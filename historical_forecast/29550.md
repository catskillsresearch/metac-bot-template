(a) **Time until outcome is determined:**  
The question resolves on January 1st, 2025. As of November 4, 2024, there are just under two months remaining.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changes:**  
To date, there are no credible media reports of at least 50 civilians being killed by autonomous drones (slaughterbots) outside of military conflict. All verifiable cases of autonomous lethal drones — such as the Kargu-2 incident in Libya — occurred within military contexts and do not meet the criteria specified by the question[1][2][5].

(c) **Scenario for a No outcome:**  
No public, credible media reports emerge before January 1, 2025, documenting at least 50 civilian deaths caused by autonomous drones acting without full human control, outside of military conflict. This matches the current state of reporting and deployment, where incidents involving these systems are confined to war zones or sanctioned operations[1][2].

(d) **Scenario for a Yes outcome:**  
Within the next two months, a credible media outlet reports cumulative civilian casualties outside a military conflict (e.g., via terrorist or criminal use of autonomous drones or robots) reaching at least 50, with clear evidence that the devices operated autonomously (not under complete human control) during the attacks. Such an event would represent a dramatic escalation and would almost certainly attract international attention and coverage due to its technical, ethical, and security implications.

## Rationale

- **Technological Feasibility:** Autonomous lethal drones capable of identifying and attacking targets without human intervention do exist and have been used in military conflicts (notably Libya, 2020)[1][5].  
- **Proliferation and Regulation:** The technology has proliferated, and there are few effective international constraints. However, most development and documented deployments remain within military, not civilian or criminal, domains[1][2][5].
- **Reporting and Verification:** No credible media coverage has reported a cumulative death toll of 50 civilians caused by slaughterbots acting outside of military conflict as of November 2024. For the question to resolve positively, such an attack would have to occur and be credibly documented, a scenario that would likely prompt global headlines given current regulatory, technological, and ethical debates[2][5].
- **Pace of Change:** Although the risk is rising due to rapid technological advancement and the regulatory gap, history suggests breakthroughs in deliberate mass use outside of conflict occur slowly and would be difficult to conceal at the scale required by the question.

Given these points, the most likely outcome is that no such mass-casualty event is credibly reported before the cutoff date.

**Probability: 2%**
