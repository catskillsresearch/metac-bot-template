I'll analyze the likelihood of Alabama having 1.5 million or more residents living in drought conditions by March 28, 2025.

(a) Time until outcome is known: 1 month and 22 days (from May 6, 2025 to March 28, 2025 - this is looking backward since the date has passed)

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: Based on the search results, the drought conditions had significantly improved across much of Alabama by February 2025, especially in northern Alabama, with only limited areas still experiencing drought. The current status appears to be below the 1.5 million resident threshold.

(c) Scenario for No outcome: Continued improvement in drought conditions throughout March 2025 due to normal or above-normal precipitation patterns. The areas that were showing improvement in February continue to recover, and even southern regions of Alabama see reduced drought severity, keeping the affected population well below 1.5 million.

(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: A reversal of the improving trend with a return to warm, dry conditions as predicted by the Climate Prediction Center for the southern and eastern U.S. through March 2025. This could expand drought conditions in southern Alabama and reintroduce drought to recently recovered areas, pushing the affected population above 1.5 million.

Looking at the available evidence, I see strong indications that drought conditions were significantly improving across Alabama by February 2025. The search results specifically mention that "a lot of the region improved its drought status" due to a strong weather system that brought rain to northern Alabama[4]. This improvement appears to have continued a trend that began in December 2024 when much-needed rain started to diminish drought conditions.

The Climate Prediction Center did forecast a warm, dry pattern for the southern and eastern U.S. through March 2025, similar to a traditional La Ni√±a pattern[5]. This could potentially slow or reverse some of the improvement in drought conditions. However, given the substantial progress already made by February, a complete reversal severe enough to place 1.5 million residents in drought areas within just one month seems unlikely.

The drought conditions in Alabama had significantly improved by February 2025 according to the latest Drought Monitor map at that time[4]. Northern and central Alabama, which contain the majority of the state's population centers (including Birmingham, Huntsville, and Montgomery), saw particular improvement. With these more populous regions showing drought relief, it would be difficult for 1.5 million residents to be affected unless drought conditions rapidly expanded back into these areas.

Additionally, the search results indicate that rainfall patterns in late February were expected to be "relatively light," suggesting neither dramatic improvement nor worsening of conditions in the immediate term[4]. While this forecast only extended a week or so into the future, it doesn't suggest an imminent dramatic shift toward worsening drought.

Taking into account the status quo of improving conditions, the historical trend of diminishing drought since December 2024, and weighing this against the potential for drier conditions predicted through March 2025, I believe the "No" outcome is more likely. While there's uncertainty in weather patterns, the magnitude of reversal needed to place 1.5 million residents in drought areas by March 28 would be substantial given the improvements already observed.

Probability: 25%
