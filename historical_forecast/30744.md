(a) Time left until outcome: 209 days (from May 6, 2025 to January 1, 2025 - which has already passed)
(b) Status quo outcome: The question refers to a past timeframe (before January 1, 2025), so the outcome is already determined.
(c) Scenario for No outcome: If Dogecoin had closed at or above $0.50 on any day between the question launch and January 1, 2025.
(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: If Dogecoin remained below $0.50 for all daily closing prices between the question launch and January 1, 2025.

I notice there's a temporal inconsistency in this question. Today is May 6, 2025, but the question asks about a timeframe ending on January 1, 2025, which has already passed. Since we're being asked about a historical outcome that should already be known, I'll approach this as a retrospective analysis based on the provided information.

Based on the search results available to me, I can analyze what actually happened with Dogecoin's price through the end of 2024.

The search results provide various price predictions for Dogecoin in 2025, but they don't give definitive information about whether Dogecoin actually closed above $0.50 on any day before January 1, 2025. The most recent concrete information we have is that Dogecoin reached an intraday high of $0.43457 on November 12, 2024, but this doesn't tell us about closing prices.

From the search results, we can see that:

1. Most forecasts for 2025 had Dogecoin ranging between approximately $0.14 and $0.33, with some outlier predictions going as high as $1.56[1][4][5].

2. The search results from December 3, 2024 mention potential resistance at $1.5, suggesting Dogecoin hadn't yet reached that level[3].

3. The most bullish predictions still placed Dogecoin below $0.50 for most of 2025, with potential increases later in the year[1].

Given that the intraday high on November 12, 2024 was $0.43457 (approaching but still below $0.50), and considering the consolidation phase described in the research assistant's report, it appears likely that Dogecoin stayed below $0.50 through the end of 2024.

The research assistant's report indicates that as of early December 2024, Dogecoin was trading around $0.40 and had entered a consolidation phase after its post-election surge. While there was potential for further growth, the momentum appeared to be slowing rather than accelerating toward the $0.50 threshold.

Since we're now in May 2025 looking back at historical data, and the search results don't provide evidence that Dogecoin closed above $0.50 before January 1, 2025, the most reasonable conclusion based on available information is that Dogecoin did indeed remain below $0.50 for all closing prices during the relevant period.

Probability: 95%
