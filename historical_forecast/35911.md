(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known: 
About 10 months from the current date (May 6, 2025) until the resolution date (March 31, 2025). Actually, since today is May 6, 2025, and the resolution date is March 31, 2025, this question's outcome is already determined, as March 31 has passed.

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed:
The status quo outcome would be "Yes" - the EB-5 program page would remain online. Based on the search results, the program is active with 547 approved regional centers as of February 12, 2025, and recent visa bulletins from March and April 2025 continue to reference the program.

(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome:
The Trump administration could have implemented the policy change mentioned in the background (replacing EB-5 with a $5 million "Gold Card") before March 31, 2025, resulting in the removal of the EB-5 program page.

(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome:
The EB-5 program continued to operate normally through March 31, 2025, with the website maintained and updated by USCIS as it had been in February and March 2025, with no major policy changes implemented by that date.

Since today is May 6, 2025, and the resolution date was March 31, 2025, I need to determine if the EB-5 program page was still online as of that date based on the available evidence.

The evidence strongly suggests that the EB-5 program and its webpage were still active through March 31, 2025:

1. The EB-5 program was authorized through September 30, 2027, as stated in the USCIS announcement from March 15, 2022[1]. This authorization provides a legal basis for the program to continue operating.

2. As of February 12, 2025, there were 547 approved regional centers for the EB-5 program[1]. This indicates active administration of the program shortly before the resolution date.

3. The March 2025 Visa Bulletin, published in February 2025, shows that all Reserved EB-5 categories remained "current," with specific cut-off dates maintained for Unreserved EB-5 applicants from China and India[5]. This demonstrates ongoing visa processing for the program.

4. The April 2025 Visa Bulletin, published in March 2025 (just before the resolution date), specifically mentions a "Retrogression of Employment-Based Fifth Preference (EB-5) Unreserved Final Action Dates for China and India"[3]. This indicates that the program was still being actively managed right up to the resolution date.

5. USCIS published information about employment-based adjustment of status for FY 2025 (which runs through September 30, 2025), specifically mentioning that they are "dedicated to using as many available employment-based visas as possible in FY 2025"[4]. This indicates an intention to continue processing EB-5 visas through at least September 2025.

There is no evidence in the search results suggesting that the EB-5 program was discontinued or that its webpage was taken down before March 31, 2025. In fact, all the evidence points to continued operation and maintenance of the program through at least April 2025.

While the background information mentions a potential Trump policy to replace the EB-5 program with a "Gold Card," there is no indication in the search results that this policy was implemented before March 31, 2025. The most recent updates from March 2025 show the program was still operating normally.

Given that the current date (May 6, 2025) is after the resolution date, and all evidence indicates the program was still active in March and April 2025, I can conclude with high confidence that the EB-5 program page was still online on March 31, 2025.

Probability: 99%
