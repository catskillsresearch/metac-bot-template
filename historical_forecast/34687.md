(a) **Time left until outcome is known**:
The Super Bowl is scheduled for February 9, 2025, so as of today (February 7, 2025), there are two days left until the event and definitive attendance will be known.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed**:
As of now, public reports have confirmed that Jill Biden will attend the Super Bowl with her grandson, and President Donald Trump will attend as well[1][2][3]. Importantly, the latest reporting explicitly states that former President Joe Biden will not be in attendance at the game[1], and there is no information indicating that Vice President Kamala Harris will be there. Therefore, the current status quo outcome is **No**.

(c) **Brief scenario for a No outcome**:
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris do not appear at the event and are not present on the stadium grounds during Super Bowl LIX, as supported by public reports—consistent with current reporting that neither plans to attend[1].

(d) **Brief scenario for a Yes outcome**:
Joe Biden and/or Kamala Harris unexpectedly decide to attend the Super Bowl, and their presence is confirmed by public reports documenting that they were anywhere within the stadium grounds during the game.

---

Given the strong tendency for high-profile attendance plans (especially for current or former presidents and vice presidents) to be publicly announced in advance, and with explicit media reports confirming Biden’s absence and no mention of Harris’s attendance, the probability of a last-minute appearance is low. Good forecasters give substantial weight to the status quo, particularly so close to the event.

Probability: 3%
