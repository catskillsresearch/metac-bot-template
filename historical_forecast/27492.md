(a) **Time until outcome is known:**  
The August 2024 core CPI data will be released by the BLS on September 11, 2024[2], so the result will be known in less than three weeks from the current date (August 22, 2024).

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
The most recent month-over-month core CPI increase (for July 2024) was 0.2%[4]. Recent professional forecasts, including the Philadelphia Fed's Survey of Professional Forecasters, indicate a projected continued moderation in core inflation, with quarter-over-quarter annualized rates moving downward[1]. The status quo scenario is therefore a continued moderate core CPI increaseâ€”most likely in the 0.2% or 0.3% range, below the 0.4% threshold in question.

(c) **Scenario for a No outcome (core CPI < 0.4% MoM):**  
- Shelter inflation remains elevated but does not accelerate.
- Other major core components, such as services inflation, do not see a significant spike.
- No unexpected shocks drive up core inflation.
- The Fed's measured stance on rates, combined with recent moderation in economic activity, continues to cool core price pressures.
- The core CPI figure for August 2024 is reported as 0.2% or 0.3%[1][4].

(d) **Scenario for a Yes outcome (core CPI = 0.4% MoM):**  
- Shelter costs accelerate even further from already-elevated levels.
- Broad-based increases occur across multiple core categories, such as medical care, motor vehicle insurance, or other services.
- A surprise, such as a supply chain disruption or surge in a major services category, temporarily boosts monthly core inflation.
- The BLS reports a rounded core CPI month-over-month increase of 0.4% for August 2024.

## Rationale

Professional forecasts for Q3 2024 core CPI (annualized) are 2.6%[1]. Translating this to monthly sequential gains, the implied monthly average is approximately \( \frac{2.6\%}{12} \approx 0.22\% \), or about 0.2% per month. This matches the most recent monthly reading for July 2024 (0.2%)[4].  
A jump to 0.4% in August would be a notable acceleration, especially as major components like shelter, while persistent, have not been accelerating at that pace in recent months[4]. While shelter rose 0.4% MoM in July, this did not translate to an outsized increase in core CPI overall, suggesting offsetting moderation in other components.

Recent trends and consensus forecasts both favor ongoing moderation in inflation, absent a clear catalyst for a marked re-acceleration[1][4]. The base case, when forecasting short-term inflation, heavily weights inertia and ongoing trends, barring new shocks.

## Final Answer

Probability: 15%  
(A 0.4% core CPI MoM print for August 2024 is possible but unlikely given moderating inflation, recent trends, and professional consensus forecasts favoring lower monthly increases[1][4].)
