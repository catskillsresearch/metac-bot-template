(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
The 2024 MTV Video Music Awards will air on September 10, 2024. Today is September 5, 2024, so the outcome will be known in 5 days.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
Currently, Taylor Swift has 10 nominations—the most of any artist in 2024. As of now, no winners have been announced[1][2]. If nothing changed and the voting trend followed her historical performance and fan engagement, she would be expected to win multiple awards, but the exact number is uncertain.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
Taylor Swift wins 4 or fewer awards, either because strong competition prevails in several key categories, voter turnout for other artists is higher than expected, or she is edged out in technical or collaboration categories, leading to fewer than 5 wins.

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
Taylor Swift wins at least 5 awards, driven by her dominance in major categories (Video of the Year, Song of the Year, Artist of the Year, etc.) and possibly technical categories, benefiting from both her high nomination count and the mobilization of her engaged fan base within the fan-voted system[1][2].

## Rationale

Taylor Swift's position as the leading nominee with 10 nods—including every major category and multiple technical categories—places her in a historically strong spot. She has significant prior success at the VMAs, including consecutive wins for Video of the Year in 2022 and 2023, and her fanbase is well-known for mobilizing in fan-voted awards, a relevant factor since most VMA categories are decided by public vote[1][2]. 

However, high nomination counts do not automatically guarantee a high number of wins. The competition—artists like Post Malone, Ariana Grande, Eminem, and SZA—also possess strong fanbases and critical acclaim, potentially dividing votes in major and secondary categories. Additionally, technical categories can be less predictable, sometimes favoring works with standout creative or visual elements outside of Swift's entries.

Historically, sweeping five or more awards at the VMAs is rare, even for artists with many nominations and popular momentum. Still, the combination of Swift’s ten nominations, leading position, prior VMA success, and fan engagement makes a strong case for multiple wins.

Weighing the status quo (past precedent, current industry buzz, voting mechanisms) and the possibility of upsets in competitive categories, the probability that Taylor Swift wins 5 or more awards is **not a lock, but notably higher than 50%**.

**Probability: 65%**
