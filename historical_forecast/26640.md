(a) Time left: The outcome will be known by October 1, 2024, which is approximately 2 months and 25 days from today (July 26, 2024).

(b) Status quo outcome: A debate was scheduled for September 10, 2024, between Trump and Biden on ABC News, but Biden has withdrawn from the race, putting this debate in jeopardy.

(c) No outcome scenario: The Democratic Party takes time to formally nominate their candidate, leaving insufficient time to negotiate new debate terms with the Trump campaign. Trump maintains his position that he will only debate on Fox News, while the Democratic nominee insists on the previously agreed ABC News venue, resulting in a stalemate that prevents any debate before October 1.

(d) Yes outcome scenario: The Democratic Party quickly nominates their candidate, who immediately agrees to debate Trump. Despite initial posturing about changing networks, both campaigns reach a compromise on venue and format, preserving the September 10 debate date or scheduling a new date before October 1.

Given the available information, I need to assess the probability of Donald Trump debating the Democratic nominee before October 1, 2024.

The first presidential debate between Biden and Trump already took place on June 27, 2024[2][4]. A second debate was scheduled for September 10, 2024, to be hosted by ABC News[2][4]. However, Biden's withdrawal from the race on July 21, 2024, has created significant uncertainty around this debate.

Several key factors influence my assessment:

## Timeline Considerations

With Biden's withdrawal occurring on July 21, the Democratic Party has just over a month and a half to:
- Formally nominate a new candidate
- Establish that candidate's debate team
- Negotiate with the Trump campaign on debate parameters
- Prepare their candidate for the debate

This compressed timeline creates logistical challenges, but not insurmountable ones. The originally scheduled September 10 debate still falls within the timeframe for this question's resolution.

## Trump's Position

Trump has expressed a preference for changing the debate venue from ABC to Fox News, calling ABC "very biased." This position could create a negotiation obstacle. However, historical precedent suggests that candidates often make such statements as opening positions in negotiations rather than absolute requirements.

## Status Quo Momentum

The debate infrastructure for September 10 is likely already being prepared by ABC News. Changing venues, dates, and formats requires additional coordination and planning, which becomes more difficult as the date approaches. This creates some momentum toward maintaining the scheduled debate, albeit with a different Democratic candidate.

## Historical Precedent

Presidential debates have been a fixture in American elections since 1960, and candidates face significant political pressure to participate. Refusing to debate can be portrayed as weakness or evasion, creating incentives for both candidates to find a way to make the debate happen.

## Risk Factors

Several factors could prevent a debate from occurring:
- Extended Democratic nomination process consuming valuable preparation time
- Irreconcilable disagreements between campaigns on debate format, rules, or venue
- Strategic calculations by either campaign that a debate is not in their interest
- Scheduling conflicts with other campaign activities or events

## Weighing the Evidence

The status quo had a debate scheduled during the relevant period, which creates some momentum toward a debate occurring. However, Biden's withdrawal has fundamentally altered the dynamics. Trump's comments about changing networks suggest he remains open to debating, just under different terms.

The most significant consideration is the compressed timeline and the need for new negotiations. While these create obstacles, they don't make a debate impossible. Both campaigns would likely recognize the political value of debating, especially given the volatility of the race after Biden's withdrawal.

Giving appropriate weight to the status quo advantage (a debate was already scheduled) while accounting for the significant disruption of Biden's withdrawal and the need for new negotiations, I assess that a debate is still more likely than not to occur before October 1, but with substantial uncertainty.

Probability: 65%
