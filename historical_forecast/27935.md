(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  
The official youth unemployment rate for August 2024 will likely be published by the National Bureau of Statistics of China (NBS) and Trading Economics by mid to late September 2024. As of September 6, 2024, this leaves a few days to about two weeks until the outcome is publicly known.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
China’s youth unemployment rate was reported at 17.1% in July 2024, already the highest since the new methodology was implemented in December 2023[1][4]. Historically, the unemployment rate tends to peak in July and August due to new graduates entering the workforce, suggesting upward pressure for August[1]. Therefore, the most likely status quo outcome is a continued, moderate increase from July’s figure, possibly reaching or slightly exceeding 18.0%.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome (rate ≤ 18.0):**  
If the influx of graduates slows, job creation marginally improves, or if some young people withdraw from the job market (e.g., due to discouragement, “lying flat”), the youth unemployment rate could rise only slightly or plateau. This would result in a rate at or below 18.0%. Minor improvements in private sector hiring or temporary government programs could also keep the figure below the threshold[1].

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome (rate > 18.0):**  
If the seasonal effect of new graduates entering the labor market is particularly strong this August, combined with continued weak job creation in major sectors, the unemployment rate could rise by a full percentage point or more. The persistence of structural labor market mismatches and lack of targeted intervention would also contribute to the rate surpassing 18.0%[1][4]. Any negative economic shocks or further slowdowns in consumption and business activity would further worsen the situation.

## Rationale

Recent data shows a clear upward trajectory in China’s youth unemployment rate, which reached 17.1% in July 2024—already surpassing prior months and reflecting significant economic and structural headwinds[1][4]. Seasonal patterns suggest August often records the annual peak, driven by millions of graduates flooding the labor market[1]. There are no signs of new, large-scale policy interventions aimed specifically at youth employment for August, nor evidence of an economic turnaround that would rapidly create new jobs[1].

Given this context, the path of least resistance is a continued (but not explosive) rise in youth unemployment for August 2024. The increase from June to July was notable; a similar (or even slightly smaller) jump would push the figure above 18.0%. The main risk to this forecast is that more young people might opt out of the workforce, temporarily suppressing the measured rate, or that local governments roll out minor hiring initiatives that limit the rise[1]. However, absent major new developments, inertia and historical patterns suggest a rate **at or just above 18.0% is most probable**.
