(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  
About 3 weeks remain until February 28, 2025.

(b) **Outcome if nothing changed:**  
If the Warren Buffett Indicator remains unchanged from its most recent reported value (202% as of early February 2025[4]), the outcome would be **202**.

(c) **Outcome if the current trend continued:**  
The Buffett Indicator has hovered between 200% and 211% in recent months, with no sharp moves despite some economic headlines[2][3][4]. If this moderate, flat-to-slightly-rising trend continues, the indicator would likely remain near **200%–210%** by late February 2025.

(d) **Expectations of experts and markets:**  
Markets and analysts widely consider US equities richly valued, with the Buffett Indicator at historic highs[3][4]. While some expect a correction, there is no consensus on a dramatic near-term shift. Most experts expect the ratio to stay elevated absent a major negative market shock.

(e) **Unexpected scenario resulting in a low outcome:**  
A sudden and acute stock market correction (e.g., due to a geopolitical event, surprise economic downturn, or financial crisis) could rapidly reduce US market capitalization, driving the ratio down toward **170–180%** or even lower if the downturn is severe.

(f) **Unexpected scenario resulting in a high outcome:**  
A significant and rapid stock market rally—perhaps triggered by an unexpectedly dovish Federal Reserve move or breakthrough economic data—could push the Wilshire 5000 up further, driving the ratio to new highs above **215–220%**.
