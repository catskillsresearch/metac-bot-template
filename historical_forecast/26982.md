(a) Time left until outcome: The outcome will be known after September 15, 2024, which is about 40 days from today (August 8, 2024).

(b) Status quo outcome: Based on recent patterns, China has been regularly sending more than 20 aircraft into Taiwan's ADIZ in single days, with June 2024 seeing 305 violations in 27 days (averaging over 11 per day)[3], and reports of 56 aircraft violations in a single day in July 2024.

(c) Scenario for No outcome: Tensions between China and Taiwan decrease due to successful diplomatic efforts or China shifting focus to internal matters. The PRC could also temporarily reduce military activity near Taiwan to avoid international criticism during a sensitive period or to conserve resources for later operations.

(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: China continues its pressure campaign against Taiwan's President Lai Ching-te, whom they consider a "dangerous separatist," by maintaining or escalating ADIZ violations[3]. A specific trigger such as a high-profile U.S. visit to Taiwan, new defensive aid announcements, or provocative statements could prompt a large-scale incursion exceeding 20 aircraft in a single day.

Looking at the historical data and recent trends, I see strong evidence supporting a "Yes" outcome for this question. Since President Lai Ching-te's inauguration on May 20, 2024, China has significantly intensified its military pressure on Taiwan. The data shows:

1. **Escalating pattern in 2024**: Taiwan reported 289 ADIZ violations in May and 305 in June (through June 27)[3]. June 2024 represents the second-highest monthly total on record without a large-scale PLA exercise.

2. **Recent large-scale daily incursions**: According to your research assistant's report, China sent 56 aircraft in a single day on July 10, 2024, tying the highest daily total on record. In just a two-day period (June 20-21), China reportedly sent 66 aircraft.

3. **Strategic timing**: The August-September period has historical significance for increased military activity. The all-time record for monthly violations (446) occurred in August 2022 during Nancy Pelosi's visit[3].

4. **Ongoing pressure campaign**: The PRC has explicitly framed their increased military activity as a response to President Lai's administration, which they consider hostile separatists[3]. This pressure campaign shows no signs of abating.

5. **Resource considerations**: While Taiwan doesn't scramble aircraft for every ADIZ violation, the violations are designed to drain Taiwan's resources and exhaust its military personnel[3], suggesting China has strategic reasons to maintain these pressure tactics.

The trend line is clear: China has been gradually increasing the frequency and scale of ADIZ violations over the years, from a monthly average of 81 in 2021 to 178 in subsequent periods[2]. In April 2024 alone, Taiwan tracked Chinese military aircraft on 193 occasions[5].

While we should consider that the status quo could shift, the evidence strongly suggests that the current status quo already includes regular large-scale incursions exceeding 20 aircraft. The pattern of escalation following President Lai's inauguration has been sustained for over two months now, indicating this is not a temporary spike but rather a deliberate, ongoing pressure campaign.

Given these factors, I assess there is a very high probability that at least one day between August 15 and September 15, 2024, will see more than 20 Chinese aircraft violate Taiwan's ADIZ.

Probability: 85%
