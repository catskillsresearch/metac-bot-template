As a professional forecaster, I'll analyze this question carefully.

(a) Time left until outcome: The outcome will be known by April 1, 2025, which is about 1 month from the current date (May 6, 2025). However, the outcome has already been determined since we're past the resolution date.

(b) Status quo outcome: Based on the search results, Gilmour Space Technologies was targeting a mid-March 2025 launch date for their Eris rocket.

(c) No outcome scenario: Gilmour Space Technologies could have faced technical difficulties, weather constraints, or new regulatory hurdles that pushed their launch date beyond April 1, 2025.

(d) Yes outcome scenario: Gilmour Space Technologies successfully completed their pre-launch preparations and executed their planned mid-March launch without major delays.

## Analysis of Available Evidence

Looking at the search results, there are several key pieces of information that inform my forecast:

As of February 24, 2025, Gilmour Space announced a mid-March target for their first Eris launch[3]. This announcement came approximately one month before our target date of April 1, 2025, giving them a reasonable window to execute the launch.

The company had already secured their launch permit as of December 2024, with the Australian Space Agency granting "the country's first orbital launch permit to Gilmour Space Technologies for its maiden Eris rocket launch from the Bowen Orbital Spaceport in north Queensland"[5]. This removes what had been a significant regulatory hurdle.

Prior to this announcement, in September 2024, the company had "successfully completed a major wet dress rehearsal of its Eris launch vehicle, progressing the countdown to T-10 seconds"[5], indicating substantial technical readiness.

The company's website as of May 2025 indicates they are "tracking to launch our Eris orbital launch vehicles and ElaraSat bus/platforms to Low Earth Orbits (LEO) from 2025"[1], suggesting the launch may have already occurred or is still planned for 2025.

## Considering Potential Delays

While the company appeared well-positioned for a March 2025 launch, rocket launches are notoriously prone to delays. According to RocketLaunch.Live, as of April 24, 2024, the "launch date is currently targeted for Q2 2025"[4], which would be April-June 2025. This conflicts somewhat with Gilmour's own February 2025 announcement of a mid-March target.

Given that the original launch timeline had already been pushed back multiple times (initially they were targeting late January 2025[5]), there's historical precedent for delays.

## Status Quo Consideration

The status quo as of February 2025 was that Gilmour Space was actively preparing for a mid-March launch with all necessary permits in place. Without evidence of further delays, and considering they had overcome previous regulatory hurdles, the most likely outcome was that they would proceed with their planned launch before April 1.

However, a prudent forecaster must acknowledge the frequency of launch delays in the aerospace industry, especially for a company attempting its first orbital launch.

## Final Assessment

Based on the evidence available, Gilmour Space Technologies appeared to be on track for a launch before April 1, 2025. They had secured the necessary regulatory approvals, completed critical technical milestones, and publicly committed to a mid-March launch window. While the possibility of short-term delays existed, the preponderance of evidence suggested they would meet the April 1 deadline.

Probability: 80%
