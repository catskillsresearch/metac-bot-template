(a) Time left until outcome is known: 69 days (from May 6, 2025 to September 30, 2024)
(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: Cannabis remains a Schedule I controlled substance
(c) Scenario for No outcome: The DEA review process extends beyond September 30, 2024, due to the volume of public comments, administrative procedures, and potential opposition from stakeholders
(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: The DEA expedites the review process after the July 22, 2024 comment period closes, and finalizes the rescheduling before the September deadline, potentially motivated by political considerations in an election year

Based on the information provided, I need to assess whether cannabis will be removed from Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act before September 30, 2024. Let me analyze the current situation and timeline.

The Department of Justice published its notice of proposed rulemaking on May 21, 2024, officially proposing to transfer marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III of the Controlled Substances Act[1][2]. This initiated a 62-day public comment period that will end on July 22, 2024[2].

After the comment period closes, several critical steps remain in the process:
- The DEA must review all submitted public comments
- The agency must make a final determination
- The DEA must issue a final rule or order to reschedule cannabis[4]

The timeline for completing these remaining steps is highly uncertain. According to the search results, this process "could happen in days, weeks, months, or even years" depending on various factors[4]. There is no mandated timeline for the DEA to issue a final rule after the comment period ends.

Looking at the specific timing, the comment period ends on July 22, 2024, leaving approximately 70 days until the September 30 deadline. This is a relatively tight window for the DEA to:
1. Review what could be thousands of public comments
2. Make potentially significant revisions to the proposed rule
3. Complete all administrative requirements
4. Issue a final rule

While there may be political motivation to expedite this process given the 2024 election year context[4], regulatory processes typically move slowly. The search results indicate that "the politics involved in rescheduling indicate that a decision will likely be made in the next few months, not years"[4], but even "months" could extend beyond the September deadline.

Additionally, the rescheduling represents a significant policy shift that could face potential legal challenges or opposition from various stakeholders, potentially extending the timeline.

Giving extra weight to the status quo, as administrative processes typically move slowly and regulatory changes of this magnitude often face delays, I believe it's more likely than not that the final rescheduling will not be completed before September 30, 2024. While the process is clearly in motion, the remaining steps after the comment period closes would need to proceed with unusual speed to meet the September deadline.

Probability: 35%
