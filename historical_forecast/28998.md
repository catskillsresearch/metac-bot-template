(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known: 
Approximately 7 months (from May 6, 2025 to January 1, 2025)

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed:
No nuclear weapon detonation as an act of war, as none have occurred since 1945.

(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome:
Despite heightened tensions and nuclear threats, particularly from Russia regarding Ukraine, all nuclear-armed states continue to exercise restraint. Deterrence holds, and diplomatic channels remain functional enough to prevent escalation to nuclear use.

(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome:
Escalation in the Russia-Ukraine conflict leads to Russia using a tactical nuclear weapon against Ukrainian military targets. Alternatively, North Korea, feeling threatened or seeking leverage, conducts a limited nuclear strike against a military target.

As a professional forecaster, I need to carefully assess the likelihood of nuclear weapon use by January 1, 2025, based on current evidence and historical patterns.

Nuclear weapons have not been used in warfare since 1945, despite numerous conflicts and tensions over the past 78 years. This long-standing norm against nuclear use represents a powerful status quo that should be weighted heavily in any forecast.

Recent data indicates heightened risk factors. According to a February 2024 survey, 29% of U.S. adults thought it was "very likely" their country would get into a nuclear war, with an additional 38% considering it "fairly likely"[1]. However, public perception often doesn't align with expert assessment, and these numbers reflect general concern rather than imminent threat.

The current geopolitical landscape does present several concerning scenarios. The ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict involves a nuclear-armed state, with Russia having made nuclear threats. As of early 2024, Russia rejected U.S. offers to re-open nuclear arms control dialogue, citing U.S. support for Ukraine[2]. This deterioration in diplomatic relations increases risk, but Russia has thus far shown restraint in crossing the nuclear threshold despite battlefield setbacks.

China's growing nuclear arsenal and tensions over Taiwan represent another risk vector. The U.S. intelligence community notes that China's nuclear modernization has increased as Beijing seeks to bolster its nuclear deterrent[3]. A high-ranking U.S. Air Mobility Command general even predicted a potential conflict with China by 2025[4]. However, such predictions often reflect worst-case scenario planning rather than most likely outcomes.

North Korea remains a nuclear concern, with U.S. intelligence reporting that it has been prepared to resume nuclear tests since mid-2022[3]. Yet the Kim regime has historically used its nuclear program as a bargaining chip rather than showing actual intent to initiate nuclear conflict.

Iran's nuclear program continues to advance, but according to U.S. intelligence assessments as of early 2024, Iran is "not currently undertaking the key nuclear weapons-development activities necessary to produce a testable nuclear device"[3]. While the situation could evolve, the timeframe until January 2025 limits the likelihood of Iran developing and using a nuclear weapon.

The New START treaty between the U.S. and Russia remains in force, with both countries pledging to stay within its limits (1,550 deployed strategic nuclear warheads)[2]. While there are concerns about what happens after the treaty expires, this mutual constraint provides some guardrails in the near term.

Historical precedent strongly suggests nuclear restraint will continue to prevail. Despite numerous crises during the Cold War that brought the world to the brink of nuclear conflict, the nuclear taboo has held. Decision-makers understand the catastrophic consequences of nuclear use, including potential for escalation to strategic exchanges.

However, I must acknowledge increased risks compared to recent decades. The combination of multiple simultaneous international tensions, deterioration of arms control frameworks, and modernization of nuclear arsenals creates a more dangerous environment. Project 2025 has been criticized for potentially "increasing the risk of nuclear war" at a time when the doomsday clock is already set closer to midnight than ever before[5].

Weighing these factors, while giving appropriate weight to the strong historical precedent against nuclear use, I assess that the probability of a nuclear weapon being detonated as an act of war before January 1, 2025 is low but not negligible.

Probability: 8%
