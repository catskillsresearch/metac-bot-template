(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) is scheduled to release the August 2024 CPI report, containing the core CPI figure, on September 11, 2024—about three weeks from now[2].

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
The most recent trend shows core CPI rising by 0.2% month-over-month in July 2024, after a 0.1% increase in June[4]. The general direction, according to professional forecasts and recent data, is for core CPI to remain moderate and possibly continue the 0.2% pace, as disinflation continues to take hold. Therefore, if nothing changes, the expected outcome is another 0.2% print.

(c) **Scenario for a No outcome (not 0.3%):**  
A No occurs if core CPI for August is reported at any value except 0.3%. The most likely No scenario is that core CPI holds steady at 0.2%, mirroring July and in line with the latest professional forecasts and broader disinflation trend. Another less likely No scenario is a reading below 0.2% (suggesting an unexpected drop in shelter or services inflation) or above 0.3% (a significant acceleration, which appears unlikely given recent moderation)[1][4].

(d) **Scenario for a Yes outcome (exactly 0.3%):**  
A Yes requires core CPI (excluding food and energy) to accelerate to a 0.3% month-over-month gain in August, up from 0.2% in July. For this to happen, shelter prices (which rose 0.4% in July) or other key service categories would need to show a further pickup, counteracting the broader downward trend in inflation. This would suggest a modest but notable reacceleration of underlying price pressures[4].

## Rationale

Recent data and forecasts provide evidence for continued moderation in core inflation:

- **Recent prints:** June: +0.1%, July: +0.2%[4]
- **Philadelphia Fed Survey (Q3 2024 projections):** Core CPI is on track for an annualized 2.6% in Q3, recently revised downward from 3.0%[1]. This translates to roughly 0.21% per month (2.6% annualized divided by 12, ignoring compounding for simplicity).
- **Drivers:** Shelter and some services (e.g., motor vehicle insurance) have been inflationary, but headline and core measures are moving toward the Fed’s 2% target[4].

The status quo, given recent 0.2% figures, is for the next month to also be 0.2% unless there is a new source of upward pressure. Most professional forecasters see little reason for a sharp reacceleration at present, though persistent shelter inflation is a potential risk[1][4].

A 0.3% reading would require a material, broad-based increase in underlying service prices, or a jump in shelter costs that outpaces recent months. This is plausible but less likely given the prevailing disinflationary pressures and recent downward forecast revisions.
