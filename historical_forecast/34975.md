(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  
Today is May 6, 2025. The resolution date for the question was April 1, 2025. Thus, the outcome is already known; all relevant information is available.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
As of the most recent reporting before April 1, 2025, the United States did impose new tariffs on imports from Canada. These tariffs were officially announced and implemented by executive order on February 1, 2025, and took effect on February 4, 2025[1][5].

(c) **Scenario that results in a No outcome:**  
A "No" outcome would have occurred if the US announced new tariffs but either suspended their implementation, revoked them before the effective date, or failed to actually implement them by April 1, 2025. Evidence indicates no such suspension or revocation occurred[5].

(d) **Scenario that results in a Yes outcome:**  
A "Yes" outcome occurred if the US government officially announced and implemented any new tariffs on imports from Canada after the question's launch and before April 1, 2025. This scenario occurred: President Trump issued executive orders on February 1, 2025, imposing 25% tariffs on most Canadian imports, effective February 4, 2025, with Canadian energy resources subject to a 10% tariff[1][5]. The action was confirmed by the White House and legal advisories, and Canada retaliated with its own tariffs, further confirming US implementation[2][3][4].

## Rationale

The available evidence establishes that:

- President Trump signed executive orders imposing new tariffs on imports from Canada on February 1, 2025, as confirmed by the White House and detailed legal analyses[1][5].
- These tariffs went into effect on February 4, 2025[5].
- Canada responded with retaliatory tariffs, confirming US implementation[2][3][4].
- No evidence suggests the tariffs were suspended, revoked, or merely threatened without implementation before April 1, 2025.

Given this timeline, the resolution criteria—a new, officially implemented tariff on Canadian imports before April 1, 2025—are clearly satisfied.

**Probability: 100%**
