As a professional forecaster assessing this question, I'll provide a structured analysis of the situation.

(a) Time left until outcome is known: 47 days (from August 14, 2024 to October 1, 2024)

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: No capture of Rylsk by Ukrainian forces

(c) No outcome scenario: Ukrainian forces halt their advance short of Rylsk due to Russian reinforcements arriving from other fronts, logistical challenges limiting further advance, or a strategic decision to consolidate current gains rather than push further into Russian territory.

(d) Yes outcome scenario: Ukrainian forces continue their rapid eastward advance through Kursk Oblast, reach Rylsk within weeks, and capture the administrative center as part of their strategic operation to disrupt Russian forces and potentially establish a buffer zone inside Russian territory.

## Current Situation in Kursk Oblast

As of August 9, 2024, Ukrainian forces have launched a significant cross-border operation into Russia's Kursk Oblast. According to Russian sources, Ukrainian forces have continued to advance eastward in Kursk Oblast, though they are likely no longer operating as far north or west as previously claimed on August 8[2][5]. This suggests a more focused advance in a specific direction rather than a broad territorial push.

Ukrainian forces have reportedly struck a Russian military convoy east of Rylsk near Oktyabrskoye, Kursk Oblast[2][5]. This indicates that Ukrainian forces are operating in the vicinity of Rylsk and targeting Russian military movements in the area, suggesting Rylsk may be within the operational scope of Ukrainian forces.

## Russian Response and Defensive Capabilities

The Russian military command appears to be relying primarily on existing units deployed along the international border and readily available forces in the rear to address the Ukrainian incursion[2]. Notably, these units are largely staffed with conscripts and irregular forces rather than experienced combat units[5]. This suggests potential vulnerabilities in Russia's immediate defensive capabilities in the region.

There are indications that the Russian military command may be resisting the redeployment of forces from other operational directions to the Kursk area, potentially to avoid disrupting Russian offensive operations in eastern Ukraine[5]. This strategic decision could limit Russia's ability to quickly reinforce the Kursk region with more experienced troops.

However, there are also reports that the Russian military command may be transferring more experienced and better-provisioned frontline units from eastern or southern Ukraine to Kursk Oblast, though "it would likely take additional time for such units to arrive"[2]. One Russian military blogger claimed that elements of the Russian Northern Grouping of Force's 44th Army Corps are operating near Rylsk, which might indicate some reinforcements are being directed to defend the town[2].

## Ukrainian Strategic Objectives

Ukraine's surprise offensive in Russia's Kursk region has been described as "a daring gambit likely intended to divert Russian forces and snatch back the war's momentum"[1]. The operation appears designed to force Russia to redirect resources away from their offensive operations in eastern Ukraine.

Reports suggest that Ukrainian forces may be specifically moving towards Rylsk. Russian military bloggers believe that "the AFU will definitely move towards Rylsk"[3], indicating that capturing this town might be part of Ukraine's operational objectives.

There are also indications that Ukraine's operation has received tacit approval from its allies. According to Politico, Germany has stated that "Ukraine has the right to self-defence enshrined in international law. This is not limited to its own territory"[3]. This suggests potential international support for Ukraine's cross-border operations, which could sustain the offensive.

## Factors Affecting Probability of Rylsk's Capture

Several factors influence the likelihood of Ukrainian forces capturing Rylsk before October 1, 2024:

**Favorable factors for Ukrainian forces:**
- The rapid initial advance and reported control of multiple settlements demonstrate operational momentum
- Apparent weakness in immediate Russian defensive capabilities in the region
- Reports of Ukrainian forces already operating near Rylsk (striking a convoy east of the town)
- Russian reluctance to immediately redeploy significant forces from other fronts

**Challenging factors for Ukrainian forces:**
- Potential arrival of more experienced Russian units in the coming weeks
- Logistical challenges of sustaining an offensive deep in enemy territory
- Uncertainty about whether capturing Rylsk is a primary objective for Ukrainian forces
- Ukrainian forces may be consolidating gains rather than pushing further east

## Forecast Analysis

Given the current trajectory, Ukrainian forces have demonstrated the capability to advance rapidly into Russian territory and are already operating near Rylsk. The Russian defensive response appears to be initially relying on less experienced units, which may not be sufficient to halt Ukrainian advances in the short term.

However, the status quo in warfare typically favors defensive operations, especially as offensive momentum slows and supply lines extend. While Ukrainian forces have shown impressive initial gains, sustaining this advance for the approximately 47 days remaining until the October 1 deadline would be challenging without substantial reinforcement and logistical support.

The reported strikes near Rylsk suggest Ukrainian forces are at least targeting the area, but capturing and holding the administrative center would require a sustained offensive push and sufficient forces to secure the town against potential Russian counterattacks. Given the strategic importance Russia would likely place on preventing the capture of a district administrative center, we can expect increasing resistance as Ukrainian forces approach Rylsk.

Based on the available information, there is a significant but not overwhelming chance that Ukrainian forces will capture Rylsk before October 1. The initial momentum and apparent Russian defensive weaknesses increase the probability, but the challenges of sustained offensive operations and potential Russian reinforcements temper expectations.

Probability: 40%
