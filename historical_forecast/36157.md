(a) Time left until outcome is known: The NCAA Tournament (March Madness) is currently in progress, with the Sweet Sixteen round approaching within the next 1-2 weeks after today's date of March 18, 2025.

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: No Ivy League team makes it to the Sweet Sixteen, as historically, Ivy League teams rarely advance that far in the tournament.

(c) Scenario for a No outcome: Yale, as the strongest Ivy League team, receives an unfavorable seed in the tournament and faces a much higher-ranked opponent in the first or second round, resulting in elimination before reaching the Sweet Sixteen, as is typical for most Ivy League representatives.

(d) Scenario for a Yes outcome: Yale, with its strong 22-8 record and dominant conference performance (13-1), receives a favorable tournament draw and capitalizes on matchup advantages to upset higher-seeded teams in the first two rounds, similar to Princeton's unexpected 2023 tournament run.

As a professional forecaster, I need to analyze the available data to determine the likelihood of an Ivy League team reaching the Sweet Sixteen in the 2025 NCAA Tournament.

Based on the current standings, Yale has emerged as the clear leader in the Ivy League with a 13-1 conference record and 22-8 overall record[1]. They've clinched the outright regular season title[2] and are the favorite (-160) to win the Ivy League Tournament[3]. The other three teams that could potentially represent the Ivy League in the NCAA Tournament are Cornell (18-11), Princeton (19-11), and Dartmouth (14-14)[1].

The historical context is important here. Ivy League teams rarely advance to the Sweet Sixteen, with Princeton's 2023 run being a notable exception rather than the norm. This aligns with the status quo expectation that no Ivy League team will reach the Sweet Sixteen.

Looking at team strength indicators, Yale appears to be the strongest contender from the Ivy League. However, their chances of making a deep tournament run are hampered by several factors:

1. Seeding: Ivy League champions typically receive unfavorable seeds (12-15 range), requiring them to defeat multiple higher-ranked teams to reach the Sweet Sixteen.

2. Team quality metrics: While Yale has a solid overall record, they lack the high-quality wins (particularly against Quadrant 1 opponents) that would suggest they can compete with top national teams.

3. Conference strength: The Ivy League is considered one of the weaker conferences in Division I basketball, which affects both seeding and preparedness for tournament competition.

It's worth noting that Princeton was actually the preseason favorite in the Ivy League[5], receiving 15 first-place votes, while Yale was picked second and Dartmouth last[5]. The fact that Yale outperformed expectations is positive, but Princeton's underperformance relative to preseason expectations suggests the overall conference strength may be weaker than anticipated.

The tournament format itself creates additional barriers. To reach the Sweet Sixteen, the Ivy League representative would need to win two consecutive games against likely higher-seeded opponents. Based on historical patterns, the probability of this occurring is quite low.

While upsets do happen in March Madness (which is what makes the tournament exciting), they remain statistically unlikely. Yale's current profile suggests they would be a double-digit seed, making a Sweet Sixteen appearance improbable though not impossible.

As a forecaster, I must acknowledge that tournament matchups and performance variability can create opportunities for surprise outcomes. However, giving appropriate weight to the status quo and historical precedent, along with current team metrics, leads me to conclude that an Ivy League Sweet Sixteen appearance in 2025 is unlikely.

Probability: 15%
