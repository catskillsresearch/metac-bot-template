(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  
As of November 20, 2024, there are about 6 weeks left until the January 1, 2025 deadline.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
No exoplanet atmosphere with more than 5% oxygen has been detected or measured as of now[1][4][5]. The status quo outcome is "No."

(c) **Scenario for a No outcome:**  
No breakthrough in spectral analysis or instrument sensitivity is achieved before the end of 2024, and ongoing observations with JWST and other leading observatories do not confidently detect or quantify an oxygen-rich atmosphere (>5% O₂) on any exoplanet. Peer-reviewed publications and official announcements continue to report only tentative detections of trace gases or focus on other molecular species (e.g., water vapor, methane), but not a quantified, robust oxygen abundance greater than 5%[1][4][5].

(d) **Scenario for a Yes outcome:**  
A major advance occurs—potentially a JWST result or a surprise from another high-precision instrument—where observational data clearly identify and quantify an exoplanetary atmosphere with more than 5% oxygen. This would require unprecedented sensitivity, favorable viewing geometry, and/or an unusually oxygen-rich exoplanet atmosphere, with results published or credibly announced before January 1, 2025.

## Rationale

- **Technological Status:**  
Transit spectroscopy and related methods have detected the atmospheric presence of various molecules, but reliable quantification of oxygen abundance at the threshold (>5%) remains technically out of reach as of late 2024 for both large gaseous and rocky exoplanets[1][4][5].

- **Recent Announcements:**  
No major observatory or research group has reported a detection of >5% oxygen in an exoplanet atmosphere[1][4][5]. Recent advances, such as new detection methods by University of Chicago researchers and data from JWST, improve identification of the *presence* of atmospheres, but do not yet deliver precise compositional ratios for oxygen[5].

- **Historical and Institutional Momentum:**  
NASA, ESA, and academic consortia maintain comprehensive databases and rapidly publicize significant discoveries. It is highly unlikely that such a detection has occurred but remains unreported.

- **The World Changes Slowly:**  
Given the pace of progress and the technical challenges, large, sudden breakthroughs between now and January 2025 are improbable. Most forecasting frameworks put heavy weight on continuation of the current trend unless compelling signals suggest imminent change.

**Probability: 1%**

This reflects the near impossibility, at the current rate of discovery and with present-day capabilities, of detecting and robustly quantifying an exoplanet atmosphere with >5% oxygen before the specified cutoff[1][4][5].
