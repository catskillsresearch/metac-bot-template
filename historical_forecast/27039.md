(a) **Time Until Outcome Known:**  
Approximately 7.5 weeks remain until October 1, 2024. The definitive answer will not be known until that date or until credible sources confirm Sheikh Hasina has been granted asylum in the UK under Section 31 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999.

(b) **Status Quo Outcome If Nothing Changes:**  
The most likely outcome as of now is that Sheikh Hasina will **not** be granted asylum in the UK before October 1, 2024. She currently remains in India, and the UK government has publicly stated, both specifically and on general grounds, significant barriers to her entry and asylum claim[2][3][4].

(c) **Scenario That Results in a No Outcome:**  
Sheikh Hasina remains in India or another safe third country through October 1, 2024, and the UK does not reverse its stance or grant her asylum. There are no official UK government statements or credible sources confirming the granting of asylum.

(d) **Scenario That Results in a Yes Outcome:**  
Sheikh Hasina is allowed to travel to the UK and formally claims asylum under Section 31. The UK Home Office grants her asylum, and this is confirmed by official statements or credible sources before October 1, 2024.

## Rationale

- The UK Home Office has **explicitly stated** that British immigration law "does not allow individuals to travel to that country to seek asylum or temporary refuge." The official position is that asylum should be claimed in the first safe country reached, which for Hasina is clearly India[2][3][4].
- Reports from multiple reputable outlets indicate that, as of August 7, the UK has "ruled out asylum for her," and she remains in New Delhi with an "interim stay" granted by Indian authorities pending any decision from the UK[3][4][5].
- There is **no confirmation from the UK government** or credible media that Hasina has been or is likely to be permitted to travel to the UK to claim asylum, nor that her application would be considered outside the existing legal framework[2][3][4].
- While Hasina's family ties (her sister is a UK citizen and her niece is an MP) might offer some opportunities for other forms of immigration, these do **not** facilitate a claim of asylum under Section 31, nor do they overcome the requirement to apply for asylum in the first safe country reached[2][5].
- The UK political environment and public statements, including from the new Labour government and the foreign secretary, suggest the UK is sensitive to both legal and diplomatic considerationsâ€”especially given ongoing calls for investigation into Hasina's handling of protests and potential human rights abuses[5].
- Statistically, asylum refusal rates remain substantial, initial acceptance is not guaranteed, appeals take time, and there is no evidence Hasina has even formally entered the UK to initiate the process as required[2][3][4].

Given the UK's strict public posture, lack of procedural movement, and the limited time frame, the **status quo outcome** (No) deserves significant weight.
