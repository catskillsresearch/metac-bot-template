(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  
From October 24, 2024, until November 5, 2024, there are 12 days remaining for any change to the Republican ticket before Election Day.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
JD Vance remains as Donald Trump's vice presidential nominee through November 5, 2024. The question would resolve as **No**, because he would not have ceased to be the Republican Party's official candidate for Vice President by that date[3][4].

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
No significant scandals, health crises, or political developments force JD Vance to step aside. Trump and the Republican Party maintain their support for Vance, he stays on the ticket, and the GOP proceeds to Election Day with Vance as the official running mate[3][4].

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
An unexpected event—such as a major scandal, damaging revelation about Vance’s past, serious health issue, or a severe breakdown in the relationship with Trump—forces Vance to withdraw or be replaced as the Republican vice presidential nominee before November 5, 2024. This could result from information similar to the Eagleton precedent or another unforeseen crisis[5].

## Rationale

Although there is historical precedent for a vice presidential nominee leaving the ticket (e.g., Thomas Eagleton in 1972), such instances are extremely rare in modern American politics. JD Vance was officially selected as Trump's running mate in July 2024, and since then the Trump campaign has taken public steps to feature and promote him, indicating a strong commitment to the ticket[3][4]. 

While reports in September 2024 noted "growing speculation" about whether Trump might consider replacing Vance, this was driven by minor controversies and not by any major political crisis or groundswell within the Republican Party for a replacement[5]. No search results provide evidence of a move to remove Vance or any active process underway to replace him.

As the election nears, logistical barriers and ballot access issues also make a last-minute replacement increasingly difficult—historically, such changes are only undertaken under extreme circumstances. The status quo generally prevails unless disrupted by significant, unforeseen developments, which, while possible, remain low-probability events given the information at hand.

## Final Answer

Probability: **93%**

There is a high probability JD Vance will remain Donald Trump's running mate through November 5, 2024; the chance of his removal or resignation, while never zero, is very low in the absence of any major new development[3][4][5].
