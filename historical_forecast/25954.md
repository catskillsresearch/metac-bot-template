I'll analyze this question about the future French Prime Minister and provide a forecast.

(a) Time until outcome: 20 days (from May 6, 2025 to July 30, 2024 - noting that the query appears to contain a date inconsistency, as the current date is shown as 2025 but the question references 2024 events).

(b) Status quo outcome: Currently, Gabriel Attal (from Macron's Together coalition) serves as Prime Minister in a caretaker capacity following the legislative elections.

(c) No outcome scenario: Either Attal remains Prime Minister, or a new Prime Minister is appointed from either Macron's Together coalition or from the New Popular Front alliance (which won the most seats), following successful negotiations to form a government.

(d) Yes outcome scenario: A "technical" or "unity" government is formed with a Prime Minister from Les Républicains (the conservative party) or another smaller party as a compromise candidate, or the position remains vacant due to complete political deadlock.

The recent French legislative elections have created a complex political landscape with no clear path to governance. Based on the search results, the New Popular Front alliance won the most seats (182), followed by Macron's Together coalition (168), and the far-right National Rally (143)[3]. This three-way split without any bloc having a majority creates significant uncertainty.

The current Prime Minister Gabriel Attal remains in office as a caretaker. President Macron has indicated he prefers to "wait for the new Assemblée Nationale to be structured before taking the necessary decisions," suggesting no immediate change[1]. The first session of the new Assembly is scheduled for July 18[1].

Looking at the most likely scenarios:

1. **Status quo continuation**: Attal remains as caretaker Prime Minister from the Together coalition. This is plausible in the short term but faces challenges, as his government could face a motion of no confidence as early as July 18[1].

2. **New Popular Front Prime Minister**: As the alliance with the most seats, the NFP has a strong claim to the premiership. Jean-Luc Mélenchon, leader of La France Insoumise (a major component of NFP), has stated that "the president must bow" to the left's victory[3]. However, there are significant internal divisions within the left coalition.

3. **Coalition government**: A broader coalition could form, but this appears unlikely. Representatives of the left have "already ruled out any prospect of an alliance with Macron's bloc and/or the right"[1]. Macron's supporters have similarly set "preconditions for any discussion"[1].

4. **Technical government**: Given the deadlock, a neutral or technical government with a Prime Minister from outside the main blocs could be a compromise solution, though there's no indication this is being actively pursued yet.

The French political system has no formal requirement for a positive confidence vote, but a government can be dismissed through a motion of no confidence. This creates pressure for some form of stable arrangement.

The status quo tends to persist in politics, especially during deadlocks. Attal is already in place as Prime Minister, giving him an advantage. However, the unprecedented nature of this three-way split makes relying solely on historical patterns less reliable.

Based on the information available, the most likely outcome appears to be either a Prime Minister from the New Popular Front or the continuation of Attal from Together, at least in the short term through July 30. There's limited evidence suggesting a Prime Minister from outside these two coalitions is being seriously considered.

Probability: 30%
