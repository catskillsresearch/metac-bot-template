I'll analyze the question about UFO sightings for March 2025 based on the available information:

(a) Time until outcome is known: The outcome will be determined when the National UFO Reporting Center posts its March 2025 data, which would be accessible by Metaculus on or after April 1, 2025. From today (May 6, 2025), this information should already be available, as we're now past that date.

(b) Status quo outcome: Based on the search results, NUFORC has already collected data for March 2025, though the exact number of reports isn't explicitly stated. The search results show some highlighted reports from March 2025, including one from March 13, 2025 in Michigan City, IN and another from March 11, 2025 in Kansas City, MO[5].

(c) Scenario for No outcome: If March 2025 followed the pattern of February 2025, which had 310 reports according to the research assistant's information, it would fall below the 400-report threshold.

(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: If March 2025 followed patterns more similar to January 2025 (549 reports) or December 2024 (939 reports), it would easily exceed the 400-report threshold.

Looking at the search results, I can see that NUFORC maintains a substantial database of UFO sighting reports that are organized by various criteria including event date, state/country, shape of UFO, and date posted[3]. The database represents "the largest independently collected set of UFO/UAP sighting reports available on the internet"[3].

From the search results, I can see some specific reports from Michigan in March (although they appear to be from 1995, not 2025)[2], as well as highlighted reports from March 2025 mentioned earlier[5]. However, the search results don't provide a comprehensive count for March 2025.

Considering the status quo and historical patterns, I need to rely on the data provided in the search results and the reported historical patterns. Looking at the months preceding March 2025:
- January 2025: 549 reports
- February 2025: 310 reports
- November 2024: 424 reports
- December 2024: 939 reports

There's significant month-to-month variability. February 2025 (310) was well below the threshold, while January 2025 (549) was well above it. The average of these recent months is significantly above 400, suggesting that exceeding 400 reports is not unusual.

Additionally, March typically has more daylight hours than February in the Northern Hemisphere, which could potentially increase outdoor activities and sighting opportunities, as noted in the research assistant's analysis.

Given that we're now in May 2025, the actual data should be available, but without that specific information in the search results, I must rely on the patterns observed in recent months. The available evidence suggests that reaching 400+ reports in a month is common, having occurred in 3 of the 4 most recent months cited.

Probability: 65%
