(a) **Time until outcome known:**  
The question concerns clemency actions taken by Donald Trump in March 2025. As today is May 6, 2025, the outcome is already knowable in principle, but the provided information is only current to February 27, 2025—meaning there is no information about actual events in March.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
As of February 27, 2025, there are zero publicly disclosed executive clemency actions by Trump in March 2025. If no new clemency actions occur or are publicly announced in March, the outcome would be *No*.

(c) **Scenario for a No outcome:**  
Trump issues three or fewer executive clemency actions (pardons, commutations, or similar) in March 2025, or none at all.

(d) **Scenario for a Yes outcome:**  
Trump grants executive clemency to more than three individuals (either individually or as part of group/batch actions) and these actions are publicly disclosed during March 2025.

## Rationale

- **Base rates:** In his first term, Trump issued clemency to 237 individuals, historically showing a pattern of both individual and group/batch pardons, especially in the waning days of his term and around specific politically charged events[2].  
- **Second term actions:** In January 2025, Trump issued two significant mass clemency actions: one for individuals convicted in the January 6 Capitol events and another for nearly two dozen anti-abortion activists[1][3][4]. These suggest a continued willingness to use clemency expansively and in a group fashion.
- **Recent patterns:** The January 2025 batch pardons serve political purposes and signal willingness for more group actions, particularly in response to political events or advocacy by activist groups[3][4].
- **Unknowns:** There are no credible reports or announcements as of February 27, 2025, indicating plans for further mass or multi-individual clemency actions in March 2025.
- **Timing:** Major clemency actions have already taken place in January, possibly addressing the most pressing political cases. Historically, there are often bursts of clemency rather than a steady flow, especially when related to headline events or upcoming political milestones (e.g., campaigns, major demonstrations).
- **Presidential discretion and unpredictability:** While Trump has shown a willingness to grant many pardons at once for political signaling, the specific timing and volume month-to-month are difficult to forecast, and there is no direct evidence as of late February for March intentions.

Given the strength of the status quo bias in short timeframes and the lack of direct evidence for more than three clemency actions in March, but also accounting for Trump’s demonstrated preference for batch actions and possible opportunistic announcements, a modest probability above pure base rate drift is justified.

**Probability: 35%**
