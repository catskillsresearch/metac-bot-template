(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
The outcome will be determined on October 1, 2024, based on National Hurricane Center reports covering September 2024. With the current date being September 12, 2024 (from your scenario), there are approximately 18 days left until resolution.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
As of early September 2024, the season started somewhat slowly, with no named storms by Labor Day weekend and no major hurricanes reported yet in September[5]. If this pattern continues, the month would end with zero or very few major hurricanes.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
September finishes with fewer than four Atlantic hurricanes reaching Category 3 or higher status. This could occur if only one or two major hurricanes form, or if atmospheric conditions (such as wind shear, dry air, or Saharan dust outbreaks) inhibit rapid intensification, despite favorable sea surface temperatures and La Niña conditions. Given the slower start to the month and typical seasonality, this is a plausible scenario[5][3].

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
Four or more Atlantic storms reach Category 3 or higher during September. This would require a sharp increase in activity in the remaining weeks, possibly with a cluster of storms rapidly intensifying in quick succession due to persistently favorable conditions (warm sea surface temperatures, low wind shear, moist air, and favorable atmospheric patterns). While the underlying seasonal forecasts call for an above-average year and 3–6 major hurricanes for the whole season[3], getting four in a single month would require an exceptionally active and intense period, which, while rare, is not impossible under strong La Niña and unusually warm ocean conditions.

## Rationale

- **Seasonal Forecasts:** The main agencies (NOAA, AccuWeather, TSR) forecast an above-normal season with 3–6 major hurricanes for the entire 2024 season[1][3]. Having four or more major hurricanes occur in just September would be an outlier even in a very active year.
- **Month-to-Month Distribution:** Historically, September is the peak month, but the majority of seasonal major hurricanes do not typically all cluster within a single month—especially not in seasons that have a slow start to September.
- **Early September Status:** With no named storms by Labor Day weekend and no major hurricanes reported in early September, getting to four for the month would require an exceptional burst of high-end hurricane activity in the remaining time[5].
- **Environmental Factors:** While La Niña and very warm sea surface temperatures increase the chances for rapid intensification and multiple major hurricanes[1][2][3], such a late start diminishes the likelihood of reaching a count as high as four.

Based on these factors, the **status quo outcome (fewer than four major hurricanes in September) deserves extra weight**. While a late burst of activity could happen, it is statistically and climatologically less likely, even in an unusually active season.
