(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
As of January 23, 2025, there are 22 days until Presidents’ Day Weekend begins (February 14, 2025) and 25 days until the end of the forecast period (February 17, 2025).

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
If 2025 travel patterns mirrored the most recent comparable year (2024), we’d expect continued high demand—perhaps slightly above 2024’s Presidents’ Day figures, though precise TSA numbers for that specific weekend are not given in the available sources. Assuming late 2024 volumes set the baseline, the status quo would likely yield four-day totals just over the 10 million mark.

(c) **Outcome if the current trend continued:**  
TSA has recently prepared for potential single-day records in 2024 with daily volumes exceeding 3 million on peak travel days[2]. With holiday travel trending upward, it’s reasonable to project average daily passenger screenings of 2.5 to 2.7 million each day over the Presidents’ Day weekend, resulting in a likely total between 10 million and 11 million for the four-day period.

(d) **Expectations of experts and markets:**  
Travel industry projections (AAA, TSA) anticipate record or near-record holiday air travel volumes through the 2024–2025 season[1][3][5]. TSA’s own statements suggest anticipation of four-day totals approaching or modestly surpassing recent highs, especially with the favorable calendar alignment of Presidents’ Day weekend beginning on Valentine’s Day (Friday, February 14, 2025)[2].

(e) **Unexpected low scenario:**  
A significant winter storm, severe weather event, or an abrupt economic shock (such as a sudden recession or health scare) could sharply suppress travel demand, resulting in widespread flight cancellations and lower screening volumes. In this case, the total for the weekend could dip below 9 million.

(f) **Unexpected high scenario:**  
Unusually mild weather, strong economic confidence, or a surge in last-minute getaways due to the Valentine’s Day/Presidents’ Day overlap could cause an outsized jump, pushing screenings per day closer to or above 3 million, and the four-day sum might approach or slightly exceed 11.5 million.
