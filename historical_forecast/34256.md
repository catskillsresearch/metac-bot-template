(a) **Time Left Until Outcome:**  
There are approximately two months left until April 1, 2025, when the question will be resolved.

(b) **Status Quo Outcome if Nothing Changes:**  
If SpaceX does not make any new posts on its Updates page between now and April 1, 2025, the outcome is **Yes**—SpaceX will have failed to post a new update in that period.

(c) **Scenario Resulting in a No Outcome:**  
A "No" outcome occurs if SpaceX posts at least one new, timestamped update on its official Updates page before April 1, 2025. This could happen if SpaceX chooses to officially document a major company event, product launch, or mission milestone, resuming use of the Updates page as it has in the past.

(d) **Scenario Resulting in a Yes Outcome:**  
A "Yes" outcome occurs if SpaceX does not post any new updates by April 1, 2025—continuing the current pattern of inactivity on that page, regardless of ongoing launches and company developments.

## Forecast Rationale

- As of January 28, 2025, more than three months have passed since the last post on SpaceX’s Updates page (September 10, 2024), despite significant operational activity—including multiple Falcon 9 launches and Starship tests—which in prior years might have warranted formal updates[1][3][4].
- There is no public announcement about retiring or changing the Updates page, but the lack of updates despite major events suggests that SpaceX may now prioritize other communication channels like its main launches page, livestreams, or social media instead of the official Updates blog[1][5].
- The pattern of leaving the Updates page inactive during busy operational periods points to a lower probability of a sudden policy reversal, especially in the absence of an imminent, unprecedented event that would compel a website update.
- Given the short time remaining until the question resolves and the strong weight forecasters give to the status quo, the probability that the current pattern of non-posting continues is relatively high.

## Final Answer

Probability: **80%**
