(a) Time left until outcome: As of May 6, 2025, the outcome is already known since March 1, 2025 has passed.

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: Based on the search results, Apple was the most valuable company by market cap as of March 31, 2025, with a market capitalization of $3.337 trillion[2].

(c) Scenario for an unexpected outcome: An unexpected outcome would have been if Microsoft had surged dramatically in February 2025 due to a major breakthrough in their AI capabilities or a significant new partnership, allowing them to overtake both Apple and Nvidia.

Looking at the market capitalization data available from the search results, I can analyze which company was most likely the world's most valuable by market cap on March 1, 2025.

According to the most recent and authoritative data available, as of March 31, 2025, Apple held the top position with a market cap of $3.337 trillion, followed by Microsoft at $2.791 trillion and Nvidia at $2.644 trillion[2]. This data comes from a reliable source that tracks public corporations by market capitalization.

However, there is some conflicting information. Another source indicates that as of May 5, 2025, Microsoft was the most valuable company with a market cap of $3.248 trillion, followed by Apple and Nvidia[1]. This suggests there may have been significant market movements between March and May 2025.

When we look at the growth trends from December 2023 to March 31, 2025, we can see that Nvidia had experienced remarkable growth of 116.2% ($1,420 billion increase), while Apple had more modest growth of 11.4% ($340 billion increase)[5]. Microsoft showed 0% growth during this period according to the same source[5].

Given that Apple was listed as the top company in the March 31, 2025 data[2], and considering that March 1 was just 30 days earlier, it's highly likely that Apple was also the most valuable company on March 1, 2025. The data shows Apple maintaining its leadership position through Q1 2025, despite Nvidia's stronger growth trajectory over the longer term.

The fact that Microsoft surpassed Apple by May 5, 2025[1] suggests a shift in market dynamics after March, but this would not have affected the March 1 ranking.

As a professional forecaster, I acknowledge that market capitalizations can fluctuate significantly even within short time periods due to earnings reports, product announcements, or macroeconomic factors. However, the authoritative quarterly data showing Apple in the top position as of March 31, 2025[2], strongly suggests it held that position on March 1 as well.

Apple: 85%
Nvidia: 10%
Microsoft: 3%
Alphabet: 1%
Amazon: 0.5%
Someone else: 0.5%
