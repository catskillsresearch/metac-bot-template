(a) **Time until the outcome is known:**  
From today (May 6, 2025) until March 28, 2025, is negative time — the event date is in the past. The Buffett Indicator value for March 28, 2025, is already available or will soon be published by sources such as Longtermtrends, Advisor Perspectives, or GuruFocus[1][2].

(b) **Outcome if nothing changed:**  
The most recent reported value for the Buffett Indicator is 153.1% as of May 6, 2025[2]. Earlier in March 2025, multiple sources reported values in the 154–155% range[1][2]. If nothing changed (i.e., no significant market movement or GDP revision occurred in late March), the value for March 28, 2025, would likely be in the 153%–155% range.

(c) **Outcome if the current trend continued:**  
From December 2024 (211%)[3] to early March 2025 (about 154%)[1][2], the indicator experienced a substantial drop, likely reflecting a sharp equity market pullback. If the downward trend continued through the end of March, the value could dip modestly lower, perhaps approaching the low 150% area. However, the drop already appears sharp and further decreases would likely require more market stress.

(d) **Expectations of experts and markets:**  
Most market commentary as of March and April 2025 focuses on the sharp correction from the late-2024 highs (above 200%) to ~154%. There is no evidence of a major bounce or further plunge post-early March in the sources. Given the lack of new shocks and the stabilization typically seen after such a correction, experts would expect the indicator to hover around 150%–155% barring unexpected market or economic news[1][2][4].

(e) **Unexpected scenario resulting in a low outcome:**  
A rapid, additional market decline (e.g., a flash crash, another banking crisis, or a geopolitical shock) near the end of March 2025 could pull the market cap down by another 10% or more, reducing the Buffett Indicator into the mid-140% range or lower.

(f) **Unexpected scenario resulting in a high outcome:**  
A sudden, strong stock market rebound in late March, possibly due to a major policy announcement, unexpectedly positive economic data, or a shift in Federal Reserve policy, could cause the Wilshire 5000 to surge, pushing the indicator back up toward 160% or higher.
