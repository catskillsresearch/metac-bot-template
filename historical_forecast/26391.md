(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  
The forecast period closes when it is clear whether a ceasefire lasting at least 30 days, agreed before August 31, 2024, has begun and remained in effect. As of July 22, 2024, there are about 6 weeks until August 31, 2024, and 14 weeks until October 4, 2024, when a 30-day ceasefire starting at the last possible moment (September 4) would have concluded.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
No 30-day ceasefire has been agreed or initiated since December 2023. The default status quo outcome is therefore "No ceasefire agreement meeting the criteria," i.e., resolution "No".

(c) **Scenario leading to a No outcome:**  
Negotiations stall, or only result in very short humanitarian pauses, or a ceasefire agreement is reached after August 31, 2024. Alternatively, a deal is agreed in time but fails to last the minimum 30 days due to breakdown or violation.

(d) **Scenario leading to a Yes outcome:**  
Both Israel and Hamas, possibly under continued US, Qatari, and Egyptian mediation, agree on a phased ceasefire that goes into effect before August 31 and holds for at least 30 days. This could be a result of mounting international pressure or shifts in domestic or battlefield incentives.

## Rationale

- **Negotiation Status:**  
There is active international mediation, and a detailed ceasefire framework exists. Hamas has tentatively accepted a phased US-backed proposal that includes an initial 42-day phase with cessation of hostilities and withdrawal of Israeli forces from densely populated areas, prisoner exchanges, and humanitarian arrangements[1][2][3]. Israel has also signaled conditional acceptance of this deal[3]. Both sides moving closer is notable progress compared to prior months when even preliminary agreement seemed out of reach.

- **Ceasefire Structure:**  
The proposed initial phase lasting 42 days (i.e., 6 weeks) exceeds the 30-day requirement[1][2][3]. The agreement states the ceasefire will persist as long as negotiations for subsequent phases continue, potentially increasing how long the pause holds[3].

- **Risks and Frictions:**  
Despite the progress, there is substantial uncertainty:
  - **Political Dynamics:** Hardliners in both Israel and Hamas could yet block or undermine the deal. Israeli government coalition politics remain volatile, and Hamas faces its own internal debates.
  - **Past Precedents:** Only one multi-day pause has occurred since October 7, 2023.
  - **Trigger Events:** Fresh violence, especially events like attacks causing mass casualties, could torpedo talks, as happened after Israeli strikes in previous months.
  - **Implementation Hurdles:** Even if the deal is signed, practical issues or spoilers could disrupt the period of calm before 30 days elapse.

- **International Pressure and Mediation:**  
The US, Egypt, and Qatar are investing heavily in pushing the sides toward agreement[2][3]. UN Security Council Resolution 2735 demonstrates rare global alignment, notably adding diplomatic and reputational pressure on Hamas to formally accept[3]. 

- **Weighting the Status Quo:**  
Despite notable movement, the default should be weighted more heavily, as the world tends to change slowly, and last-minute breakdowns are common in this conflict. The situation is currently one of ongoing hostilities and missed opportunities.

## Final Probability

Balancing:
- Serious movement toward a viable, detailed agreement
- Ongoing violence and deep mistrust
- Recent tentative acceptance of a phased plan by both sides, but not a final, implemented deal

**Probability: 45%**

A deal is closer than at any time in recent months, but the weight of the recent status quo, political volatility, and very limited precedent for such a lengthy agreed pause argue against going above 50% at this time.
