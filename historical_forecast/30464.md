(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
The November 2024 Zillow Observed Rent Index (ZORI) data for Providence, RI will be released around December 12, 2024, which is approximately 2.5 weeks from the current date (November 25, 2024).

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
The latest available data (October 2024) shows Providence, RI with a year-over-year rent increase of 5.7%[1]. This is above the 5.0% threshold for the question. If November 2024 follows the same trend as October, the answer would be **Yes**.

(c) **Scenario for a No outcome:**  
If Providence, RI experiences a significant slowdown in rent growth between October and November 2024—perhaps due to an uptick in available rental units, seasonal weakening, or a surge in rental concessions—the year-over-year increase could fall below 5.0%. For example, if the November 2023–24 growth rate drops to 4.9% or below, the outcome is No.

(d) **Scenario for a Yes outcome:**  
If Providence’s rent market remains steady or strengthens slightly, and the year-over-year increase for November 2024 is at least 5.0% (matching or exceeding the October rate), the answer would be Yes. Stable demand, low vacancy, and lack of new supply would support this scenario.

## Rationale

The most recent data (October 2024) shows Providence at 5.7% annual rent growth, the third highest among large metros and above the 5.0% mark[1]. Nationally, rent growth is slowing, and the October 2024 market commentary highlights continued deceleration due to abundant concessions and softening demand. However, there is no specific evidence that Providence is currently diverging from its high-growth trend[1].

Rent growth rates tend to move gradually month to month, especially in a stable economic environment without major shocks. A drop of 0.7 percentage points or more (from 5.7% to below 5.0%) in just one month is possible but not typical absent a local or sectoral disruption, for which there is currently no public evidence[1].

Recent historical trends suggest Providence has outperformed the national average, and unless there is an abrupt and unusual market shift in November, the year-over-year growth should remain above 5.0%[1]. National-level commentary about cooling rents does not directly contradict the strong local Providence data, but it does increase the odds of a small dip.

Given the weight forecasters assign to the status quo and slow change, the most likely outcome is that Providence will remain at or above 5.0% year-over-year growth for November 2024.
