(a) **Time until outcome is known:**  
There are 17 days remaining until October 1, 2024, when it will be known if Comex Gold Spot closing prices will have exceeded $2,700/oz as determined by Yahoo Finance.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changes:**  
As of September 13, 2024, the highest recorded Comex Gold Spot close is $2,591.30/oz, and gold faces notable resistance below $2,530-$2,591.30 levels. If current trends persist and gold does not experience an unusually sharp rally, the price will **not** exceed $2,700/oz before the deadline[1][4][5].

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
- Gold continues to face technical and psychological resistance below $2,700/oz.
- Supportive macroeconomic factors (rate cut expectations, recession fears, ETF inflows) keep prices elevated, but not enough to drive a rapid breakout.
- No significant, unexpected market shock occurs to trigger a parabolic move.
- Thus, gold closes every day below $2,700/oz before October 1, 2024.

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
- A strong, sudden catalyst emerges (e.g., aggressive rate cuts, geopolitical crisis, major financial instability) that spikes safe-haven demand.
- Gold rapidly breaks through the $2,600s, shattering resistance and setting new records above $2,700/oz, confirmed by the Yahoo Finance close before October 1, 2024.
- Market momentum and buying panic push gold higher than any current forecast suggests.

## Rationale

The **status quo** outcome should carry the most weight because goldâ€™s prior record close is $2,591.30/oz and technical resistance remains firm near and just above this level[1][5].  
Most market forecasts for 2024 have trailed well behind $2,700/oz, even as consensus upgrades arrive in response to recent highs[4][5]. No analyst cited in major sources is predicting a close above $2,700/oz in the very near term, and the price would require an additional $100+ move in under three weeks, which is an unusually steep gain outside major shocks[4][5].

While seasonally-adjusted factors and macro conditions (rate cut expectations, labor market softening, and robust gold demand) provide a bullish backdrop, these influences have already contributed to the recent surge. Without a new, extraordinary catalyst, the probability of gold closing above $2,700/oz before October 1, 2024, remains moderate but not high.

**Probability: 30%**
