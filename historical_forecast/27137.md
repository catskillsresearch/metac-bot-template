(a) Time remaining until outcome: There are approximately 48 days left until October 1, 2024, when the outcome of this question will be determined.

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changes: The British Museum continues to retain all of its Benin Bronzes collection without returning any to Nigeria.

(c) Scenario resulting in a No outcome: The British Museum maintains its longstanding legal position against deaccessioning items from its collection, citing the British Museum Act of 1963. International pressure and negotiations continue but no actual transfers occur before the October 1 deadline.

(d) Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome: An unexpected emergency legislative change allows the British Museum to bypass its current legal restrictions, and in response to mounting diplomatic pressure, the museum rapidly arranges for at least 200 Benin Bronzes to be physically transported to Nigeria before October 1, 2024.

Looking at the available evidence, I need to assess the likelihood of at least 200 Benin Bronzes going from the British Museum to Nigeria before October 1, 2024.

The status quo strongly suggests this will not happen. The British Museum has consistently maintained its position against returning any Benin Bronzes, citing legal restrictions on deaccessioning items from its collection[1]. As of June 2023, the British Museum had not returned any of the Benin Bronzes in its possession, and there is no evidence in the search results indicating any change to this position as of the most recent information available.

While other institutions worldwide have begun returning Benin Bronzes - such as the University of Iowa's Stanley Museum of Art in July 2024[3][4] and the Smithsonian's commitment to return 29 pieces[4] - the British Museum has remained firm in its stance. The museum holds approximately 900 Benin Bronzes, making the prospect of returning at least 200 (over 22% of their collection) particularly significant and unlikely without major policy changes.

Several factors further decrease the probability of this occurring before October 1, 2024:

1. The extremely short timeframe (48 days) would make the logistics of such a large transfer extremely challenging, even if the decision were made today.

2. There is ongoing debate within Nigeria itself about where returned artifacts should be kept and how they should be used[2], potentially complicating any rapid large-scale repatriation.

3. A March 2023 decree by then-President Buhari vesting ownership rights of returned artifacts with the Oba of Benin[5] may have created additional complexities in the repatriation process.

4. The British Museum is bound by the British Museum Act of 1963, which would require parliamentary action to amend - a process that typically takes much longer than the remaining time before October 1.

While international pressure for repatriation continues to grow, and some UK collections are pushing ahead with returns[5], there is no indication that the British Museum specifically is preparing for or considering such a significant transfer in the immediate future.

Given the strong status quo of no returns from the British Museum, the legal barriers in place, the extremely short timeframe, and the absence of any public announcements suggesting imminent change, the probability of at least 200 Benin Bronzes being returned from the British Museum to Nigeria before October 1, 2024, is extremely low.

Probability: 1%
