(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  
The question will be resolved based on whether a new post appears on Virgin Galactic’s News page, timestamped after November 22, 2024 and before January 1, 2025. That leaves about 39 days remaining.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
If Virgin Galactic continues its current pattern and does not update its News page, the outcome will be "Yes"—no new post before January 1, 2025[1].

(c) **Scenario that results in a No outcome:**  
Virgin Galactic publishes any new post (such as a press release, business update, or even a holiday greeting) on its official News page (not the Investor Relations or Press Center), timestamped after November 22, 2024 and before January 1, 2025. Alternatively, if the official News page is inaccessible when checked for resolution, a "No" outcome is triggered per the question’s guidelines.

(d) **Scenario that results in a Yes outcome:**  
No new post is added to the News page at the specified URL during the resolution period, and the page remains accessible for verification[1].

## Rationale

Virgin Galactic’s News page has not been updated since July 10, 2024[1]. While the company has made important financial announcements and business updates since then (including quarterly results in August and November 2024), these were exclusively posted to the Investor Relations site, not the main News page[2][4][5]. This suggests that the News page is reserved for more selective or high-profile media releases and does not mirror regular financial or operational updates.

There is no pattern of frequent News page updates. Although unexpected news, marketing campaigns, or year-end messages could prompt a post at any time, there is no public indication that such an announcement is likely in the remainder of 2024. The lack of planned events and the relatively low rate of News page activity support the baseline assumption that no update will occur before January 1, 2025.

However, two sources of risk to a "Yes" outcome remain:

- **Unscheduled Announcements:** Companies occasionally release year-end or holiday updates, even if not routine. Virgin Galactic could break its posting silence with an unexpected newsworthy event or celebratory message, though there is no public signal this is imminent.
- **Website Downtime:** If the News page becomes inaccessible at resolution, the question resolves to "No" by rule, even without new content.

Given the historical posting frequency, absence of known catalysts, and that current business updates are channeled elsewhere, the status quo outcome (“Yes”) deserves substantial weight. Yet, neither a surprise announcement nor web downtime can be dismissed outright.

## Probability Estimate

Balancing the infrequent update trend, absence of signals for a new post, and the nontrivial but limited risk of an unexpected update or downtime, the odds favor a "Yes" outcome but are not overwhelming.

**Probability: 80%**
