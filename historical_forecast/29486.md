## Forecasting Analysis for Brasília Rainfall in December 2024

### (a) Time Left Until Outcome Known
As of November 1, 2024, approximately one month remains until the end of December 2024, when the total rainfall for the month can be verified.

### (b) Status Quo Outcome
The status quo suggests that December is typically the wettest month in Brasília, with long-term averages ranging from about 207mm to 396mm of rainfall. Therefore, it is likely that rainfall in December 2024 will exceed 100mm under normal conditions.

### (c) Scenario for "No" Outcome
A "No" outcome would require an unprecedented anomaly, where the rainfall in December 2024 is significantly below historical averages. This could be due to a continuation of drought-like conditions or unusual blocking high-pressure systems persisting over Brasília throughout the month, preventing typical wet-season rainfall patterns from establishing.

### (d) Scenario for "Yes" Outcome
A "Yes" outcome aligns with historical trends, where December experiences substantial rainfall. Given that December is the wettest month in Brasília and the recent drought has ended, it is reasonable to expect a return to typical wet-season patterns. This scenario would involve the normal onset of heavy rainfall during the month, consistent with historical averages.

### Final Consideration
Given the historical data and typical climatology, it is highly probable that Brasília will experience more than 100mm of rainfall in December 2024. The recent drought has ended, and December typically marks the beginning of the wet season, supporting this conclusion.
