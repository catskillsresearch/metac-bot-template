(a) Time left until outcome: The 97th Academy Awards ceremony is typically held in late March or early April. Based on the current date (May 6, 2025), the ceremony has already taken place, and the results should be known. However, since the query asks me to forecast as if from February 25, 2025, I'll approach this as if the Oscars are approximately 1 month away.

(b) Status quo outcome: Based on the search results, Wicked is expected to receive multiple nominations but likely not dominate in the major categories like Best Picture. The film appears positioned to win perhaps 2-3 technical awards (potentially in areas like Production Design and Visual Effects).

(c) Unexpected outcome scenario: A scenario that could lead to an unexpected outcome would be if Wicked resonated with Academy voters much more strongly than anticipated, perhaps due to its commercial success creating momentum in a year where other contenders underperformed at the box office. This could result in the film winning 4 or more Oscars, including potential surprise wins in major categories like Best Actress for Cynthia Erivo or even Best Director for Jon Chu, despite the search results suggesting he's not expected to be in the top five.

Now for my forecast rationale:

Wicked has been nominated for 10 Academy Awards for the 2025 ceremony, which indicates significant recognition from the Academy. The film has been critically acclaimed and commercially successful, with a strong opening projected at $130-150 million[2]. Critics have described it as "one of the best films of the year"[1], which suggests it has genuine merit beyond just being popular.

However, when examining the available evidence more carefully, there are indications that while Wicked is expected to perform well, it may not sweep the major categories. One source specifically states that for Best Picture, "it's not a top five pick, and it certainly won't win"[3]. This suggests that despite its popularity, the film may face challenges in the most prestigious categories.

Looking at the technical categories, Wicked seems to have stronger prospects. The production design is described as "a marvel in the Emerald City"[3], and the visual effects are noted as "good and, most importantly, serve the story well"[3]. These are categories where musicals with strong visual elements often perform well at the Oscars.

The film's runtime (reportedly around 2 hours and 40 minutes) has been mentioned as a potential concern[2], which could affect its reception among Academy voters who sometimes favor tighter narratives.

While one enthusiastic source claims Wicked will "use Elphaba's broom to sweep the Oscars"[3], this seems more like hyperbole than a measured prediction. The measured assessments suggest a more modest performance.

Historically, musicals have had varied success at the Oscars. Some, like "Chicago" or "The Sound of Music," have won numerous awards including Best Picture, while others have been recognized primarily in technical categories. Without specific information about Wicked's competition, it's difficult to precisely gauge its chances against other nominees.

Considering all these factors and accounting for the uncertainty inherent in Oscar predictions, here is my forecast:

Option_A (0-1 wins): 30%
Option_B (2 wins): 35%
Option_C (3 wins): 25%
Option_D (4 or more wins): 10%
