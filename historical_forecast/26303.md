(a) Time left until outcome is known: About 2.5 months (from May 6, 2025, until September 30, 2024 - noting this is a retrospective question as the current date is already past the resolution date)

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: The question would resolve negatively, as no major LLM-powered cyberattack meeting the criteria was reported before September 30, 2024.

(c) Brief description of a scenario resulting in a No outcome: No cyberattack using LLMs caused human casualties, $10M+ in damages, or significant disruption to large organizations/critical infrastructure before the deadline, either because security measures were effective or because attackers hadn't yet developed the capability to execute attacks of that magnitude.

(d) Brief description of a scenario resulting in a Yes outcome: A sophisticated LLM-powered attack successfully targeted critical infrastructure (like a hospital system or major corporation), causing either significant financial damage exceeding $10M or disrupting operations to the point where basic functions couldn't continue.

Based on the search results and understanding the nature of forecasting questions, I'll analyze whether a major LLM-powered cyberattack occurred before September 30, 2024.

The search results provide predictions and trends from late 2023 and early 2024 about potential LLM-powered cyberattacks, but don't contain evidence of actual major attacks that would satisfy the criteria specified in the question. Let me analyze what we know:

The evidence shows that cybersecurity experts were predicting an increase in LLM-powered attacks throughout 2024. Key points include:

1. Malicious versions of ChatGPT, like WormGPT, were already circulating on the dark web in 2023, indicating development of LLMs without ethical restraints[1].

2. There was a trend of "script kiddies" using LLMs to create complex exploit scripts despite limited technical knowledge, lowering the barrier to advanced attacks[2].

3. Experts specifically predicted a surge in Business Email Compromise (BEC) attacks using LLMs to mimic communication styles of executives[5].

4. Prompt injection techniques were being developed to bypass LLMs' built-in safeguards[2].

5. 2024 being a U.S. election year was considered to increase the risk of AI-powered attacks on critical infrastructure[1].

However, the search results don't contain any reports of actual major LLM-powered cyberattacks that occurred before September 30, 2024, that meet any of the specified criteria:
- No mention of fatalities
- No mention of attacks causing $10M+ in damages
- No mention of disruptions to medical facilities, government facilities, or large companies that prevented basic functions

While the potential and tools for such attacks existed, the absence of evidence for a qualifying attack in these search results (which extend to May 2025) suggests that no such attack actually occurred within the timeframe.

As a forecaster, I need to consider the status quo and default to it in the absence of contrary evidence. The search results contain predictions about the future from early 2024 but no confirmation that these predictions manifested into reality in the form of a qualifying attack.

Probability: 1%
