(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
There are just over three weeks remaining until April 1, 2025. Today is March 11, 2025.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
The last reported figure, for February 16–March 1, 2025, is 135,232 cubic meters per day[3][4]. If nothing substantial changes, this is the value likely to be reported in OCHA's final pre-April 1 snapshot.

(c) **Outcome if the current trend continued:**  
Recent OCHA data shows a steady upward trend:  
- Mid-January: 85,325 m³/day  
- Late January: 97,167 m³/day  
- Early February: 116,671 m³/day  
- Late February–early March: 135,232 m³/day[3][4]

If this rate of increase (about 19,000 m³ over ~2 weeks) continued, a modest increase might be expected. Extrapolating linearly (though supply constraints may slow gains), the figure could reach around 140,000–145,000 m³/day by late March.

(d) **Expectations of experts and markets:**  
- Humanitarian partners and UN sources attribute recent gains to increased groundwater production and modest improvements in fuel availability[4].  
- However, about 70% of produced water is still lost due to severe distribution network damage, and supply continues to be highly vulnerable to fuel, security, and infrastructure constraints[4][5].  
- Most outlooks indicate no major infrastructure repair or policy change is expected before April 1, and most production gains to date have come from temporary measures.  
- Market and expert consensus would likely anchor expectations in the 135,000–145,000 m³/day range, barring a dramatic turn of events.

(e) **Unexpected scenario for a low outcome:**  
A renewed escalation, sudden cut to fuel supplies, or a significant security incident could sharply reduce operational capacity, dropping daily production back toward early 2025 levels (85,000–100,000 m³/day or lower). 

(f) **Unexpected scenario for a high outcome:**  
If there were a breakthrough: for example, a major ceasefire, rapid increase in fuel supplies, or emergency repairs to key infrastructure, daily production could jump above 150,000 m³/day—though record levels remain highly unlikely without significant new investments.
