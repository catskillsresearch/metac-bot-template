(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  
About 1.5 months remain before January 1, 2025. The question will resolve based on whether Microsoft (MSFT) ever trades at or above $468.35, even briefly, before the end of December 31, 2024.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
As of the latest available data, MSFT is trading at approximately $436.17 to $438.47—roughly 6.4% below its all-time high of $468.35[5]. If the stock price were to remain near this level without rallying sharply, the stock would continuously remain below its all-time high through year-end, resulting in a **Yes** outcome.

(c) **Scenario for a No outcome:**  
A **No** resolution would occur if MSFT trades at or above $468.35 at any point before January 1, 2025, even as a fleeting intraday high. This could result from:
- A strong rally fueled by bullish sentiment, positive earnings/news, or sector-wide tech momentum;
- MSFT exceeding bullish analyst price targets, which generally project 2024 highs in the $483–$547 range, above the current all-time high[1][3];
- Market optimism about Microsoft's AI and cloud computing growth, as forecast by most analysts[1].

(d) **Scenario for a Yes outcome:**  
A **Yes** resolution requires MSFT to never reach $468.35 before January 1, 2025. This could happen if:
- Recent gains stall out and MSFT consolidates or trades sideways, staying well below the all-time high;
- The market experiences a correction, or negative news dampens tech stock enthusiasm;
- The bearish or neutral technical forecast holds, as some models predict a 90% probability of MSFT staying between $332.66 and $416.49 over the next 3 months[5].

## Rationale

- **Status Quo Weight:**  
Good forecasters emphasize the status quo, as sharp movements often require a new catalyst or shift in market sentiment. The current price is roughly 6% below the all-time high; that gap is not trivial, but neither is it large in the volatile tech sector.

- **Analyst & Technical Signals:**  
Most analyst forecasts for 2024 put MSFT above $468.35 by year-end, with targets between $483–$547[1][3]. The consensus is bullish, based on fundamentals like AI, cloud growth, and acquisitions[1]. However, some technical models currently predict a 90% probability that MSFT finishes the next three months below $416.49, implying a lower likelihood of a breakout unless conditions change[5].  
Recent trading momentum has been positive, but MSFT is not yet close to the high, and the Fear & Greed Index suggests moderate caution in the market[4].

- **Market Environment:**  
Macro risks—including potential market corrections, elevated valuations, or negative shocks—could keep MSFT below its prior high. Conversely, any tech rally or strong quarterly results could push it above.

- **Volatility & Timeframe:**  
MSFT’s historical volatility and the time left (1.5 months) mean a 6% move is plausible but not guaranteed.

## Final Probability Estimate

Weighing the current price, bullish analyst targets, historic volatility, and the technical forecast of a sub-$416.49 finish with 90% probability (though this model could shift if current price holds or climbs[5]), the probability that MSFT **never** hits or exceeds its all-time high of $468.35 before January 1, 2025, is modest.

**Probability: 35%**
