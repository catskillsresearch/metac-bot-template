(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  
There are approximately 20 calendar days remaining until October 1, 2024.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
As of September 11, 2024, there has been no official announcement or confirmation regarding Intel’s removal from the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA)[1][2][5]. If no such announcement or credible reporting occurs before October 1, 2024, the question will resolve as **No**.

(c) **Scenario for a No outcome:**  
- S&P Dow Jones Indices makes no announcement or confirmation of Intel’s removal from the DJIA before October 1, 2024.  
- Speculation and market pressure continue, but the committee decides to delay or forgo any index change until after the deadline.  
- Regardless of persistent rumors, without official word or credible reports of a forthcoming removal, the status quo prevails and the question resolves as No[2][5].

(d) **Scenario for a Yes outcome:**  
- S&P Dow Jones Indices issues an official announcement, or a credible outlet reports with confirmation, that Intel will be removed from the DJIA (at any time, including a future effective date).  
- Such an announcement could occur without advance warning, as index changes are often sudden[2].  
- This would satisfy the question’s criteria, and the question would resolve as Yes.

## Rationale

There is strong and widespread speculation, supported by analysts and credible financial media, that Intel is at significant risk of imminent removal from the DJIA due to its extremely poor stock performance, historically low index weighting, and negative business developments[1][2][5]. The criteria for removal—low share price, lack of index representativeness, and recent precedents of rapid constituent changes—are all present[1][2][5]. 

However, S&P Dow Jones Indices has not yet made any public comment or official announcement regarding Intel’s status[2]. Notably, while index changes are often made quickly and without advance notice, they do not always coincide immediately with periods of speculation, and the index committee is known for its opacity and unpredictability.

Historically, the status quo is the most common short-term outcome, given the relatively infrequent changes to DJIA membership (last occurred in February 2024)[2]. The closer we get to the October 1 deadline without an announcement, the more likely the status quo continues past the cutoff. While the “final push” argument is persuasive and risk is high, **no removal is certain until officially confirmed**.

## Final Answer

Probability: **35%**
