(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  
Assuming Gallup releases its annual Middle East sympathies results in March 2025 as typical, there is approximately 1 month until the outcome is known (today is May 6, 2025; the update was expected in February/March 2025, but for the forecast the relevant judgment would likely have been made by late February or early March).

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
In Gallup’s 2023 World Affairs poll, 54% of Americans said their sympathies were more with the Israelis, the lowest share since 2005, but still above 50%[3][4]. In early 2024, Gallup found favorability toward Israel had dropped to a historic low (58%), but Gallup analysts noted that “sympathies toward the two sides ... were largely unchanged” despite the ongoing conflict[3][4]. Therefore, if current trends continued without further change, 50% or more of respondents would continue to express greater sympathy for Israelis.

(c) **Scenario for a No outcome (under 50% express sympathies for Israelis):**  
A significant, rapid shift in American public opinion would have to occur. This could be triggered by:
- Major new revelations or incidents in the Israel-Gaza conflict that sharply erode support for Israel among moderates and independents.
- A strong and sustained campaign in U.S. media/politics reframing the narrative to be significantly more sympathetic to Palestinians.
- Continued or worsening partisan polarization, especially if Democratic support for Palestinians grows further and Republican support for Israel stagnates or softens.
- A general trend of declining support for foreign interventions or allies, exacerbated by domestic concerns.

(d) **Scenario for a Yes outcome (50% or more sympathize with Israelis):**  
The public opinion landscape remains largely stable, continuing a long-term trend of Americans expressing greater sympathy for Israelis, even as criticism of Israeli government actions and favorability ratings fluctuate. Sympathy might be somewhat reduced from previous years but remains above the 50% threshold. This could be reinforced if:
- The situation in Gaza moves toward de-escalation or peace, reducing negative media coverage of Israeli actions.
- No dramatic new developments shift public focus or sentiment before the survey is fielded.
- Core supporters of Israel remain strongly aligned while opposition is split or undecided, preventing Palestinians from overtaking Israelis in public sympathy[3].

**Rationale:**  
Gallup’s most recent commentary (late 2024) states that although Americans’ favorable ratings of both Israel and the Palestinian Authority declined during the Israel-Hamas war, “their sympathies toward the two sides ... were largely unchanged,” with the majority continuing to express more sympathy for Israelis[3][4]. The relevant question has shown a slow, multi-year downward drift, but not enough to cross the 50% threshold in the last available data. Public opinion in this area tends to change gradually absent major, unprecedented events.

Negative trends for Israel in related Gallup measures (e.g., favorability, approval of actions in Gaza) do raise the risk that sympathy could eventually fall below 50%, especially if partisan realignment accelerates. However, the status quo baseline—where a slim majority still express sympathy for Israelis—is likely to prevail unless a substantial, disruptive event occurs within the brief remaining window before the 2025 survey.
