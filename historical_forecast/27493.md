(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  
The August 2024 US core CPI data will be released by the BLS on September 11, 2024. As today is August 22, there are approximately 20 days left until the official outcome is published[2].

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
The most recent month-over-month (MoM) readings for core CPI were 0.2% in both June and July 2024[4]. Leading forecasters (e.g., Philadelphia Fed Survey) expect Q3 2024 annualized core CPI at 2.6%, which implies a typical monthly rate of around 0.21%, well below the 0.5% threshold[1]. In the absence of a significant change, the status quo expectation is that core CPI MoM will remain in the 0.2%–0.3% range.

(c) **Brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome:**  
Core CPI rises less than 0.5% month-over-month in August 2024—consistent with recent trends, professional forecasts, and ongoing moderation in shelter and services inflation[4][1]. No major economic shock or supply-side disruption occurs. Shelter costs continue to contribute to inflation, but not enough to push MoM core CPI above 0.5%. Fed policy remains restrictive and effective at containing price pressures.

(d) **Brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome:**  
Core CPI rises 0.5% or more month-over-month in August 2024 due to an unexpected and significant event, such as:
- A sudden supply chain disruption affecting a major non-energy sector (e.g., auto parts, shelter, healthcare).
- An unanticipated surge in shelter, medical, or other core service prices.
- A large, broad-based increase in goods prices unrelated to food and energy.

There are currently no indications of such developments[4][1].

## Rationale

Recent inflation data and forecasts demonstrate a consistent trend of cooling price pressures. Both June and July 2024 showed MoM core CPI readings at 0.2%[4], and the Philadelphia Fed’s Survey of Professional Forecasters projects core CPI to rise at an annualized rate of 2.6% in Q3 2024—translating to a monthly increase of roughly 0.21%[1]. This is far below the 0.5% threshold in question.

Core CPI would require a sharp, outsized jump in prices—more than doubling recent monthly rates—to reach or exceed 0.5%. No forecast from a major survey, nor real-time nowcasting resources, predicts such a spike for August 2024. Furthermore, the drivers behind July’s CPI—such as shelter and vehicle insurance—while sticky, have not exhibited the momentum or volatility required to produce a 0.5% MoM core CPI result, even in the face of ongoing high rents[4].

Finally, there have been no reports of major policy changes, international shocks, or domestic disruptions on the horizon that would plausibly cause a one-month surge of this magnitude. Given the structural inertia in core CPI and the absence of acute catalysts, the status quo and the slow-moving nature of inflation trends should be given significant weight in the forecast.

**Probability: 5%**

A 0.5% or higher MoM increase in US core CPI for August 2024 is highly unlikely barring a major, unforeseen shock. The best estimate, based on all available data, is that the actual MoM core CPI will be in the 0.2–0.3% range[1][4].
