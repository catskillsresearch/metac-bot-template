(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known: Approximately 7 months. Pantone's Color of the Year for 2025 is expected to be announced on December 5, 2024, which is about 7 months from today (May 6, 2025).

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed: Based on recent history, green has not been the Color of the Year since 2017's "Greenery." The most recent colors have been orange (Peach Fuzz), red (Viva Magenta), blue (Very Peri), gray/yellow, and blue again.

(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome: Pantone selects a warm brown like "Mocha Mousse" or a purple/plum shade like "Cinnamon Slate" as mentioned in several predictions, continuing the trend toward warm, comforting colors but outside the green hue range.

(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome: Pantone selects "White Grape" (Pantone 14-0442 TCX), the zingy green shade that appeared in both London and New York Fashion Week palettes, reflecting growing interest in fresh, nature-inspired colors.

Based on the search results and current color trend information, there are several factors that suggest green could be the 2025 Pantone Color of the Year, though there is still significant uncertainty.

The most compelling evidence for green comes from VeriVide's prediction highlighting "White Grape" (14-0442 TCX), which is described as "a zingy green shade reminiscent of the first leaves of Spring"[4]. This color appears in both the London and New York Fashion Week color palettes for Spring/Summer 2025, making it the only shade to bridge both influential fashion markets[4].

However, there are competing predictions suggesting other color families. The Nord Room's analysis indicates that "deep green" is among several trending colors for 2025, alongside earthy orange, gold, purple, and light blue[2]. Meanwhile, Young House Love reports that Pantone has already selected "Mocha Mousse" as their 2025 Color of the Year, describing it as a warm brown that "fits right within the trend of warm browns"[3]. This suggests that brown tones may have already won out over greens.

Looking at historical patterns, Pantone hasn't selected a green as Color of the Year since "Greenery" in 2017, suggesting we may be due for a return to this color family. However, Pantone often surprises with unexpected selections that reflect broader cultural moods.

The color trends for 2025 seem to emphasize "richer and calmer" colors with "a beautiful variety of hues"[2]. While green is mentioned as part of these palettes, there's equal emphasis on warm browns, purples, and earthy tones that create "inviting spaces"[2]. Benjamin Moore has already selected "Cinnamon Slate" for their 2025 Color of the Year, described as a mix of "heathered plum" and "velvety brown"[3].

Despite the uncertainty, the appearance of "White Grape" in both major fashion week palettes gives green a stronger chance than might be expected from recent historical patterns. Given the HSV criteria for this question (75 â‰¤ H < 165 qualifying as green), even a yellow-green or blue-green shade would qualify.

Considering all factors, including the prominence of "White Grape" in fashion forecasts, the ongoing trend toward nature-inspired colors, and the fact that green hasn't been selected in several years, green appears to have a moderate chance of being the 2025 Pantone Color of the Year.
