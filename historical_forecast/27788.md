(a) **Time until outcome is known:**  
Tesla is expected to report Q3 2024 deliveries around October 2, 2024. As of August 29, 2024, this is about five weeks away.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
If Tesla maintains its Q2 2024 delivery level (443,956 vehicles) into Q3, the outcome would be **No** (no increase).

(c) **Scenario for No outcome:**  
A “No” outcome occurs if Q3 2024 deliveries are 443,956 vehicles or fewer. This could happen if production or demand stagnates due to modest global EV demand, persistent inventory build-up, supply chain issues, or weaker Model Y/3 sales in major markets. Some forecasters expect deliveries in Q3 to be quite similar to Q2, with only modest improvement at best[2][5].

(d) **Scenario for Yes outcome:**  
A “Yes” outcome occurs if Tesla delivers more than 443,956 vehicles in Q3 2024. This scenario is supported by:
- Strong production rates at the Shanghai factory, reportedly operating near capacity in August and September[1].
- High inventory at the end of Q2 for some models, potentially allowing for higher Q3 deliveries if demand materializes[2][5].
- Some independent forecasts suggest Q3 deliveries could approach 500,000, though most expect a modest increase over Q2[1][5].

## Rationale

Good forecasters weight the status quo heavily, as large quarter-to-quarter swings without a compelling catalyst are relatively rare. However, Tesla’s recovery from a poor Q1 2024, a production uptick at key factories, and high starting inventory moderately favor a small increase in Q3 deliveries. Most public forecasts suggest Q3 2024 will be flat to modestly higher than Q2 2024, with significant upside unlikely unless market demand or logistics outperform expectations[1][2][5].

- Shanghai’s continued high output and the potential to utilize existing inventory support a possible increase.
- However, the absence of major new products, incentives, or demand drivers tempers the likelihood of a dramatic rise.
- If Q3 matches Q2, the answer is “No.” If there is even a small sequential increase, the answer is “Yes.”

Given these factors, the probability of a small increase (i.e., a “Yes” resolution) slightly outweighs the risk of a flat or down quarter due to production momentum and inventory resources, but only modestly.
