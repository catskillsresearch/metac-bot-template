(a) Time left until outcome is known: 39 days (from today, August 22, 2024, until October 1, 2024)

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: No nuclear weapon detonation by Russia in Ukraine or Ukrainian-held territory

(c) Scenario resulting in No outcome: Russia continues to use conventional military means to respond to Ukraine's Kursk incursion, potentially escalating conventional attacks on Ukrainian infrastructure and military targets, while maintaining nuclear weapons as a deterrent without actual use.

(d) Scenario resulting in Yes outcome: Facing significant territorial losses in Kursk Oblast and potential Ukrainian advances threatening critical Russian infrastructure, Putin decides to demonstrate Russia's resolve by authorizing a tactical nuclear strike against Ukrainian forces in occupied Russian territory or within Ukraine proper to force a Ukrainian withdrawal and deter further Western support.

I'm assessing the likelihood of Russia detonating a nuclear weapon in Ukraine or Ukrainian-held territory before October 1, 2024. This requires careful analysis of recent developments, Russian nuclear doctrine, and the strategic context.

## Recent Developments

The Ukrainian incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast beginning August 6, 2024, represents a significant escalation in the conflict. By August 15, Ukrainian forces had advanced approximately 35 kilometers into Russian territory and established control over roughly one thousand square kilometers of land in Kursk Oblast[4]. This operation marks the first time Ukrainian army units have crossed the border into Russia since the beginning of the conflict.

Despite this direct incursion into Russian territory, Moscow has notably refrained from nuclear saber-rattling in response[5]. This absence of nuclear threats is particularly significant given Putin's previous statements that Russia would use nuclear weapons when faced with threats to "sovereignty and territorial integrity"[1].

## Russia's Nuclear Posture

In June 2024, Putin indicated potential changes to Russia's nuclear doctrine while maintaining that nuclear weapons would only be used in "exceptional casesâ€¦when there is a threat to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country." However, he refused to "rule out the possibility of making changes to this doctrine"[1].

Putin has made several direct and indirect nuclear threats throughout the conflict, particularly in contexts of military setbacks and NATO support for Ukraine[1]. In May 2024, he ordered tactical nuclear weapon drills in response to perceived NATO threats, marking the first public announcement of such exercises.

Russia possesses an estimated 1,000-2,000 tactical nuclear weapons designed for battlefield use. These smaller-yield weapons are intended for specific targets, even with friendly forces in proximity.

## Strategic Analysis

The Ukrainian operation in Kursk has created what some observers describe as "a full-blown crisis for the Kremlin"[5]. However, the lack of nuclear threats in response suggests that Putin's previous "red lines" regarding nuclear use may have been primarily intended as deterrence rather than actual triggers for nuclear deployment.

There are practical limitations to using nuclear weapons on Russian territory currently occupied by Ukrainian forces, as noted by one analysis: "it would hardly help him to drop a nuke on Russian territory, after all"[5]. Such an action would cause catastrophic damage to Russia's own land and potentially expose Russian citizens to radiation.

## Status Quo Bias and Historical Precedent

Nuclear weapons have not been used in warfare since 1945. This 79-year precedent creates an extremely strong status quo against nuclear weapons use. The international taboo against nuclear weapons has proven remarkably resilient through numerous conflicts, including several that directly involved nuclear powers.

Russia has consistently used nuclear threats as a form of strategic signaling and deterrence rather than as actions it intends to implement. When analyzed in context, Putin's statements about nuclear weapons appear designed to influence Western decision-making regarding support for Ukraine rather than telegraph actual plans for nuclear use.

## Factors Decreasing Likelihood of Nuclear Use

1. The absence of nuclear threats following the Ukrainian incursion into Kursk Oblast suggests previous "red lines" may have been primarily rhetorical.

2. Using nuclear weapons would risk unprecedented international isolation and potentially direct Western military intervention.

3. Russia continues to have conventional military options available to respond to the Ukrainian incursion.

4. The tactical disadvantages of using nuclear weapons on Russian territory currently occupied by Ukrainian forces.

5. The extremely strong historical precedent against nuclear weapons use in warfare.

## Factors Increasing Likelihood of Nuclear Use

1. Putin's recent statements about potentially changing Russia's nuclear doctrine.

2. The unprecedented nature of the Ukrainian incursion into Russian territory.

3. Russia's demonstrated willingness to conduct tactical nuclear weapon drills.

4. The potential for the conflict to escalate further in the coming weeks, potentially creating what Russia might perceive as an existential threat.

## Conclusion

The available evidence strongly suggests that Russia is unlikely to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine or Ukrainian-held territory before October 1, 2024. Despite the unprecedented Ukrainian incursion into Russian territory, Moscow has not issued nuclear threats in response. The practical limitations of using nuclear weapons on territory occupied by Ukrainian forces, combined with the catastrophic international consequences of breaking the nuclear taboo, make such an action highly improbable in the near term.

While Putin has made concerning statements about potentially changing Russia's nuclear doctrine, actions speak louder than words, and Russia's actions thus far indicate a continued adherence to the status quo of non-use. The historical precedent against nuclear weapons use provides an extremely strong prior probability that Russia will continue to refrain from nuclear use.

Given the extremely strong status quo against nuclear weapons use, the absence of nuclear threats following the Ukrainian incursion into Russian territory, and the significant strategic disadvantages Russia would face from using nuclear weapons, I assess the probability as very low.

Probability: 3%
