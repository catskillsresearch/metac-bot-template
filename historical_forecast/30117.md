(a) **Time Until Outcome**  
The Pantone 2025 Color of the Year is scheduled to be announced on December 5, 2024. Assuming today's date is November 15, 2024 (the context cutoff), the outcome will be known in about 3 weeks.

(b) **Status Quo Outcome if Nothing Changed**  
Based on all available 2025 color trend forecasts and expert predictions, the most probable outcome is that orange will **not** be the closest color to the 2025 Pantone Color of the Year. The consensus places greater likelihood on warm browns (such as “Mocha Mousse”), muted earth tones, or possibly a fresh green like “White Grape”[2][3][4].

(c) **Scenario for a No Outcome**  
Pantone selects a color whose hue falls outside of the orange range (HSV H < 15 or H ≥ 45), such as:
- A warm brown shade like “Mocha Mousse” (closer to yellow or brown than orange)
- A fresh green, muted purple, or blue
- Any other color whose hue is not between 15 and 45 degrees in HSV[2][3][4]

(d) **Scenario for a Yes Outcome**  
Pantone selects a color whose hue is between 15 and 45 degrees in HSV (i.e., orange to yellow-orange). This could be a true orange, peach, or warm orange-brown shade that falls within this hue range (as “Peach Fuzz” did in 2024 or “Living Coral” in 2019)[2].

## Rationale

Historical precedent shows Pantone alternates across the color spectrum but tends to avoid highly similar shades in consecutive years. With “Peach Fuzz” (an orange) chosen for 2024, the typical pattern would suggest a less likely repeat for orange-dominant hues in 2025. Although deep, earthy oranges are present in 2025 palettes, they are generally noted as supporting rather than leading colors. Key industry forecasts overwhelmingly predict either:
- Warm brown (“Mocha Mousse” is specifically cited as Pantone’s likely pick[3])
- Zingy green (“White Grape” appears in both leading palette reports[1][4])
- Other muted earth tones, with much less emphasis on pure or dominant orange shades[2][3][4]

Given that the HSV range for resolution (15 ≤ H < 45) is quite strict, even brown shades are unlikely to resolve as "Orange" unless they skew heavily orange. Trend momentum, expert consensus, and Pantone’s own signals all suggest the color of the year will fall just outside the official “orange” hue spectrum.

Forecasters should place extra weight on the status quo (that orange will not be the closest color), especially since Pantone rarely picks similar hues in consecutive years and orange just won in 2024.
