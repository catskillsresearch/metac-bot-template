(a) Time left until the outcome is known:  
The question asks for the number of registered Syrian refugees in Turkey on April 1, 2025. Since today is May 6, 2025, the outcome date has passed by about one month, so the actual data should now be available or soon will be officially published.

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed:  
As of late 2023 and early 2024, the number of registered Syrian refugees in Turkey was approximately between 3.2 million to 3.47 million[2][5]. If no significant changes occurred, the number on April 1, 2025, should be near this range.

(c) Outcome if the current trend continued:  
The number of registered Syrian refugees under temporary protection in Turkey has been relatively stable or slowly growing, given Turkey's ongoing hosting role and no major reported returns or deportations on mass scale since 2022, although some deportations have occurred[5]. The count may therefore be expected to be slightly above 3.4 million, possibly up to about 3.5 million–3.6 million by April 2025, assuming incremental growth or stability.

(d) Expectations of experts and markets:  
Experts monitoring the Syrian refugee situation and Turkey's policy typically anticipate a stable or mildly increasing refugee population due to ongoing conflict instability in Syria and Turkey’s open-border and temporary protection policies. No official forecast by UNHCR for April 1, 2025, seems published yet, but estimates hover around 3.2 to 3.5 million registered Syrians[1][2][5].

(e) Unexpected scenario resulting in a low outcome:  
A significant unexpected scenario that could lead to a lower number of registered Syrian refugees would be a large-scale voluntary or forced return to Syria, or sudden deportations by Turkish authorities beyond currently reported limited cases, or a closure of registration and protections reducing official counts. Political changes in Turkey or regional stabilization could also reduce refugee numbers dramatically.

(f) Unexpected scenario resulting in a high outcome:  
Conversely, a sudden large influx of new Syrian refugees fleeing heightened conflict or persecution in Syria or neighboring areas, or expanded registration efforts capturing previously unregistered refugees would raise the count above current numbers significantly, possibly above 3.6 million.

**Final estimate reflecting wide uncertainty and plausible range:**

Percentile 10: 3,200,000  
Percentile 20: 3,300,000  
Percentile 40: 3,400,000  
Percentile 60: 3,500,000  
Percentile 80: 3,600,000  
Percentile 90: 3,700,000

This range accommodates the recent historic data and uncertainties about registration changes or population movements up to April 1, 2025[1][2][5].
