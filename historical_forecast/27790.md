(a) Time left until outcome: 147 days (from May 6, 2025, until September 30, 2024, which has already passed)
(b) Status quo outcome: No announcement of GPT-5 has been made as of the available information
(c) Scenario for No outcome: OpenAI continues focusing on optimizing GPT-4 and GPT-4o, delays GPT-5 announcement until after September 2024 due to training complexities or strategic reasons
(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: OpenAI accelerates its timeline, completes safety testing earlier than expected, and announces GPT-5 with performance results before September 30, 2024

Based on the search results and the current date (May 6, 2025), I can provide a retrospective analysis of whether OpenAI announced GPT-5 before September 30, 2024.

Looking at the information available before August 29, 2024, there were mixed signals about GPT-5's release timeline. In March 2024, Business Insider reported that OpenAI was on track to release GPT-5 "sometime mid-year, likely during summer," with some enterprise customers already receiving demos[1]. The report mentioned that people familiar with the company indicated a summer 2024 release was planned.

However, by June 2024, contradicting reports emerged suggesting that GPT-5 might not be released until 2025[2]. This represented a significant shift from earlier expectations.

By August 5, 2024, OpenAI seemed to be tempering expectations, with an OpenAI spokesperson explicitly stating, "We're not planning to announce our next model at DevDay"[3]. This statement directly contradicted earlier speculation about a summer or fall 2024 announcement.

The question specifically requires OpenAI to publish a document announcing GPT-5's existence and describing some performance results. The evidence available before August 29, 2024, showed increasing signs that OpenAI was pushing back the timeline for GPT-5's announcement.

Several factors likely contributed to this delay:

1. Safety testing and "red teaming" processes might have taken longer than anticipated
2. OpenAI's May 2024 release of GPT-4o may have shifted their focus to supporting this model before moving to the next major version
3. Strategic considerations about market timing and competitive positioning

As a forecaster, I must give significant weight to the status quo - that no announcement had been made as of August 29, 2024, despite earlier predictions of a summer release. The explicit statement from OpenAI that they were not planning to announce their next model at DevDay (which would have occurred before September 30) is particularly strong evidence.

While there was always a possibility of a surprise announcement in September 2024, the trajectory of information showed OpenAI moving away from, rather than toward, an imminent GPT-5 announcement.

Probability: 15%
