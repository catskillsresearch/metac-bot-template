(a) **Time left until outcome is known**  
As of October 25, 2024, there are 7 days until November 1, 2024. The outcome will be clear within a week.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed**  
The Federal Reserve last cut the federal funds rate on September 18, 2024, moving it to 4.75%-5.00%[1]. There have been no indications from the FOMC that another meeting or policy statement is scheduled between now and November 1. If nothing changes, and no unscheduled meeting occurs, the rate will remain unchanged through October, resulting in a "No" outcome.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome**  
- The Fed holds no additional meetings or issues no further policy statements announcing a rate cut between September 30 and October 31, 2024.
- Economic data remains stable or even runs "hot," as suggested by recent inflation and labor reports, reducing pressure for an emergency cut[3].
- Market expectations, already pushing back further rate cuts, prove correct[3].
- The Fed maintains its current data-driven, cautious approach.

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome**  
- The Fed calls an emergency, unscheduled FOMC meeting in the last week of October in response to a sudden financial shock, crisis, or unexpectedly severe economic downturn.
- At this meeting, the Fed announces a reduction in the target federal funds rate range before November 1, 2024.

## Rationale

The September 18, 2024, rate cut marked the first easing in four years, justified by improved inflation dynamics and a slowing labor market[1]. The FOMC's latest statement and the available projections from June suggest the committee only foresaw a single cut for all of 2024 as of midyear[5]. More recent economic data underscore ongoing strength in employment and slightly elevated inflation, leading markets to push back their expectations for further cuts[3].

Additionally, there is no publicly scheduled October FOMC meeting after September 30 and before November 1, 2024. The only plausible scenario for a rate cut in this window would be an emergency meetingâ€”a rare event, which typically only occurs in response to extraordinary, negative economic or financial shocks. There are currently no such events or warnings in the public record[3].

Given the lack of any scheduled FOMC meetings and the absence of a crisis that would provoke an emergency session, the base rate (status quo) heavily favors no additional cuts in this period. Historical precedent also shows that inter-meeting emergency rate cuts are infrequent in relatively stable environments.

## Final Answer

**Probability: 5%**

While not impossible, the probability that the Federal Reserve will announce another rate cut between September 30 and November 1, 2024, is very low barring an unforeseen economic shock. The absence of a scheduled meeting and current economic trends suggest the status quo will prevail[1][3][5].
