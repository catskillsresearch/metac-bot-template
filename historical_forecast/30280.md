(a) Time until outcome: About 7 months (May 6, 2025 to January 1, 2025)
(b) Status quo outcome: No bankruptcy filing (AMC continues to operate)
(c) No scenario: AMC successfully extends debt maturities, box office recovery provides improved cash flow, and continued equity raises provide enough liquidity to avoid bankruptcy
(d) Yes scenario: Box office performance remains weak, debt refinancing options exhaust, cash reserves deplete, and creditors become unwilling to extend further credit

Based on the search results provided, I can offer a comprehensive analysis of AMC's bankruptcy risk before January 1, 2025.

AMC Entertainment has been navigating significant financial challenges in recent years, but several factors suggest bankruptcy before 2025 is unlikely. CEO Adam Aron has repeatedly and publicly dismissed the notion of imminent bankruptcy, stating in April 2024 that bankruptcy is "inconceivable" and that the company will "continue to avoid bankruptcy" as it has for the past four years since the pandemic[3][4].

More concretely, AMC announced collaborative refinancing transactions in July 2024 that extend up to $2.45 billion of debt maturities from 2026 to 2029 and beyond[2]. This successful debt restructuring provides AMC with breathing room for its near-term obligations. The company may also issue an additional $50 million of new exchangeable notes to repurchase debt maturities in 2025, 2026, and 2027[2], further reducing near-term bankruptcy risk.

While AMC's 10-K filing did acknowledge bankruptcy risk if they cannot restructure their debt, the company has consistently demonstrated an ability to find creative financial solutions. Their primary strategy has been to continuously issue and sell new shares to raise needed cash[5], which has been effective thus far despite the dilution impact on existing shareholders.

Looking at industry projections, Adam Aron has expressed optimism about box office performance in 2025, which would improve AMC's cash flow situation[3]. He predicts that theater-going will "perk up in 2025 and beyond"[4], potentially alleviating some financial pressure.

The company's lenders have shown confidence in AMC's future, as evidenced by their willingness to extend debt maturities. Adam Aron characterized the refinancing agreement as "an undeniably strong vote of confidence by our lenders in AMC's future"[2].

That said, AMC's financial situation remains precarious. The company continues to face significant debt challenges and has relied heavily on equity raises to avoid bankruptcy. If market conditions deteriorate significantly or if investor appetite for AMC shares suddenly dries up, the company could face more immediate bankruptcy pressure.

Given the successful debt maturity extensions into 2029 and beyond, management's confident public statements, lender support, anticipated box office improvement in 2025, and demonstrated ability to raise capital through equity sales, bankruptcy before January 1, 2025 appears unlikely though not impossible.

Probability: 15%
