(a) **Time left until outcome:**  
As of September 20, 2024, there are 10 days until the September 30, 2024 resolution date.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
The US national average retail price of regular gasoline is currently well above $3.00 per gallon. As of April 2024, the price was $3.62 per gallon[4]. Throughout the summer of 2024, the average has hovered around $3.50 to $3.70[2][4]. No credible forecast projects an imminent and sustained drop below $3.00 before the end of September.

(c) **Scenario that results in a No outcome (gas stays above $3.00):**  
- Continued strong consumer demand through the end of the summer driving season.
- Brent crude prices rising, as forecasted by the EIA, with late 2024 projections in the $82–83/bbl range supporting elevated gasoline prices[1].
- Limited refinery disruptions, meaning no sudden supply glut or collapse in demand.
- Typical regional and seasonal price moderation, but insufficient to push the national average below $3.00.

(d) **Scenario that results in a Yes outcome (gas drops below $3.00):**  
- An unexpected and sharp drop in global oil prices, for example due to a major economic downturn or demand destruction.
- A dramatic surge in refining capacity or inventory, causing a supply glut.
- Severe, extended demand reduction caused by economic shocks or policy interventions.
- A major, price-suppressing event globally (e.g., breakthrough peace in key oil-producing regions leading to oil oversupply).

## Rationale

The current trajectory, supported by government forecasts and industry analysis, points strongly toward gas prices remaining above $3.00 through the end of September 2024. The EIA forecasts average prices of $3.70 per gallon for May–September 2024, with no base-case scenario in which retail gas prices approach $3.00 during this period[2]. Futures and industry analysts similarly see prices sustained well above the $3.00 mark, with autumn averages in the $3.11–$3.35 range[5].

Seasonal declines after the summer driving season may pull prices down, but the decline required from current levels would be extreme—roughly a 15% drop in less than two weeks. The most optimistic September 2024 gas price forecasts in public modeling show a minimum of $2.73 and an average of $3.11[5], suggesting a sub-$3.00 national average is possible, but only under lower-probability scenarios.

Recent EIA and industry analysis also points to tightening supply or rising global oil prices into Q4 2024[1], which would tend to keep prices elevated. Risks to the downside (rapid price drop) appear limited and would require exogenous shocks, not currently forecast.

Given the inertia of retail gasoline pricing and limited time for change, the base case (status quo) should be strongly weighted.

**Probability: 10%**
- There is a small but non-zero chance that a sharp, short-term decline in crude oil or a rapid loosening in refined product supply could briefly drive the average under $3.00, but this is not the expectation of authoritative forecasts or the current market[1][2][4][5].
