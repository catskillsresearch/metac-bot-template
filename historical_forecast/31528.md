As a professional forecaster, I'll approach this question systematically:

(a) Time until outcome is known: 17 days. The Doomsday Clock announcement is scheduled for January 28, 2025, at 10:00 a.m. EST, and today is January 11, 2025.

(b) Status quo outcome: The Doomsday Clock remains at 90 seconds to midnight. This has been its position since January 2023, and was reaffirmed in January 2024.

(c) Unexpected outcome scenario: An unexpected de-escalation of major global conflicts or a breakthrough international climate agreement in early January 2025 could cause the Science and Security Board to move the clock back to 100 or more seconds to midnight. Alternatively, a sudden escalation in nuclear threats or a major climate disaster could push the clock even closer to midnight, perhaps to 60 seconds or less.

## Rationale for My Forecast

The Doomsday Clock has remained at 90 seconds to midnight since January 2023, which represents the closest it has ever been to symbolic apocalypse. This position was maintained in January 2024, with the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists specifically noting that "not enough progress has been made to move the hands back."[3]

Looking at historical patterns, the Doomsday Clock tends to move slowly. In recent years, it has predominantly moved closer to midnight rather than further away, reflecting deteriorating global security conditions. Since 2017, the clock has only moved in increments of 30 seconds or less per year.

The current 90-second setting primarily reflects concerns about:
- Russia's invasion of Ukraine and increased risk of nuclear escalation
- Ongoing climate crisis
- Breakdown of global norms and institutions
- Threats from disruptive technologies and biosecurity issues[5]

For the clock to move significantly in either direction, we would need to see substantial changes in these areas. As of January 11, 2025, there are no major indications of such dramatic shifts in global security.

The Bulletin's Science and Security Board has scheduled their announcement for January 28, 2025[1], and there is no pre-announcement information available. This is consistent with their standard practice of keeping the decision confidential until the formal announcement.

I note that there appears to be a conflicting data point in the search results where one source claims the clock will be at 89 seconds to midnight in 2025[2][4]. However, this appears to be either speculative or incorrect, as the official announcement from the Bulletin has not yet occurred, and their most recent confirmed position is 90 seconds.

Given the historical inertia of the Doomsday Clock and the absence of dramatic positive developments in global security, I assign the highest probability to the status quo outcome. However, I must account for possible changes based on events that may have occurred after my knowledge cutoff date.
