(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
There are about two months left until April 1, 2025.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
As of January 31, 2025, Mike Johnson remains the Speaker of the US House of Representatives. He narrowly won reelection at the start of the 119th Congress after initial defections, but secured the position with support from key Republicans and endorsement by Donald Trump[2][4]. There are no active, credible reports of an imminent ouster as of the current cutoff date.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
No motion to vacate the speakership succeeds and Johnson continues as Speaker through April 1, 2025, either because the GOP maintains internal discipline, Trump’s backing deters further revolts, or Democrats do not join a challenge[2][3][4].

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
A new internal crisis or shift in GOP dynamics—such as further alienation of hard-right members, a breakdown over spending or impeachment, or a strategic move by factional leaders—leads to a successful motion to vacate the chair. This could occur if key backers withdraw support, if scandals emerge, or if political calculations shift in such a way that Johnson is ousted before April 1, 2025[3][4].

**Rationale:**  
Historical precedent shows that House Speakers are rarely ousted mid-session; Kevin McCarthy’s 2023 removal was an extraordinary event that illustrates what’s possible, but also how unusual it is. Recent reporting indicates Mike Johnson’s position is precarious but stabilized by strong support from Donald Trump and a recent, though narrow, reelection[2][3][4]. The GOP’s right flank remains dissatisfied, but as of the cutoff, they lack the numbers to remove him and there is no evidence of an organized coup underway[3].  
While internal divisions and the threat of a motion to vacate persist, the status quo—Johnson remaining Speaker—is a resilient outcome, especially with Trump’s backing acting as a unifying force. Near-term triggers (such as a government shutdown or major legislative defeat) could destabilize his position, but absent such events documented before the cutoff, the slow-changing nature of congressional leadership should be given greater weight.

**Probability: 80%**
