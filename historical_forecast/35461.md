(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
From February 27, 2025 (today) until April 1, 2025 is 33 days.

(b) **Outcome if nothing changed:**  
The latest widely reported case count is 597 as of February 18, 2025[2]. However, there are indications in other sources that the count may have risen further (e.g., up to 90 cases in South Plains region alone as of February 21[5]). If we use the officially confirmed statewide figure from February 18 (597), and assume no new cases are reported, the outcome would be **597 cases**.

(c) **Outcome if the current trend continued:**  
Between early February and mid-February, the outbreak accelerated rapidly: from 58 cases (Feb 18[4]) to 597 cases (Feb 18[2]) due to a likely reporting lag, then more localized counts add up to 90 as of February 21 just in South Plains counties[5]. Outbreaks of highly contagious diseases like measles can grow rapidly, especially when immunization is low and containment is ineffective. However, with large-scale public health responses, growth rates typically slow over time as awareness, isolation, and vaccination ramp up.

Assuming conservative linear growth (using 597 on Feb 18 as baseline), and if cases continued to accumulate at the same rate seen in early February (about 36 new cases per day over about 17 days), this would add roughly 1,188 new cases by April 1. This would suggest a rough upper-bound around **1,785 cases** (597 + 1,188).

However, such escalations are rarely perfectly linear as containment measures are implemented. On the other hand, if the outbreak follows previously observed boom-and-bust dynamics—with sudden reporting surges—it’s possible a dramatic spike could still occur, especially after spring break.

(d) **Expectations of experts and markets:**  
- Health authorities expect additional cases due to the high contagiousness of measles, the clustering of unvaccinated communities, and potential exposure during spring break[2][4][5].
- However, the implementation of exclusions from school and public places, along with rising public awareness, are likely to slow the rate of increase over time.
- There is no indication from expert or market commentary that the outbreak is on the verge of exponential catastrophic growth, but they consistently caution that "more cases are expected"[4][5].

(e) **Unexpected scenario resulting in a low outcome:**  
A rapid and effective public health intervention is launched (emergency clinics, strict isolation, public compliance with vaccination), and the outbreak is contained abruptly. Reporting delays are resolved, and the final tally barely increases from February, leading to a total number only slightly above the mid-February figure (e.g., **around 650 cases**).

(f) **Unexpected scenario resulting in a high outcome:**  
Significant undetected spread during spring break, especially in unvaccinated populations, triggers a large secondary wave. Public health messaging is insufficient or delayed, or further outbreaks occur in major urban centers, pushing the total count above **2,000 cases** by April 1.
