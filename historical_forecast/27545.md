(a) Time until outcome: Approximately 39 days (from May 6, 2025 to October 1, 2024)
(b) Status quo outcome: "No" - CDC continues to assess the risk as "Very Low"
(c) No outcome scenario: No clade I mpox cases are detected in the US through September 30, 2024, and robust surveillance and preparedness measures remain effective at preventing domestic transmission.
(d) Yes outcome scenario: Clade I mpox cases are imported to the US and limited domestic transmission occurs, prompting CDC to elevate the risk assessment to "Low" or higher in a published document before October 1, 2024.

Based on the information provided, I need to forecast whether the CDC will raise its risk assessment for mpox from "Very Low" to a higher level before October 1, 2024. Let me analyze this systematically.

As of the search results from August 2024, the CDC's most recent qualitative assessment (July 8, 2024) rated the risk to the US general population as "Very Low." This represents the status quo that would need to change for a "Yes" outcome.

Several important factors suggest the risk assessment will likely remain "Very Low":

1. No domestic cases of clade I mpox have been reported in the US as of August 23, 2024[1]. The CDC explicitly states, "there are no known cases in the United States at this time."

2. The CDC's Health Alert Network notice from August 7, 2024 specifically states that "the risk of clade I mpox spreading to the United States is very low at this time"[2].

3. The US has implemented substantial preparedness measures, including expanded surveillance, diagnostic testing capacity, and vaccination recommendations[1]. These measures reduce the likelihood of undetected spread.

4. The European CDC similarly assessed the risk to the EU/EEA general population as "low" based on "very low likelihood and a low impact"[4], providing an international benchmark.

However, there are factors that could lead to an increased risk assessment:

1. The WHO declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on August 14, 2024[1][5], indicating significant international concern about the outbreak.

2. The CDC noted it is "working to update our July 8, 2024, risk assessment" specifically in response to the spread of clade I mpox in Africa[1]. This indicates they are actively reevaluating the situation.

3. The US continues to see low but steady transmission of clade IIb mpox, with 1,700 new cases reported between January and August 10, 2024[5]. This ongoing domestic transmission of a different clade could increase concern if clade I is introduced.

4. International travel continues, creating pathways for potential importation of cases.

That said, the CDC's risk assessment framework considers both likelihood and impact. For the risk level to exceed "Very Low," either the likelihood of infection would need to increase from "extremely low" to at least "low," or the impact would need to increase from "very low" to at least "moderate." 

Given the robust surveillance and response measures in place and the absence of domestic clade I cases as of August 23, 2024, it seems unlikely that either component would increase substantially enough to raise the overall risk level before October 1, 2024 (approximately 39 days from the current date).

The status quo typically has strong inertia in forecasting scenarios, particularly for short timeframes. Without evidence of domestic transmission or a significant change in the virus characteristics, the most probable outcome is that the risk assessment will remain "Very Low."

Probability: 18%
