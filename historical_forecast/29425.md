(a) Time left until outcome: Approximately 26 days until the Namibian presidential election scheduled for November 27, 2024.

(b) Status quo outcome: Based on the 2019 election, SWAPO's candidate received 56% of the vote. If this trend continues, Nandi-Ndaitwah would receive slightly above 55%.

(c) No outcome scenario: SWAPO's declining electoral performance continues and accelerates. Opposition candidates, particularly Panduleni Itula who received 30% in 2019, consolidate anti-incumbent sentiment. Economic challenges and desire for change push Nandi-Ndaitwah below the 55% threshold, possibly to around 50-52%.

(d) Yes outcome scenario: SWAPO's institutional advantages, combined with the fractured opposition field splitting the anti-incumbent vote among multiple candidates, allows Nandi-Ndaitwah to maintain or slightly improve upon the 56% received in 2019. Her status as potentially the first female president generates additional enthusiasm among certain voter segments.

As a professional forecaster, I need to assess whether Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah will secure 55% or more of the vote in Namibia's upcoming presidential election. Let me analyze the available evidence systematically.

## Historical Context and Trends

SWAPO has dominated Namibian politics since independence, but its electoral performance has been on a declining trajectory. In 2019, President Geingob won with 56% of the vote, down significantly from the 76% he received in 2015[3][5]. This represents a substantial 20 percentage point decline in just one electoral cycle, indicating growing voter dissatisfaction with the ruling party.

The opposition has been gaining ground, with Panduleni Itula achieving 30% in 2019, the highest opposition result in Namibia's electoral history[3]. SWAPO has also lost control of key economic centers including Windhoek, Walvis Bay, and Swakopmund, further suggesting eroding support[3].

## Current Electoral Landscape

Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah is positioned as the overwhelming favorite, backed by SWAPO's established political machinery[1]. As the country's first female presidential candidate from SWAPO, she may attract voters interested in making history[2]. Her extensive experience in international relations is considered a significant strength[2].

However, the electoral field is competitive. Key opposition candidates include:
- Panduleni Itula (Independent Patriots for Change)
- Job Amupanda (Affirmative Repositioning)
- Ally Angula (independent, backed by smaller parties)[3][5]

## Key Factors Affecting the Outcome

**Factors favoring Nandi-Ndaitwah reaching 55%:**
- The fragmentation of opposition forces among multiple candidates likely benefits SWAPO, as indicated by analysts[5]
- SWAPO's institutional advantages and historical dominance provide a strong base
- Her position as potentially Namibia's first woman president could mobilize certain voter segments[2]

**Factors against Nandi-Ndaitwah reaching 55%:**
- SWAPO's clear downward electoral trajectory since 2015
- Growing opposition strength, particularly in urban centers
- Economic challenges and potential voter fatigue after decades of SWAPO rule
- Analysis from Fitch Solutions indicates the presidential race will be "very tough"[5]

## Analytical Assessment

The trend line for SWAPO is clearly negative. From 76% in 2015 to 56% in 2019, the party appears to be losing approximately 5 percentage points per year. Extrapolating this trend would put Nandi-Ndaitwah below the 55% threshold.

However, the fragmentation of opposition forces could mitigate this decline. Fitch Solutions' analysis specifically notes that "the fielding of several presidential candidates backed by different opposition parties is likely to benefit Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah" and that "the opposition's failure to coalesce around a single candidate will reduce the various contenders' appeal to voters, benefitting SWAPO"[5].

It's worth noting that Fitch Solutions considers there to be a 42% probability scenario where "SWAPO Retains Majority, Nandi-Ndaitwah Loses Presidential Race"[5], suggesting significant uncertainty about her chances.

The baseline expectation should be anchored to the most recent result (56%), adjusted for the continuing trend of declining SWAPO support, but also accounting for the mitigating factor of opposition fragmentation.

Given these considerations, I assess that Nandi-Ndaitwah is more likely than not to fall short of the 55% threshold, though not by a large margin. The continuing erosion of SWAPO's support base appears to be a stronger factor than the benefit gained from opposition fragmentation.

Probability: 40%
