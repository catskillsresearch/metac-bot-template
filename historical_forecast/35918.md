(a) **Time until outcome is known:**  
About three weeks remain until the resolution date (April 1, 2025).

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changes:**  
As of mid-February 2025, OpenAI’s top model (GPT 4o) is ranked #2 on the Chatbot Arena leaderboard with a score of 1028. The highest score clearly attributed to a Chinese model (Qwen2.5-Max from Alibaba) has reportedly surpassed DeepSeek V3 (score 1016), but there is no evidence it has surpassed GPT 4o[3][5]. Therefore, if nothing changes, **no Chinese model is currently ahead of all OpenAI models**, so the outcome would be **No**.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
OpenAI maintains or improves its leaderboard position, and no Chinese model (by the defined criteria) exceeds the Arena Score of GPT 4o or any other OpenAI model by April 1, 2025. This could happen if GPT 4o retains its high performance, or if the gap between OpenAI and the top Chinese models persists due to limited performance gains, slower release cycles from Chinese developers, or user voting preferences.

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
A Chinese model (such as Qwen2.5-Max or another meeting the criteria) not only continues rising but overtakes all OpenAI entries, including GPT 4o, before the cutoff. This could result from a major upgrade, successful marketing, or user preference shifts, causing its Arena Score to climb above all OpenAI models on the leaderboard.

## Rationale

- **Current Standings:** As of the latest available rankings (February 2025), GPT 4o from OpenAI holds a higher Arena Score (1028) than any confirmed Chinese model. While Alibaba’s Qwen2.5-Max has “surpassed” DeepSeek V3 (1016), there is no evidence it has reached or exceeded GPT 4o’s score[3][5]. The absence of precise score data for Qwen2.5-Max means we cannot confirm a lead over OpenAI at this stage.
  
- **Momentum & Uncertainty:** Chinese models are improving quickly, with Qwen2.5-Max highlighted as a rising contender[3]. The leaderboard is dynamic, with small point differences potentially shifting rankings rapidly. However, OpenAI models like GPT 4o are still at the top, and the status quo tends to persist unless a notable disruption occurs.

- **Probable Developments by Q1 End:**  
  - OpenAI has a track record of rapid iteration but may not release another breakthrough model before early April.
  - Chinese teams are showing progress, and the race is tight, but overtaking the leading OpenAI model in the next three weeks would require a substantial performance jump or a favorable shift in Arena votes.
  - No existing data confirm a Chinese model already holds the lead.

- **Weighting the status quo:** Good forecasts give extra weight to the status quo since, even with rapid advances, leaderboard overthrows remain infrequent events over short timespans.
