(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
As of May 6, 2025, UFC 313 took place on March 8, 2025, so the outcome is already determined.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
The best available evidence confirms that Justin Gaethje fought Rafael Fiziev at UFC 313. However, there is no explicit result in the provided sources indicating whether Gaethje won or lost[1][2][3][4].

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
If Justin Gaethje fought at UFC 313 but did not defeat his opponent (i.e., he lost, drew, or the match was declared a no contest), or if he did not participate in any bout that evening, the outcome resolves as No.

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
If Justin Gaethje fought someone at UFC 313 and was officially declared the winner of that bout, the outcome resolves as Yes.

## Rationale

The information confirms the following:
- Justin Gaethje did compete at UFC 313, facing Rafael Fiziev in the co-main event on March 8, 2025[1][2][3][4].
- The fight took place and was recognized as "Fight of the Night," reflecting that the bout occurred and was notable[3].
- None of the available sources explicitly state the result of the Gaethje vs. Fiziev fight. There is mention of their previous encounter, but not the outcome of this specific rematch[1][4].

Given standard UFC event reporting, explicit winner results are typically available immediately after events. The absence of a stated Gaethje victory in the sources provided suggests that either the information is missing from the sources, or that he did not win. Without explicit confirmation of a Gaethje victory, and in line with good forecasting practice that emphasizes the current best corroborated state (the status quo), the answer must reflect the highest confidence given the evidence at hand.

Probability: 25%  
A Gaethje victory is possible, but with no explicit evidence in the sources, and following the forecaster's principle to lean on what is confirmed, the likelihood that the question resolves as Yes remains low pending further direct evidence.
