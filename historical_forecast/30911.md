(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
There are approximately 21 days (three weeks) remaining until December 31, 2024, when the Forbes Real-Time Billionaires List ranking for Jeff Bezos will be determined.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
As of the most recent comprehensive data from November 2024, Jeff Bezos is ranked as the third-richest person in the world on the Forbes Real-Time Billionaires List with a net worth near $230 billion, trailing Elon Musk and, by a small margin, Larry Ellison[1]. If current trends and rankings persist without significant shifts, Bezos would finish the year ranked 3rd, which means the outcome would be **No**.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
Amazon’s stock either remains flat or underperforms relative to Oracle and Meta through December, keeping Bezos’s net worth stable or lower. Meanwhile, Larry Ellison’s Oracle shares and/or Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta shares also maintain or increase their value, ensuring that both remain ahead of Bezos and securing his position at 3rd or lower.

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
Amazon’s stock appreciates significantly during December, increasing Bezos’s net worth enough to overtake either Larry Ellison or Elon Musk, or both. Alternatively, if Oracle and/or Tesla stock prices fall due to company or market-wide factors, this could lower Ellison’s or Musk’s net worth and enable Bezos to move into the top two. A tie in net worths for the relevant positions would also count as a “Yes”.

## Rationale and Forecast

Recent data indicates that Bezos has experienced notable upward momentum in his net worth and ranking during 2024, climbing from 4th in October to 3rd in November with a gain of nearly $42 billion during the year[1][2][5]. The gap between Bezos and the 2nd position is relatively narrow—on the order of a few billion dollars—making small stock market movements highly consequential for the year-end ranking[1][5].

However, as of the last update, he is still trailing the 2nd place (often Ellison), and the status quo heading into December suggests he will remain in 3rd if these trends continue[1]. Since historically, large swings in rankings within a single month are uncommon without major company-specific or market-wide news, experienced forecasters generally put extra weight on the status quo outcome.

That said, with approximately three weeks left and the competitive gap between the 2nd and 3rd positions being modest, this is not a lock—there remains a nontrivial chance of swift changes due to stock volatility, end-of-year market rallies, or sector-specific news affecting Amazon, Oracle, or Tesla. Additionally, Bezos has completed large scheduled share sales for 2024 as of November, removing a potential downward pressure on his net worth from further insider selling[5].

Taking all this into account, the most likely scenario is that Bezos remains 3rd, but the probability of him moving into the top 2 on December 31 is appreciable due to the close gap.

**Probability: 35%**
