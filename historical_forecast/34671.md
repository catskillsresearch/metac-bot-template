(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  
As of February 3, 2025, there are 6 days until Super Bowl LIX airs on February 9, 2025. The outcome—whether Apple runs a television commercial on the national Fox broadcast during a commercial break—will be determined at that time.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
There is currently no public confirmation that Apple intends to air a TV commercial during Super Bowl LIX. The most up-to-date ad trackers and industry resources have not listed Apple among the confirmed advertisers as of February 3, 2025[1][2][4][5]. Historically, most Super Bowl advertisers are announced in advance, with slots selling out months before the game[1]. This suggests the status quo outcome is **No Apple Super Bowl ad**.

(c) **Scenario for a No outcome:**  
Apple does not air a commercial during the Super Bowl broadcast. This could occur because:
- Apple may choose to focus its marketing efforts solely on halftime show sponsorship via Apple Music[1], continuing its recent strategy.
- Apple may have decided against purchasing an ad slot, with all inventory already sold by November 2024 and no public record of Apple's participation[1].
- All currently available confirmed advertiser lists and trackers do not include Apple, indicating no plans have been announced or are even likely.

(d) **Scenario for a Yes outcome:**  
Apple does air a commercial during the Fox national broadcast. For this to occur:
- Apple would have needed to purchase and produce an ad slot, possibly choosing to keep its participation secret for a late reveal or surprise campaign.
- There could be a late-breaking announcement or an unlisted last-minute purchase, though this is rare given the sell-out status and extensive pre-game PR coverage of major advertisers[1].

## Rationale

- The overwhelming majority of Super Bowl TV advertisers announce their participation well in advance, given the need to coordinate PR and maximize brand buzz.
- As of February 3, 2025, all major industry ad trackers and news outlets, such as Marketing Dive and Ad Age, are closely monitoring brand announcements and updating lists in real time, and none have listed Apple as a confirmed advertiser for a commercial slot[1][2][4][5].
- The most recent precedent is Apple's high-profile sponsorship of the halftime show with Apple Music, but this does not by itself imply an on-air commercial, as the sponsorship and commercials are considered separate activations[1].
- Fox sold out its advertising slots months ago, and brands have been eager to announce their participation, but Apple has not made any public move to indicate a commercial will air[1].
- While Apple did advertise in the prior year (2024), this does not guarantee a repeat, and companies sometimes shift strategy year to year.
- The probability of a surprise, unannounced Apple ad exists, but is low given the total lack of leaks, teases, or industry chatter as of a week before the event.

## Final Forecast

Probability: **10%**
