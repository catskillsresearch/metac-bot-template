(a) Time until outcome: 4 months and 11 days (from May 6, 2025 until the September 17-18, 2024 FOMC meeting)

(b) Status quo outcome: The Fed will cut rates at the September meeting based on recent signals from Fed Chair Powell and market expectations.

(c) Scenario for No outcome: Economic data between now and September shows continuing inflation pressures while employment remains resilient, leading the Fed to maintain current rates despite earlier signals about potential cuts.

(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: Economic data continues to show significant weakening, particularly in the labor market, but inflation remains somewhat elevated, causing the Fed to delay rate cuts until they have more certainty about the economic trajectory.

Based on the available information as of May 2025 looking back at the September 2024 meeting, I need to provide a forecast about whether the Fed would have held rates steady at their September 2024 meeting.

The most significant evidence points toward a rate cut rather than holding steady in September 2024:

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell explicitly stated after the July 2024 meeting that "the time for a rate cut is approaching" and that a reduction "could be on the table at our September meeting" if they received favorable data[3]. This represents a clear shift in the Fed's communication strategy toward signaling potential easing.

The Fed's characterization of inflation changed from simply "elevated" to "somewhat elevated" in their July statement, indicating they were becoming less concerned about inflation pressures[3]. This language shift is significant as it suggests the Fed was preparing markets for a policy pivot.

Economic data as of early August 2024 showed significant weakness, particularly in the July jobs report (only 114,000 jobs created with rising unemployment). This deterioration in labor market conditions would likely intensify pressure on the Fed to begin easing monetary policy to prevent a recession[3].

Market expectations had shifted dramatically by early August, with futures markets pricing in approximately five quarter-point rate cuts through the end of 2024. The CME FedWatch tool was showing expectations for about 100 basis points of cuts by year-end[3]. While the Fed doesn't directly follow market expectations, such overwhelming consensus creates pressure.

Most Wall Street analysts, including those at major institutions like Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase, had forecast rate cuts to begin in September 2024, with some even predicting half-point cuts rather than the standard quarter-point[3].

As a forecaster, I should consider what could prevent a September rate cut:

1. A sudden acceleration in inflation between August and September could give the Fed pause.
2. Surprisingly strong economic data might alleviate recession concerns.
3. Financial market stability concerns might prompt the Fed to delay action.

However, the evidence strongly suggests a rate cut was the most likely outcome for September 2024:

1. Fed communications had clearly shifted to prepare markets for cuts.
2. Economic data was showing concerning weakness.
3. The vast majority of analysts expected at least one cut in September.
4. Even the Fed's own projections from June 2024 indicated at least one cut by year-end[5].

While status quo bias is important in forecasting, in this case the status quo momentum was clearly shifting toward rate cuts rather than holding steady. Powell's explicit mention of the September meeting as a potential starting point for cuts was particularly significant.
