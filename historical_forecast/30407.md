(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  
As of November 22, 2024, there are 40 days remaining until January 1, 2025.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
Bluesky is at 20 million users as of November 19, 2024. In the prior approximately 10 days, it added about 5 million users (from roughly 15 million after the U.S. election to 20 million)[1][3]. If this rate of growth—roughly 500,000 new users daily—continues, Bluesky would reach 30 million users in about 20 additional days, well before January 1, 2025. Thus, the status quo strongly favors a "Yes" outcome.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
The most plausible way Bluesky fails to reach 30 million users by the deadline is if the current surge in user growth dramatically slows. This could happen if the post-election momentum fades, media attention decreases, seasonal distractions reduce sign-ups, technical issues hinder onboarding, or competing platforms make moves that slow Bluesky’s adoption.

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
If Bluesky simply maintains its November pace—adding between 1 million to 5 million users per week—it will surpass 30 million users by mid-December. Even a moderate slowdown would still plausibly see it cross the threshold before January 1, given current acceleration rates[1][3][5].

## Rationale

Bluesky’s growth curve over the last quarter has steepened, with the platform moving from 9 million users in early September to 12 million in mid-October, and up to 20 million by November 19, 2024[1][3]. Notably, the post-election period saw explosive expansion, recording over 1 million new users in a single week and another million within just 24 hours[1]. Usage metrics have surged by over 500% in the U.S. and 350% in the U.K. since election day[5], supporting the idea that the growth is not merely a temporary blip, but is currently sustained.

Barring an abrupt and lasting drop in signups or a major bottleneck, Bluesky is on a trajectory to exceed the 30 million user mark about two weeks before the end-of-year deadline[1][3][5]. The underlying drivers—dissatisfaction with X, product launches, and increased visibility—are likely to persist, at least through the coming month.

However, heavy reliance on recent surges does introduce some risk; surges from external events can be short-lived, and user acquisition rates may normalize as the election recedes or if initial hype wanes. Still, the current numbers suggest even a substantial slowdown would not prevent reaching the target.

## Final Answer

Probability: **95%**
