(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  
As today is May 6, 2025, and the question concerns the percentage shown on Trump Golf Track as of April 1, 2025, the outcome is already knowable; we are answering retrospectively but must project from data before the cutoff (March 11, 2025).

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
If President Trump stopped golfing after March 11, the percentage as recorded on April 1, 2025, would be based only on rounds up to that point. As of late February, the Trump Golf Track listed the percentage at 22.64% on January 26, 2025[1], and other trackers put it at 17-24% through late February[2][4]. If no more golf was played, the percentage would slowly decline as more non-golfing days accumulate in the denominator.

(c) **Outcome if the current trend continued:**  
During the early weeks of his second term, Trump played golf on roughly one out of every 4–5 days (about 17–24% of days spent golfing)[2][4]. Recent observations (through late February) suggest a sustained pace, and there is a slight seasonal increase expected in March as weather improves. Given this, it is reasonable to forecast that by April 1, Trump Golf Track will report a percentage for “Percentage of Presidency” spent golfing in the range of 22–25%[1][2].

(d) **Expectations of experts and markets:**  
Media outlets and trackers covering Trump’s habits expect him to maintain or slightly increase his golfing frequency, noting potential for higher rates compared to his first term, especially as early cold-weather months give way to spring[2]. There is no indication of an expected dramatic reduction or spike in golfing days for the coming weeks, so expert consensus aligns with a steady or modestly rising trajectory in the reported percentage.

(e) **Unexpected scenario resulting in a low outcome:**  
An unexpected international crisis, major health issue, or other urgent presidential demand could dramatically curtail Trump’s golf outings, reducing the ratio of golfing days to total days in office, and thus lowering the percentage displayed by Trump Golf Track as of April 1.

(f) **Unexpected scenario resulting in a high outcome:**  
Conversely, a streak of highly favorable golf weather, a lull in pressing presidential duties, or an intentional public show of leisure could prompt Trump to increase his golfing frequency markedly above trend, pushing the reported percentage closer to 30%.
