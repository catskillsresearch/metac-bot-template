(a) Time left until the outcome is known: 37 days (from August 23, 2024 to September 30, 2024)

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: The CDC's risk assessment for mpox to the US general public remains "Very Low" or "Low" until October 1, 2024.

(c) Scenario resulting in a No outcome: The CDC updates its risk assessment but maintains that the risk to the general public remains "Low" or below, with continued absence of clade I mpox cases in the US and effective containment of the existing clade IIb cases.

(d) Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome: Clade I mpox cases are detected in the US, possibly from travelers returning from affected regions in Africa, leading to limited community spread that causes the CDC to raise its risk assessment for the general public above "Low" (to "Moderate" or higher).

The question asks whether the CDC's assessment of mpox risk to the US general public will exceed "Low" before October 1, 2024. Based on the available information, several factors suggest the risk assessment is likely to remain at "Low" or below.

As of August 22, 2024, the CDC assessed the risk to the US general population as "VERY LOW," and there are no known cases of clade I mpox in the United States[1]. While the World Health Organization declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on August 14, 2024, regarding the clade I mpox outbreak in Africa, this alone doesn't automatically raise the risk level for the US general public[1][4].

The Biden-Harris Administration has been monitoring and preparing for clade I mpox since December 2023, with robust detection, containment, and management capabilities in place[1]. The US has expanded diagnostic testing capacity and implemented wastewater surveillance across 32 jurisdictions, with all detected mpox virus being clade IIb as of May 25, 2024[5].

The Johns Hopkins Center for Outbreak Response Innovation (CORI) assessed in June 2024 that the risk to the general public from mpox (clade IIb) was "Low," while noting a "Low-Moderate" risk to specific populations like men who have sex with men and sex workers[5]. Even their assessment of a potential "summer surge" scenario maintained the risk to the general public as "Low."

For the CDC's risk assessment to exceed "Low," we would need to see either:
1. The introduction and spread of clade I mpox in the US, which is more virulent than clade IIb
2. A significant surge in clade IIb cases beyond what has been observed in the past year

Neither scenario appears likely in the short timeframe before October 1st. The US has substantial experience managing clade IIb mpox from the 2022 outbreak, and public health measures are already in place. While international travel could introduce clade I cases, the robust surveillance system would likely detect these quickly, allowing for containment before widespread community transmission.

The status quo is powerful in this forecast. The CDC has maintained a "Very Low" risk assessment for the general public despite ongoing clade IIb cases, and there's no clear indication this will change dramatically in the next 37 days. While the CDC is updating its assessment in response to the WHO's PHEIC declaration, the focus appears to be on preparedness rather than indicating an imminent elevation of risk.
