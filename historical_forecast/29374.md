I'll provide a forecasting analysis of Ohio Issue 1 for the November 2024 election.

(a) Time left until outcome: 7 days (Election Day is November 5, 2024)

(b) Status quo outcome: The current Ohio Redistricting Commission remains in place, consisting of elected officials including the governor, auditor, secretary of state, and four state lawmakers (two from each party).

(c) Scenario for No outcome: Voters are confused by potentially misleading ballot language, which misrepresents the purpose of the amendment. Republican-led opposition messaging successfully frames the measure as a partisan "power grab" rather than a good government reform. Voter turnout patterns favor those who benefit from the current system, and the technical nature of redistricting makes it difficult for average voters to understand the stakes.

(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: Despite confusing ballot language, voters recognize the need for reform after the highly publicized 2022 redistricting controversy where the Ohio Supreme Court rejected maps seven times. The bipartisan coalition of supporters effectively communicates how the amendment would remove politicians from the redistricting process. Voters frustrated with partisan gerrymandering turn out in sufficient numbers to approve the measure.

## Analysis of Ohio Issue 1

Ohio Issue 1 represents a significant proposed change to Ohio's redistricting process. If approved, it would eliminate the current Ohio Redistricting Commission and replace it with a 15-member citizen panel composed of Republicans, Democrats, and independents selected by retired judges[4]. This new commission would draw legislative and congressional maps based on a proportionality formula corresponding with the results of recent statewide elections[4].

The proposal comes in response to Ohio's recent redistricting controversies. In 2022, the Ohio Supreme Court struck down seven different maps passed by the current commission for unfairly benefiting Republicans[5]. This history of partisan gerrymandering has created momentum for reform.

## Key Factors Affecting the Outcome

### Ballot Language Concerns

A significant hurdle for Issue 1 is potential voter confusion stemming from the ballot language itself. The language was certified by Secretary of State Frank LaRose and approved by the Republican-controlled Ohio Ballot Board[3]. Critics argue this language may be misleading and could cause voters to vote against a measure they might otherwise support if they fully understood it[5].

The Ohio Supreme Court has been involved in a case regarding the ballot language, which indicates the seriousness of this concern[3]. Confusing ballot language tends to favor the status quo, as voters often vote "no" when uncertain.

### Partisan Dynamics

The amendment faces opposition primarily from Republican elected officials who benefit from the current system. They characterize it as a Democratic power grab rather than a good government reform[5].

However, the measure has notable bipartisan support, including from former Republican Chief Justice Maureen O'Connor, giving it credibility across party lines. The campaign emphasizes that "this isn't a fight between Democrats and Republicans â€” it's between citizens and politicians"[5].

### Voter Understanding of Redistricting

Redistricting is a complex topic that many voters may not fully understand. The technical nature of the issue could make it difficult for voters to assess the implications of their vote.

The amendment's supporters need to effectively communicate the basic concept: removing politicians from the map-drawing process and replacing them with citizens who would create fairer districts[4][5].

### Recent Precedents

Looking at similar recent ballot initiatives provides mixed signals:

- In 2018, Ohio voters overwhelmingly approved (by 75%) a measure to reform congressional redistricting
- However, that measure still left politicians in charge of drawing the maps, which led to the 2022 controversy

## Status Quo Bias Considerations

As a forecaster, I must account for status quo bias. Several factors suggest difficulty in passing Issue 1:

1. Complex constitutional amendments often face an uphill battle, especially when opposed by powerful interests
2. Confusing ballot language typically favors rejection
3. Incumbent politicians who benefit from the current system have resources to fight the measure

However, the recent history of redistricting failures in Ohio provides unique context that may overcome status quo bias. The 2022 redistricting controversy was highly publicized, with the state Supreme Court repeatedly rejecting maps as unconstitutional. This visible failure of the current system may motivate voters to support change.

## Final Assessment

Given the factors above, I believe Ohio Issue 1 faces significant challenges but also has meaningful support. The confusing ballot language and opposition from incumbent politicians create headwinds, but the bipartisan support and recent visible failures of the current system provide tailwinds.

While status quo bias would normally suggest a lower probability of passage, the recent redistricting controversy and bipartisan support (including from prominent Republicans) increase the likelihood of voter approval. However, the technical nature of the issue and potential ballot confusion remain significant hurdles.

Probability: 55%
