Time until outcome: 4 months and 25 days (from May 6, 2025 to October 1, 2024 - noting this is backward in time due to the date configuration).

Status quo outcome: Based on the search results, the Ukrainian offensive has penetrated into Kursk Oblast but there is no confirmed Ukrainian control of territory at least five miles inside other Russian oblasts. If nothing changes, the outcome would be "No."

No outcome scenario: Ukraine maintains its focus solely on Kursk Oblast through October 1, 2024, either unable or unwilling to commit resources to establish a significant presence (â‰¥5 miles deep) in any other Russian oblast.

Yes outcome scenario: Ukraine expands operations into at least one other Russian oblast (likely Belgorod or Bryansk, which are already under counterterrorism operations), establishing control of territory at least five miles inside that oblast by October 1, 2024.

I'm approaching this forecasting question with careful analysis of the available information about Ukraine's current cross-border operations into Russia.

## Current Situation Assessment

As of early August 2024, Ukraine has launched a significant offensive into Russia's Kursk Oblast, making confirmed advances of up to 10 kilometers (approximately 6.2 miles) into Russian territory[3]. This represents Ukraine's first direct offensive into Russian territory of this scale since the beginning of the invasion[2]. The operation appears to be substantial, with mechanized forces penetrating at least two Russian defensive lines[3].

The Russian response has included declaring a counterterrorism operation in three oblasts - Belgorod, Bryansk, and Kursk[1] - suggesting these are the areas where Russia perceives potential Ukrainian activity. This indicates that while the current confirmed offensive is limited to Kursk Oblast, there may be concern about potential operations in the other two oblasts as well.

## Strategic Considerations

Several factors are relevant to forecasting whether Ukraine will expand operations beyond Kursk Oblast:

1. **Resource constraints**: Opening a new front in another oblast would require significant military resources. Ukraine appears to be committing substantial forces to the Kursk operation, potentially limiting capabilities for simultaneous operations elsewhere.

2. **Strategic objectives**: The Kursk offensive has already achieved certain strategic goals - forcing Russia to divert troops from occupied Ukrainian territory[2]. Establishing control in multiple oblasts might dilute force concentration without providing proportional strategic benefits.

3. **Russian defensive redeployments**: Russia has been diverting thousands of troops to counter the Kursk threat[2], which may strengthen defenses in other border regions, making additional incursions more difficult.

4. **Timeline considerations**: The question focuses on October 1, 2024, giving Ukraine less than two months from the start of the Kursk offensive to establish control of territory at least five miles inside another Russian oblast.

## Historical Precedent

Looking at the pattern of the conflict so far, this Kursk offensive represents a significant escalation and change in Ukrainian tactics. Prior to August 2024, there had not been major, sustained incursions by Ukrainian regular forces into Russian territory. The fact that Ukrainian forces in Kursk were still holding territory in January 2025 (according to the search results) suggests that this operation was intended to be sustained rather than a temporary raid[2].

## Forecasting Probability

Given the status quo and available information, I assess that the most likely scenario is for Ukraine to maintain its focus on Kursk through October 1, rather than opening another significant front in a different oblast:

1. The Kursk offensive already accomplishes the strategic goal of diverting Russian forces.
2. Ukraine's military resources are likely stretched, making simultaneous major operations challenging.
3. The timeline (less than two months) constrains Ukraine's ability to plan and execute another major offensive.
4. Russian forces are likely to strengthen defensive positions in other border regions in response to the Kursk incursion.

However, I cannot completely discount the possibility of Ukraine expanding operations, particularly given the counterterrorism operations declared in Belgorod and Bryansk oblasts, which may indicate some level of Ukrainian activity or Russian concern.

Probability: 15%
