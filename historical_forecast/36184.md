(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
As of March 20, 2025, there are 12 days remaining until April 1, 2025, the deadline for the question to resolve.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
None of Elon Musk, Donald Trump, or JD Vance have visited Fort Knox as of March 20, 2025. If the current situation remains unchanged—i.e., no visit is arranged or occurs within the next 12 days—the outcome will be "No."

(c) **Scenario for a No outcome:**  
Despite public statements and strong hints about intentions, neither Musk, Trump, nor Vance actually schedule or complete a visit to Fort Knox before April 1, 2025. Obstacles may include security complexities, bureaucratic delays, resistance from the Treasury Department, or simple lack of follow-through.

(d) **Scenario for a Yes outcome:**  
A visit is organized and carried out before the deadline, with at least one of Musk, Trump, or Vance physically stepping onto the Fort Knox grounds. This would likely involve high-level coordination, security arrangements, and public attention. The visit might be triggered by mounting political or media pressure, swift logistical work, or an unexpected agreement between the relevant authorities and one or more of these individuals.

## Rationale

Both Elon Musk and Donald Trump have recently and publicly announced intentions or desires to visit Fort Knox. Musk discussed his plan at the 2025 CPAC Summit and has made several references on social media and in interviews to the possibility of an in-person audit of the gold reserves[1][2][3][5]. Trump, too, has stated he wants to go to Fort Knox to see the gold for himself, echoing Musk's skepticism and intent[5][4].

However, as of March 20, 2025, there is no evidence of a visit actually being scheduled or imminent. Importantly, a visit to Fort Knox is logistically complex and requires significant coordination with the U.S. Army and the Treasury Department, both of which have strict protocols and may not be inclined to accommodate such a visit on short notice—especially given that the Treasury Secretary has publicly stated that annual audits already occur and the gold is "present and accounted for"[4][5]. There are also only 12 days left in the window for the visit.

The status quo favors inertia: high-profile, last-minute visits to one of the country's most secure installations are rare, and without clear evidence of concrete scheduling or authorization, such a visit remains unlikely despite political grandstanding. Forecasters typically put substantial weight on the status quo outcome unless there is strong, actionable evidence of an imminent change.

**Probability: 15%**

While the public commitments by Musk and Trump have increased the odds somewhat above baseline, the lack of any concrete scheduling, the extremely short time frame left, and the formidable institutional inertia all suggest a visit remains improbable before April 1, 2025[1][2][3][4][5].
