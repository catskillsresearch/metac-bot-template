(a) **Time Left Until Outcome Is Known**

- The number of days from November 19, 2024, to December 27, 2024, is 38 days (about 5.5 weeks) until the target date when the US oil rig count will be checked.

(b) **Status Quo Outcome If Nothing Changed**

- As of October 2024, the reported Baker Hughes US oil rig count was 479, which is well below the threshold of 590[3]. The count has been steadily declining over the past two years, with no signs of reversal. If current trends persist, the count will remain far below 590 by December 27, 2024[3][5].

(c) **Scenario That Results in a No Outcome**

- The most likely scenario, supported by historical trends and industry forecasts, is that the rig count continues its gradual or flat trajectory, possibly with minor fluctuations but no major increases. Economic, regulatory, or market conditions do not shift enough to incentivize a rapid ramp-up in drilling, and no external shocks (e.g., sudden and sustained oil price spikes, major geopolitical events) dramatically alter industry behavior. The count remains below 590[3][5].

(d) **Scenario That Results in a Yes Outcome**

- A "Yes" would require an unprecedented surge in drilling within a 5.5-week period. This could occur only if there were a sudden, substantial, and persistent increase in oil prices or a significant geopolitical event that made US domestic production vastly more attractive and feasible overnight. Such a scenario would require operators to activate more than 110 additional rigs (from 479 to over 590) in just over a month—something for which there is no precedent or early indication as of November 2024[3][5]. Moreover, there are no current policy signals or market incentives pointing to such a reversal[3][5].

## Forecaster Rationale

The US oil rig count has been in a marked and sustained decline since early 2023, with drops accelerating at several points[3][5]. As of the most recent data (October 2024), the count stands at 479—far short of the required 590. Forecasts for all of 2024 expect flat to slightly declining activity, and industry analysis consistently points to a lack of catalysts for a sharp reversal in this trend[3][5].

Logistically, adding over 110 rigs in five weeks would involve immense mobilization of equipment, personnel, and capital—a process neither technically nor economically feasible given the current industry outlook[3][5]. Market factors, such as supply, demand, and price, can create volatility, but there is no sign of an imminent and sustained disruption sufficient to drive such a rapid and dramatic increase.

Historically, forecasting best practice is to weight the status quo (inertia) more heavily unless there is compelling, up-to-date evidence of imminent change. In this case, all available data, forecasts, and on-the-ground reports align with the status quo—continued low or marginally fluctuating rig counts.

## Final Probability Forecast

Probability: 1%  

There is a near-zero chance the US oil rig count exceeds 590 on December 27, 2024, barring the emergence of extraordinary and currently unforeseen market or geopolitical events[3][5].
