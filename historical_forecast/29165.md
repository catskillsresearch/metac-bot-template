(a) Time left until outcome is known: 67 days (May 6, 2025 to December 31, 2024)

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: No - Russia does not have full control of Chasiv Yar but controls parts of it (eastern areas).

(c) A scenario resulting in a No outcome: Ukrainian forces successfully maintain their defensive positions west of the Siverskyi Donetsâ€“Donbas Canal, preventing Russian forces from making significant advances through winter months when offensive operations typically slow down.

(d) A scenario resulting in a Yes outcome: Russia intensifies its offensive operations in Chasiv Yar, leveraging its numerical advantage and artillery superiority to break through Ukrainian defenses at the canal, eventually capturing the entire city before the end of December.

Based on the search results provided, I can offer an analysis of the likelihood that Russia will control Chasiv Yar by December 31, 2024.

Chasiv Yar has been a focal point of Russian offensive operations for months. From the available information, we can see that Russian forces have been conducting ground attacks in the area but with limited confirmed advances. According to the search results from May 2024, Russian forces were conducting operations in the Chasiv Yar direction but had not made confirmed territorial gains at that time[2].

The most recent information indicates that Russia controls part of Chasiv Yar, but Ukrainian forces are preventing them from crossing the canal in the eastern part of the town[4]. This suggests that while Russia has made some progress, they do not yet have complete control of the settlement.

## Key Factors Affecting the Forecast

**Current Battle Dynamics:**
Russian forces have been making incremental progress in Chasiv Yar. The search results indicate that Russian forces were conducting ground attacks near the Novyi Microraion in eastern Chasiv Yar in May 2024[1]. However, the pace of Russian advances has been relatively slow, with Ukrainian forces maintaining defensive positions.

**Strategic Importance:**
Chasiv Yar appears to have strategic significance. The search results suggest that Russian forces recently intensified their efforts to seize this "operationally-significant town" west of Bakhmut[3]. This indicates that capturing Chasiv Yar remains a priority for Russian forces, which increases the likelihood of continued pressure on the area.

**Force Deployment and Capabilities:**
Senior NATO military commanders confirmed that Russian forces do not have sufficient forces to achieve a "strategic breakthrough" in Ukraine[1]. This suggests limitations in Russia's ability to make rapid, large-scale advances. However, Russia has demonstrated the ability to leverage electronic warfare capabilities to support tactical gains[1].

**Ukrainian Defensive Posture:**
Ukrainian President Zelensky has stated that Ukrainian forces have stabilized the front in some areas and built multiple lines of defense[1][3]. This indicates that Ukraine has prepared defensive positions, which could slow Russian advances.

## Assessment of Timeframe

The search results from May 2024 indicated that Russian forces had not made confirmed advances in Chasiv Yar at that time[1]. By August 2024, Russia controlled part of Chasiv Yar, but Ukraine was preventing them from crossing the canal in the eastern part of the town[4].

Given the slow pace of Russian advances observed over several months, it seems unlikely that Russia would completely capture Chasiv Yar by December 31, 2024. While Russian forces have shown the ability to make tactical gains, their progress has been incremental rather than rapid.

## Historical Precedent

Looking at similar contested settlements along the front line, Russian advances have typically been measured in weeks or months rather than days, especially in urban areas where Ukrainian forces can establish effective defensive positions. The relatively slow pace of Russian advances in Chasiv Yar since May 2024 suggests this pattern is continuing.

## Uncertainty Factors

There are several factors that could significantly alter this assessment:

1. A major shift in force allocation by either side
2. Changes in Western military aid to Ukraine
3. Seasonal weather conditions affecting military operations
4. Potential Ukrainian force redeployments from other sectors

These factors contribute to uncertainty in the forecast, but based on the current trajectory, I assess that Russia is unlikely to have complete control of Chasiv Yar by December 31, 2024. While they control parts of the town and continue to make tactical advances, the pace of these advances suggests that complete control within the remaining timeframe is not the most probable outcome.

Probability: 35%
