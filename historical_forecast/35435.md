(a) **Time until outcome:**  
There are 22 days left until the closing value of NVIDIA’s stock on March 28, 2025, will be known (from May 6, 2025, backward).

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
If nothing changed from the latest available data, the closing price would be approximately $114.37, which is NVIDIA’s share price as of May 6, 2025[1]. (Note: This is after the date in question; however, it provides the most recently observed anchor for the price.)

(c) **Outcome if the current trend continued:**  
NVIDIA’s stock has generally been in an uptrend. Over the past year, it saw 146% gains (year-over-year as of January 23, 2025), but since then, growth has moderated. Analyst consensus and algorithmic forecasts converge on a 12-month target in the $151.79–$179 range, with algorithmic models forecasting approximately $152.39 for one year from now[1][3][4][5]. Extrapolating from current levels and recent 3-month uptrends (+15%), if the trend continued, a value in the range of $120 to $140 is plausible.

(d) **Expectations of experts and markets:**  
- **Analyst consensus (as of early 2025):** $176.54 one-year target, with end-of-2025 forecast at $137.50, and a best-case of $192.50 and worst-case of $82.50[4].
- **Shorter-term estimates (end of March 2025):** Implied range based on current price ($114) and near-term forecasts is likely $120–$140, though most end-of-year targets are above this[1][3][5].
- **Alternative, more bullish projections:** Some outliers, such as Paisakit, predict $156.90–$185.40 for 2025, with even higher peaks possible[5].
- **Market sentiment:** Most analysts rate the stock as a “Strong Buy,” but there is some caution about short-term downside risk[5].

(e) **Unexpected scenario – low outcome:**  
A sharp regulatory action (e.g., new export restrictions on AI chips to China), a sudden tech sector correction, or reports of an AI spending slowdown could rapidly drag shares lower—toward or even below the pessimistic scenario of $82.50[4][5].

(f) **Unexpected scenario – high outcome:**  
If NVIDIA announced breakthrough new chips, delivered massive positive earnings surprises, or saw a new wave of AI megaprojects signed, shares could rapidly soar toward the upper range of analyst forecasts—potentially approaching $180–$200.

This range reflects the current price anchor ($114.37[1]), consensus forecasts ($137.50–$179[4][5]), and room for unexpected volatility.
