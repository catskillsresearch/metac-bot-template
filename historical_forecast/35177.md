(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
There are approximately 6 weeks remaining until March 31, 2025.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
As of February 18, 2025, Trump Media & Technology Group (DJT) has not exceeded its all-time high of $79.38 in 2025, and the current trading price is around $24–$25. If this condition continues and the stock does not surpass $79.38 (even intraday) through March 31, the outcome would be **Yes**—the stock continuously remains below its all-time high[1][5].

(c) **Scenario that results in a No outcome:**  
A "No" outcome would occur if, at any point (even intraday), before March 31, 2025, DJT trades above $79.38. This could be triggered by a significant surge in investor sentiment, a major positive political development for Donald Trump, hype around new product releases or partnerships, or heavy speculative buying.

(d) **Scenario that results in a Yes outcome:**  
A "Yes" outcome occurs if DJT never exceeds $79.38 (including all intraday highs) from the present up to and including March 31, 2025. This scenario could unfold if the current lack of fundamentals persists, no dramatic shifts in sentiment or political catalysts occur, and the speculative fervor around the stock stays subdued or wanes.

## Rationale

- **Current Trajectory:**  
  DJT is trading far below its all-time high, at about $24–$25 as of May 2025[1][5]. There is no evidence it has exceeded $79.38 in 2025.

- **Volatility and Speculation:**  
  The stock is highly speculative and volatile. While it can experience sharp swings, large upward moves of over 200% from the current price in just six weeks are rare historically, especially without a clear, major catalyst.

- **Forecasts and Sentiment:**  
  There are widely varying forecasts. One source predicts the average DJT price for 2025 could be as high as $231 with highs of $333—this suggests there is *some* perceived upside risk[4]. However, other sources and the observed price trend show no sign of imminent explosive growth, and most recent activity has trended flat or downward[1][3][5]. With six weeks until the deadline and the status quo showing no momentum toward the all-time high, the probability of such a dramatic move is diminished unless unexpected news emerges.

- **Weight of Status Quo:**  
  Professional forecasting principles place extra weight on the status quo outcome, as extraordinary events (e.g., a >200% price spike) are rare absent strong catalysts. DJT's fundamentals and recent trading do not currently suggest such a move is imminent. Major catalysts (SEC actions, political developments, insider transactions) could always intervene, but in the absence of clear, actionable information, these should be considered low-probability, high-impact risks.

**Probability: 85%**  
There is an estimated 85% chance that Trump Media & Technology Group (DJT) will continuously remain below its all-time high of $79.38 through March 31, 2025, given current price levels, the absence of imminent catalysts, and the weight of historical market behavior[1][5]. The 15% risk allowance accounts for the unpredictable nature of DJT and the possibility of unforeseen events or speculative rallies.
