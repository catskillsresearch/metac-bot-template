(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  
From July 16, 2024, there are about 2.5 months (approximately 11 weeks) until the September 30, 2024, cutoff date for the forecast.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
As of July 15, 2024, 167 measles cases have been reported in the United States. In recent months, the case count increased from 121 in April to 167 in July—an average pace of about 23–24 cases per month. At this rate, about 57 more cases would occur by September 30, leading to an estimated total of 224 cases (167 + 57 = 224). This projection places the total *within* the 201–300 range.

(c) **Scenario that results in a No outcome:**  
- If the rate of measles case growth slows sharply—due to effective public health interventions, outbreak resolution, or seasonal decrease in transmission—the total may remain at or only slightly above the current number, ending below or just above 200 cases by September 30.
- Alternatively, if there is a sudden, large outbreak or multiple outbreaks, and the pace accelerates dramatically, the total could surpass 300 cases well before September 30.

(d) **Scenario that results in a Yes outcome:**  
- The most plausible scenario for a Yes is the continuation of the current trend: steady, moderate case growth without exceptionally large outbreaks or successful, complete containment. This would put the total just above 200 but likely below 300 by the deadline.

## Rationale

- **Current trajectory:** The CDC reported 167 cases as of July 15, 2024, following a period of consistent increase that has averaged between 23–24 cases per month since April. Extrapolating this trend forward to September 30 results in an expected case total between 200 and 250, comfortably within the specified range[1][3].
- **Historical patterns:** Years with surge in cases (notably 2019) have shown that large, explosive outbreaks can occur, but so far in 2024, outbreaks have not reached such extremes[1][3][4].
- **Public health response:** The CDC and public health authorities are ramping up efforts to contain outbreaks, including vaccination campaigns and rapid response to new clusters. These interventions may stem the tide of new cases, but unless they are dramatically more effective than currently observed, the existing trend is likely to continue[2][5].
- **Extra weight on status quo:** Good forecasting practice places extra emphasis on the continuation of present trends unless there is compelling evidence for abrupt change—which in this case, neither the data nor recent CDC communications suggest.

## Final Answer

Probability: **75%** that the total number of measles cases reported in the United States in 2024 by September 30 will be *more than 200 and less than or equal to 300*[1][3].
