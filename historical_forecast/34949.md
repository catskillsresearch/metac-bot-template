(a) **Time until the outcome is known:**  
The official PlayStation Blog typically publishes the monthly US/Canada top downloads for PS5 within the first two weeks of the following month. Since the forecast concerns February 2025 downloads, the outcome will likely be known around March 10–15, 2025. This is approximately 1 month from the current date (February 11, 2025).

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
In January 2025, at least two sports games were confirmed in the PS5 top downloads for the US/Canada region: NBA 2K25 (#3) and Madden NFL 25 (top 5)[4][5]. EA Sports FC 25, although dominant in Europe, is not explicitly confirmed in the US/Canada January top five, but has shown staying power in previous months. Other EA and 2K sports titles (e.g., NHL, UFC) have also been consistently present in the top 20 throughout 2024[2][4]. If current trends continue and no major shifts occur, the most likely number of sports games in the February 2025 list is 3–4.

(c) **Scenario for an unexpected outcome:**  
A notable deviation could occur if a major non-sports game releases in February 2025 and captures multiple spots in the download charts, pushing sports titles out of the ranking. Alternatively, a significant digital sale on non-sports titles, viral hype, or unexpectedly rapid decline in player engagement for sports games could limit the sports representation to only 1 or 2 titles. Conversely, a promotional event or new content for several sports games could temporarily boost their downloads, increasing their presence to 5 or more.

## Rationale

- The status quo, supported by January 2025 data, shows at least two sports games solidly in the US/Canada PS5 top downloads: NBA 2K25 and Madden NFL 25[4][5]. EA Sports FC 25, while dominant in Europe, is not consistently a top 3 title in the US/Canada but often remains in or near the top 10[5].
- Sports titles have strong staying power given annual release cycles, regular updates, and broad appeal. These games have been mainstays in monthly and annual charts throughout 2024 and into early 2025[2][4].
- February is not a typical launch window for new sports games in the US/Canada, minimizing the risk of newly released sports titles unexpectedly boosting the count.
- The main uncertainty is the arrival of highly anticipated non-sports games in February and potential digital sales events, which could crowd out sports games.
- Given the above, the modal outcome is 3–4 sports games, with meaningful probability on 2 and slight probabilities on more extreme outcomes.
