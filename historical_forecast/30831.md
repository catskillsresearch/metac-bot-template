(a) **Time left until outcome:**  
There are approximately 25 days remaining until December 31, 2024, when Tesla's closing stock price for the year will be determined.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
As of December 5, 2024, Tesla's stock closed at $403.84, which is under $420. If the price were to remain unchanged or grow modestly, it would finish the year below $420[2].

(c) **Scenario for a "No" outcome (stock closes at or above $420):**  
Tesla continues its recent strong momentum—up 46% in the past month—and the positive sentiment from Elon Musk’s political advisory role and broader post-election optimism persists. Investors could keep bidding up the stock, and additional positive news—from earnings, deliveries, product announcements, or macroeconomic tailwinds—could push Tesla above $420 before year-end[2].

(d) **Scenario for a "Yes" outcome (stock closes under $420):**  
Tesla’s current rally loses steam as the initial excitement wanes. Potential negative catalysts—such as disappointing delivery numbers, broader market pullbacks, or negative news from China or elsewhere—could stall or reverse recent gains. If the price plateaus or retreats slightly from $403.84, it will close under $420[2][1].

## Rationale

The current context emphasizes Tesla’s high volatility and unpredictable investor sentiment. The stock is less than 5% below the $420 threshold with only 25 days left, but it recently surged 46% in a month—a dramatic move not out of character for Tesla, but hard to sustain without new catalysts[2].

Analyst expectations vary widely. Some price targets go well below $420, such as Morningstar’s $250 “fair value” assessment, signaling skepticism about the stock sustaining or growing its premium[2][1]. Other sources, like TradingView and TipRanks, show a wide range (from as low as $24.86 to as high as $550 for 12-month projections), reflecting division even among experts[2]. Notably, the average analyst target hovers well below $420.

Given historical trends, most periods of rapid ascent in Tesla’s stock have been followed by volatility and occasional pullbacks. While the political boost has driven recent gains, the lack of a fundamental shift in Tesla’s operating performance or financial outlook tempers the likelihood of continued rally without interruption.

Because the **status quo outcome** is under $420 at present, and because most of the time stock prices do not sustain such steep, short-term climbs without substantial new catalysts, **the base case remains that Tesla will close under $420 on December 31, 2024**. The risk of a last-minute run above $420 is real—but given the volatility and strong resistance at round-number psychological levels, the probability of remaining below $420 is somewhat higher than a coin flip, but not by much.

## Probability

Probability: **65%** that Tesla’s closing price on December 31, 2024, will be under $420 per share.
