Here's a breakdown based on the available information:

(a) **Time left until the outcome is known**: Approximately 23 days (until December 13, 2024).

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed**: Historically, Mt Seymour has typically opened between early and mid-December. Given this pattern, it's reasonable to expect it might be open by December 13 under typical conditions.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome**: If there is insufficient snowfall or unfavorable weather conditions in November and early December 2024, Mt Seymour might not have enough snow cover to open by December 13. This scenario aligns with past instances where opening was delayed due to inadequate snow.

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome**: If the snow conditions are favorable, with significant snowfall in late November, Mt Seymour could open earlier than usual this season. The projection that Mt Seymour might open in late November and the forecast of a snowier winter both support this possibility.

Given these factors, including historical trends and current weather projections, there's a reasonable chance Mt Seymour will be open by December 13. However, the final determination depends heavily on actual snow conditions.
