(a) Time until outcome: The outcome will be known shortly after the November 5, 2024 election, which is approximately 2 weeks from today (October 22, 2024).

(b) Status quo outcome: Based on the historical pattern, there is inconsistency in polling bias. In 2016 and 2020, Trump outperformed polls by 1.8 and 2.7 percentage points respectively in swing states, which would suggest a bias outside the 0-1.0pp range. However, the 2022 midterms showed a reversal with polls overestimating Republican performance by 3.7 points in Senate races.

(c) Scenario for No outcome: Polling bias continues the pattern seen in either the 2016/2020 elections (where Trump outperformed polls by more than 1 percentage point) or follows the 2022 midterm pattern (where polls overestimated Republican performance, resulting in a negative bias for Trump). Either scenario would place the bias outside the narrow 0-1.0pp range specified.

(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: Pollsters have corrected methodological issues from previous cycles, leading to more accurate polling with only a small bias favoring Trump. The accuracy seen in the 2022 generic congressional ballot (only 0.3pp off) extends to presidential polling, resulting in a polling bias within the 0-1.0pp range.

Looking at the evidence presented, I need to evaluate the likelihood that RCP's polling bias for Trump will fall within the narrow range of 0-1.0 percentage points. The historical data shows significant variability in polling bias across election cycles.

In 2016 and 2020, Trump outperformed polls significantly, with biases of 1.8pp and 2.7pp respectively in swing states. This would suggest a bias greater than the upper bound of 1.0pp specified in the question. However, the 2022 midterms showed a complete reversal, with polls overestimating Republican performance by 3.7pp in Senate races, which would result in a negative bias (below the lower bound of 0pp).

The key insight from the research is that "bias in one cycle has not been predictive of bias in subsequent cycles"[5]. This is crucial as it suggests that using historical patterns to predict the 2024 polling bias has significant limitations. The data shows inversions in average error across multiple election cycles from 2000 to 2020[5].

The specified range (0-1.0pp) is quite narrow, making it less likely to capture the actual bias given historical variability. Most previous elections have seen polling biases outside this range. The only recent example that falls close to this range is the 2022 generic congressional ballot, which had a bias of only 0.3pp.

While pollsters may have learned from previous errors, there's no evidence of major methodological changes that would systematically address polling bias for this specific election. The "shy Trump voter" hypothesis remains contested, and other factors may influence polling accuracy in unpredictable ways.

Given the inconsistent historical pattern, the narrow specified range, and the lack of evidence for systematic polling improvements, I believe there is a relatively low probability that the polling bias will fall precisely within the 0-1.0pp range. The status quo suggests either larger positive biases (as in 2016/2020) or negative biases (as in 2022 Senate races) are more likely.

Probability: 25%
