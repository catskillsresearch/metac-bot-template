## Forecast Analysis

### (a) Time Left Until Outcome Known
There are approximately 26 days left until December 31, 2024.

### (b) Status Quo Outcome If Nothing Changed
As of December 5, 2024, Yoon Suk Yeol remains the President of South Korea. If nothing changes, he would still be in office on December 31, 2024.

### (c) Scenario Resulting in a No Outcome
A scenario where Yoon Suk Yeol ceases to be President could involve:
- **Impeachment:** The National Assembly taking a unified stance to impeach him with the required supermajority if additional evidence or political consensus emerges.
- **Resignation:** Pressure from political opposition, public protests, and internal party discord forces Yoon to resign.
- **Removal by Other Legal Means:** If other legal processes or constitutional crises result in his removal before December 31.

### (d) Scenario Resulting in a Yes Outcome
For Yoon Suk Yeol to remain President on December 31, 2024:
- **Status Quo Maintenance:** Despite opposition and low approval ratings, he maintains his political base and manages to withstand calls for resignation or impeachment.
- **Stabilization Efforts:** He successfully implements policies or strategies that stabilize his administration and improve public perception.
- **Lack of Legislative Action:** The National Assembly does not gather the necessary votes to impeach him, and no other mechanisms are used to remove him from office.

### Final Answer
Given the serious challenges Yoon Suk Yeol faces with a low approval rating, mass cabinet resignations, and significant political opposition, there is substantial uncertainty about his political future. However, as of December 5, 2024, he remains in office. The historical tendency to maintain the status quo unless significant factors disrupt it suggests that while there are many potential challenges, he might still be president on December 31, 2024, unless specific drastic actions occur.
