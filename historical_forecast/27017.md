(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  
As of today, May 6, 2025, the question's resolution date (September 30, 2024) is in the past; the outcome is already determined by historical events as of this date.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
As of May 2025, the United Nations has 193 member states[2]. No new member has been admitted since South Sudan in 2011[2]. If this status did not change between July and September 30, 2024, the answer is "No" (the UN did not have more than 193 member states before October 1, 2024).

(c) **A scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
Despite active applications (notably Palestine) and various partially recognized states seeking full membership, none received Security Council recommendation and General Assembly approval before the deadline. The existing members remained at 193, and no new admissions were finalized or recognized in time.

(d) **A scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
A scenario for a "Yes" would require a candidate (such as Palestine or Kosovo) to overcome both political and procedural hurdles, including avoiding a veto in the Security Council and securing a two-thirds General Assembly majority, and then being admitted as a full member before September 30, 2024. No evidence suggests this occurred.

## Rationale

Historical precedent shows UN membership changes are rare and slow, with the last new member admitted in 2011[2]. The process for admitting a new member is complex and can be blocked by any permanent member of the Security Council via veto. Palestineâ€™s recent bid (spring 2024) was vetoed by the US, despite significant support, highlighting persistent political obstacles.

As of May 2025, there are still only 193 UN member states[2]. There is no evidence in the public record or authoritative sources that any new state was admitted before October 1, 2024. Security Council and General Assembly actions during the relevant period concerned other matters, such as Security Council elections for 2025-2026, not new state admissions[1][3][4][5].  

Given the lack of new admissions and the continued reporting of 193 member states, the status quo prevailed.

**Probability: 0%**  
The United Nations did not have more than 193 member states before October 1, 2024[2].
