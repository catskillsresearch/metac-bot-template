(a) **Time until Outcome Known:**  
The 2024 Warhammer 40,000 World Team Championship takes place from August 8th to 11th, 2024. As of July 25, about two weeks remain until the outcome is known.

(b) **Status Quo Outcome if Nothing Changed:**  
Historically, powerhouses like England and USA consistently perform well at the WTC, often finishing near the top. England has been a perennial contender, and both USA and France have had strong showings in recent years. Sweden, while competitive, is usually slightly behind these teams in terms of final placement[1]. If past trends hold, it is most probable that one of these four teams will be in serious contention, with England and USA as slight favorites.

(c) **No Outcome Scenario:**  
A No outcome occurs if none of USA, Sweden, England, or France win the championship. This could result from:
- An upset victory by a dark horse, such as Germany (the defending champion and frequent podium finisher), Poland (historically strong), or rising competitors like Spain, Australia, or Belgium.
- Variance in team rosters, meta shifts, or matchup luck allowing a tier-two seed (e.g., Canada or Belgium) or even a breakthrough from a lower-seeded country to claim the title.

(d) **Yes Outcome Scenario:**  
A Yes outcome resolves if any one of the USA, Sweden, England, or France finishes first and is declared the WTC champion. This is the most “expected” outcome, relying on continued strong performance, consistent team composition, and adaptation to the latest game meta by these traditional powerhouse teams.

## **Rationale**

- **Status Quo Weight:**  
In competitive Warhammer 40,000, results at the top end are relatively stable year-to-year, with a small set of nations (including the queried four) almost always finishing near the top. England and USA in particular have outstanding records and resources, and France also has a history of strong play[1].

- **Meta and Roster Shifts:**  
Large meta shifts (changes in most competitive factions or strategies) can disrupt expectations, but evidence from recent tournaments and kill team stats indicate that top teams rapidly adapt to balance updates and meta changes[2][3].

- **Field Strength:**  
There are 40 teams this year, including several first-time entrants and a few strong returning teams (e.g., Germany, Poland, Spain, Australia). While upsets are possible, the gap in depth and experience between the likes of England/USA and most other teams remains significant.

- **Uncertainty Factors:**  
- Lack of recent public data on exact rosters and preparation for the four teams in question adds slight risk.
- The Swiss-format finals allow for high-variance pairings, which sometimes favors a well-prepared underdog, but top teams are typically resilient to random pairings due to their depth.

## **Final Probability Estimate**

Given the historical dominance of these teams, the structure of the event, and the relatively slow change in competitive Warhammer outcomes at the top level, the probability that USA, Sweden, England, or France win the 2024 WTC is **high**—but not certain.

**Probability: 70%**
