(a) **Time left until outcome is known**:  
The outcome should be known in early December 2024, when the FBI reports November's NICS background check numbers. That is about 2-3 weeks from the current date (2024-11-19).

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed**:  
In November 2023, unadjusted NICS checks totaled 2,652,870, which is about 147,000 below the 2.8M threshold[5]. November 2022 was slightly higher, at 2,788,138[5]. The recent norm has been for November's unadjusted NICS checks to fall just short of 2.8M. If there is growth consistent with the recent upward year-over-year trend (especially post-July 2024), the number could surpass the threshold, but the status quo is that November checks are somewhat below 2.8M[5].

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome**:  
If the year-over-year increase observed since July 2024 is modest or similar to the growth seen between November 2022 and November 2023 (where the number actually declined by about 5% unadjusted), or if there is no significant surge related to the 2024 presidential election, the total could remain between 2.6M and 2.75M—producing a No outcome[5].

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome**:  
If the upward trend accelerates in November 2024—driven by heightened election-year anxiety, holiday seasonality, and strong Black Friday sales (typically one of the busiest days for background checks)—it is plausible that unadjusted NICS checks will exceed the 2.8M mark. This would be in line with historic spikes seen in certain election years or in response to policy uncertainty[5].

## Rationale

Recent history shows November NICS checks usually fall slightly below 2.8M unadjusted[5]. However, the market has trended upward since July 2024, and November's volume is typically boosted by Black Friday-related demand[5]. Major elections have historically produced surges in background checks, but the most recent relevant data (November 2023) was still below 2.8M[5]. The upward trend since July 2024 is encouraging for a "Yes," but as the world changes slowly and no evidence indicates a dramatic acceleration, the base rate should be weighted more heavily.

## Judgment

Given the data:
- Status quo (sub-2.8M) is slightly likelier based on the last two Novembers.
- There is evidence of rising demand (year-over-year increases since summer 2024; likely strong Black Friday)[5].
- The election could produce an unusual surge, but no datapoint yet suggests a spike of this magnitude.

**Probability: 45%**  
It is somewhat more likely than not that the count remains below 2.8M, but a substantial surge is plausible given the election and rising trend.
