(a) Time left until outcome: The outcome will be known in January 2025, after the December 2024 rainfall data is released (about 8 months from now).

(b) Status quo outcome: Based on historical averages, Brasília typically receives between 207-396mm of rainfall in December, which is well above the 150mm threshold.

(c) Scenario for No outcome: If the current drought conditions persist and intensify through the end of 2024, coupled with the unusual heat patterns observed this year, Brasília could experience a significantly drier-than-normal December with rainfall falling below the 150mm threshold.

(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: If weather patterns return to more typical conditions by December, or if the end of the drought results in a return to normal precipitation patterns, Brasília would likely receive its usual substantial December rainfall of over 150mm.

The question asks whether Brasília, Brazil will receive more than 150mm of rainfall in December 2024. As a professional forecaster, I need to carefully analyze the historical data and current conditions to provide an accurate probability estimate.

December is historically Brasília's wettest month, with substantial rainfall typically recorded. Based on the search results, Brasília receives approximately 396mm of rainfall over 21 days in December according to one source[5], while another reports an average of 207mm with 21 rainy days[3]. Both of these figures significantly exceed the 150mm threshold in question.

The historical pattern strongly suggests that December rainfall in Brasília normally surpasses 150mm by a considerable margin. Different meteorological sources consistently show December averages ranging from approximately 207mm to 396mm[3][5], with about 21-22 rainy days during the month.

However, I must consider the recent unusual weather patterns affecting the region. Brasília has just experienced a record-breaking drought, with 167 consecutive days without rainfall. Additionally, September 2024 was recorded as the hottest September in 63 years, and INMET expects 2024 to be among the top 5 hottest years on record. These factors could potentially disrupt the typical rainfall patterns.

The El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycle can also influence Brazilian rainfall patterns, though the search results don't provide specific information about the current or projected ENSO status for December 2024.

While the recent drought is concerning, it's important to note that December remains the wettest month even in challenging years. The strong seasonal pattern of December rainfall in Brasília suggests that even with drought conditions earlier in the year, the region often receives substantial rainfall during this peak wet season month. The question mentions that the drought has already broken, which could indicate a return to more normal precipitation patterns.

The historical data shows that December rainfall in Brasília typically exceeds 150mm by a wide margin. Even if rainfall is somewhat below average due to lingering drought effects or unusual heat, there remains a strong likelihood that the 150mm threshold would still be reached. However, I must acknowledge the uncertainty introduced by the exceptional climate conditions observed in 2024.
