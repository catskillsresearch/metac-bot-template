(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  
There are approximately 28 days remaining until the final outcome is determined (from September 2 to October 1, 2024).

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
As of September 2, 2024, Super Micro Computer, Inc. (SMCI) has *not* filed its 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, and has only submitted a Form 12b-25 (notice of late filing), which extends the deadline by 15 calendar days to about September 13–14, 2024[2][3]. If nothing changes (i.e., SMCI does not file the 10-K), the outcome will be **No**.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
SMCI fails to resolve the issues preventing the timely filing of its 10-K and misses both the original and the extended deadline provided by Form 12b-25. No Form 10-K appears on the SEC EDGAR site for the relevant fiscal year by 11:59 p.m. ET on September 30, 2024[2][3].

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
SMCI completes its audit and other required processes, files its Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, on or before September 30, 2024, and the filing appears on the SEC EDGAR page specified in the question[2][3].

## Rationale

- **Weight of status quo:**  
Good forecasting practice gives extra weight to the status quo, particularly when there is no explicit, public commitment to resolve a delay and no new filing date announced.
- **Historical context:**  
SMCI generally has a record of timely filings, but the 2024 delay is official: the company filed a Form 12b-25, which reflects an inability to meet the standard deadline[1][2].
- **Nature of the delay and uncertainty:**  
The 12b-25 grants a 15-day extension, making mid-September the next decision point[2]. However, companies sometimes miss even this extension. No communication from SMCI has committed to a specific new filing date, nor has the company provided details about the cause or expected duration of the delay[1][2].
- **Financial data availability:**  
While Q4/full-year results have been released, this only indicates that some financial preparation is complete, not that regulatory or audit issues aren’t present[4].
- **Risks and red flags:**  
Recent investigative reports and historical context suggest SMCI has faced corporate governance and accounting scrutiny in the past, increasing the risk of prolonged delays[5]. However, there is no public evidence as of the cut-off date of a more severe issue (such as a formal SEC investigation or restatement) that would *necessarily* preclude timely filing.

## Final Assessment

- There is no evidence of an insurmountable obstacle, but the lack of a new expected filing date and the official notification of delay weigh against a quick resolution.
- Most companies filing a 12b-25 do ultimately meet the extended deadline, but a non-trivial fraction do not, and the risk is higher when there is no clarity about the reasons for delay.
- Given the above, the base rate for 10-Ks filed *after* a 12b-25 varies by situation, but an estimate of 60–80% eventual timely compliance (by the 15-day window) is typical for large, public companies not in obvious distress, possibly lower given SMCI’s recent scrutiny.

**Probability: 70%**  
That SMCI will file its 10-K for FY 2024 before October 1, 2024, per the SEC EDGAR source[2][3].
