(a) Time left until outcome: 3 days (from February 7, 2025 to February 9, 2025)
(b) Status quo outcome: No. As of now, there is no confirmation that Elon Musk will attend the Super Bowl LIX.
(c) Scenario for No outcome: Elon Musk decides not to attend the Super Bowl due to other commitments, personal reasons, or simply lack of interest in the event, despite speculation about his potential attendance with President Trump.
(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: Elon Musk decides to join President Trump's entourage as a special guest, given their public alignment on various issues, and attends the Super Bowl LIX at Caesars Superdome in New Orleans.

Based on the available information, I'll assess the probability of Elon Musk attending Super Bowl LIX on February 9, 2025.

The search results indicate that there is speculation about Elon Musk possibly joining President Donald Trump at Super Bowl LIX[1]. The headline from one of the sources directly asks "Will Elon Musk join Donald Trump in the Super Bowl LIX," suggesting this is a topic of public interest and discussion. This implies there might be some connection or possibility of Musk attending, but it falls short of confirming his attendance.

What we do know with certainty is that President Trump will be attending the Super Bowl and making history as the first sitting president to attend this event[1][2]. His confirmed companions include House Speaker Mike Johnson and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem[1]. The full traveling party has not been announced yet.

The speculation about Musk's attendance likely stems from his known association with President Trump. However, mere association doesn't guarantee attendance at a specific event. Without explicit confirmation from Musk himself or official sources, I must consider this a speculative possibility rather than a likely occurrence.

The status quo in forecasting is particularly important here - without confirmed reports of planned attendance, the default assumption should be non-attendance. High-profile figures like Musk have demanding schedules and numerous commitments, making attendance at any specific event uncertain unless explicitly confirmed.

While there's clearly media interest in whether Musk will join Trump at the Super Bowl, the search results provide no concrete evidence that Musk has made plans to attend or has been officially invited as part of Trump's entourage. The article mentions that "people has one name in their mind" which suggests Musk is being discussed as a potential attendee, but this falls far short of confirmation[1].

Given the lack of explicit confirmation and the principle of defaulting to status quo, I assess that Musk is more likely not to attend than to attend. However, the public speculation and his connection to Trump do provide some non-trivial probability of attendance.

Probability: 25%
