(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
The February 2025 southwest land border encounter data will be published by US Customs and Border Protection after the month ends. The question states that if the data is not published by 3 PM Eastern on March 31, 2025, it will be annulled. So, as of February 17, 2025, approximately 6 weeks remain until the outcome is known.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
Encounters as of late 2024 and early 2025 are at their lowest since mid-2020, with daily averages roughly around 1,150 encounters per day in early January 2025. Assuming no major changes, February 2025 might have a similar daily average, implying a monthly total around 34,500 (1,150 Ã— 30 days).

(c) **Outcome if current trends continued:**  
The downward trend since mid-2024, driven by enforcement policies including the Presidential Proclamation and DHS-DOJ rule, suggests a further moderate decline or stabilization at low levels. Encounters for February 2025 could be slightly lower than January 2025, potentially in the range of 30,000 to 35,000 encounters for the month.

(d) **Expectations of experts and markets:**  
Experts and DHS data releases indicate encounters have dropped sharply since the end of Title 42 expulsions in May 2023 and more so after the 212(f) proclamation in mid-2024. The continued decrease and maintenance of historically low daily encounter averages suggest forecasting low encounter numbers for February 2025 compared to previous years[5].

(e) **Unexpected scenario resulting in a low outcome:**  
A significant diplomatic agreement between the US and Mexico/Guatemala further curtails migrant flows or a rapid improvement in economic conditions or security in origin countries sharply reduces migration incentives, causing February 2025 encounters to drop well below current levels, perhaps under 20,000 for the month.

(f) **Unexpected scenario resulting in a high outcome:**  
A sudden surge in migration due to political instability, natural disasters, or humanitarian crises in countries of origin or transit could sharply increase crossings. Also, a rollback or delay in enforcement policies or court injunctions limiting enforcement could raise encounters back toward mid-2023 levels or higher, potentially exceeding 50,000 for February 2025.

**Final Answer (in number of encounters for February 2025):**

Percentile 10: 20,000  
Percentile 20: 25,000  
Percentile 40: 30,000  
Percentile 60: 35,000  
Percentile 80: 40,000  
Percentile 90: 50,000  

This range reflects uncertainty around policy enforcement, seasonal migration patterns, and geopolitical factors, while centering around the current low trend observed through early 2025.
