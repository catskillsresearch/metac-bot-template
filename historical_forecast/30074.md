(a) **Time until outcome known:**  
As of November 14, 2024, there are approximately 1.5 months left until January 1, 2025, when the question’s outcome will be determined.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
The EUR/USD exchange rate has remained above 1.00 throughout 2024, with forecasts and recent market conditions suggesting continued stability above parity. If current trends persist, the euro will not fall below 1 US dollar before 2025, so the status quo outcome is **No**—the euro will not be worth less than 1 US dollar[2][3][4][5].

(c) **Scenario for a No outcome:**  
- The euro steadily trades in the 1.03–1.12 range through the end of 2024, as forecast by major banks and analysts, driven by ongoing but moderate ECB easing, modest Eurozone growth, and a cautious US Federal Reserve policy[2][4][5].
- No significant geopolitical or economic shocks occur, and central bank policies evolve as currently anticipated.

(d) **Scenario for a Yes outcome:**  
- An unexpected, high-impact event occurs that sharply weakens the euro or strengthens the dollar, such as a severe Eurozone financial crisis, major political instability, or an abrupt shift in ECB/Fed policy substantially widening the interest rate differential[1][4].
- A short-term panic or sudden financial shock triggers a rapid sell-off in the euro, momentarily driving the EUR/USD rate below parity, even if only for a brief period.

## Rationale

The overwhelming majority of authoritative forecasts—including those from JPMorgan, ING, FXOpen, and other analysts—see the EUR/USD rate remaining above 1.00 for the remainder of 2024 and into 2025[1][2][4][5]. Interest rate differentials and monetary policy expectations both support a stronger dollar, but not to the degree required to bring the euro below dollar parity in the absence of a major shock[1][4].

While there is always inherent risk in currency markets due to their responsiveness to global events, the current baseline outlook—supported by both macroeconomic data and central bank policy guidance—is for continued euro stability above 1.00[2][4][5]. Historical precedent shows that the euro only briefly dipped below parity during exceptional circumstances (as in late 2022), and the recovery since then has been relatively stable.

A breach of parity is possible but requires a notable negative surprise not priced by markets or anticipated by analysts. Good forecasters give extra weight to the status quo and consensus scenario, unless there is strong evidence of an impending regime change—which is not present here.

## Final Answer

Probability: **10%**

This reflects a low, but non-negligible, chance of a brief dip below parity due to unforeseen shocks, but the expert consensus and current trajectory imply a strong likelihood the euro remains above 1 US dollar through the end of 2024[1][2][4][5].
