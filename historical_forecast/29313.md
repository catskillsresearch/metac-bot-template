Based on the available polling data, I'll analyze the likelihood of the same presidential candidate winning both Michigan and Wisconsin in the 2024 election.

(a) Time left until outcome is known: Approximately 7 days. Election Day is November 5, 2024, and we should have projections within a day or two afterward.

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: The same candidate winning both states. In recent elections (2016, 2020), Michigan and Wisconsin voted for the same presidential candidate, showing a high correlation in their voting patterns.

(c) Scenario for a No outcome: Given the extremely tight races in both states, differential turnout operations could lead to Harris narrowly winning Michigan while Trump takes Wisconsin, or vice versa. For example, if union turnout is stronger in Michigan while rural turnout is higher in Wisconsin, we could see a split result.

(d) Scenario for a Yes outcome: The strong gender divide present in both states continues to play out similarly, with women supporting Harris and men supporting Trump in roughly equal proportions. This parallel demographic dynamic, combined with the historically correlated voting patterns of these states, leads to the same candidate winning both.

## Analysis of Current Polling

The most recent Quinnipiac poll (October 23, 2024) shows Harris leading Trump by 3 points in Michigan (49% to 46%) while they're tied at 48% each in Wisconsin[1]. Just two weeks earlier, on October 9, Quinnipiac showed Trump leading in both states - by 3 points in Michigan (50% to 47%) and 2 points in Wisconsin (48% to 46%)[2]. 

This demonstrates both the volatility of the polling and the similar movement in both states. When Harris gained ground in mid-October, she gained in both states; when Trump was ahead earlier in October, he led in both states.

## Historical Correlation

Michigan and Wisconsin have historically voted similarly in presidential elections. Both states were part of the "Blue Wall" that voted Democratic from 1992 to 2012. Both flipped to Trump in 2016, and both flipped back to Biden in 2020. This suggests a strong correlation in how these neighboring Midwestern states vote.

## Demographic Similarities

The current polling shows nearly identical gender gaps in both states:
- In Michigan, women support Harris 57-37%, while men back Trump 56-40%
- In Wisconsin, women support Harris 57-39%, while men back Trump 59-38%[1]

These remarkably similar demographic splits suggest that the fundamental factors driving voter preferences are aligned across both states.

## Volatility and Uncertainty

While polling suggests a high probability of the same outcome, there is notable volatility. The gap between Harris and Trump has shifted by several points in just two weeks, indicating voter preferences remain somewhat fluid. Additionally, polls from July showed Trump leading Harris in both states, with the races tied in Wisconsin[5].

The extremely tight margins in both states mean that small differences in turnout or late shifts could produce different outcomes. However, the consistent movement of both states together in the polls suggests that any late shifts are likely to affect both states similarly.

## Final Assessment

Given the historical correlation between Michigan and Wisconsin, the similar demographic patterns in current polling, and the consistent movement in polling over time, the most likely outcome is that the same candidate will win both states. However, the extremely tight margins create meaningful uncertainty.

The status quo of correlated outcomes across these neighboring Midwestern states with similar demographic profiles is the most reasonable baseline expectation, though the closeness of both races means a split result remains quite possible.

Probability: 75%
