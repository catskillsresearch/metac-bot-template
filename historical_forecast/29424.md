As a professional forecaster, I'll analyze Missouri Amendment 7's prospects methodically.

(a) Time until outcome: 5 days (November 5, 2024 is Election Day)

(b) Status quo outcome: Amendment 7 does not exist in current law. If nothing changes, ranked-choice voting would remain technically possible in Missouri, though it's not currently used at the state level. St. Louis has a nonpartisan election system with approval voting.

(c) Scenario for No outcome: Public awareness grows about Amendment 7's true purpose of limiting voting options. Voters recognize the redundancy of the citizenship provision (already law) and reject the amendment as an unnecessary restriction on local control. Editorial endorsements against the measure like The Kansas City Star's gain traction, and voters who previously supported election reforms turn out to oppose the amendment.

(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: The dual-purpose nature of Amendment 7 succeeds in attracting voters who strongly support the citizenship requirement while obscuring the ranked-choice voting ban. Conservative messaging about "protecting elections" resonates with the state's predominantly conservative electorate. Limited opposition fails to educate voters about the amendment's implications, and it passes comfortably.

## Analysis of Amendment 7's Prospects

Missouri Amendment 7 would accomplish two things:
- Prohibit ranked-choice or approval voting in all Missouri elections
- Add constitutional language explicitly forbidding noncitizens from voting in elections (though state law already prohibits this)[1][3]

The polling available suggests strong support for the amendment. A poll from Public Opinion Strategies found that 62% of respondents support Amendment 7, though with a limited sample size of 600 registered voters[5]. Without additional polling, it's difficult to gauge public opinion with complete confidence, but this single poll suggests significant support.

**Factors favoring passage:**

1. **Bundling with popular provision:** The amendment combines a ban on ranked-choice voting with language about citizen-only voting, which critics call "ballot candy" - something that looks appealing but doesn't actually change anything substantive since noncitizens already cannot vote in Missouri[5]. This bundling approach may attract voters who strongly support citizenship requirements.

2. **Conservative state politics:** Missouri is a predominantly Republican state that has trended conservative in recent years. Republican lawmakers introduced this measure through SJR78, sponsored by Sen. Ben Brown[5]. Conservative messaging around "fortifying" elections and ensuring "every Missourian's voice is heard" could resonate with the state's electorate.

3. **Limited opposition:** There appears to be limited organized opposition to the amendment. While The Kansas City Star has endorsed a "No" vote, the search results don't indicate a strong, well-funded campaign against the measure[5].

**Factors opposing passage:**

1. **Editorial opposition:** The Kansas City Star has endorsed a "No" vote on the amendment[5], which could influence some voters.

2. **Previous reform support:** Missouri voters have "already shown they support comprehensive election reform"[5], suggesting some receptivity to alternative voting methods.

3. **Potential voter education:** If voters understand that the citizenship provision is redundant and the primary effect is to ban alternative voting methods, some might oppose the restriction on local control.

## Context of Status Quo

Currently, Missouri does not use ranked-choice voting at the state level, though St. Louis has implemented nonpartisan elections with approval voting. The amendment would not retroactively affect nonpartisan municipal elections passed as of November 5, 2024, meaning St. Louis would not have to change its current system[5].

The status quo favors passage because:
- There's limited use of or familiarity with ranked-choice voting in Missouri
- The amendment packages a voting restriction with a superficially popular citizenship requirement
- Conservative messaging about "protecting elections" aligns with the state's political leanings

## Final Assessment

While Amendment 7 represents a significant change in restricting future voting options, its packaging with a citizenship requirement that's already law makes it likely to pass. The limited polling available shows 62% support, and the state's conservative political climate favors passage. The opposition appears relatively limited, and the amendment's framing obscures its primary purpose of limiting alternative voting methods.

Given the bundling strategy, the state's political climate, the poll showing 62% support, and the limited organized opposition, Amendment 7 is highly likely to pass.

Probability: 78%
