(a) Time left until outcome: Approximately 7.5 months (from today's date of May 6, 2025 until January 1, 2025)

(b) Status quo outcome: No attack on the Crimean Bridge since the last confirmed strike in July 2023

(c) No outcome scenario: Ukraine continues to prioritize other military targets as the bridge's strategic value has diminished, with Russia using alternative supply routes while maintaining strong defensive measures around the bridge.

(d) Yes outcome scenario: Ukraine executes a planned attack on the bridge for symbolic reasons or to further degrade Russian logistics, successfully penetrating Russian defenses despite their enhanced protective measures.

Based on the current information as of May 6, 2025, I assess that an attack on the Crimean Bridge before January 1, 2025 is unlikely for several key reasons.

First, the strategic value of the bridge appears to have significantly diminished. According to Ukrainian Navy spokesperson Dmytro Pletenchuk in June 2024, destroying the Kerch Bridge "would not have the same effect now because Russia barely uses it for military purposes anymore"[5]. This assessment is supported by analysis from the investigative group Molfar, which found that over a three-month period in 2024, only one military freight train carrying around 55 fuel cars crossed the bridge[5]. Since the 2023 attack, "no trains with military cargo have been observed at Taman Station heading toward the Crimean Bridge"[4].

Russia has effectively adapted its logistics by developing alternative supply routes. Moscow has "switched to using overland routes in annexed eastern Ukraine to supply its front lines after repeated attacks by Ukraine on the Kerch Bridge"[2]. Additionally, Russia now uses a ferry crossing in Kerch for the majority of cargo transit, with the bridge accounting for less than a quarter of the total transiting cargo[5].

Russia has also significantly enhanced its defensive measures around the bridge. Analysis indicates that Russia is "rushing to complete huge new defenses of the Kerch Bridge"[3] and has "tried to minimize the high-risk cargoes crossing the bridge so that any attack won't be amplified by cargo being hit"[3]. These defensive adaptations make a successful attack increasingly difficult to execute.

While Lieutenant General Ben Hodges stated in an interview that "that bridge at some point in 2024 will be gone"[1], this prediction was likely made before the recent shift in the bridge's strategic importance became apparent. The Ukrainian military's resources are finite, and allocating them to attack a target with diminished military value would be questionable from a strategic perspective.

It's worth noting that previous predictions about attacks on the bridge have not always materialized. For example, there were reports suggesting a possible attack around Putin's inauguration on May 7, 2024, but this did not occur.

The status quo has remained stable for nearly two years since the last successful attack in July 2023. While Ukraine maintains the capability to attempt such an attack, the strategic incentives have shifted significantly, with the military value of such an operation now being questioned by Ukrainian officials themselves.

Considering all these factors—the diminished strategic importance of the bridge, Russia's adaptation to alternative supply routes, enhanced Russian defensive measures, and the lack of attacks since July 2023 despite previous predictions—I assess that an attack on the Crimean Bridge before January 1, 2025 is unlikely.

Probability: 25%
