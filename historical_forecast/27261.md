(a) **Time until outcome is known:**  
As of August 19, 2024, there are 2 days until the forecast window opens (August 21), and 23 days until it closes (September 11).

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
The most significant recent geomagnetic event was a G4 (Severe) storm with Kp = 8 on August 12, 2024, caused by a CME[2]. There is no data on Kp values exceeding 8 so far. If geomagnetic activity remains at its recent levels—with recurring moderate to strong storms but no evidence of more extreme disturbances—the likeliest status quo is that the highest Kp index in the period will be in or just below the range queried (greater than 6 and up to 8).

(c) **Scenario for a No outcome:**  
The No outcome would occur if, during August 21–September 11, 2024, no geomagnetic storm reaches a Kp above 6, or if any event exceeding Kp 6 also exceeds Kp 8 (i.e., is a G5/extreme, Kp > 8), or if the period only sees minor/moderate storms (Kp ≤ 6).

(d) **Scenario for a Yes outcome:**  
A Yes outcome will occur if, during the period, the strongest geomagnetic storm observed reaches a Kp greater than 6 and less than or equal to 8 (that is, Kp is in the range (6, 8]), according to the official running 30-day record from the German Research Center for Geosciences.

## Rationale

**Weighting the Status Quo:**  
Statistically, the occurrence of a Kp in the (6, 8] range (i.e., G3–G4, strong to severe, but not extreme, geomagnetic storms) is much more common than either the absence of strong storms (Kp ≤ 6) or the rarest extreme storms (Kp > 8). The recent G4 event (Kp = 8) demonstrates that the Sun is in an active phase, with Solar Cycle 25 exceeding earlier expectations and repeating high but not extreme Kp values. Active sunspot regions such as AR3697 have been capable of producing the necessary activity multiple times this solar cycle[1][2].

**Space Weather Forecasting Limitations:**  
Forecast skill for geomagnetic storms rarely extends beyond a few days. The period in question is nearly three weeks long, but the persistence of high solar activity (multiple active sunspots, recently recurring strong CMEs) means the risk of further G3-G4 (Kp 7–8) level events remains elevated, even if it is impossible to forecast particular CMEs that far in advance. The scenario of "no strong storms" is less supported by recent solar trends and observations.

**AR3697 and Solar Rotation:**  
AR3697 (previously AR3664) has been rotating into view every ~27 days and producing significant activity each pass, although somewhat reduced relative to its record-breaking May 2024 outburst[2][1]. As of late June and into early July, solar activity was moderate to high, with M-class and occasional X-class flares still reported[1]. Given this pattern and the solar cycle's advancement, another G3–G4 storm in late August or early September is plausible but by no means guaranteed.

**Uncertainties and Extreme Event Probability:**  
A "Yes" outcome is most likely, but a "No" remains possible if activity unexpectedly abates, if storms are only weak/moderate, or if a black swan/extremely rare (Kp > 8) event occurs. However, extreme (Kp > 8) storms are statistically much less likely than G3–G4-level storms.

## Probabilistic Judgment

Given the recent G4 storm (Kp = 8) and high ongoing solar activity, the most probable outcome for the period August 21–September 11, 2024, is at least one geomagnetic storm with Kp in the range (>6, ≤8), but not exceeding Kp = 8. The background rate and solar conditions both favor the "Yes" range, with the "No" case requiring either an anomalous quiet period or a rare, more extreme event.

**Probability: 70%**
