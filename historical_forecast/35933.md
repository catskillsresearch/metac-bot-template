(a) Time left until outcome: 26 days (from May 6, 2025 until April 1, 2025 - though this is already in the past since we're in May)

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: The objective would remain marked as "in progress" in the Project 2025 Tracker spreadsheet.

(c) Scenario resulting in a No outcome: The Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) continues to operate with federal funding through the 2025 fiscal year, with states actively administering the program and accepting applications. The Project 2025 Tracker spreadsheet continues to mark the elimination objective as "in progress" since the program remains operational.

(d) Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome: Unexpected legislative action or executive order terminated LIHEAP funding and program operations before April 1, 2025, and the Project 2025 Tracker spreadsheet was updated to reflect this elimination as "complete."

Based on the available information, I can provide a comprehensive analysis of whether the Project 2025 Tracker spreadsheet will mark the objective of eliminating LIHEAP as complete by April 1, 2025.

Looking at the current evidence, LIHEAP appears to be fully operational across multiple states well into 2025. In Pennsylvania, the program is accepting applications from November 4, 2024, to April 18, 2025, offering cash grants ranging from $200 to $1,000 based on household circumstances[3]. Similarly, Indiana's Energy Assistance Program (their implementation of LIHEAP) indicates operations continuing until at least October 1, 2025[5].

The federal nature of LIHEAP is consistent across states, with documentation from Pennsylvania describing it as "a federally-funded program which enables the state to help low-income households meet their home heating needs"[2]. This is echoed by other states' descriptions of the program[4][5].

A particularly compelling piece of evidence is Pennsylvania's 2025 State Plan for LIHEAP, which details the continued administration of the program[2]. This suggests not only that the program exists, but that there is formal planning and budgeting for its operation throughout 2025.

Since the current date (May 6, 2025) is past the April 1, 2025 resolution date, we would already know the outcome. Given the evidence showing LIHEAP's continued operation with states actively accepting applications and distributing benefits after April 1, it is highly unlikely that the Project 2025 Tracker would have marked the elimination objective as complete.

Good forecasting practice emphasizes the inertia of government programs - they tend to continue unless specific legislative or executive actions terminate them. The search results provide no indication of any such termination action. Instead, they show active program administration across multiple states extending well beyond April 1, 2025.

Looking specifically at Pennsylvania's LIHEAP applications being accepted until April 18, 2025[3] and Indiana's program planning continuation until October 2025[5], it's clear that LIHEAP remained operational past the resolution date. Therefore, the Project 2025 Tracker would almost certainly continue to mark the elimination objective as "in progress" rather than "complete."
