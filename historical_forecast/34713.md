Looking at this forecasting question about Google Maps renaming the Gulf of Mexico to Gulf of America, I'll analyze the situation systematically.

(a) Time left until outcome is known: Approximately 55 days (from May 6, 2025 to April 1, 2025). However, since April 1, 2025 has already passed, we now have complete information about whether this event occurred before the deadline.

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: The Gulf of Mexico would continue to be labeled as "Gulf of Mexico" on Google Maps.

(c) Scenario resulting in a No outcome: Google delayed implementing the name change despite the Trump administration's executive order. This could have happened if the federal mapping database updates were delayed, if there were technical challenges in implementing the change, or if political or public pressure caused Google to reconsider the implementation timeline.

(d) Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome: The federal mapping database was updated promptly after the Trump administration's executive order in January 2025, and Google quickly implemented the change in their maps system for U.S. users before April 1, 2025.

Based on the information available, Google announced on January 27, 2025, that they would rename the Gulf of Mexico to "Gulf of America" for U.S. users once the federal mapping database reflected the changes ordered by the Trump administration[1]. However, as of that announcement, the change had not yet been implemented.

Looking at this from a forecasting perspective, we need to consider several factors:

First, the timing is critical. The announcement was made on January 27, 2025, giving Google approximately 2 months to implement the change before the April 1, 2025 deadline. While this seems like sufficient time, Google specifically mentioned they were waiting for updates to the official government sources[1].

Second, bureaucratic processes often take longer than expected. The U.S. Department of the Interior indicated they were working "expeditiously" to fulfill Trump's order[1], but government database updates frequently encounter delays.

Third, the change is technically complex since Google plans to display different names to different users based on their location - "Gulf of America" for U.S. users, "Gulf of Mexico" for Mexican users, and both names for users in other countries[1].

Given the status quo bias (that things change more slowly than we expect), and the dependency on government database updates before Google would implement the change, I would assign a relatively low probability to this change being completed before April 1, 2025.

However, we must also consider that Google's announcement indicated a clear intention to make this change, and the Trump administration appeared to be prioritizing it. The executive order had already been issued and the Department of the Interior had declared the name changes official[1].

Weighing these factors and giving extra weight to the status quo (that changes take time), I would assess that there was a moderate likelihood of the change being implemented before April 1, but still more likely than not that bureaucratic or technical delays would push implementation past the deadline.

Probability: 35%
