I'll approach this forecasting question systematically by analyzing the current data and potential scenarios.

(a) Time until outcome: 24 days (from May 6, 2025 to March 30, 2025)
   * Note: The question appears to contain a temporal inconsistency. Today's date is May 6, 2025, which is already past the resolution date of March 30, 2025.
   * However, I'll proceed as if we're forecasting from the last data point available in the search results (March 8, 2025).

(b) Status quo outcome: No - Claudia Sheinbaum maintains a higher approval rating than Javier Milei
   * Current gap: Sheinbaum (69%) leads Milei (62%) by 7 percentage points according to the most recent Morning Consult data from early March 2025.

(c) Scenario for No outcome (Sheinbaum maintains lead):
   * Sheinbaum continues implementing popular policies in Mexico, maintaining her strong 69% approval
   * Milei continues facing political opposition in Argentina and criticism over the $LIBRA cryptocurrency issue
   * The 7-point gap remains stable or widens as economic challenges in Argentina persist

(d) Scenario for Yes outcome (Milei overtakes Sheinbaum):
   * Milei's economic reforms begin showing positive results, boosting his approval significantly
   * Sheinbaum faces an unexpected political crisis or scandal in Mexico
   * Argentine citizens rally around Milei in response to opposition attacks, creating a surge of support

Now for my rationale:

The most recent data from Morning Consult (collected between February 27 and March 5, 2025) shows Claudia Sheinbaum with a 69% approval rating compared to Javier Milei's 62%[5]. This represents a substantial 7 percentage point gap that Milei would need to overcome in less than a month.

Looking at recent trends, we see that Sheinbaum's approval has actually increased from 66% in early February to 69% by early March[2][5]. Meanwhile, Milei's approval has decreased from 65% to 62% during roughly the same period[2][5]. This suggests the gap is widening rather than narrowing.

Milei faces significant political challenges that could inhibit approval growth. The search results indicate "high political tension" in Argentina, with intensified criticism from opposition sectors, particularly regarding a controversy surrounding cryptocurrency "$LIBRA"[5]. These political headwinds make rapid approval gains difficult.

While Milei maintains "solid support" from his base, the opposition from "Kirchnerist and leftist sectors" appears to be organized and vocal[5]. Such polarization typically constrains approval ceiling, making it difficult to achieve the dramatic gains needed to overtake Sheinbaum in just a few weeks.

The status quo strongly favors Sheinbaum maintaining her lead. A 7 percentage point gap is substantial in approval rating terms, and the momentum is currently in Sheinbaum's favor. Political approval ratings typically change gradually unless major events intervene, and there's no indication of imminent game-changing developments that would dramatically shift these trajectories.

For Milei to overtake Sheinbaum, we would need to see both a significant rise in his approval and a corresponding drop in hers. While not impossible, such a combined movement would require extraordinary circumstances not evidenced in the current data.

As a professional forecaster, I must acknowledge that approval ratings can fluctuate based on events not yet visible in the data. However, the weight of evidence - current gap size, recent trend direction, and political context - strongly suggests Sheinbaum will maintain her lead.

Probability: 15%
