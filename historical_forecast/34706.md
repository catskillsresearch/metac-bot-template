(a) Time left until outcome: 9 months and 25 days (from February 8, 2025, when the research was conducted, until the end of March 2025)

(b) Status quo outcome: Based on recent data, the status quo would be 10 approvals, as both March 2023 and March 2024 had exactly 10 arms sales approvals.

(c) Unexpected outcome scenario: A sudden diplomatic crisis emerges in early 2025 requiring rapid military support to multiple allies, leading to an unusually high number of expedited arms sale approvals (>15) in March 2025. Alternatively, a new administration policy temporarily freezing certain categories of arms sales could push the number below 5.

Looking at the data provided for US State Department arms sales approvals, I can identify several patterns and factors that will inform my forecast for March 2025.

## Historical March Patterns

March has shown a consistent pattern in recent years:
- March 2020: 4 approvals
- March 2021: 6 approvals
- March 2022: 4 approvals
- March 2023: 10 approvals
- March 2024: 10 approvals

The most recent two years show a clear stabilization at 10 approvals, which represents a significant increase from the 4-6 range in earlier years. This doubling suggests either a policy shift or changing global security dynamics that have persisted through 2023-2024.

## Seasonal and Annual Patterns

The data reveals some seasonal patterns:
- December tends to see higher numbers (17 in 2023, 15 in 2024, 15 in 2020)
- August shows considerable variability (22 in 2024 vs. 5 in 2023)
- The first quarter (Jan-Mar) typically shows moderate numbers

Looking at recent months, we see:
- January 2025: 5 approvals
- February 2025: 9 approvals

February 2025 included a major $7.4 billion arms sale to Israel notified on February 7th, indicating continued robust arms sales activity in early 2025.

## Recent Arms Sales Activity

Recent notifications from April 2025 (which occurred after the research date but before today's date in the scenario) show continued activity:
- April 29, 2025: Poland - AIM-120D missiles ($1.33 billion)
- April 28, 2025: Romania - PATRIOT Air Defense System ($280 million)
- April 25, 2025: Netherlands - Tomahawk missiles ($2.19 billion)
- April 23, 2025: Ireland - Javelin missiles ($46 million)
- April 14, 2025: Israel - Eitan powerpack engines ($180 million)

This indicates at least 5 approvals in April 2025, maintaining a relatively steady pace of arms sales approvals.

## Probability Assessment

Given these factors, I'll assess the probabilities for each range:

**0-5 approvals:** Historical data shows this range occurred in earlier years (2020-2022) but not in the most recent March periods. While a sudden policy shift could drive numbers down, the recent approval activity suggests this is unlikely. However, I need to account for unexpected outcomes like diplomatic tensions or policy changes.
**Probability: 15%**

**6-10 approvals:** This range includes both the recent March status quo (10) and slightly lower numbers that would still be consistent with the overall pattern. The consistency of the last two March periods at exactly 10 approvals gives this range strong support, reinforcing the status quo bias.
**Probability: 60%**

**>10 approvals:** While March hasn't exceeded 10 approvals in recent years, other months frequently do (December 2024: 15, August 2024: 22). Global security concerns or a backlog of approvals could push March 2025 into this range. The consistent upward trend in approvals over time provides some support for this possibility.
**Probability: 25%**

0-5: 15%
6-10: 60%
>10: 25%
