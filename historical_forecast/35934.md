To answer this forecasting question properly, I need to analyze the timeline, current status, and potential scenarios.

(a) Time left until outcome is known: 17 days (from May 6, 2025, to April 1, 2025 - which has already passed)

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: The objective would remain marked as "in progress" on the Project 2025 Tracker spreadsheet.

(c) Scenario resulting in a No outcome: The legal challenges to the transgender military ban continue to delay implementation through court injunctions, preventing the full expulsion of transgender service members by April 1, 2025.

(d) Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome: The court injunctions are overturned, allowing the Pentagon to complete the administrative separation of all transgender service members before April 1, 2025.

Based on the search results and the current date (May 6, 2025), I can provide a retrospective analysis of this question.

The search results show that on January 27, 2025, President Trump issued an Executive Order titled "Prioritizing Military Excellence and Readiness," which directed the Secretary of Defense to implement restrictions on transgender people in the Armed Forces[2]. Following this order, the Pentagon released a policy on February 27, 2025, described as "a complete ban on transgender military service" that would force out current service members and ban transgender people from enlisting[5].

According to the search results, the Department of Defense announced that service members diagnosed with gender dysphoria would be processed for separation[4]. The policy was characterized as "a complete purge of all transgender individuals from military service" with unprecedented scope and severity[5].

However, significant legal challenges emerged. On February 3, 2025, six transgender servicemembers and two individuals seeking to enlist asked a D.C. federal court to block enforcement of the ban while their lawsuit, Talbott v. Trump, proceeded[1]. The motion argued that the ban violated transgender servicemembers' right to equal protection by singling them out with an "irrational and prejudicial" policy[1].

Additionally, New York Attorney General Letitia James, along with a coalition of 20 attorneys general, filed an amicus brief on February 27, 2025, arguing that the ban was unconstitutional, discriminatory, and dangerous[3].

Given these legal challenges and the timing (with the Pentagon policy being released only about a month before the April 1 deadline), it is highly unlikely that the complete expulsion of all transgender service members could have been accomplished by April 1, 2025. The legal proceedings would have taken time to resolve, and even if the administration prevailed, implementing the separations would require administrative processes.

The status quo bias is particularly relevant here. Major policy changes, especially those facing legal challenges, typically take longer than expected to implement fully. The fact that multiple states and advocacy organizations were actively fighting the ban in court suggests that implementation would have been delayed beyond April 1, 2025.

Probability: 15%
