(a) **Time left until outcome known:**  
There are approximately 81 days remaining in the window (from July 11, 2024, to September 30, 2024) during which Starship launches could reach or surpass 160 km altitude and count toward the outcome.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
As of July 11, 2024, there are no Starship launches officially scheduled or publicly confirmed for the July 1 – September 30, 2024 window on SpaceX’s official manifest or third-party launch schedules[1][2][3]. If this remains unchanged (i.e., no launches occur, or none achieve 160 km), the outcome will be “No.”

(c) **Scenario for a No outcome:**  
No Starship launches occur between July 1 and September 30, 2024, or any launches attempted fail to reach at least 160 km altitude. Alternatively, more than two launches reach this threshold, or none do, both of which resolve the question as “No.”

(d) **Scenario for a Yes outcome:**  
Exactly one or exactly two Starship launches occur in this period, and each launch reaches at least 160 km altitude, as verified by official or credible sources.

## Rationale

- SpaceX has demonstrated increasing launch cadence historically, and Starship is technically capable, as shown by reaching 234 km on March 14, 2024[4][5].
- Despite Elon Musk’s stated ambition for “at least 6 more flights this year,” actual launch schedules are highly dynamic, and public timelines from SpaceX tend to be optimistic and often slip[4].
- The most authoritative and up-to-date launch trackers and SpaceX's official manifest do not list any Starship launches (test or operational) for July–September 2024[1][2][3].
- Starship launches are logistically and regulatorily complex, requiring FAA approval and coordination that usually becomes publicly visible before the event.
- SpaceX is agile and could announce or execute a flight with limited notice, but this has not occurred as of July 11, 2024.
- Given the lack of concrete evidence for even one launch, the base-rate or status quo outcome should be weighted heavily, as good forecasting practice suggests—particularly for uncertain, fast-changing programs like Starship.

## Final Answer

Probability: 10%  
Given the absence of publicly scheduled Starship launches in the target window, the likelihood that exactly 1 or 2 Starship launches will reach at least 160 km between July 1 and September 30, 2024 is low, but not zero, acknowledging the possibility of late-breaking or unscheduled flights[1][2][3].
