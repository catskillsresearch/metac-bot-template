Before offering my forecast, let me analyze the key components of this question:

(a) Time left until outcome: There are approximately 239 days between today (May 6, 2025) and December 31, 2024. This is actually a past date, so the outcome should already be known.

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: Marijuana has historically been classified as a Schedule I controlled substance since 1970.

(c) Scenario for No outcome: The DEA completes its review process following the May 2024 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, officially transfers marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III, and updates the official scheduling before December 31, 2024.

(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: The DEA's rescheduling process faces delays, legal challenges, or administrative hurdles that prevent the finalization of marijuana's rescheduling before December 31, 2024, leaving it as a Schedule I substance.

Based on the search results provided, I can offer a comprehensive forecast:

The Department of Justice (DOJ) proposed to transfer marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) on May 21, 2024[1]. This proposal followed an announcement from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) on August 30, 2023, recommending this rescheduling[2].

For marijuana to be officially rescheduled, several steps must occur. While HHS made the recommendation to the DEA, the final decision rests with the DEA, which is overseen by the Department of Justice and the U.S. Attorney General[2]. The Attorney General has the rulemaking authority to reschedule a substance, but must make findings that marijuana fits the criteria of Schedule III[2].

The rescheduling process includes a notice of proposed rulemaking (which occurred on May 21, 2024)[1][3], followed by a public comment period and review. According to the search results, the DEA announced in early 2024 that it would act on President Biden's call to reclassify marijuana, but this triggers "a long process of hearings and reviews that will not be completed until after the presidential election in November"[4].

This timeline suggests that while the process is underway, it's unlikely to be completed before December 31, 2024. The rescheduling process is typically lengthy and involves multiple steps, including DEA determination, rulemaking procedures, and implementation[5].

Additionally, there appears to be political resistance, with 25 Republican lawmakers sending a letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland protesting changes to federal marijuana laws[4]. This political opposition could potentially slow the process further.

Given the historical precedent for such regulatory changes to take considerable time, especially for controversial substances, and the explicit mention that the process would likely extend beyond November 2024, it is highly probable that marijuana will still be listed as a Schedule I controlled substance on December 31, 2024.

As a forecaster, I must place significant weight on the status quo outcome. Regulatory processes, especially those involving controlled substances, tend to move slowly. While there is clear momentum toward rescheduling, the timeline indicated in the search results suggests the process will extend into 2025.

Probability: 85%
