Based on the information about Alaska Ballot Measure 2 in the 2024 general election, I'll provide a forecast analysis for whether Alaska voters will approve this measure that would repeal ranked-choice voting and nonpartisan primaries.

(a) Time left until outcome is known: 6 days (from October 30, 2024, until Election Day on November 5, 2024)

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: Alaska would continue using the top-four primary system and ranked-choice voting in general elections, which was implemented after voters approved it in 2020.

(c) Scenario resulting in a No outcome: Alaskans for Better Elections and the "No on 2" campaign successfully convince voters that the current system provides more voter freedom and better representation. Their significantly larger funding ($675,724 in contributions as of August 10, 2024) allows for more effective campaign messaging. Voters who have become accustomed to the ranked-choice system over the past two years decide they prefer having more options in the general election and reject the repeal.

(d) Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome: The "Yes on 2" campaign and Alaskans for Honest Elections effectively argue that returning to partisan primaries and traditional voting would simplify the electoral process. Voters who found ranked-choice voting confusing or unnecessarily complex decide to revert to the more familiar system. Despite having less funding ($422,038 as of August 10, 2024), the campaign successfully taps into voter frustration with the current system.

## Rationale

Looking at the evidence, several factors influence my forecast:

**Recency of the current system:** Alaska voters only approved the ranked-choice voting system in 2020, and it has only been in use since 2022[4]. This short implementation period suggests two possibilities: either voters haven't had enough time to become comfortable with the new system (favoring repeal), or they haven't experienced enough problems to warrant changing back (favoring retention).

**Funding disparity:** Campaign finance reports through August 10, 2024, show that opponents of the repeal have raised significantly more money than supporters ($675,724 vs. $422,038)[4]. This funding advantage could translate to more effective messaging against the repeal.

**Uniqueness factor:** Alaska and Maine are currently the only two states with statewide ranked-choice voting[4]. If Alaska voters approve Ballot Measure 2, it would make Alaska the first state to implement and then repeal ranked-choice voting, which is a significant status quo disruption.

**Status quo bias:** As noted, forecasters should put extra weight on the status quo outcome since change tends to happen slowly. The current ranked-choice voting system is now the status quo, albeit a relatively new one. Voters often lean toward maintaining existing systems unless there's significant dissatisfaction.

**Nationwide trends:** As of September 10, 2024, there were 11 statewide ballot measures related to electoral system changes in nine states[4]. This suggests a broader national interest in voting system reforms, though it doesn't directly indicate which way Alaska voters might lean.

Without polling data on voter sentiment toward this specific measure, my forecast relies heavily on the funding advantage for the "No" campaign, the status quo bias, and the relatively short period the current system has been in place. The funding disparity suggests the "No" campaign may have more resources to convince voters. However, if voters have found the ranked-choice system confusing or unsatisfactory during its short implementation, they might be motivated to repeal it.

Given these considerations, I believe there's a slight edge toward maintaining the current system, but with significant uncertainty due to the limited information available.

Probability: 45%
