(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
The outcome will be determined after the market close on March 11, 2025. As today is March 3, 2025, there are 8 calendar days until the resolution—including 7 full trading days (since February 28 was the last close prior to Fashion Week and March 11 is the relevant end date).

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
If none of the stocks changed in price between the close on February 28, 2025, and the close on March 11, 2025, the relative change for all three would be 0.

(c) **Outcome if the current trend continued:**  
- Hermès: Up 23% YTD as of February 14, 2025 (outpacing LVMH’s 13%)[4].
- LVMH: Up 13% YTD as of February 14, 2025[4].
If these short-term trends continued linearly for another 7 trading days, Hermès would likely see the highest percentage change, perhaps in the low single digits over this period (for example, 2–3%), with LVMH and Dior trailing behind. Dior’s stock, not specifically broken out in the results, typically mirrors LVMH’s performance closely as it is the group’s holding company.

(d) **Expectations of experts and markets:**  
- Hermès is favored by analysts due to its strong earnings, industry-leading profit margins (EBIT 42.86%), and recent momentum[1][4].
- LVMH, while a global leader and more diversified, is seeing slower, steadier growth (EBIT 26.46%)[1][4].
- The luxury sector is expected to rebound in 2025 after a slower year, but Hermès is viewed as the best-positioned to outperform during event-driven periods like Paris Fashion Week[2][4].
- Historically, Paris Fashion Week brings extra attention and can boost stocks if collections are well-received, but single-week movements are usually muted unless driven by standout news or viral success.

(e) **Unexpected scenario resulting in a low outcome:**  
If overall global equity markets experience a sharp sell-off during the event (e.g., due to geopolitical shocks or a sudden economic downturn), all stocks could fall over the week, potentially resulting in a negative percentage change across the board. The lowest plausible outcome would be a synchronized decline, perhaps −4% to −7%, though the actual minimum per contest rules cannot be below 1.0.

(f) **Unexpected scenario resulting in a high outcome:**  
If, for example, Hermès unveils a highly acclaimed collection that generates exceptional social media buzz, celebrity endorsements, and stronger-than-expected wholesale orders, its stock could rally sharply—possibly up 5% or more within the week. A large strategic announcement (e.g., a major partnership or acquisition) during Fashion Week for any of the three could also trigger a similar jump.
