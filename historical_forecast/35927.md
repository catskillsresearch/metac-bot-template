(a) Time left until outcome is known: 25 days (from March 13, 2025 to April 1, 2025)

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: The General Services Administration (GSA) remains ranked #2 in Most Total Savings on DOGE's Agency Efficiency Leaderboard, behind the Department of Education.

(c) Scenario resulting in a No outcome: GSA continues its current pace of cost-cutting measures but doesn't implement any dramatic new initiatives. The Department of Education maintains its lead through April 1, 2025, keeping GSA in second place.

(d) Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome: GSA rapidly accelerates its efficiency measures in the remaining 25 days, possibly by terminating major contracts, implementing substantial workforce reductions, or identifying significant property consolidation savings that would propel it past the Department of Education in total savings by April 1, 2025.

Based on the available information, I need to assess the likelihood that the General Services Administration (GSA) will be ranked #1 in Most Total Savings on DOGE's Agency Efficiency Leaderboard by April 1, 2025.

As of March 2025, the Department of Education (ED) holds the top position, with GSA in second place. The search results show that ED has achieved this position through aggressive cost-cutting measures, particularly by canceling contracts and grants related to diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives, with nearly $900 million in savings reported. There is no indication in the provided information that GSA is poised to overtake ED within the next few weeks.

Looking at GSA's current activities, the agency has been recognized for its work with small businesses, earning an A+ rating from the Small Business Administration for the 14th consecutive year. GSA is also focused on optimizing its real estate portfolio and implementing various efficiency measures as outlined in its FY 2025 Congressional Justification. However, there's no evidence that these ongoing initiatives will generate sufficient savings to surpass ED's aggressive cuts by April 1, 2025.

The search results indicate that DOGE launched its Agency Efficiency Leaderboard in February 2025, creating competition among agencies to reduce costs. While this competitive environment might incentivize GSA to accelerate its cost-cutting efforts, the tight timeframe of just 25 days makes a dramatic shift in rankings unlikely.

GSA does have significant potential for savings, as noted in their FY 2025 Congressional Justification, with approximately 80 million rentable square feet of leased space expiring in the next 5 years. However, realizing these savings would likely occur over a longer timeframe rather than in the immediate future.

Putting extra weight on the status quo, as good forecasters should, it seems unlikely that GSA will overtake ED in the leaderboard rankings within such a short period. The Department of Education's aggressive approach to cost-cutting appears to have given it a substantial lead that would be difficult to overcome in just 25 days without extraordinary measures by GSA.

Probability: 15%
