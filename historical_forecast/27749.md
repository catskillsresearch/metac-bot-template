(a) **Time left until the outcome is known**  
The 2024 Speed Chess Championship is scheduled for September 6-8, 2024, and the outcome will be publicly known by the end of the tournament, a little more than a week from now (today is August 30, 2024). Barring delays or cancellation, the result will be revealed within approximately 1-2 weeks.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed**  
The current favorites, based on historical performance and ratings, are Magnus Carlsen and Hikaru Nakamura. While Alireza Firouzja is in exceptional form, the conventional expectation is that either Carlsen or Nakamura would win; thus, the status quo outcome is that Firouzja does *not* win the championship.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome**  
Firouzja loses to Nakamura in the semifinals, which is very plausible given Nakamura’s dominance in this event (five-time champion from 2017-2022 and formidable blitz expertise). Alternatively, Firouzja could defeat Nakamura, reach the final, and then lose to Magnus Carlsen (the defending champion and current world #1) or Hans Niemann. Any such loss means he does not win the championship.

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome**  
Firouzja defeats Nakamura in the semifinals—overcoming a player with a legendary Speed Chess Championship track record—and then triumphs in the final against either Carlsen (the defending champion and current world #1) or Niemann. This requires consecutive wins over perhaps the two best speed chess players of their generation, but recent results show Firouzja is capable of world-class performances.

## Rationale

- **Alireza Firouzja’s Current Form:**  
Firouzja is coming into the tournament in exceptional form, winning both the 2024 Saint Louis Rapid & Blitz and the 2024 Sinquefield Cup—both prestigious fast time control events—just weeks before the Speed Chess Championship[1][2][4]. He also secured a dominant quarterfinal victory over Fabiano Caruana to reach the semifinals[5].
  
- **Track Record Against the Field:**  
In May 2024, Firouzja defeated Magnus Carlsen twice in the Grand Final of the Chess.com Classic, a rare accomplishment suggesting he can indeed overcome the strongest blitz/rapid players even in high-stakes settings[3].
  
- **Opposition Strength:**  
The decisive challenge remains Nakamura in the semifinals, followed by likely Carlsen in the final. Nakamura’s repeated Speed Chess Championships and Carlsen’s historic blitz rating, plus his status as reigning champion, both establish Firouzja as an underdog in these potential matchups.

- **Historical Precedent:**  
Statistical models in similar events have given Carlsen overwhelming odds (e.g., 93% before Firouzja’s recent upset win in May[3]), and experts often estimate Firouzja’s chances in the 10-20% range against Carlsen head-to-head. Nakamura, with a tournament format tailored to his strengths, typically commands heavy favoritism over any opponent.

- **Status Quo Weight:**  
Good forecasting practice places extra weight on baseline expectations—Nakamura and Carlsen’s established dominance in this format. Firouzja’s outstanding hot streak increases his chances, but the burden remains high; strong recent form improves his probability but does not make him the favorite.

## Final Probability

Given the competition’s format, Firouzja’s need to consecutively beat both Nakamura and either Carlsen or Niemann, and the historical dominance of his two main rivals—even factoring in his recent surge in blitz and rapid:

**Probability: 20%**

This estimate recognizes Firouzja as a legitimate contender with a real shot, thanks to his excellent form and recent big wins, but maintains Nakamura and Carlsen as the most likely victors given their records and status quo expectation[1][2][3][4][5].
