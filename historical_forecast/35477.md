(a) **Time until outcome known:**  
Just over 1 month remains until April 1, 2025.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changes:**  
The most recent OCHA impact snapshot (as referenced in the question background and supporting documents) is from February 11, 2025, and shows 277 UN staff reported as working in Gaza. If no newer snapshot is released by OCHA before April 1, or if staffing levels do not increase in a subsequent update, the official outcome will be **No**[4].

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
If the humanitarian and security situation remains as constrained as it is now—characterized by continued Israeli military operations, evacuation orders, and logistical difficulties—or if OCHA does not release a new impact snapshot before April 1, the reported number of UN staff is likely to remain below 290. In this scenario, numbers stay at or near 277, and the answer resolves as No[4][5].

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
A marked increase in humanitarian access, the implementation of additional phases of the current ceasefire, or a targeted surge in UN staffing (perhaps in response to critical needs or improved operational conditions) could enable more UN staff to enter and be reported as working in Gaza before April 1. If OCHA publishes a new snapshot in March showing 290 or more staff, that would result in Yes[4][5].

## Rationale

The best available evidence indicates the number of UN staff in Gaza was most recently reported as 277 as of February 11, 2025. While the 2025 humanitarian Flash Appeal signals the UN's intent to expand relief efforts[5], the "constrained operating environment" and consistent references to logistics and security challenges[4][5] make a large, rapid staffing increase unlikely in the short term.

OCHA’s update frequency typically ranges from bi-weekly to monthly, so there is a possibility of an updated snapshot before April 1, 2025. However, unless there is a significant positive shift in conditions or explicit new operational policy (for which there is currently no public indication), the most likely scenario is continuation of the status quo. Given the dangers and access restrictions, as well as the pattern of staffing reported so far, historical inertia should be weighted heavily.

While a ceasefire began in January, subsequent reports indicate humanitarian scale-up has been incremental and hampered by ongoing restrictions and risks[4]. There is no clear evidence yet of a major, recent push to deploy substantially more UN staff, nor of a change in reporting methodology or frequency from OCHA.

**Probability: 20%**

A substantial staffing surge (to 290+) is plausible but unlikely given current trends and documented operational constraints. The most probable outcome is a No, with at most a modest increase in staff or no new snapshot before April 1.
