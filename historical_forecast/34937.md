(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
There are about 20 days remaining until March 1, 2025.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
As of February 1, 2025, the National Map still labeled the body of water as the "Gulf of Mexico." If no further action is taken to update the map or database, the name will remain "Gulf of Mexico," resulting in a **No** outcome.

(c) **Scenario for a No outcome:**  
The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), which operates the National Map, does not update the map to reflect the new "Gulf of America" name before March 1, 2025, whether due to administrative delay, legal challenge, inter-agency coordination issues, technical hurdles, or deferral to international naming conventions. In this case, the National Map still refers to the body of water as "Gulf of Mexico" on or after March 1, 2025, or the name is absent altogether.

(d) **Scenario for a Yes outcome:**  
The Department of the Interior, through the Geographic Names Information System (GNIS) and USGS, acts swiftly on Executive Order 14172, updating federal naming databases and the National Map to relabel the relevant body of water as the "Gulf of America" before March 1, 2025. As a result, the National Map refers to the body of water as Gulf of America (even if in conjunction with "formerly Gulf of Mexico") anytime before the deadline.

## Rationale

The executive order signed January 20, 2025, explicitly directs the Secretary of the Interior, within 30 days, to rename the "Gulf of Mexico" as the "Gulf of America" on all federal references and update the GNIS accordingly[1][2]. The GNIS is the authoritative source for geographic names on the National Map, and such federal directives typically cascade into map updates, particularly for U.S. territorial features.

President Trump's proclamation on February 9, 2025, declaring "Gulf of America Day" and referencing his first visit to the Gulf "since its renaming," signals active implementation and White House pressure to see the change executed[1]. The Department of the Interior has also publicly announced its advance toward "restoration of historic names," confirming that the executive branch considers the order actionable and in progress[2].

However, the status quo is powerful, and federal geographic names changes—particularly for prominent and internationally recognized features—can face logistic, procedural, or legal delays. The order’s language is clear and the timeline short, but past precedent shows that even with direct executive action, map and database updates are not always instantaneous or universal by deadline[3][4]. Given the National Map is a high-profile, public resource, the update may be prioritized, but technical or bureaucratic delays remain possible.

Given these facts, the probability for a "Yes" is high but not certain. The order, public declarations, and agency actions all align with the name being changed promptly. The main risk is a last-minute delay or technical hurdle preventing the name from appearing on the National Map before March 1, 2025.

## Final Probability

Probability: **85%**

**Justification:**  
- Strong executive mandate, clear timeline, and public pressure support the change.
- The National Map relies on GNIS, which is explicitly ordered to be updated.
- High likelihood of executive orders being executed swiftly for high-profile tasks.
- Moderate chance of administrative or technical delay preventing the map update before the deadline, but these risks appear outweighed by current momentum and top-level prioritization[1][2][3][4].
