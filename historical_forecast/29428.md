(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  
As of October 31, 2024, the South Dakota general election is five days away (Election Day: November 5, 2024).

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
If voter preferences remain as currently measured, Initiated Measure 29 will be defeated. The most recent Emerson College Poll (Oct 19–22, 2024) shows 50% of likely voters opposed, 45% in support, and 5% undecided[5].

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
The majority of undecided voters either break against the measure or split in a way that maintains or widens the current opposition margin. This scenario is reinforced by strong opposition from the state Republican Party, South Dakota’s conservative electorate, and a historical trend of narrow defeats for similar measures in the last cycle[1][2][5].

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
Undecided voters break decisively in favor of legalization, or there is an unexpected late surge in turnout among pro-legalization constituencies. This would require a larger-than-typical late shift, reversing or closing the 5-point deficit as measured in late October[5].

## Rationale

- **Historical trend:** South Dakota narrowly rejected recreational marijuana legalization in 2022 (47% Yes, 53% No)[3]. In 2020, voters approved legalization, but it was overturned by the courts—indicating a divided electorate with a slight tendency toward opposition[1][3][5].
- **Polling:** The most credible and recent poll (Emerson, Oct 19–22, 2024) shows the No side at 50%, Yes at 45%, and 5% undecided[5]. Given the historical reliability of late-October polling in the state and the absence of evidence for a substantial late-breaking pro-legalization movement, the deficit is likely to hold.
- **Political context:** The South Dakota Republican Party has taken a formal stance against IM 29, mobilizing opposition in a state that generally leans conservative on social issues[1][2]. While the pro-legalization side has motivation, the current polling and party opposition make a late surge less probable.
- **Undecided voters:** With only 5% undecided, even if they broke overwhelmingly for legalization, they are unlikely to overcome the current gap. It would require an extraordinary last-minute shift or systemic polling errors, neither of which is indicated by available information[5].

**Good forecasters place extra weight on the status quo, especially in states with a consistent recent voting pattern and when late polling shows a clear (if not insurmountable) gap.**

Probability: **20%** (that South Dakota voters will approve Initiated Measure 29)
