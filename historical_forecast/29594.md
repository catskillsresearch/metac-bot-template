I'll provide my assessment of the question about Robinhood's potential stablecoin announcement before January 1, 2025.

(a) Time until outcome: 56 days (from November 5, 2024, to January 1, 2025)

(b) Status quo outcome: No announcement of Robinhood launching its own stablecoin on its official blog.

(c) Scenario for No outcome: Robinhood continues its current strategy of partnering with other entities in the stablecoin space (as evidenced by its participation in the Global Dollar Network) rather than developing its own stablecoin. The company maintains its publicly stated position of having "no imminent plans" to launch its own stablecoin offering.

(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: Despite previous denials, Robinhood accelerates its crypto strategy in response to market opportunities or competitive pressures and announces its own stablecoin on its official blog before January 1, 2025. This would represent a significant strategic shift from their recent public statements.

## Rationale for Forecast

Based on the available information, there are several strong indicators pointing toward a "No" outcome to this question:

First, Robinhood has explicitly stated it has "no imminent plans" to launch its own stablecoin offering[1]. This direct statement from the company carries significant weight, especially given the short timeframe remaining until January 1, 2025.

Second, Robinhood has recently joined the Global Dollar Network as a distribution partner for the USDG stablecoin, not as an issuer[1][2]. This suggests that rather than developing its own stablecoin, Robinhood is pursuing a partnership strategy in this space. Johann Kerbrat, GM & VP of Robinhood Crypto, stated that "Stablecoins have been proven to offer a bridge between traditional finance and cryptocurrencies" and expressed support for the Global Dollar Network's efforts[2]. This statement indicates the company is satisfied with its current role in the stablecoin ecosystem.

Third, the search results indicate that as recently as November 5, 2024, there had been no announcement on Robinhood's official blog about launching its own stablecoin, which is the sole source that will be used for resolving this question[5]. With only 56 days remaining until the January 1, 2025 deadline, the window for such an announcement is narrowing.

While Robinhood has been expanding its crypto offerings, including launching cryptocurrency transfers for customers in Europe[4], there is no concrete evidence suggesting an imminent shift toward launching its own stablecoin. The company's recent strategic moves in the crypto space appear focused on expanding accessibility to existing cryptocurrencies rather than creating new ones.

It's worth noting that the stablecoin market is dynamic and competitive, with traditional financial institutions like BBVA planning to enter the space in 2025[4]. However, given Robinhood's recent participation in the Global Dollar Network, it seems more likely they will continue their distribution partner strategy rather than developing a competing product in the very near term.

The status quo strongly favors a "No" outcome, and without specific evidence pointing to a change in Robinhood's stated strategy, the most reasonable forecast is that no announcement of a Robinhood-issued stablecoin will appear on their official blog before January 1, 2025.

Probability: 92%
