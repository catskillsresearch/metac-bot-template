As a professional forecaster, I'll analyze the question about CDC's reported H5N1 cases by December 31, 2024.

(a) Time left until outcome is known: 14 days (from May 6, 2025 to December 31, 2024, which is in the past relative to the current date)

(b) Outcome if nothing changed: 27 confirmed H5N1 cases, as reported by the CDC's H5N1-specific tracker as of October 25, 2024[5].

(c) Outcome if current trend continued: Based on recent data, there were 53 human cases by November 18[4], and this increased to approximately 57 cases by early December according to PAHO[5]. This suggests a rate of roughly 4 new cases over about 2-3 weeks. If this trend continues, we might expect 61-65 cases by December 31, 2024.

(d) Expectations of experts and markets: No specific expert forecasts are provided in the search results. The CDC maintains that "the overall risk to the general public associated with the ongoing HPAI A(H5N1) outbreak in U.S. dairy cattle and poultry has not changed and remains low at this time"[1], suggesting they don't expect a dramatic increase in cases.

(e) Unexpected scenario resulting in low outcome: The CDC might not update its H5N1-specific tracker before December 31, leaving the official count at 27 despite higher numbers being reported elsewhere. Alternatively, they could reclassify some previously counted cases after further testing determines they were not specifically H5N1 subtype.

(f) Unexpected scenario resulting in high outcome: A cluster of new cases could be discovered in a previously unaffected farm or facility, especially in California where 294 new infected dairy herds were confirmed in just the past 30 days[5]. Enhanced holiday surveillance or backlog clearance could also lead to a sudden jump in reported cases.

Given that this question specifically asks about the H5N1 subtype cases reported on the CDC website, and considering the discrepancy between the H5N1-specific tracker (27 cases as of October) and the broader reporting of H5 cases (around 57 by early December), my forecast needs to account for uncertainty about whether and how the CDC will update its H5N1-specific reporting by year-end.
