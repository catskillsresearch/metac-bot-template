Based on the interview question about forecasting Atlanta's allergy index for March 17-30, 2025, I'll provide a comprehensive analysis and prediction.

(a) Time left until outcome: Approximately 10 months from now (from May 6, 2025 to March 31, 2025 when the data will be accessed).

(b) Status quo outcome: The current allergy index in Atlanta is not explicitly stated in the search results, but as of February 3, 2025, the total pollen count was 25, which would translate to a low allergy index level (0-2.4 range on Pollen.com's scale)[1].

(c) Outcome if current trend continued: Based on historical patterns, we would expect a significant increase from February to late March. The pollen count typically rises dramatically as we approach late March, which is considered peak season for tree pollen in Georgia[2].

(d) Expert expectations: Experts anticipate that late March in Atlanta will have high tree pollen counts, as this period typically falls within the peak season. In the southeast, spring allergy season can start as early as February and last until May, with pollen counts being highest between mid-March and mid-April[5].

(e) Unexpected scenario - low outcome: An unusually wet March 2025 with consistent rainfall could significantly suppress pollen counts by washing pollen from the air. Extended periods of cool temperatures could also delay tree pollination, resulting in lower than average allergy indices during the specified period.

(f) Unexpected scenario - high outcome: An unseasonably warm and dry March with consistent windy conditions would create perfect conditions for extreme pollen dispersal. If these weather conditions align with peak pollination for oak, pine, hickory, and other major allergenic trees in Atlanta, we could see record-breaking pollen counts similar to the historically high readings in previous years[3].

Now for my forecast of Atlanta's average allergy index for March 17-30, 2025:

Percentile 10: 5.8
Percentile 20: 6.5
Percentile 40: 7.4
Percentile 60: 8.3
Percentile 80: 9.2
Percentile 90: 10.1
