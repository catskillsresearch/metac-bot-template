(a) Time left until outcome: 210 days (from May 6, 2025, until January 2, 2025, when the question will be resolved based on TSA data for December 25-31, 2024).

(b) Status quo outcome: Based on the most recent comparable data (2023), airline passenger volume for December 25-31 was approximately 17.3 million, which would lead to a "No" outcome since it exceeds 17 million.

(c) Scenario for "No" outcome: Holiday travel demand continues to grow as observed throughout 2024, with TSA screening over 3 million passengers on peak days surrounding Christmas and New Year's. AAA's projection of record holiday travel (119.3 million travelers overall) materializes in the form of increased air travel, pushing the total TSA screenings for the week above 17 million.

(d) Scenario for "Yes" outcome: The slowdown in year-over-year growth observed in October 2024 continues through the end of the year. Economic concerns, higher airfares, or other factors cause fewer people to fly during the holiday season, keeping total passenger volume at or below 17 million for the week.

The question asks whether US airline passenger volume for the week of December 25-31, 2024, will be less than or equal to 17 million according to TSA data. Let me analyze this systematically:

First, I need to consider recent trends in airline travel. The search results reveal that in 2024, TSA has experienced record-breaking passenger volumes. On July 7, 2024, TSA set a new record by screening over 3 million people in a single day[3]. Similarly, on December 1, 2024, during the Thanksgiving travel period, TSA screened 3.09 million passengers, marking the busiest day on record[5]. This indicates strong momentum in air travel throughout 2024.

For the 2024 holiday season, AAA projects 119.3 million people will travel 50 miles or more from December 21 to January 1, which narrowly surpasses the previous record set in 2019[2]. While this forecast includes all modes of transportation, not just air travel, it suggests that overall travel demand for the holiday period will be high.

Looking at historical data provided in the query, the total TSA passenger volume for December 25-31, 2023, was approximately 17.3 million. This represents a significant increase from previous years (15.8 million in 2022 and 13.5 million in 2021). The trend shows consistent growth in holiday air travel following the pandemic recovery.

For Thanksgiving 2024, TSA reported screening 18.3 million passengers from November 26 to December 2, representing a 6% increase from the same period in 2023[4]. If a similar growth rate applies to the Christmas-New Year period, we could expect passenger volumes to increase by approximately 6% from the 2023 total of 17.3 million, which would result in around 18.3 million passengers for December 25-31, 2024.

However, I must also consider the reported slowdown in year-over-year growth observed in October 2024, with passenger numbers down 1.4% compared to the same period in 2023. This suggests that the rapid growth seen earlier in the year may be moderating.

The status quo outcome (based on 2023 data) would lead to a "No" resolution since 17.3 million exceeds the 17 million threshold. Even a small year-over-year increase would further solidify this outcome. Only a decline from 2023 levels would lead to a "Yes" resolution.

Given the strong performance throughout 2024, record-breaking single-day numbers, and AAA's projection of record holiday travel, the evidence points more strongly toward continued robust air travel demand. While there was a slight slowdown in October, the holiday period typically sees stronger demand than regular travel periods, and the Thanksgiving 2024 numbers already demonstrated this pattern with a 6% increase year-over-year.

Considering all factors, I believe the probability of airline passenger volume being less than or equal to 17 million for December 25-31, 2024, is relatively low. The status quo and recent trends point more strongly toward exceeding this threshold.

Probability: 25%
