(a) **Time Left Until Resolution**  
There are approximately 19 days until the outcome is known, since today is May 6, 2025, and the relevant Netflix Top 10 list will be published for the week ending March 23, 2025.

(b) **Status Quo Outcome if Nothing Changed**  
Historically, Netflix's Top 10 global English movies list sees 1 or occasionally 2 new titles in a given week, particularly when a notable movie releases close to or during that week[2]. For the week ending March 23, 2025, one clearly-identified new movie, *Little Siberia*, is set to debut worldwide on March 21, 2025, making it a strong candidate for a fresh entry into the Top 10 for that week[2]. Unless there are last-minute changes, the status quo expectation would be that there is 1 new movie on the list.

(c) **Scenario for an Unexpected Outcome**  
Unexpected scenarios could include:
- *No new movies*: *Little Siberia* might underperform or have a limited release, or be delayed, leading to 0 new entries. Additionally, if no other movies with first-week appearances launch during this period, the list could be static.
- *2 or more new movies*: Multiple surprise releases, strong sleeper hits, or movies with unannounced release dates could enter the Top 10 for their first week. If a major title is released with little advance notice, or if a smaller film suddenly goes viral, it's possible 2 or more new movies could appear[1][2][3].

**Rationale**

- The most likely scenario is 1 new movie, *Little Siberia*, entering the global English Top 10 in its first week, matching historic Netflix patterns where 1â€“2 new movies often debut on the chart per week[2].
- There is a significant but smaller chance of 2 new entries if another film with a global release drops that week and overperforms, or if a surprise international release gains traction quickly.
- The chance of 0 new entries is low but not negligible, due to the possibility of *Little Siberia* being delayed or underperforming.
- 3 or more new entries is highly unlikely, as Netflix rarely premieres that many major English-language films with enough impact in a single week[2][3].

**Probabilities**

- 0: **10%** (delays or total lack of traction for new releases)
- 1: **70%** (only *Little Siberia* enters as new)
- 2: **17%** (a second release or sleeper hit joins *Little Siberia* as new)
- 3 or more: **3%** (unusually high number of impactful releases or viral hits)
