(a) Time left until outcome is known: 26 days (from December 11, 2024 until January 1, 2025)

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: No election call before January 1, 2025

(c) A scenario resulting in a No outcome: Premier Ford maintains his current position of not calling an election in 2024, continues preparations throughout December, but waits until early 2025 to make any official election announcement.

(d) A scenario resulting in a Yes outcome: Premier Ford makes a surprise announcement in late December 2024, calling for an early provincial election to be held in early-to-mid 2025, perhaps following the completion of his caucus members' decisions about running again.

As a professional forecaster, I need to analyze the likelihood of Premier Doug Ford calling an early Ontario provincial election before January 1, 2025, with voting scheduled before January 1, 2026.

## Current Evidence Assessment

The evidence strongly suggests Premier Ford is considering an early election in 2025, but several factors indicate he is unlikely to make this call in the remaining weeks of 2024:

First, Ford has explicitly ruled out a 2024 election, stating clearly "We aren't having an election this year" in September 2024[1][2]. This direct statement significantly reduces the probability of an election call in the remaining days of December 2024.

Second, while Ford has established a December deadline for his party members to decide if they'll run again, this deadline appears to be preparatory for a potential 2025 election rather than indicating an imminent announcement[1][2]. The premier framed this as being prepared, saying "You always have to be prepared," which suggests groundwork for a future decision rather than an immediate one[1].

Third, the PC Party has been polling specifically about a 2025 election, asking voters whether "Doug Ford should call an election for 2025 instead of waiting until June 2026"[3]. This polling activity suggests the party is evaluating a 2025 election call rather than an imminent 2024 announcement.

## Timing Considerations

The timing of any election call is particularly important for this forecast. Given that:

- As of December 11, 2024, only 20 days remain in the calendar year
- The holiday period from mid-to-late December is traditionally a political low-activity period
- The question specifically requires both the call to be made before January 1, 2025, and the election to be scheduled before January 1, 2026

The window for a "Yes" outcome is extremely narrow. Election calls typically avoid major holidays, making a call in the final weeks of December particularly unusual from a political strategy perspective.

## Political Context

Several political signs point toward preparations for an early election, but not necessarily one called in the final days of 2024:

- Opposition parties are ramping up their election preparation activities
- Government legislative activities show signs of clearing the decks
- The $200 "rebate" cheques planned to be mailed to Ontario households early in the new year could be positioning for an election that follows[4]

These are consistent with an election call in early 2025, not December 2024.

## Historical Precedent

Traditionally, elections in Canada are rarely called during the December holiday period. Additionally, the tactical advantage of calling an election typically comes from choosing an opportune moment, which would likely exist in early 2025 rather than the final days of 2024.

## Forecast Rationale

Putting extra weight on the status quo (no announcement before January 1, 2025) is appropriate here for several reasons:

1. Ford's explicit statement ruling out a 2024 election
2. The preparation timeline (December deadline for MPPs) aligns better with a 2025 announcement
3. The holiday period makes a December announcement politically awkward
4. The narrow remaining timeframe (20 days as of December 11)

All evidence points to preparations for a potential early 2025 election call, rather than one occurring in the final days of 2024. While signs strongly suggest Ford is considering an early election, the timing for the announcement appears to be oriented toward early 2025 rather than late 2024.
