(a) **Time until outcome is known:**  
The Paris 2024 Olympics officially run from July 26 to August 11, 2024. As today is July 18, there are about 8 days until the Games begin and roughly 24 days until the final tally of world records will be known.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
Recent Olympic Games saw the following number of world records: London 2012 (32), Rio 2016 (23), Tokyo 2020 (27). The average is approximately 27, with a minimum of 23. If trends continue and nothing dramatic changes, the most probable scenario is that the number of world records will be in the mid-to-high 20s.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
A "No" would result if only 23 or fewer world records are broken. This could occur if:
- Many sports see stable, “mature” records that are very hard to break.
- External conditions (e.g., weather, disruptions, health issues) suppress top performances.
- There are fewer events or rule changes that make record-setting less likely.
Notably, Rio 2016 saw only 23 world records, demonstrating this is possible.

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
A "Yes" would result if 24 or more world records are broken. This is likely if:
- Performance trends in swimming and track & field continue, where several world records are considered at risk[1][2][4][5].
- Favorable competition conditions and deep competitive fields push athletes to peak results.
- Multiple records are broken in qualifying rounds and finals of certain events, both of which count per the rules.

## Rationale

- The historical average from the last three Summer Olympics (27) is comfortably above the 24 threshold, and only one recent Games has dipped below this line (Rio 2016, with 23).
- For Paris 2024, several high-profile athletes are widely expected to challenge world records—especially in swimming and track & field[1][2][4][5]. Analysts already highlight specific events (like the women's 100m hurdles, men's pole vault, and various swimming races) as likely sites for record-breaking performances.
- Data indicates that both the depth of competition (especially in women’s events) and the "Olympic year effect" (where athletes peak for the Games) are in play[2][5].
- The rules count every broken record in a single event (e.g., heats and finals), making 24 a more achievable cumulative target.
- The main downside risk is conditions like injuries, weather, or unforeseen disruptions preventing athletes from reaching peaks, but no evidence suggests these will be unusually impactful in 2024.

Given the consistency of recent Games, the identification of multiple likely record-breaking events, and with only a modest threshold to reach, the base rate supports a clear probability above 60%. The only substantial counterexample is Rio 2016, which is likely an outlier amid a generally upward/slightly fluctuating trend.

**Probability: 75%**
