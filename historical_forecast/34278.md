Based on the available data, I'll provide a professional forecast for Lake Kariba's water level on February 24, 2025.

(a) Time left until the outcome is known:
The current date is May 6, 2025, and the outcome date was February 24, 2025. This means the outcome is already known, but I'm forecasting based on data available before January 31, 2025.

(b) The outcome if nothing changed:
If the water level remained at 475.87m (as of January 6, 2025), that would be the outcome[3].

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued:
The most recent data shows the lake level was steadily increasing, reaching 477.68m by May 5, 2025[1]. However, this is after the forecast date. Looking at historical patterns, there's typically an increase during the rainy season (November-April).

(d) The expectations of experts and markets:
Experts anticipated that while the 2024-2025 rainy season might bring some relief, it would take approximately three years of good rainfall for Kariba to fully recover its hydroelectric capability[4]. The Kariba Lake is designed to operate between 475.50m and 488.50m for hydropower generation[1].

(e) An unexpected scenario resulting in a low outcome:
A continued or worsening drought pattern could result in minimal inflow from the Zambezi River, causing the lake level to remain near its critical minimum operational level of 475.50m or potentially drop further[4].

(f) An unexpected scenario resulting in a high outcome:
Exceptionally heavy rainfall in the Zambezi catchment area could lead to significantly increased inflows, rapidly raising the lake level beyond expectations, similar to historical maximum flow events[4].

Based on the available data as of January 31, 2025, and considering the lake was at 475.87m on January 6, 2025, with a historical pattern of rising levels during the rainy season but starting from a much lower base than previous years, I forecast the following water levels for February 24, 2025:

Percentile 10: 475.70m
Percentile 20: 476.00m
Percentile 40: 476.30m
Percentile 60: 476.60m
Percentile 80: 476.90m
Percentile 90: 477.20m
