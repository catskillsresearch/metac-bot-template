(a) **Time until outcome**: 13 days (March 18–31, 2025).  
(b) **Status quo outcome**: The Tucker Carlson Show remains at #10.  
(c) **Unexpected outcome scenario**: A major news event (e.g., a high-profile political development or NYT investigative report) could temporarily spike engagement for *The New York Times Daily*, while *The Tucker Carlson Show* faces audience fatigue or controversy, reversing their positions.  

### Rationale  
1. **Status quo bias**: Spotify rankings prioritize recent engagement (past 24–48 hours)[^1^], but historical consistency (e.g., NYT Daily’s loyal audience) reduces volatility[3].  
2. **Volatility factors**: Political podcasts like *Tucker Carlson Show* are more susceptible to event-driven spikes (e.g., election cycles), whereas NYT Daily’s news-driven format benefits from regular premium coverage[^1^].  
3. **Current momentum**: *Tucker Carlson Show* recently reached #10 (per March 2025 data)[1], suggesting transient momentum, but NYT Daily’s entrenched audience provides downside protection.  

**Final probabilities**:  
The_New_York_Times_Daily: 45%  
The_Tucker_Carlson_Show: 55%
