(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
There are approximately 55 days remaining until January 1, 2025, which is when the outcome will be determined.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
Merck's stock currently trades around $83.18, well below its all-time high of $134.63. If the stock remains at this level or grows only moderately (as expected), it will not surpass the all-time high before the end of 2024.

(c) **Scenario for a No outcome:**  
A "No" outcome occurs if Merck stock ever exceeds $134.63 (even as an intraday high) before January 1, 2025. This would require an unprecedented surge of more than 60% in under two months, which could be triggered by an extraordinary positive catalyst, such as breakthrough clinical trial results, a major acquisition, or significant regulatory news.

(d) **Scenario for a Yes outcome:**  
A "Yes" outcome occurs if Merck stock remains below $134.63, without ever exceeding it, for the rest of 2024. This scenario aligns with current market sentiment, analyst expectations, and the company's recent financial performance, all indicating that such a dramatic price increase is highly unlikely in the remaining days of the year[1][2][5].

## Rationale

Most reputable forecasts and technical analyses indicate that Merck is expected to end 2024 well below its all-time high. Current price predictions for Merck into 2025 suggest a range centered around $76–$88 per share, with even the most optimistic 12-month price targets only slightly exceeding the all-time high—but those are for well into 2025, not before January[1][2][5]. Analyst and model consensus is that Merck might approach or eventually surpass $134.63, but certainly not within the short two-month window remaining in 2024.

Recent financial data for Q3 2024 shows steady but not explosive growth, and overall sentiment in the market is bearish or neutral. Technical indicators such as the RSI and Fear & Greed Index also do not suggest imminent, drastic upside movement[1].

Additionally, for the stock to surpass its all-time high, it would require a gain of over 60% in less than two months—a move not supported by any current forecast or historical precedent for a pharmaceutical company of Merck's size without a major, unexpected event.

As good forecasters, extra weight is placed on the status quo, especially with such little time remaining and absent any known market-moving catalysts.
