(a) Time left until the outcome is known:  
The question will be resolved based on the emoji count in the Unicode standard as of December 31, 2024, so there are about two months left until the outcome is officially known.

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changes:  
As of November 2024, Unicode 16.0 has been released with only 7–8 new emojis added, bringing the total to approximately 3,640 emojis. There is no indication of further major emoji additions before the end of the year, so the count is expected to remain below 3,900 by December 31, 2024.

(c) Scenario resulting in a No outcome:  
No new emoji releases or updates that significantly increase the emoji count occur before the end of 2024. The Unicode 16.0 release remains the latest, with its modest addition of emojis. Thus, the total emoji count remains roughly at 3,640, below the 3,900 threshold.

(d) Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:  
A highly unlikely scenario where Unicode or a related standards body unexpectedly releases a large batch of new emojis late in 2024, adding over 250 emojis between now and December 31, 2024, pushing the total count to 3,900 or more by the deadline.

**Rationale:**  
The historical growth in emojis from Unicode 11.0 in 2018 (2,789 emojis) to Unicode 14.0 in 2021 (3,633 emojis) shows steady but moderate increases year over year. Unicode 15.0 and 16.0 have shown a clear slowdown in additions, with 16.0 adding only about 7–8 new emojis in September 2024. This signals a tapering in growth rates.

Moreover, the emoji submission window opened April to July 2024 will not affect the total emoji count until future Unicode versions, likely Unicode 17.0 and beyond, which are expected after 2024. Given the development and approval cycles, no substantial emoji count increase is expected before the end of 2024.

The prediction for Unicode 19.0 in 2026 is that growth will continue but gradually, likely adding some dozens of emojis, not hundreds, given recent trends, keeping the total well under any sudden large jump.

Therefore, based on the current data and development timelines, the most rational forecast heavily favors the total emoji count being below 3,900 on December 31, 2024.

**Final answer:**  
Probability: 95% that there will be fewer than 3,900 emojis in the Unicode standard by December 31, 2024.
