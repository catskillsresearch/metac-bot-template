(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  
As of November 5, 2024, there are less than two months until January 1, 2025, when the outcome will be determined.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
Sadiq Khan remains mayor of London. He was re-elected on May 2, 2024, began his third term in May 2024, and, under normal circumstances, will serve a four-year term. As of the current date, there are no credible reports or official statements suggesting he will leave office or that a permanent successor will be appointed before January 1, 2025[1][2][3][5].

(c) **Scenario that results in a No outcome:**  
Sadiq Khan continues in office without resignation, removal, or replacement, maintaining his role as mayor through January 1, 2025. This scenario is supported by the absence of any official resignation, credible scandal, legal action, or severe health event as of the last update[1][2][3][5].

(d) **Scenario that results in a Yes outcome:**  
Sadiq Khan vacates the office of mayor before January 1, 2025, and a permanent successor is appointed or elected. This could occur through voluntary resignation, removal following legal or political processes, incapacity resulting in a permanent replacement, or other unforeseen significant events. There is no current evidence of such developments; calls for his resignation (such as those from public commentators) have not initiated any formal process or produced substantive momentum toward his removal[5].

## Rationale

Historical precedent and current information both strongly favor the status quo. Sadiq Khan has just begun a new term, and there is no indication from credible sources of imminent change in his officeholding. Periodic public and political criticism, including calls to resign, have not led to official action, and no permanent successor has been named or is being prepared, according to the City of Londonâ€™s official platforms and leading news organizations[1][2][4][5]. While the office is subject to political risk like any senior post, the lack of current scandal, health concerns, or internal party strife means that sudden changes are unlikely within the remaining short time frame.

## Final answer

Probability: 2%
