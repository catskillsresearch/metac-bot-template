I'll analyze the probability that the USDA's recall of Boar's Head deli meat will be closed before October 1, 2024.

(a) Time left until outcome is known: The question outcome will be determined when Metaculus accesses the FSIS recall page after September 30, 2024. From the current date (May 6, 2025), this outcome has already been determined.

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: Based on the search results from July-August 2024, the recall was active, with products having sell-by dates extending through October 17, 2024. If nothing changed, the recall would remain active until after October 1, 2024.

(c) Scenario for a No outcome: The USDA maintains the active recall status beyond October 1, 2024, due to the extended shelf life of recalled products (some with sell-by dates until October 17, 2024), ongoing public health concerns about potential new cases, and the severity of the outbreak (multiple deaths and hospitalizations).

(d) Scenario for a Yes outcome: The USDA closes the recall before October 1, 2024, potentially because: all affected products were successfully removed from commerce earlier than expected, the contamination source was definitively identified and addressed, follow-up testing confirmed no further risk, and no new cases were reported for an extended period.

Based on the search results provided, I'll now analyze the probability of the recall being closed before October 1, 2024.

The Boar's Head recall represents one of the most significant foodborne illness outbreaks in recent years. The July 2024 recall initially covered liverwurst products but quickly expanded to include approximately 7 million pounds of ready-to-eat meat and poultry products[1][4]. This massive scale indicates a serious contamination issue requiring thorough investigation and resolution.

A critical factor in this forecast is the sell-by dates of the affected products. According to the FSIS announcement, the recalled products have "sell by" dates ranging from July 29, 2024, through October 17, 2024[1][3]. This timeline is particularly important because regulatory agencies typically maintain active recall status until all affected products are reasonably expected to be out of commerce and consumer homes. With products having sell-by dates extending beyond October 1, 2024, it's highly unlikely the USDA would close the recall before that milestone.

The severity of the outbreak further supports maintaining an active recall status. The search results indicate that as of early August 2024, there were 43 reported illnesses and three confirmed deaths across multiple states[4]. This level of public health impact would likely prompt regulators to maintain the recall status until they can be confident no additional cases will emerge.

Listeria infections present a particular challenge because symptoms can appear up to 70 days after consumption. Given that products were produced as late as July 29, 2024[1], potential new cases could continue to emerge through October 2024. This extended incubation period gives regulators strong reason to maintain the active recall status until all potentially contaminated products are well past their sell-by dates.

The company's response also factors into recall duration. While Boar's Head temporarily stopped production at the affected facility and began disinfection procedures[2], there's no indication in the search results that these efforts would be completed with sufficient time to satisfy regulatory requirements for closing the recall before October 1, 2024.

Considering the standard practices of FSIS, which typically maintains recalls as active until affected products are beyond their shelf life, the documented October 17, 2024 sell-by dates for some products[1][3], the ongoing investigation into multiple deaths, and the potential for delayed symptom onset with Listeria, I see very little likelihood of this recall being closed before October 1, 2024.

Putting extra weight on the status quo outcome (active recall continuing), I see overwhelming evidence supporting a "No" resolution to this question.

Probability: 5%
