(a) Time until outcome: The outcome will be known on February 9, 2025, which is 3 days from today (May 6, 2025). However, since we're analyzing information from before February 3, 2025, we need to make a retrospective assessment based on that information.

(b) Status quo outcome: Based on the information available before February 3, 2025, OpenAI appears likely to run a Super Bowl ad, while there is no evidence that either Anthropic or Perplexity had purchased advertising slots. Since the question resolves as "Yes" if any of these three companies run an ad, the status quo outcome would be "Yes" primarily due to OpenAI's expected participation.

(c) Scenario for a No outcome: None of these three AI companies ultimately run ads during the Super Bowl broadcast. OpenAI might have changed plans at the last minute due to budget constraints or strategic shifts. Both Anthropic and Perplexity continue to focus on other marketing channels that provide better ROI for their target audiences. Other AI companies like Google and Microsoft dominate the AI advertising during the Super Bowl instead.

(d) Scenario for a Yes outcome: OpenAI follows through with its reported plans to debut its first Super Bowl ad, capitalizing on the mainstream interest in AI. Alternatively, Perplexity, which is mentioned in the prediction markets with a 36% chance of running an ad according to search result [3], decides to make a splash with its first major national television campaign. The trend of AI companies featuring prominently in Super Bowl advertising creates competitive pressure for these companies to participate.

As a professional forecaster, I need to carefully analyze the evidence available before February 3, 2025, to make my prediction.

The search results provide several key pieces of information:

1. AI is expected to be a major theme for Super Bowl LIX advertisements, with Mark Evans from Fox Sports explicitly stating that "you will see some more AI focused creative"[1]. This creates a favorable environment for AI companies to advertise.

2. According to prediction markets from Kalshi as of February 3, 2025, OpenAI had a 60% probability (59¢ price) of running a Super Bowl ad, while Perplexity had a 36% probability (49¢ price)[3]. Anthropic is not specifically mentioned in the prediction markets.

3. There is a social media post suggesting that AI companies will be featured, specifically mentioning Google's Gemini/Veo and Perplexity as possibilities[1].

4. Perplexity is described as "the AI-generated search platform most likely to present a brand in a positive light in its results" according to BrandRank.AI[4], indicating it has a positive brand reputation that could make it an attractive Super Bowl advertiser.

Weighing these factors, I need to consider the status quo outcome heavily. OpenAI appears to have the highest likelihood of the three companies to run an ad based on the prediction market data (60% probability)[3]. While there's no direct confirmation from OpenAI in the search results, the prediction market data suggests significant confidence. 

For Perplexity, the 36% probability in prediction markets[3] indicates some possibility but less certainty. The mention of Perplexity as a potential advertiser in a social media post[1] provides additional weak evidence.

For Anthropic, there is minimal evidence in the search results to suggest they will run an ad, though they are mentioned as one of the AI companies that might be represented[1].

Since the question resolves as "Yes" if any of these three companies runs an ad, I need to calculate the combined probability. Using the prediction market data and considering the companies independently:

P(Any of the three runs an ad) = 1 - P(None run an ad)

Given OpenAI at 60% and Perplexity at 36%, and assuming independence (a simplification):
P(None run an ad) = (1-0.6) × (1-0.36) × P(Anthropic doesn't run an ad)

Without specific data on Anthropic, I would conservatively estimate its probability lower than Perplexity's, perhaps around 20%.

P(None run an ad) = 0.4 × 0.64 × 0.8 = 0.2048

P(Any of the three runs an ad) = 1 - 0.2048 = 0.7952

Rounding and considering the status quo bias where OpenAI appears likely to run an ad:

Probability: 80%
