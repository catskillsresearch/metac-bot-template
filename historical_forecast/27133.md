(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
As of August 12, 2024, there are just under seven weeks remaining until the October 1, 2024, deadline for this question to resolve.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
If the current trajectory holds—meaning no additional debates are formally organized or confirmed—only one qualifying debate (June 27, 2024, Trump vs. Biden) will have taken place before October 1, 2024. This leads to a **No** outcome.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
Joe Biden's June 27 debate with Trump is the only one to take place because:  
- Biden dropped out, leaving the Democratic nomination unsettled.
- The planned September 10 debate becomes canceled, postponed, or fails to meet the formal criteria (no agreement with the new nominee, or format issues).
- No formal, live debates between Trump and the new Democratic nominee (e.g., Kamala Harris) are scheduled, agreed upon, or occur before October 1, 2024.

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
After Biden's withdrawal, the new Democratic nominee (presumably Kamala Harris) is rapidly confirmed.  
- Trump and the new nominee formally agree to at least two live, structured, and moderated presidential debates, both of which occur before October 1, 2024.
- These events are properly billed as presidential debates and meet all outlined criteria.

## Rationale

- Only one official presidential debate (June 27, 2024, between Trump and Biden) has occurred[2][4].
- The planned second debate (September 10, 2024, originally Trump vs. Biden on ABC) is now uncertain, as Biden is no longer the nominee. Trump has proposed debates with Kamala Harris but no agreement or scheduling has been confirmed[1][3].
- There is no public confirmation of any formal, live, structured debates agreed upon between Trump and the eventual Democratic nominee before October 1, 2024[1][3].
- Both logistical and political factors—such as the time required for the Democratic Party to confirm a nominee, negotiate formats, and organize events—constrain the likelihood of arranging multiple debates within seven weeks.

Given historical precedent and the inertia commonly observed in tumultuous election years, the status quo is a strong anchor. Unless there’s a rapid and highly coordinated pivot by both campaigns and media partners, more than one qualifying debate between Trump and the Democratic nominee before October 1, 2024, is highly unlikely.
