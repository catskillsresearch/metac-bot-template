I need to forecast whether Cruise will operate a rider-only ride-hailing service available to the general public anywhere in the U.S. by December 31, 2024. Let me analyze this systematically.

(a) Time until outcome is known: Approximately 7 months and 25 days from today (May 6, 2025)

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: Cruise is currently not operating any rider-only ride-hailing services in the United States. They have only resumed manual driving operations in select cities.

(c) Scenario for a No outcome: Cruise continues its gradual return to operations with manual driving only through the end of 2024, maintaining its current focus on rebuilding trust with regulators and improving safety protocols. The company sticks to its announced timeline of returning to the Uber platform in 2025, with no acceleration of this schedule.

(d) Scenario for a Yes outcome: Cruise makes unexpectedly rapid progress in addressing regulatory concerns, successfully demonstrates safety improvements, and receives regulatory approval to resume limited rider-only operations in at least one U.S. city before December 31, 2024. This would require a significant acceleration of their publicly stated timeline.

## Analysis of Current Status

Based on the search results, Cruise's autonomous ride-hailing service remains suspended following safety incidents in late 2023. As of April 2024, Cruise has only resumed manual driving operations in Phoenix, Houston, and Dallas[2]. These manual operations are part of their gradual return strategy, but do not constitute rider-only services as defined in the question.

Cruise's own website indicates that "ridehail services are not available at this time," with only a waitlist open for future service[1]. This suggests no immediate plans to resume rider-only operations in the near term.

## Future Plans and Announcements

The most telling evidence comes from Cruise's partnership announcement with Uber in August 2024. This partnership explicitly states that Cruise's robotaxis will come to the Uber app "in 2025"[3]. A Cruise spokesperson specifically told TechCrunch that "this partnership will follow the re-launch of Cruise's own driverless service"[3], indicating that even Cruise's direct service won't resume until sometime before the Uber partnership begins in 2025.

## Regulatory and Safety Environment

Cruise has been working to address regulatory concerns. The company recalled its fleet of 1,194 autonomous vehicles to resolve a federal safety probe and paid a $112,500 fine to California regulators in June 2024[3]. While these actions position Cruise to eventually restart operations, there is no indication this will happen before the end of 2024.

## Status Quo Inertia and Timeline Considerations

The status quo strongly suggests Cruise will not have rider-only services by December 31, 2024:

1. Cruise is currently only operating manually driven vehicles in limited cities
2. They have explicitly communicated a 2025 timeline for returning to the Uber platform
3. Regulatory approval processes typically take substantial time
4. The company is likely to proceed cautiously after previous safety incidents

For Cruise to launch rider-only service by the end of 2024, they would need to dramatically accelerate their timeline, which seems unlikely given the careful, phased approach they've adopted following their suspension.

## Final Assessment

Weighing heavily toward the status quo and considering Cruise's own explicit timeline pointing to 2025 for service resumption, there is very little evidence suggesting Cruise will operate rider-only ride-hailing services anywhere in the U.S. by December 31, 2024. Their current manual operations and partnerships all point to a 2025 return to autonomous service.

Probability: 10%
