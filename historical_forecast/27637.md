I'll analyze the likelihood of Green Day's "Dilemma" winning Best Rock at the 2024 MTV VMAs.

(a) Time until outcome: The MTV VMAs are scheduled for September 10, 2024, which is approximately 4 months away from today's date (May 6, 2025). However, since we're looking back at this event, the awards have already taken place.

(b) Status quo outcome: Based on the search results, we can see that "Dilemma" by Green Day was nominated for Best Rock video at the 2024 MTV VMAs, but the results indicate that it did NOT win. Search result [2] explicitly states "WINNER. Lenny Kravitz. Human." This shows Lenny Kravitz won the Best Rock category with his song "Human."

(c) Scenario for No outcome: The scenario that would result in a No outcome has already occurred - Lenny Kravitz's "Human" received more votes or was selected by the judges over Green Day's "Dilemma" and the other nominees in the Best Rock category.

(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: For Green Day to have won, they would have needed to receive more votes than the other nominees, particularly Lenny Kravitz. This could have happened if Green Day had a stronger fan mobilization during the voting period (which ran until August 30, 2024) or if "Dilemma" had been particularly impactful or critically acclaimed compared to the competition.

Looking at the available evidence, we have clear information about the outcome. According to search result [2], which appears to be from the MTV website itself showing the results of the 2024 VMAs, Lenny Kravitz won the Best Rock category with "Human." The result is explicitly marked as "WINNER" next to Lenny Kravitz's entry.

Since we're looking back at an event that has already occurred, and we have definitive information about the winner, there's no need to estimate probabilities based on uncertain future outcomes. The information clearly indicates that Green Day's "Dilemma" did not win the Best Rock award at the 2024 MTV VMAs.

Probability: 0%
