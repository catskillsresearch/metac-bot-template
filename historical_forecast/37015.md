(a) Time left until outcome: 29 days (from May 6, 2025 to May 5, 2025)
(b) Status quo outcome: No announcement yet, so default outcome is No
(c) No outcome scenario: Han continues focusing on state affairs as acting president, decides his dual role makes candidacy complicated, or faces political pressure that prevents him from running
(d) Yes outcome scenario: Growing support from PPP lawmakers and civic leaders convinces Han to announce his candidacy before the May 3 legal deadline for office-holding candidates

As of May 6, 2025, Han Duck-soo has not formally announced his candidacy for the upcoming South Korean presidential election scheduled for June 3, 2025. The question asks whether he will announce before May 5, which has already passed without such an announcement.

Based on the search results, there was significant momentum building toward a potential Han candidacy in April 2025:

1. Growing support within the People Power Party (PPP) was evident, with approximately 30 of the party's 108 lawmakers expressing support for his candidacy[3].

2. Regional support was forming, particularly from PPP officials from the southwestern Honam region who held a press conference urging Han to run[3].

3. Han reportedly told US President Trump during a phone call that he was "considering" a presidential bid "due to several demands and the current situation," though nothing had been decided[5].

4. PPP floor leader Kweon Seong-dong publicly welcomed Han's potential entry into the race, suggesting it would boost public interest in the party's upcoming convention[5].

However, several factors likely contributed to Han's decision not to announce:

1. His dual role as Acting President and Prime Minister created complications. Political insiders noted it would be difficult for Han to step down as acting president simply to enter the race while the presidency remained vacant[3].

2. Han consistently stated he would remain focused on state affairs, suggesting a reluctance to enter partisan politics during a transitional period[3].

3. The threat of impeachment from the Democratic Party may have deterred him from making a controversial decision to run[5].

4. At 75 years old, age may have been a factor in his decision-making process.

The status quo generally has strong inertia in political decisions. In this case, Han's established position as Acting President represented a significant status quo that would require a major shift for him to announce a candidacy. The fact that he did not announce by May 5 indicates that the political and personal complications outweighed the growing support for his potential candidacy.
