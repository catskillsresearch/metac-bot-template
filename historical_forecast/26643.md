(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
From July 26, 2024, to September 15, 2024, there are 51 days remaining until the resolution deadline.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
As of June 24, 2024, the Spanish Wikipedia had 1,968,552 articles. Over the previous 12 months, it added about 8,469 articles per month (roughly 282 per day). At this rate, in the 51 days left, approximately 14,382 articles would be added, bringing the total to around 1,982,934 articles before the September 15 deadline—short of the 2 million goal.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
If the article creation rate continues as it has in the past year, without major acceleration or special initiatives, the Spanish Wikipedia will not reach 2 million articles before September 15, 2024. The most plausible outcome, given current trends and no significant disruptions or campaigns, is that the target will be reached about a month after the deadline.

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
A "Yes" outcome would require a significant uptick in article creation. This could occur through large-scale bot-generated article projects, special editor campaigns, or changes in article-counting methodology (barring disqualifying rule changes). Such surges have occurred in other language editions, but there is no current indication of such activity on Spanish Wikipedia.

## Rationale

Historical data shows a steady but modest acceleration in article creation over recent years. The status quo, with an average of about 8,469 new articles per month, puts the 2 million article milestone out of reach before the September 15, 2024 cutoff. The extrapolated total by then would still be roughly 17,000 articles short.

Large, abrupt increases in article count are rare and typically coordinated (such as bot-generated stubs), but there is no evidence in public statistics or Wikimedia project announcements that such actions are currently planned or underway for the Spanish Wikipedia. Unless an unexpected initiative launches in the next few weeks—which is always possible but not typical—the most reliable indicator of future performance is the recent past.

Good forecasting practice gives extra weight to the status quo in the absence of clear signals of change. While Wikipedia projects can occasionally accelerate growth unexpectedly, these events are infrequent and usually come with some advance discussion or indication, which is missing here.
