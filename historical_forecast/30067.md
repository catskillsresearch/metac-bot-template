(a) Time left until outcome: 47 days (from November 14, 2024 to December 31, 2024)

(b) Status quo outcome: Yes - Google maintains >90% global search engine market share (currently 90.91% as of revised April 2024 data)

(c) Scenario for No outcome: Google's gradual decline accelerates due to increased competition from Microsoft Bing (potentially leveraging AI advancements) and other search engines. The holiday season sees users experimenting with alternatives, and Google's market share falls just below 90% by December 31.

(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: Google's market share continues its slow decline but remains above 90% by year-end. The company maintains its dominant position due to its established user base, ecosystem integration, and lack of compelling alternatives that could cause rapid market shifts.

Based on the search results provided and careful analysis of current trends, I'll assess the probability that Google will maintain over 90% global search engine market share by December 31, 2024.

Google's global search engine market share has been on a slow but steady decline. According to StatCounter's revised data, Google held 90.91% of the global search market as of April 2024, down from 91.38% in March 2024 and 92.82% year-over-year[4]. This indicates a gradual erosion of Google's dominance rather than any dramatic shift in the search landscape.

While there was initial reporting of a more significant drop in April 2024 (to 86.99%), this data was later corrected by StatCounter as an anomaly or reporting error[2][4][5]. The corrected data shows a much more modest decline, consistent with the longer-term trend.

Microsoft Bing has seen some growth, increasing to 3.64% global market share (up from 2.76% year-over-year), while Yahoo sits at 1.13%[4]. However, neither competitor shows signs of making dramatic inroads against Google's dominance in the global market within the short timeframe remaining in 2024.

It's important to note that Google's position is notably weaker in specific regions. In Europe, Google holds 89.46% as of April 2025 data[1], and in the US, the figure is even lower at 86.58% after StatCounter's corrections[5]. However, the global figure remains our focus for this forecast.

The search results suggest that Google began experiencing a more consistent decline since introducing its Search Generative Experience in May 2023[4]. This timing coincides with increased competition from AI-enhanced search alternatives, which could potentially be a factor in the gradual erosion of market share.

Given the current rate of decline (approximately 1.91 percentage points year-over-year), and assuming this pace continues, Google's global market share would remain above 90% by December 31, 2024. The company has a significant buffer (0.91 percentage points) above the 90% threshold, which provides some margin for error in this forecast.

However, I must consider several uncertainties:

1. The holiday shopping season could temporarily shift search behaviors
2. Potential new product launches or features from competitors
3. Unforeseen technical issues or privacy concerns affecting Google
4. StatCounter's data revision practices (they maintain a 45-day quality assurance and revision period)

While acknowledging these uncertainties, I'm placing significant weight on the status quo outcome. The search engine market typically changes slowly due to established user habits, ecosystem lock-in, and the massive infrastructure advantage Google maintains. The 47-day timeframe until December 31 is relatively short for dramatic market shifts in this industry.

Probability: 83%
