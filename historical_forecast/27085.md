(a) **Time left until outcome**: As of August 9, 2024, there are approximately 52 days remaining until the resolution deadline of September 30, 2024.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changes**: As of August 9, 2024, *no* arrest warrant has been issued by the ICC for Benjamin Netanyahu. The Prosecutor’s application for an arrest warrant was filed on May 20, 2024, and the matter is under review by the Pre-Trial Chamber, with no public confirmation of a warrant issued as of this date[1][3][4].

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome**: The ICC Pre-Trial Chamber could continue to deliberate without issuing an arrest warrant, or ultimately deny the Prosecutor’s application before September 30, 2024. Additionally, the process could be delayed, or the Chamber might request further evidence or clarification, pushing any decision past the deadline[1][4].

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome**: Before September 30, 2024, the Pre-Trial Chamber grants the Prosecutor’s application, finding reasonable grounds and jurisdiction, and issues a public arrest warrant for Benjamin Netanyahu. This would be formally announced by the ICC and reported by credible sources, in line with the question’s criteria[1][3][4].

## Rationale

- **Status quo**: The ICC’s process from application to issuance of an arrest warrant generally involves careful judicial review and is not immediate. Based on historical patterns, the period between Prosecutor application and warrant issuance varies, often taking several weeks to a few months. In the case of Vladimir Putin, the process took around five weeks, but that was in a highly publicized and urgent scenario.
- **Current stage**: The Prosecutor’s application against Netanyahu and Gallant was filed on May 20, 2024. As of August 9, 2024—over ten weeks later—no warrant has been publicly issued, suggesting either an ongoing judicial deliberation or possible delays, which is not uncommon for complex cases before the ICC[1][3][4].
- **Political context**: There is unprecedented international pressure against the issuance of warrants for Israeli officials, which could be contributing to delays[1][3]. However, the ICC is mandated to operate independently of political influence.
- **Risk of sudden change**: While the procedural and political context slow the process, the recent past (Putin’s warrant, for example) shows the ICC can move faster in high-profile cases if it chooses. If the Pre-Trial Chamber finds the Prosecutor’s evidence sufficiently compelling, it could issue the warrant before September 30, 2024—but the longer the delay, the lower this chance becomes.

## Final probability estimate

Given:
- The significant time elapsed since the application (over 10 weeks by August 9, 2024)
- No announcement yet despite global attention and precedent for relative ICC speed in other cases
- Intense international lobbying that could create delays
- Only 52 days remaining to the deadline

I assess the probability that the ICC will issue an arrest warrant for Benjamin Netanyahu *before September 30, 2024* as:

**Probability: 30%**

This reflects a still-plausible chance due to the gravity and publicity of the case, but the status quo and recent procedural pace suggest issuance by the deadline is somewhat unlikely absent a sudden move by the Pre-Trial Chamber[1][3][4].
