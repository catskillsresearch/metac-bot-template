(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  
Nvidia's Q3 2024 earnings are expected to be released on November 19, 2024. As of May 6, 2025, this question is now resolved and the answer would depend on the actual reported result from that date.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
In the most recent comparable period (Q3 fiscal 2024, ended October 29, 2023), Nvidia reported GAAP earnings per diluted share of $3.71 and non-GAAP EPS of $4.02[1][2][5]. These are vastly above the $0.74 per share consensus estimate for Q3 2024. Barring a catastrophic decline in business, the status quo, based on recent historical performance and business momentum, would strongly favor earnings well above $0.74 per share.

(c) **Scenario that results in a No outcome:**  
A No outcome (EPS less than or equal to $0.74) would likely require an extreme negative event, such as:

- A sudden collapse in demand for Nvidia's AI/data center products;
- A major supply chain disruption halting shipments;
- Severe regulatory or geopolitical action disrupting core business;
- A massive one-time expense or write-down that dramatically reduces reported earnings.

(d) **Scenario that results in a Yes outcome:**  
A Yes outcome (EPS greater than $0.74) is the base case if Nvidia maintains normal operations, continues benefiting from high demand in AI/data center markets, and follows the trajectory of recent quarters[1][2][5]. Even with some business volatility, EPS would have to fall over 80% from the previous year's comparable quarter to trigger a No.

## Rationale

Recent history shows Nvidia's diluted earnings per share were approximately five times higher than the $0.74 threshold (even going back several quarters)[1][2][5]. The company's growth has been driven by unprecedented demand for AI accelerators, with data center revenues driving both top-line and bottom-line beats far above consensus. Unless there was a dramatic, negative shift in the business environment after early 2024—which is highly unlikely based on medium-term trends—the most probable scenario by far is that Nvidia's reported diluted EPS for Q3 2024 greatly exceeds $0.74 per share.

Good forecasters weigh the status quo heavily, especially when recent results and ongoing sector momentum strongly reinforce the current trajectory. No fundamental signs in the provided data suggest an imminent reversal capable of leading to such an extreme earnings collapse.

**Probability: 99%**
