(a) **Time remaining until outcome is known:**  
Approximately 1 month (the outcome will be determined on September 18, 2024; today is August 16, 2024).

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
Keir Starmer’s approval rating, as tracked by major pollsters and summarized by the Politico Poll of Polls, is currently well below 50% and declining. As of early August, YouGov reported 40% favourable and 49% unfavourable[2], and Ipsos found only 36% saying he is doing a good job[5]. If these levels hold, his approval rating on September 18 will be less than 50.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome (approval rating is 50 or higher):**  
A significant, positive, and widely popular government action or event occurs in the next month—such as a major policy breakthrough, rapid economic improvement, or effective crisis management—leading to a rapid and substantial boost in public approval of Starmer. Polling would need to show a sharp, sustained surge in approval over the next four weeks to cross the 50% threshold.

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome (approval rating is lower than 50):**  
No major positive shocks occur, or challenges/political opposition continue to dominate headlines. Approval ratings remain steady or decline further, reflecting the end of the brief post-election honeymoon and underlying public dissatisfaction. Starmer’s aggregate approval remains in the 30s or 40s, well below 50[1][2][5].

## Rationale

- The historical trend in UK political approval ratings shows that post-election "honeymoon" effects are often short-lived unless accompanied by widely celebrated policy successes or national unity moments. Starmer’s honeymoon appears to have ended quickly, with approval now returning to, or dropping below, pre-election levels[1][2].
- The recent polls—YouGov at 40% favourable and Ipsos at 36% "doing a good job"—indicate that Starmer would need an unprecedented late-summer surge to reach 50% in the next month[2][5].
- No evidence in recent news suggests a likely catalyst for such a dramatic positive swing. The fragmented election result, low turnout, and continued voter dissatisfaction suggest public opinion is more likely to remain tepid than to rally sharply.
- Given these facts, and recognizing that polling and approval metrics are relatively stable outside of major crises or national events, the base-rate expectation is for little change.

## Final Answer

Probability: 95%  
— The likelihood that Keir Starmer's approval rating as Prime Minister of the UK will be less than 50 on September 18, 2024, is extremely high based on current trends and historical patterns[1][2][5].
