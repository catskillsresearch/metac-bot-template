(a) **Time until outcome is known:**  
The outcome will be known after March 4, 2025. As of the current date, May 6, 2025, the event has already passed, but the research assistant's information only goes up to February 25, 2025, so no transcript or public report has yet confirmed Trump's speech content[1][2][3][4][5].

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
If nothing changes and based on all current reporting as of February 25, 2025, there is no evidence that Trump intended to use the terms "AI" or "artificial intelligence" in his address. There are no credible leaks or statements showing these topics are on his agenda, and the resolution criteria are strict: the exact terms must appear in a credible transcript of the address[1][2][3][4][5].

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
- Trump delivers the speech and does not say "AI" or "artificial intelligence."
- Trump discusses technology or innovation policy but avoids saying the required terms.
- Trump does not deliver the address due to scheduling, health, or political events.
- The official transcript from a credible source does not include either term.

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
- Trump directly references "AI" or "artificial intelligence" when discussing technology, the economy, workforce policy, defense, or global competition, and this is reflected in the official transcript.
- Unexpected global or domestic events prompt Trump to address AI policy in the speech, using the explicit terms.

## Rationale

Experienced forecasters know that the most likely outcome is that the status quo persists: if there is no momentum or credible evidence that a new topic (in this case, AI) will be addressed in a highly scripted, internationally watched speech, it usually is not spontaneously added. No announcements, policy previews, or leaks have indicated that AI will be a featured topic[1][2][3][4][5]. Trump's policy themes, as described, focus on "America First," border security, energy, and taxes—none of which inherently require an explicit mention of "AI" or "artificial intelligence." Additionally, Trump often frames high-tech issues under the banner of American business, jobs, and national security, and may avoid technical jargon unless it directly serves a political narrative.

The strong resolution criteria—requiring the exact words in a credible transcript—further bias the probability toward "No" unless there is specific evidence to the contrary. Because no transcript or speech has been released and the invitation letter or coverage does not mention AI, the probability that he will say the required terms is low.

## Final Answer

Probability: 10%
