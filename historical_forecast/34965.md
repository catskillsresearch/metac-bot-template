(a) **Time Remaining Until Outcome:**  
Approximately 7 weeks remain until March 31, 2025.

(b) **Status Quo Outcome (if nothing changes):**  
Warren Buffett is currently ranked just outside the top 5, in 7th or 8th place, with a net worth around $148 billion as of February 2025—still trailing behind Bernard Arnault & family (~$169 billion) and Bill Gates (~$166 billion). If these relative positions hold, Buffett would not be in the top 5 on March 31, 2025.

(c) **Scenario Resulting in a No Outcome:**  
Berkshire Hathaway’s stock and Buffett’s core holdings maintain current performance or grow in line with the broader market, but not enough to surpass the net worth of those currently in the 5th position and above. At the same time, rival billionaires (Arnault, Gates, Zuckerberg, Page, Brin) avoid significant losses or asset declines, keeping Buffett outside the top 5.

(d) **Scenario Resulting in a Yes Outcome:**  
Berkshire Hathaway outperforms expectations considerably, resulting in a major surge in Buffett’s net worth, or one or more people currently ranked above him experience a sharp decline in their asset values—due to market shocks, business setbacks, or currency fluctuations—allowing Buffett to overtake them and move into the top 5.

## Rationale

Buffett’s net worth has increased by approximately $6 billion since the start of 2025, fueled by Berkshire Hathaway’s positive performance[1]. Despite this, he remains about $21 billion behind the 5th spot as of February 2025. Current trends show steady but not extraordinary growth, with other billionaires’ net worths also rising or holding steady[1][3][4].

Historically, movement within the top 5 is slow barring major stock market swings, but volatility and company-specific events can create rapid changes. Over the remaining period, Buffett would need an exceptional gain in Berkshire’s share price, or significant declines from at least two individuals ahead of him, to reach the top 5. While possible, this would require notable changes from the status quo, which historically is not the most likely scenario given the size of the gap[3][4].

Recent history also shows other billionaires, such as Zuckerberg, at times re-entering the top 5 due in part to tech market rallies—suggesting movement is possible, but infrequent and typically necessitates large shifts in tech or luxury sector stock prices[3][4]. There are currently no indications of major asset liquidations, significant philanthropic giving, or negative corporate news that would meaningfully shift the current rankings shortly.

Given these factors, and weighing the likelihood that the present standings persist or only change incrementally, the most probable outcome is that Buffett remains outside the top 5 on March 31, 2025.

**Probability: 25%**
