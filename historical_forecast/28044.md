(a) **Time until outcome known:**  
The Brandenburg state election is scheduled for September 22, 2024. Today is September 12, 2024, so there are 10 days until the election and the outcome becomes known.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
As of the latest publicly available polls, AfD is polling at 29% in Brandenburg[3]. This figure is within the range specified in the question (more than 28% and less than or equal to 30%).

(c) **Scenario for a No outcome:**  
A No outcome would occur if AfD’s final vote share is less than or equal to 28%, or exceeds 30%. This could happen if there is a late drop in AfD support due to campaign controversies, higher-than-expected turnout among anti-AfD voters, successful mobilization by rival parties, significant protest activity, or a polling overestimate of AfD strength.

(d) **Scenario for a Yes outcome:**  
A Yes outcome occurs only if AfD’s official result is strictly more than 28% and less than or equal to 30%. This would be the case if current polling is accurate and turnout or late-campaign developments do not significantly shift voter preferences, resulting in a final vote share that lands within this narrow window.

## Rationale

Recent reputable polling places AfD at 29% in Brandenburg, exactly within the target range[3]. This suggests that, as of today, the **status quo expectation is that AfD will indeed score more than 28% and up to 30%**. The party’s momentum in other eastern German states—scoring 30.6% in Saxony and 32.8% in Thuringia—reinforces this trend, as do broader political developments, such as disillusionment with mainstream parties and AfD’s consolidation in the east[2][3][5].

However, polls can have error margins (typically ±2-3 percentage points), and late shifts are possible. While AfD’s support has been steady or growing, it is also a polarizing party, and late-campaign events—such as anti-AfD protests, negative headlines, or tactical voting against the party—may shave several points off its final tally. Conversely, the undiminished and possibly understated “shy” AfD voter effect could nudge the result slightly higher than polls suggest.

Given the current polling (29%), the probability that AfD’s vote share lands *outside* the narrow 28-30% band—whether a little under (e.g., 27%) or a little over (e.g., 31%)—is significant due to the usual volatility in final voting figures. A percentage point or two shift is quite normal between polls and results, especially in a close, high-salience election. Thus, **while the modal (most likely) single outcome is a vote share within the range, the combined probability of all outcomes outside the range is at least as large**.

In summary, the best estimate—considering current polling, polling error, and the natural uncertainty that remains until the vote—is that the chance AfD’s result falls in the specified band is solid, but moderate, not overwhelming.

**Probability: 40%**
