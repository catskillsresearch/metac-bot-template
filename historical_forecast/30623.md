(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  
Approximately 28 days remain until December 30, 2024.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
As of early December 2024, 1 Bitcoin is worth less than 200,000 Dogecoin. For example, if Bitcoin is at $60,000 and Dogecoin is at $0.40, 1 BTC = 150,000 DOGE. Current DOGE prices are near $0.40–$0.44, making the 200,000 DOGE threshold unlikely unless BTC rises dramatically or DOGE falls sharply[5].

(c) **A scenario that results in a No outcome:**  
Dogecoin continues trading in the $0.34–$0.44 range or higher through December, while Bitcoin remains at or below its current price levels. In this case, the BTC/DOGE ratio stays well below 200,000[5].

(d) **A scenario that results in a Yes outcome:**  
Either Bitcoin rallies significantly (e.g., breaks well above $80,000) or Dogecoin’s price drops sharply (e.g., falls below $0.30) before December 30, 2024. For example, if BTC rises to $80,000 and DOGE falls to $0.40, 1 BTC = 200,000 DOGE; or if BTC holds at $60,000 and DOGE drops below $0.30, the threshold is reached.

## Rationale

Most professional forecasts emphasize the “status quo” or inertia in markets unless there is clear evidence of a major shift. Recent DOGE price action has kept DOGE above $0.40, with forecasts for end-2024 ranging from $0.10 to $0.60, but with the most recent actual price ~ $0.40–$0.44[5][4]. Bitcoin's recent rally does not appear sufficient to offset DOGE's gains unless BTC dramatically outperforms DOGE in December – an event not widely expected by mainstream forecasts.

Dogecoin, driven heavily by speculative sentiment, could experience high volatility, but multiple forecasts for the end of 2024 center around $0.34–$0.60, with some outlier predictions much higher or lower[1][2][4][5].

Given these mid-December price levels and consensus expectations, the “No” scenario (BTC not worth at least 200,000 DOGE) is the default outcome, unless there is an unforeseen market shock favoring BTC or severely hurting DOGE.
