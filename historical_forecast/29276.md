(a) Time until outcome: 8 days (October 28, 2024 to November 5, 2024)

(b) Status quo outcome: No - Kalshi has not shown Donald Trump with a 70% chance of winning before October 28, 2024.

(c) No outcome scenario: Trump's odds on Kalshi continue their current trajectory but never reach 70% in the final week before the election. The market remains competitive with Trump maintaining a modest lead in the 55-65% range, but uncertainty about the outcome prevents his chances from crossing the 70% threshold.

(d) Yes outcome scenario: A major event occurs (such as a significant polling shift, a Harris campaign scandal, or unexpected economic news) that substantially increases Trump's perceived chances of winning, causing his odds on Kalshi to surge past 70% in the final days before the election.

Based on the search results provided, I can analyze the likelihood of Kalshi showing Donald Trump with a 70% chance of winning before November 5, 2024.

The most recent data shows that Trump's chances on Kalshi reached approximately 56-57% in mid-October 2024, with the platform noting that he "extended his lead" at that time[2]. This represents significant momentum for the Republican candidate, but still places him well below the 70% threshold specified in the question.

Looking at the historical trajectory, we can see that Trump's chances have been increasing, with the market demonstrating "strong Republican momentum"[2]. However, the rate of increase is important to consider. From the available information, Trump's odds increased but haven't shown the kind of dramatic surge that would suggest a jump from 57% to 70% within a short timeframe.

Importantly, the search results indicate that Kalshi has become increasingly liquid, with volume "more than doubled in the past 48 hours" as of mid-October[2]. This increased liquidity typically makes prediction markets more stable and less prone to dramatic swings, as more participants and capital lead to more efficient pricing.

For Trump's chances to reach 70% in the remaining days, we would need to see a substantial shift in the electoral landscape or a major event that significantly alters voters' perceptions. While such events are possible in the final days of a campaign, they are relatively rare. Most of the major campaign events (debates, conventions, etc.) have already occurred by late October.

The status quo bias is particularly relevant here. Prediction markets tend to move gradually rather than making dramatic jumps absent major news. With just 8 days remaining until the election, and Trump's chances hovering in the mid-to-high 50s percent range, reaching 70% would require a substantial deviation from the current trajectory.

Additionally, as elections approach, uncertainty typically decreases, which can lead to prediction markets converging toward their final probabilities. If the race is genuinely competitive (as the 56-57% figure suggests), we would expect the odds to stabilize rather than making dramatic moves in the final days.

Given these considerations, while it's certainly possible for Trump's chances to reach 70% on Kalshi before November 5, 2024, the evidence suggests this is unlikely to occur. The current trajectory, the increased market liquidity, and the limited time remaining all point toward a continuation of the status quo, where Trump maintains a lead but doesn't cross the 70% threshold.

Probability: 20%
