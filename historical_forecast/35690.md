(a) **Time left until outcome:**  
There are approximately 26 days until April 1, 2025, when the final status of the Coca-Cola 12-pack's "SNAP EBT eligible" labeling on Amazon will be known.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
As of February 19, 2025, the 12-pack of Coca-Cola at the specified Amazon link is listed as "SNAP EBT eligible." If no relevant changes occur in federal SNAP policy, Amazon's eligibility labeling protocols, or the product's listing status, the most likely outcome is that the label will remain unchanged and visible on April 1, 2025.

(c) **Scenario for a No outcome:**  
A "No" result would occur if, on or after April 1, 2025, Metaculus checks the specified Amazon listing and the exact phrase "SNAP EBT eligible" is not displayed. This could happen if:
- Federal SNAP guidelines are amended to exclude soft drinks (like Coca-Cola) from eligibility.
- Amazon changes its labeling system, removes the phrase, or modifies how eligibility is displayed (even if the product is still eligible, the specific phrase might be absent).
- The 12-pack listing gets delisted, replaced by a third-party seller, or otherwise altered so that it no longer qualifies for SNAP (for example, changes in seller status or fulfillment method).
- There is a technical or policy update that interrupts how labels display on Amazon.

(d) **Scenario for a Yes outcome:**  
A "Yes" result would occur if, on or after April 1, 2025, the Amazon product page for the 12-pack of Coca-Cola (or its direct primary replacement) continues to display the exact phrase "SNAP EBT eligible" when accessed from the United States. This will happen if:
- SNAP eligibility rules for soft drinks remain unchanged at the federal level.
- Amazon continues its current practice of labeling eligible items with the exact language specified in the question.
- The listing’s fulfillment method or primary seller does not change in a way that affects eligibility or labeling.

## Rationale

Federal SNAP rules still consider soft drinks (including Coca-Cola products) as eligible food items. Recent SNAP changes have focused on income eligibility and streamlining application processes, with no indication of moves to exclude soft drinks or other sodas from the eligible product list[5]. Amazon’s approach to SNAP EBT labeling has involved displaying the "SNAP EBT eligible" tag on qualifying food items, and this protocol is documented on both official Amazon and third-party guides as recently as early 2025[1][2][5].

No evidence has emerged of an imminent federal policy shift targeting soft drinks’ eligibility. Similarly, there have been no announcements from Amazon suggesting a change in their eligibility labeling practices or a specific alteration to the Coca-Cola 12-pack product listing.

The most likely risks to the status quo are:
- An unexpected rapid change in federal SNAP policy about eligible foods, unlikely given the slow pace of such changes.
- Amazon making a technical or branding update to the label language itself (removing or changing the phrase "SNAP EBT eligible").
- The specific product’s listing being altered, delisted, or moved to a third-party seller before April 1, 2025.

Such abrupt changes are rare and typically signaled in advance, neither of which have been observed as of March 6, 2025.

**Given the short timeframe, the absence of relevant policy or product change signals, and the inertia typical in such programs and labeling conventions, the best forecast is that the status quo will persist through April 1, 2025.**
