(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
The final outcome will be known after both remaining tournaments conclude: the Saint Louis Rapid & Blitz and the Sinquefield Cup. These are scheduled for later in 2024, so resolution is expected within a few months.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changes:**  
With current standings as of May 2024, Gukesh Dommaraju sits in 6th place with 19.25 points, trailing the leader Alireza Firouzja (43.58 points) by 24.33 points. If all players perform at their usual level and no dramatic shifts occur, Gukesh is very unlikely to win the overall Grand Chess Tour[1].

(c) **Scenario for a No outcome:**  
Gukesh does not win either of the remaining two tournaments or does not earn enough points to overtake all players ahead of him (notably Firouzja, Caruana, Vachier-Lagrave, So, and Praggnanandhaa). Even if he performs well, if any of the leaders maintain strong results, Gukesh finishes outside first overall.

(d) **Scenario for a Yes outcome:**  
Gukesh wins both remaining tournaments or achieves near-maximum points in them. Simultaneously, the current leaders (especially Firouzja and Caruana) must significantly underperform, allowing Gukesh to close and overcome his 24.33-point deficit and finish atop the final standings.

## Rationale

While Gukesh is an elite player and reigning World Champion, the mathematics of the current standings make his path to Grand Chess Tour victory extremely daunting. The deficit is large, and he must not only excel but also rely on multiple competitors faltering. Grand Chess Tour events award points for placement, but without an exceptionally high swing in both his and the leaders’ performances, status quo heavily favors a "No" outcome[1].

Additionally, Gukesh’s rapid and blitz ratings are notably lower than his classical, suggesting the Saint Louis Rapid & Blitz may not be his strongest format, further reducing his chances to maximize points in that event. The classical Sinquefield Cup could better suit him, but it still requires back-to-back exceptional results and others’ poor performance[4].

Given these factors, forecasters should weigh the status quo outcome most heavily. While chess can deliver surprises, the most probable scenario, based on all pre-August 2024 information, is that Gukesh will not win the 2024 Grand Chess Tour.
