(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
There are approximately 7 weeks remaining until March 28, 2025. This is the deadline for OpenAI to publicly release the full o3 model via web interface for the question to resolve as "Yes."

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changes:**  
As of February 6, 2025, the full o3 model has not been publicly released via web interface; only o3-mini is available to users. If OpenAI takes no further action, the question will resolve as "No"[1][2][4][5].

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
OpenAI does not publicly release the full o3 model before March 28, 2025—either because of technical, safety, or strategic reasons—or only provides access to o3-mini or other variants with qualifiers indicating they are not the full o3. If the release is after the deadline, restricted to invite-only users, or limited to API access only (not web interface), the outcome will be "No"[1][2][4][5].

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
OpenAI publicly releases the full o3 model—without "preview," "mini," or similar qualifiers—via a web interface accessible to users in the United States, before March 28, 2025. This release could be for all users or restricted to paying subscribers, as long as it is not invite-only or waitlisted, and at least two Metaculus admins can independently access it[1][2][4][5].

## Rationale

OpenAI has a pattern of announcing models with some lead time before public web availability. The o3-mini model was released as scheduled on January 31, 2025, and is confirmed available via ChatGPT and API. However, there is no documented case of the full o3 model being released as of February 6, 2025, and all available information indicates it remains unreleased[1][2][4][5].

Historical precedent suggests that OpenAI sometimes announces ambitious timelines but can experience delays, especially for significant advances or when safety testing is emphasized[1][4]. Despite Sam Altman's December 2024 comment that o3 would come "shortly after" o3-mini, over a week has passed since the o3-mini release with no sign of full o3 public availability. No official date for the full o3 release has been published, nor have there been credible leaks or hints about imminent web rollout.

If OpenAI follows its announcement timelines, release could still plausibly occur before the deadline, particularly if last-mile safety testing concludes satisfactorily. However, delays, risk aversion, and the technical leap involved in the o3 architecture (as described in benchmarks and in the context of AGI-like capabilities) all increase the chance that extra care—and thus delay—will be taken[1][4][5].

Given the lack of any recent updates, the cautious position is to place extra weight on the status quo holding. Rapid, publicly accessible launches have historically been less common for OpenAI's most advanced models; GPT-4, for example, was initially limited to a smaller audience and API before broader release.

**Probability: 30%**

- There remains some chance OpenAI will release the full o3 publicly on web by March 28, 2025, as the company has signaled intent to do so after o3-mini, but with no current evidence of imminent release, delays and risk management pressures suggest the "No" outcome is more likely barring new developments in the next seven weeks[1][2][4][5].
