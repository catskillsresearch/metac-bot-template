(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  
There are about 21 days left until January 1, 2025, when the outcome will be determined.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
If nothing changes (i.e., no new layoff events at Apple are reported by Tech Crunch for November or December 2024), the outcome will be **No**—Tech Crunch will *not* have reported new Apple layoffs in the specified period.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
Apple does not announce or execute any new layoffs during November or December 2024, or, if it does, Tech Crunch does not update its layoff tracker to include Apple for those months. In this situation, Apple will not appear in the Tech Crunch tracker under November or December 2024 and the question will resolve as No.

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
Apple is reported by Tech Crunch’s layoff tracker as having conducted a layoff in either November or December 2024. This would require Tech Crunch to update its tracker to specifically list Apple as a company with layoffs during that period.

## Rationale

- **Status quo bias:** The conservative assumption is that there will be *no new Apple layoffs reported* by Tech Crunch in the remaining three weeks of 2024. Historically, Apple has been relatively conservative with mass layoffs compared to many peers, and there are no current signals or rumors (from search results or general knowledge) suggesting imminent, large-scale layoffs at Apple for the end of 2024.
- **Tech Crunch update cadence:** Tech Crunch maintains and regularly updates its layoff tracker, but many layoff events are concentrated at the start of years or coincide with earnings reports and fiscal restructuring, which is often earlier in the year[1][5].
- **Industry momentum:** While 2024 has seen substantial layoffs in the tech sector, the majority of headline-making layoffs have come from other companies (e.g., Cisco, SAP, PayPal, Salesforce, iRobot)[4][5]. Apple’s name does not appear in the list of significant 2024 layoffs, suggesting such events at Apple remain rare.
- **Search report limitations:** There are no signals or rumors of new, large-scale Apple layoffs or Tech Crunch preparing to report such an event as of December 10, 2024. The absence of Apple in recent layoff summaries (including the major events through August 2024[5]) supports the default assumption of no new near-term layoffs.

## Final Answer

**Probability: 10%**

This reflects a small but nonzero likelihood that unforeseen events could cause a last-minute Apple layoff that is significant enough for Tech Crunch to report and list before January 1, 2025. The vast majority of scenarios, however, point to a No outcome given the lack of current signals and the weight of the status quo.
