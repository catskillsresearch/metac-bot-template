(a) **Time until outcome is known:**  
The Olympic tennis events will take place from July 27 to August 4, 2024. As of the search date (July 22, 2024), the outcome will be known in about two weeks.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
Historically, most athletes win either no medal or a single medal in Olympic tennis, as winning multiple medals requires entering and performing at a high level in both singles and at least one doubles event. The status quo is that *no athlete wins multiple medals*.

(c) **Scenario for a No outcome:**  
No athlete reaches the podium in more than one event. For instance, top singles players either do not participate in doubles/mixed doubles or are eliminated before the medal rounds in their secondary event. Doubles specialists likewise do not medal in both gender and mixed doubles.

(d) **Scenario for a Yes outcome:**  
An athlete enters both singles and doubles (or mixed doubles) and medals in both events. For example, if Carlos Alcaraz were to medal in singles and also in men’s doubles or mixed doubles, the Yes criteria would be met. The same scenario applies for any player managing a medal in two combinations of events, regardless of medal color.

## Rationale

- The event structure, with five possible medal opportunities and the option for players to compete in multiple events, makes a multi-medal outcome *possible* each Olympics[4]. However, the physical demands, scheduling, and need for high-level partnership in doubles add significant hurdles.
- Some of the top contenders in men’s singles (e.g., Carlos Alcaraz, Novak Djokovic, Jannik Sinner) are strong singles players, but it is unclear from available sources whether they are confirmed to play doubles or mixed doubles[3].
- In past Olympics, it is *rare but not unprecedented* for a player to win more than one medal. Notable examples include Venus and Serena Williams (women’s singles and doubles in 2000, 2008, 2012) and Andy Murray (singles and mixed doubles finalist in 2012).
- There is no confirmation in the search results of a high-profile player being actively favored or announced for multiple events[1][3].
- Bookmaker odds and previews focus on singles prospects, not doubles combinations[3], suggesting that, for favorites, energy and attention may be on singles play.
- The field is deep and competitive, which further decreases the likelihood of a single player or pair dominating across multiple draws[5].

Given that the status quo is usually *No*, but the structure and history allow for a *Yes*, a probability between 20–35% is seen as reasonable in expert forecasting circles for this specific scenario, depending on the entry lists and known doubles partnerships.
