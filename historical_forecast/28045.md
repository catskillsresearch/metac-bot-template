(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
The Brandenburg state election will be held on September 22, 2024. As today is September 12, 2024, there are 10 days remaining until the election results will be known.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
Recent polling in Brandenburg puts AfD at 29%[3]. This is above the 28% threshold in question, suggesting that, if trends hold steady, AfD would receive *more* than 28% of the vote.

(c) **Brief scenario for a No outcome (vote share ≤ 28%):**  
AfD’s vote share could end up at or below 28% if:
- Late-campaign controversies or negative media coverage erode support.
- Opposition parties, especially the CDU or left-of-center parties, mobilize their voters very effectively.
- Protests or public backlash against AfD’s radicalization impact turnout or shift undecided voters.
- Strategic voting occurs as mainstream and left-leaning voters seek to block an AfD plurality.

(d) **Brief scenario for a Yes outcome (vote share > 28%):**  
AfD surpasses 28% if:
- Its growing regional popularity continues unchecked, as seen in recent state elections in Thuringia (32.8%) and Saxony (about 30%)[2][4].
- Voter discontent with the federal government translates into higher support for AfD.
- The party successfully mobilizes its base, and turnout among opposition supporters remains split or low.
- Protests and opposition backlash fail to convert into increased turnout for mainstream parties, or even fuel AfD support by consolidating its anti-establishment appeal.

## Rationale

The most recent reliable polling places AfD at 29% in Brandenburg[3]. This is a crucial detail: while earlier in the summer AfD was polling closer to 24%, its support appears to have increased as the election nears, now surpassing the 28% line in several polls[3]. In both Saxony and Thuringia, AfD recently achieved about 30% or more, marking a significant surge across the region[2][4]. 

While sudden shifts are always possible in the final days, political change tends to be gradual, and the status quo—that is, the most recent polling average—holds considerable predictive value, especially when the margin is not razor-thin. Brandenburg’s political landscape does differ slightly from Saxony and Thuringia, but the trends suggest it is currently part of the same broader east German surge for the AfD.

A substantial late-campaign swing, unprecedented turnout shift, or major scandal would be required to push AfD down to 28% or below. While large-scale anti-AfD protests have occurred throughout the year and could limit their ceiling[5], similar bottom-up mobilization efforts have not stopped the party from achieving high vote shares elsewhere in eastern Germany.

## Final Probability

Given:
- Most recent polls show AfD at or just above 28% in Brandenburg[3].
- Status quo polling is a strong predictor, and AfD has outperformed its polls slightly in some recent eastern state-level races.
- The margin above 28% is not enormous, but it is clear and consistent across several sources.

**Probability: 70%**
