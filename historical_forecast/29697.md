(a) **Time remaining until outcome:**  
About 54 days remain until January 1, 2025, when the outcome of this question will be known.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changes:**  
As of November 7, 2024, Thomas Massie has not been announced as the nominee for Secretary of Agriculture. If no further announcements are made, the outcome will remain **No**[2][1][5].

(c) **Scenario for a No outcome:**  
No formal announcement is made by Donald Trump or his transition team naming Thomas Massie as the nominee for Secretary of Agriculture before January 1, 2025. The role may go to another candidate, or the decision may be delayed past the deadline[1][5].

(d) **Scenario for a Yes outcome:**  
Donald Trump or his transition team publicly announces, via credible media or official communication, that Thomas Massie is the nominee for Secretary of Agriculture before January 1, 2025. This resolves the question as Yes, regardless of any subsequent reversals or Massie’s response.

## Rationale

Currently, Thomas Massie is being discussed as a candidate and is seen as "in the mix" among several potential nominees[5]. He has expressed willingness to serve and interest in the position[2][5]. However, Massie has directly stated, as of November 7, 2024, that he has "not received any commitments or offers from President Trump's team," and that discussion of appointments is "premature"[2].

Massie is considered a "long shot choice" compared to established figures like Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller and others who have strong ties to agricultural constituencies[1][5]. While his name is circulating in various reports and advocacy spaces, and allies such as Joel Salatin have suggested optimism about his candidacy, there is no credible report of an actual nomination or commitment.

Given 54 days remain, and the transition process is underway, an announcement naming Massie is possible but would require a significant shift from the current status—either through Trump making an unconventional pick or Massie’s candidacy gaining momentum over other contenders. The absence of any commitment as of now, combined with the presence of multiple high-profile competitors, means the base rate should be tilted toward the status quo (no announcement) unless more direct signals or leaks suggest otherwise.
