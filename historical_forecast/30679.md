I'll analyze the question about December 2024 temperatures at Barrow/Port Rogers weather station in Alaska.

(a) Time until outcome is known: About 1 month. The outcome will be known after December 31, 2024, when the complete December 2024 temperature data becomes available on the Iowa Environmental Mesonet.

(b) Status quo outcome: The status quo would be that December 2024 temperatures at Barrow/Port Rogers will not exceed the 1945-2023 December average by ≥6 degrees F. Historically, such large monthly anomalies are relatively rare, even with Arctic warming trends.

(c) Scenario for No outcome: Normal or slightly elevated Arctic temperatures in December 2024, influenced by typical seasonal weather patterns. While still warmer than historical averages (due to ongoing Arctic warming), the temperature anomaly stays below the 6°F threshold. Perhaps a period of cooler weather or storms moves through the region, keeping the monthly average closer to historical norms.

(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: An exceptionally strong warm air intrusion occurs over the North Slope of Alaska throughout December 2024. Persistent southerly winds bring unusually warm air masses to Barrow/Port Rogers. Sea ice formation is delayed or minimal near the coast, removing the typical cooling effect. These factors combine to produce a monthly anomaly exceeding the 6°F threshold.

## Analysis of Available Evidence

The Arctic is experiencing accelerated warming at approximately three times the global average rate, according to the Arctic Council. This has led to significant environmental changes including melting sea ice, permafrost thaw, and increasing frequency of temperature extremes.

Barrow/Port Rogers (now officially named Utqiaġvik) is particularly vulnerable to these warming trends due to its coastal Arctic location. The station has recorded a general warming trend over past decades, especially in winter months.

However, the specific threshold of ≥6°F above the 1945-2023 December average represents a significant anomaly. While such large monthly deviations are becoming more common with climate change, they're still not the norm for any given month.

## Factors Affecting December 2024 Temperatures

Several factors will influence December 2024 temperatures at this location:

1. **Sea ice conditions**: Reduced sea ice coverage allows ocean heat to warm the atmosphere. If December 2024 has significantly delayed or reduced sea ice formation near Barrow, temperatures could be elevated.

2. **Atmospheric circulation patterns**: Arctic Oscillation, polar vortex behavior, and jet stream positioning all significantly impact short-term Arctic temperatures. These patterns are difficult to predict months in advance.

3. **El Niño/La Niña conditions**: While ENSO effects are less direct in the Arctic than lower latitudes, they can influence broader circulation patterns affecting Alaska.

4. **Background warming trend**: The underlying climate change signal increases the probability of warmer temperatures compared to historical averages.

## Historical Context and Precedent

Looking at recent years, the Arctic has experienced unprecedented warming, with some winter months showing dramatic temperature anomalies. However, a monthly anomaly of ≥6°F still represents a significant threshold that isn't reached every year, even in today's warming Arctic.

## Final Assessment

The evidence suggests that while Arctic warming is making temperature anomalies more extreme and more frequent, a December monthly anomaly of ≥6°F at Barrow/Port Rogers still represents a relatively high threshold. Given the ongoing climate trends, such an anomaly is certainly possible but not highly probable for any specific December.

Without specific seasonal forecast data for December 2024, I must rely on the general warming trend while recognizing the natural variability that affects any specific month. The background warming signal increases the likelihood above what it would have been historically, but natural variability means that not every month will see extreme anomalies.

Following forecasting best practices, I should give substantial weight to the status quo (no extreme anomaly) while acknowledging the increasing probability of warm extremes due to climate change.

Probability: 35%
