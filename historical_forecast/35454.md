I'll analyze the DOGE savings per taxpayer forecast for March 31, 2025, using the available information.

(a) Time left until outcome is known: 33 days (from May 6, 2025 back to March 31, 2025)

(b) Outcome if nothing changed: Based on the search results, DOGE claimed savings of approximately $37.69 billion as of February 12, 2025[5]. Assuming approximately 161 million taxpayers (standard estimate), this would translate to about $234 per taxpayer.

(c) Outcome if current trend continued: The search results indicate DOGE's savings claims have been subject to significant corrections. Initially claiming $55 billion in savings, this number appears to have been reduced to around $32.5 billion after corrections[4]. If we assume this corrected figure and modest growth through March, the per-taxpayer amount would likely be between $200-$250.

(d) Expectations of experts and markets: According to Wolfe Research analysts, DOGE could potentially save between $60 billion and $350 billion annually[5]. Elon Musk himself projected savings reaching $4 billion per day (roughly $1.5 trillion per year)[5], which would be approximately $9,300 per taxpayer annually, or about $775 per month. However, these projections appear extremely optimistic given the corrections already made to DOGE's claimed savings.

(e) Unexpected scenario resulting in low outcome: A comprehensive audit reveals further accounting errors in DOGE's methodology, forcing additional significant downward revisions to their savings claims. Public scrutiny increases after media outlets highlight discrepancies, resulting in a more conservative approach to calculating savings.

(f) Unexpected scenario resulting in high outcome: DOGE identifies several major sources of waste that can be immediately eliminated, including substantial fraud in government benefit programs. The administration implements rapid policy changes through executive action that allow for immediate budget cuts, dramatically accelerating the rate of savings in March.

Based on the available information, DOGE's savings claims have been questioned and corrected downward. The organization has demonstrated a tendency to overestimate savings initially before making corrections[4]. While there are ambitious projections about potential savings ($350 billion annually according to some analysts)[5], the actual verified savings appear substantially lower.

The $5,000 stimulus check proposal being discussed indicates confidence in significant savings[2][3], but this appears aspirational rather than based on current actual savings. The fact that DOGE has had to correct significant accounting errors suggests their tracking methodology is still evolving[4].
