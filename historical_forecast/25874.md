(a) Time until outcome: The 2024 Tour de France started on June 29 and will end on July 21, 2024. Today is July 8, 2024, so there are 13 days remaining until the outcome is known.

(b) Status quo outcome: Based on recent Tour de France editions, there's a mixed pattern of time gaps. In 2023, the gap was 7:29 (over 3 minutes), but in 2022 it was 2:43 (under 3 minutes). Looking at the current race dynamics and the performances we've seen so far, Tadej Pogačar is showing dominance, setting up a potential for a gap exceeding 3 minutes.

(c) Scenario for No outcome: Jonas Vingegaard, despite returning from injury, steadily improves throughout the race and manages to limit his time losses in the mountains. The remaining time trials allow him to stay within striking distance of Pogačar. Team Visma-Lease a Bike provides excellent tactical support, preventing Pogačar from gaining significant time advantages. The final time trial in Nice sees Vingegaard performing exceptionally well, keeping the gap under 3 minutes.

(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: Pogačar continues his exceptional form shown in the Giro d'Italia and early Tour stages, dominating in the mountain stages. Vingegaard, still not at full strength from his injury, struggles to match Pogačar's pace on climbs. The upcoming time trials, totaling nearly 60km, allow Pogačar to further extend his lead. Other contenders like Roglič and Evenepoel fail to consistently challenge Pogačar, allowing him to focus his energy on building a substantial lead over second place.

## Rationale for Forecast

The 2024 Tour de France presents a unique scenario where several factors suggest a wider time gap is likely between first and second place.

First, examining the race structure, the 2024 Tour features a challenging route with significant climbing from the very first stage and concludes with a time trial rather than the traditional parade stage. This final 35.2km time trial in Stage 21 from Monaco to Nice includes climbs like La Turbie (8.1km at 5.6%) and Col d'Eze (1.6km at 8.1%), which could potentially expand time gaps on the final day.

The inclusion of time bonuses also plays a role in potentially widening gaps. At the finish of each stage (except the two individual time trials), the first three riders receive 10, 6, and 4 seconds respectively, and there are additional bonus points available at critical points on certain stages (stages 2, 4, 11, and 17) with premiums of 8, 5, and 2 seconds.

Looking at historical patterns, large time gaps have occurred frequently in recent Tours. The 2023 gap of 7:29 significantly exceeded our 3-minute threshold, while 2022's gap of 2:43 fell just short. The 2021 gap was 5:20, again exceeding 3 minutes. This shows that large gaps are common in modern Tours, especially when one rider is significantly dominant.

The current form of the favorites also suggests a potentially large gap. Tadej Pogačar has been described as "unreachable" based on his performances, including his dominant Giro d'Italia victory. Meanwhile, Jonas Vingegaard, the two-time defending champion, is returning from injury and may not be at full strength. This disparity in form could lead to Pogačar building a substantial lead.

Team dynamics also favor a larger gap, with Pogačar's UAE Team Emirates showing strength while Vingegaard's Visma-Lease a Bike team has faced difficulties this season.

The weather and unexpected events remain wild cards that could affect the outcome. Crashes, illness, or tactical surprises could dramatically alter the final time gap in either direction.

Weighing all these factors, while acknowledging that the status quo in bicycle racing can shift rapidly, the evidence points toward a gap exceeding 3 minutes being more likely than not.
