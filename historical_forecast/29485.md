Looking at the information provided, I need to analyze the likelihood of California's Proposition 33 passing in the 2024 general election.

(a) Time left until outcome: The outcome will be known after the election on Tuesday, November 5, 2024, which is less than 1 day away from the current date (May 6, 2025). However, based on the search results, we already have the election results.

(b) Status quo outcome: The status quo would be that Proposition 33 does not pass, maintaining the Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act of 1995 that limits local governments' ability to implement rent control.

(c) Scenario for No outcome: Voters remain concerned about potential negative impacts on housing development and prefer maintaining existing limits on rent control. Historical resistance to similar measures like Proposition 21 (2020) may continue, with voters heeding warnings from opponents that the measure could freeze housing construction.

(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: Growing frustration with high rents and housing costs leads voters to support giving local governments more power to implement rent control. Support from tenant advocacy groups and organizations like the California Nurses Association successfully convinces voters that expanded rent control would provide needed relief.

Looking at the search results, we have actual election results for Proposition 33. According to search result [5], Proposition 33 was defeated with 60% voting No (8,975,542 votes) and only 39.9% voting Yes (5,979,880 votes). The race was called at 12:02 AM PT on November 6, 2024, with 99% of votes counted by the Associated Press.

This outcome aligns with historical precedent, as California voters previously rejected similar measures. The 2020 Proposition 21, which would have authorized cities to enact rent control ordinances, similarly failed with only 40.1% approval. The results of Proposition 33 in 2024 show almost exactly the same level of support (39.9%).

The failure of Proposition 33 reflects continued voter concerns about the potential negative impacts of expanded rent control on housing development, as argued by opponents. Despite significant campaign spending on both sides and the ongoing housing affordability crisis in California, voters ultimately maintained the status quo regarding rent control limitations.

Probability: 0%
