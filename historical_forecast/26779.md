(a) Time left until outcome: The outcome will be known after September 30, 2024, when the EPA publishes complete Q3 2024 data (approximately 2 months from today).

(b) Status quo outcome: Currently, there has been 1 day with AQI > 150 in Q3 2024 (as of July 29). If no further days exceed this threshold, the answer would be No.

(c) Scenario for No outcome: Wildfire activity remains moderate in Washington, Oregon, and British Columbia, with occasional smoke events that cause hazy conditions but mostly remain in the upper atmosphere without significantly impacting ground-level air quality in Seattle.

(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: Multiple severe wildfires develop in Washington state and British Columbia in August and September, combined with unfavorable wind patterns that funnel smoke directly into the Seattle metro area for extended periods, causing at least 10 more days with AQI > 150.

## Analysis of Current Conditions and Forecasts

As of August 1, 2024, wildfire smoke from eastern Washington and Oregon is expected to reach Seattle by early Friday. However, meteorologists predict this smoke will initially remain at higher levels of the atmosphere, causing hazy conditions and colorful sunsets rather than severely impacting ground-level air quality[3]. While the Puget Sound Clean Air Agency indicates air quality could drop to moderate or worse, much depends on smoke volume, plume height, and wind speeds - all difficult to predict with certainty[3].

## Historical Patterns and 2024 Outlook

Looking at the historical data, Seattle has experienced 11 or more days with AQI > 150 only twice in the past decade (2017 and 2022). Most years have shown significantly fewer bad air days, with five of the ten years having 3 or fewer such days.

For 2024, forecasts indicate:
- A quick start to wildfire season with slightly more active conditions than normal across Washington and British Columbia[2]
- Potentially less active fire conditions in Oregon and California, especially in the first half of the season[2]
- King County is predicted to have approximately 21 days in 2024 with an AQI over 100 (unhealthy for sensitive groups)[1]

It's important to note that the prediction of 21 days with AQI > 100 doesn't directly tell us how many days will exceed the much higher threshold of 150. Typically, only a subset of poor air quality days reach the "unhealthy for all" category.

## Factors Increasing Risk

Several factors suggest elevated risk compared to some previous years:
- Scientific observations indicate worsening trends in air quality from wildfire smoke in the region[5]
- The Washington Department of Ecology has launched an enhanced air quality monitoring map in response to the 2024 wildfire season already being underway[4]
- Climate change continues to increase wildfire risk in the Pacific Northwest

## Factors Decreasing Risk

Counterbalancing factors include:
- So far, only one day in Q3 has exceeded AQI 150
- The historical record shows that having 11+ days over AQI 150 is relatively rare (20% of recent years)
- Early season forecasts suggest potentially less severe fire activity in Oregon and California, which can be significant sources of smoke for Seattle

## Weighing the Evidence

Given that we already have 1 day with AQI > 150 and are just entering the traditional peak fire season (August-September), there's a meaningful chance of reaching 11 days. However, the status quo suggests we would need a significant escalation in wildfire activity to reach that threshold.

Most years (8 out of 10) have fallen short of 11 days, suggesting that the base rate probability favors a "No" outcome. The current forecasts indicate an above-average fire season in Washington and BC, but not necessarily an extreme one that would produce unprecedented air quality impacts.
