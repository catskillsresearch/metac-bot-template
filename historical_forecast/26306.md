(a) Time left until outcome: 133 days (from May 6, 2025 to September 16, 2024)
(b) Status quo outcome: This appears to be a question about a past event (September 16, 2024) being asked from May 6, 2025. The status quo would be the actual historical outcome that occurred on that date.
(c) No outcome scenario: If global markets experienced significant downturns in Q3 2024, causing billionaire wealth to decline broadly, or if the Bloomberg Billionaires Index methodology changed to become more restrictive.
(d) Yes outcome scenario: If strong market performance, particularly in technology sectors, boosted billionaire wealth, or if substantial IPOs or acquisitions created new billionaire wealth pushing the 500th position above $6 billion.

I notice there's a temporal inconsistency in this question. The current date provided is Tuesday, May 6, 2025, but I'm being asked to forecast an event that would have already occurred on September 16, 2024. Since I'm restricted to information available before July 19, 2024, and the question asks about a date in the future from that perspective, I'll proceed with my forecast accordingly.

The Bloomberg Billionaires Index is a daily ranking of the world's richest people, with net worth figures updated at the close of every trading day in New York[3]. The index serves as a dynamic measure of personal wealth based on changes in markets, the economy, and Bloomberg reporting[3].

Looking at the available information, I don't have specific data on what the current 500th position value is as of July 2024. The search results don't provide this crucial baseline information. Without knowing the starting point, it's difficult to determine how far the value needs to move to reach the $6 billion threshold.

What we do know is that billionaire wealth, particularly among top-ranked individuals, has been trending upward. Major billionaires like Jeff Bezos saw significant wealth increases in 2023, with wealth doubling for several top billionaires since 2020[4]. Technology sector performance appears to be a major driver of billionaire wealth, with eight of the ten richest billionaires having connections to the tech sector[4].

The Bloomberg Index calculation methodology considers several factors, including stock performance, market capitalization, and ownership stakes. The inclusion criteria involve a confidence score system and specific calculations for adjusted market capitalization[1].

For the 500th position to reach $6 billion by September 2024, several factors would need to align:

1. Strong overall market performance, particularly in sectors heavily represented among billionaires
2. Potential new entrants to the billionaire ranks through IPOs or significant value appreciation
3. Stability in global economic conditions

Given the typical wealth concentration patterns, the gap between the very top billionaires and those near the 500th position is substantial. While top billionaires may have hundreds of billions, those near the bottom of the list would have considerably less.

Without specific data on the current 500th position value, I must rely on broader trends. The strong performance of billionaire wealth in recent years suggests an upward trajectory, but market volatility and potential economic headwinds create significant uncertainty.

Considering the principle that the status quo often persists, and absent specific contradictory evidence, I'm inclined to give moderate weight to the possibility that the 500th position will reach $6 billion. However, the lack of specific baseline data introduces considerable uncertainty.

Probability: 55%
