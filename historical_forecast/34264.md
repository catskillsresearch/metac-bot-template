(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  
Approximately 2 months (the question resolves on April 1, 2025; today is January 29, 2025).

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
No public health emergency (PHE) declaration by the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) for Marburg virus disease.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
The Tanzania outbreak remains limited in scope—no sustained transmission outside affected districts, no significant case importation risk to the US, and US authorities continue monitoring and technical assistance without escalating to an emergency declaration. As seen with the recent Rwanda outbreak, the US responds with travel advisories and support but does not declare a PHE[4][5].

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
The Tanzania outbreak escalates rapidly, with widespread transmission to urban centers or neighboring countries, evidence of onward international spread, or identification of importation to the US or US territories. The threat of domestic transmission prompts HHS to declare a Marburg-specific PHE to mobilize resources, accelerate countermeasures, or implement additional public health authorities.

## Rationale

- **Status Quo Weight:** The US has not declared a PHE for Marburg during recent outbreaks, despite fatalities and healthcare worker involvement in Rwanda and the current small but monitored Tanzania outbreak[4][5]. US response thus far has involved technical assistance, travel advisories, and vaccination support, consistent with a high threshold for PHE declarations in the absence of clear threat escalation[4][5].
- **PREP Act Declaration:** There is already a standing PREP Act declaration concerning Marburgvirus, intended to provide immunity for countermeasures, but this is distinct from a formal HHS PHE declaration and does not meet the question criteria[1][3][5].
- **Current Outbreak Status:** Tanzania's president and health authorities have publicly expressed confidence in containment efforts, and as of now, only a small number of confirmed or suspected cases are reported. No evidence exists of uncontrolled spread or US domestic risk[4].
- **Historical Precedent:** HHS reserves PHE declarations for exceptional situations (e.g., COVID-19, mpox), typically involving clear, direct threats to US health security or urgent needs to access emergency powers, neither of which are currently evident for Marburg.

## Final Assessment

Given the limited scope and current containment of the Marburg virus outbreaks, coupled with the US's measured response and lack of immediate threat to domestic health, it is unlikely—though not impossible—that HHS will declare a public health emergency before April 1, 2025. This could change rapidly if the outbreak expands dramatically or secondary international cases arise, but history and current developments support the status quo.
