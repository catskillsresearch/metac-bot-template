I'll approach this forecasting question systematically by analyzing the relevant information about the Chevron doctrine overturning and its potential impact on Clean Air Act challenges.

(a) Time left until outcome: 67 days (from May 6, 2025 to October 1, 2024)
Wait, that's incorrect - the date shown is May 6, 2025, which is after the resolution date of October 1, 2024. The question has already been resolved.

Let me adjust and approach this based on the information available as of June/July 2024:

(a) Time left until outcome: Approximately 2-3 months (from June/July 2024 to October 1, 2024)
(b) Status quo outcome: No - no federal court has yet ruled against a major Clean Air Act provision specifically citing Chevron's overturning
(c) No outcome scenario: Courts take time to process cases challenging Clean Air Act provisions, and none reach final ruling stage before October 1, 2024, or courts rule on Clean Air Act cases without specifically citing Chevron's overturning as a key factor
(d) Yes outcome scenario: An existing challenge to a major Clean Air Act provision (like the "Good Neighbor" rule or greenhouse gas regulations) receives an expedited hearing and a federal court explicitly cites the Chevron overturning as justification for striking down or limiting the provision

## Analysis of Recent Developments

The Supreme Court overturned the Chevron doctrine on June 28, 2024, in a 6-3 decision that fundamentally changes how courts will evaluate agency interpretations of ambiguous laws[1][4]. Chief Justice Roberts, writing for the majority, called the Chevron doctrine "fundamentally misguided" and stated that the judiciary has "the sole prerogative to 'say what the law is'"[1][2].

This decision represents a seismic shift in administrative law after 40 years of precedent. Justice Elena Kagan's dissent predicted that the ruling "will cause a massive shock to the legal system"[1]. The Chevron doctrine had been cited over 18,000 times by federal courts considering administrative authority[5].

## Timeline Considerations

With the Chevron decision issued on June 28, 2024, there are only about three months until the October 1, 2024 deadline. This is a relatively short timeframe for:

1. Litigants to incorporate the Chevron overturning into existing challenges
2. Courts to hear arguments, deliberate, and issue final rulings
3. Those rulings to specifically address major Clean Air Act provisions while explicitly citing Chevron

Federal court proceedings typically move slowly. Even if cases were already in progress before the Chevron decision, incorporating this new precedent and reaching a final ruling would normally take more time than is available.

## Existing Challenges and Likelihood of Quick Rulings

The search results don't provide specific information about pending challenges to major Clean Air Act provisions that might be decided before October 1, 2024. However, we know that numerous lawsuits challenging EPA regulations are currently pending.

The Supreme Court has already shown willingness to intervene in EPA matters, as evidenced by its June 27, 2024 decision to temporarily block the EPA's "Good Neighbor" air pollution rule by a 5-4 vote. This suggests courts might be prepared to act relatively quickly on Clean Air Act challenges.

## Weighing the Probabilities

Arguments for a lower probability:
- The very short timeframe between Chevron's overturning and the October deadline
- Federal court proceedings typically move slowly
- For the question to resolve as "Yes," a court must specifically cite Chevron's overturning as a key factor

Arguments for a higher probability:
- The Supreme Court has already demonstrated willingness to intervene in EPA matters
- The 6-3 Chevron decision signals strong judicial skepticism toward agency interpretations
- Lower courts may feel emboldened to quickly challenge agency regulations

## Status Quo Considerations

The status quo currently favors a "No" outcome simply because of timing constraints. In the absence of specific information about cases that are already far along in their proceedings and poised to cite Chevron, I must give significant weight to the natural inertia and timelines of the federal court system.

Given the recency of the Chevron overturning, it seems more likely that major challenges citing this precedent would come to fruition later in 2024 or in 2025, rather than in the narrow window before October 1, 2024.

## Final Assessment

While the overturning of Chevron creates fertile ground for successful challenges to Clean Air Act provisions, the extremely limited timeframe makes it unlikely that a federal court will issue a final ruling striking down a major Clean Air Act provision while explicitly citing Chevron's overturning as a key factor before October 1, 2024.

Probability: 20%
