(a) The time left until the outcome is known: The outcome is already known. The 2025 Grammy Awards ceremony took place on February 2, 2025, and the current date is May 6, 2025, so we have complete information about the results.

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed: Based on the search results, Post Malone won 0 Grammy awards at the 2025 ceremony, continuing his streak of nominations without wins.

(c) A description of a scenario that results in an unexpected outcome: An unexpected outcome would have been if Post Malone had broken his Grammy drought by winning one or more awards. This could have happened if the Recording Academy had chosen to recognize his successful pivot to country music with "F-1 Trillion," or if his collaboration with Taylor Swift on "Fortnight" had won in the major categories. However, this did not occur.

As a professional forecaster, I must analyze the evidence carefully. The search results clearly indicate that Post Malone did not win any Grammy awards in 2025. Multiple sources confirm that following the 2025 Grammy Awards, Post Malone has become the most-nominated performing artist without a single win in Grammy history, with his career total reaching 18 nominations and zero wins[1]. 

The search results specifically state: "Post Malone's pop music scored him 10 Grammy nominations and zero wins. His first year in country nearly doubled that total. At the 2025..." which further confirms his lack of wins[3]. Additionally, we can see that other artists like Beyonc√© (who won Album of the Year for "Cowboy Carter") and Kendrick Lamar (who won Record of the Year for "Not Like Us") took home the major awards for which Post Malone was nominated[3].

While forecasting typically involves uncertainty about future events, in this case, we're looking at an event that has already occurred. The 67th Annual Grammy Awards took place on February 2, 2025, and we now have definitive information about the results as of May 6, 2025.

Given the clear evidence from multiple sources, there is no uncertainty about the outcome:

Option_A: 100%
Option_B: 0%
Option_C: 0%
