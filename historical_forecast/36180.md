**Analysis for Ambassador Recall Probability**  

(a) **Time remaining**: 12 days (March 20 to April 1, 2025).  
(b) **Status quo outcome (No)**: The UK maintains its ambassador in Russia, continuing reciprocal diplomatic expulsions without recalling its top envoy.  
(c) **Scenario for No**: Russia refrains from additional escalatory actions (e.g., expelling higher-ranking UK diplomats, direct threats to embassy operations), leading the UK to limit responses to targeted expulsions rather than full-scale diplomatic withdrawal.  
(d) **Scenario for Yes**: Russia intensifies harassment of UK diplomats (e.g., physical threats, embassy closures, expulsion of the ambassador) or undertakes a severe provocation (e.g., cyberattack linked to UK infrastructure), forcing the UK to recall the ambassador as a retaliatory measure or on safety grounds.  

**Rationale**:  
- **Recent Precedent**: The UK has consistently matched Russian expulsions (e.g., expelling a Russian diplomat on March 12[1][3]) rather than escalating to ambassador removal.  
- **Political Calculus**: Ambassador recalls are rare, as they risk destabilizing communication channels. The UK’s March 12 statement accused Russia of attempting to force embassy closure[1][3], but no direct threats to the ambassador were cited.  
- **Timeline Constraints**: With only 12 days remaining, the UK would likely require a severe, immediate trigger (e.g., explicit threats to the ambassador’s safety) to justify recall. No such trigger appears in available reports up to March 20.  

**Probability: 10%** (Low likelihood absent near-term catastrophic escalation).
