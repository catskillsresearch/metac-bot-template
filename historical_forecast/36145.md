Looking at the interview question carefully, I need to forecast which movie will win the 2025 GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Film - Limited Release.

(a) Time until outcome is known:
Based on the search results, the 36th GLAAD Media Awards ceremony took place on March 27, 2025[2]. Since today is May 6, 2025, the outcome is already known.

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed:
According to the search results, "Crossing" (MUBI) has already won the 2025 GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Film - Limited Release[1][3]. This was announced at the 36th GLAAD Media Awards ceremony that occurred on March 27, 2025.

(c) Scenario for unexpected outcome:
An unexpected outcome would have been if the award had gone to one of the other nominees like "Housekeeping for Beginners" or "20,000 Species of Bees," which both received critical acclaim with 7.0 ratings according to the search results[1]. A surprise winner could have emerged if the GLAAD voters had prioritized a film that tackled particularly timely LGBTQ+ issues or featured groundbreaking representation that resonated strongly with the current cultural moment.

My rationale:
The search results clearly indicate that "Crossing" by MUBI has already won the award for Outstanding Film - Limited Release at the 36th GLAAD Media Awards[2][3]. This is not a forecast but a historical fact, as the awards ceremony already took place on March 27, 2025, and we're now in May 2025. 

While I would normally assign probabilities to different outcomes in a forecasting exercise, in this case, the event has already occurred, and "Crossing" is confirmed as the winner. The search results show it explicitly marked as "Winner" in multiple sources[1][3].

Looking at the previous year's awards (35th GLAAD Media Awards), we can see that "Monica" won in this category[5], showing that GLAAD voters do change their selections year to year based on the merits of individual films.

Final probabilities:
20,000 Species of Bees: 0%
Backspot: 0%
Before I Change My Mind: 0%
Big Boys: 0%
Close to You: 0%
Crossing: 100%
Fitting In: 0%
High Tide: 0%
Housekeeping for Beginners: 0%
A Place of Our Own: 0%
