(a) **Time until outcome known:**  
Election Day is November 5, 2024. As of October 31, 2024, there are about 5 days until the votes are cast and results start being reported.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
Based on the latest polling, Marsha Blackburn is slightly outperforming Donald Trump in Tennessee by raw percentage-point margin. Blackburn leads her Democratic Senate challenger by 23 points (54%-31%), while Trump leads Kamala Harris by 21 points[2]. Recent polling suggests a higher likelihood that Blackburn will receive more votes in her race than Trump will in his.

(c) **Scenario for a No outcome (Trump does not outperform Blackburn):**  
If current polling trends hold, and Marsha Blackburn maintains her larger lead over her opponent than Trump does over his, especially in a lower-profile Senate race with a strong Republican incumbent, she will garner more total votes than Trump. This would result in a "No" outcome.

(d) **Scenario for a Yes outcome (Trump outperforms Blackburn):**  
If, on Election Day, Trump’s presidential race drives higher turnout from Republican voters (e.g., due to national events or last-minute mobilization), and/or third-party candidate Pamela Moses takes a significant share from Blackburn but there is minimal third-party voting in the presidential race, Trump could receive more votes than Blackburn, resulting in a "Yes" outcome.

## Rationale

The best available data shows Blackburn with a slightly higher margin (23 points) than Trump (21 points) over their major-party opponents[2]. However, several factors make this difference less meaningful than it might appear:

- **Presidential races almost always have higher turnout** than Senate races, even when both are on the same ballot, especially among less-engaged voters who come out for the top of the ticket and skip down-ballot races. This typically gives a slight edge to presidential candidates in total raw votes.
- **Third-party candidates:** The Senate race features an independent candidate (Pamela Moses) polling at 5%, whereas the current Tennessee presidential ballot has less prominent third-party contenders. That third-party vote may draw more from protest voters who would otherwise choose neither major candidate, but could also skim votes that might have gone to Blackburn in a two-person race[2].
- **Historical precedents:** In Tennessee, presidential candidates (especially Trump) have received more raw votes than Senate candidates in recent cycles, even if the percentage margin was wider for the Senate race. For example, in 2020, Trump received more votes (1,852,475) than then-Senator Bill Hagerty (1,840,926), a difference of about 12,000 votes, despite Hagerty’s wider lead over his opponent than Trump’s over Biden.

Given these factors, while the status quo polling suggests Blackburn could win by a slightly larger margin, it is not the same as receiving more raw votes. The statewide presidential race tends to attract more total voters than the Senate race. The presence of a 5% third-party candidate in the Senate race may further lower Blackburn’s raw vote total compared to Trump.

## Final Answer

Probability: 65%  
Trump is modestly more likely to receive more votes in Tennessee than Marsha Blackburn, despite her greater polling margin, due to the higher turnout in the presidential race and the third-party dynamic in the Senate contest[2]. The margin is not overwhelming, but historical patterns and the structure of the races put Trump in a slightly favored position.
