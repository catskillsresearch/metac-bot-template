(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  
The Greenlandic general election will be held on March 11, 2025. As of today, March 10, 2025, there is approximately 1 day left until the outcome—specifically, until preliminary seat allocations are reported.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
In the 2021 election, Inuit Ataqatigiit (IA) won the largest number of seats (12 out of 31), with Siumut as the second-largest party (10 seats)[1][2]. Recent polling and political analyses indicate that IA remains the front-runner, leading Siumut by about nine percentage points in voter preference as of January 2025[5]. IA continues to lead the governing coalition, and there is no strong evidence from recent polling or expert forecasts that this order will change[3][5]. Therefore, if the status quo holds, Inuit Ataqatigiit will again win the largest number of allocated seats.

(c) **Scenario resulting in an unexpected outcome:**  
A plausible scenario for an unexpected result would involve a significant, late shift in voter sentiment triggered by a single-issue campaign—such as a polarizing debate over independence, mining policy, or foreign intervention. For example, if Siumut's promise of a post-election independence referendum or a last-minute controversy galvanizes voters, Siumut could close the gap and potentially overtake IA in seats won. Additionally, a new party like Quelleq could capitalize on last-minute momentum or protest votes, possibly splitting the vote and creating a tie or allowing a third party to emerge as the largest. Given the small number of seats and the volatility sometimes seen in Greenlandic elections, a tie between IA and Siumut is also within the realm of possibility, though less likely. However, the limited size and infrequency of polls, as well as Greenland’s tradition of sudden campaign shifts, introduce notable uncertainty[3][5].

**Rationale:**  
- Historical trends and incumbent advantage favor Inuit Ataqatigiit and suggest they will remain the largest party[1][2][3].
- Recent polling, though limited, shows IA with a clear, though not insurmountable, lead over Siumut[3][5].
- New parties are present but have not shown signs of surpassing the established leaders in support[3].
- Single-issue fluctuations, polling uncertainty, and Greenland’s small electorate mean a non-IA outcome, while unlikely, cannot be entirely ruled out.
