(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  
The BLS will release the preliminary November 2024 nonfarm payroll numbers on December 6, 2024—so approximately 4 days remain until the outcome is known.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
October 2024 saw a very weak nonfarm payroll increase of just 12,000 jobs, well below the 75,000 threshold. The prior two months—September (+223,000) and August (+78,000)—saw moderate gains but were both revised downward[4]. If recent trends and labor market softness persist into November, the most recent (October) pace would signal a "No" outcome, though the labor market has shown volatility.

(c) **A scenario that results in a No outcome:**  
If structural weaknesses—such as continued contraction in manufacturing, temporary help services, and retail—persist or worsen, and if the rebound from October's weather- and strike-related disruptions proves muted, nonfarm payroll growth in November could remain well below 75,000, or even decline.

(d) **A scenario that results in a Yes outcome:**  
If October's weak growth was mainly due to temporary factors (storms, strikes, data collection issues), then November could see a rebound—especially with typical seasonal hiring for the holidays. Continued resilience in health care and government, along with a normalization of manufacturing output, could push the monthly gain above the 75,000 mark.

## Rationale

Good forecasting gives extra weight to inertia: most months, the labor market changes slowly. October's result (+12,000) was exceptionally weak and well below market expectations and historical norms for this time of year. However, several contextual factors suggest an improvement is plausible in November:

- October's poor result may have been driven by anomalous events (like hurricanes and a dockworkers' strike), potentially setting the stage for a bounce-back.
- November often sees an uptick in jobs due to seasonal hiring, particularly in retail and logistics, though the secular trend in retail is weak.
- Downward revisions to August and September remind us that initial estimates can be optimistic, but backward-looking, so the headline November number is what matters for this question[4][5].

Still, the October report reflected pronounced softness, and it is possible some of the weakness is persistent, not just transitory.

## Assessment

- Recent months show a volatile but generally declining trend, raising risk of another weak month, but the magnitude of October’s shortfall suggests at least some catch-up is likely.
- Seasonal patterns support a modest rebound.
- The sectoral breakdown shows some strengths (health care, government) that could offset ongoing weaknesses in manufacturing and temp services.
- Recent history shows that major swings (from +12,000 to +75,000+) are possible, especially around the holiday season.

Given all available information, the balance of probabilities slightly favors a rebound above the 75,000 threshold, but with significant downside risk if underlying weakness is not just transitory.
