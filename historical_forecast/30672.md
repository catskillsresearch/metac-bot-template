(a) **Time until outcome is known:**  
The outcome will be determined shortly after January 1, 2025, when data for weeks 51 (ending December 20) and 52 (ending December 27) are expected to be posted, likely between January 1 and January 7, 2025. As of December 3, 2024, this is approximately 4–5 weeks away.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
The latest reported weekly case count is 77 (late November). If weekly cases remain stable, the two-week total for weeks 51 and 52 would be \(77 \times 2 = 154\), which is well below the 275–375 range required for a "Yes" resolution[5].

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
If weekly reported cases stay near current levels (around 77 per week) or increase only modestly, the total for weeks 51 and 52 remains below 275. For example, even with a small rise to 90 cases per week, the two-week total would be 180, still a clear "No."

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
A "Yes" would require a substantial increase in weekly reporting—averaging between 138 and 188 cases per week over weeks 51 and 52. This could be triggered by a rapid acceleration of the epidemic, changes to case-finding or reporting practices, or a dramatic outbreak, such that weekly cases nearly double or more from the most recent count.

## Rationale

New Zealand is in the early stages of a whooping cough epidemic, with weekly cases rising and public health measures ramping up as of late November[1][3]. Case reports have shown steady increases: from 179 cases in four weeks (late August–September)[2], to 215 (mid-October–early November)[2], and 263 in the most recent four-week window (mid-October–mid-November)[3]. This suggests a current pace of around 65–77 cases per week, matching the latest granular report[5].

To hit the 275–375 range over two weeks, a dramatic and immediate acceleration—nearly doubling or tripling weekly cases—would be required within a short period. Although epidemics can accelerate rapidly, especially with pertussis in an under-immunized population, there is not yet evidence of such a sharp increase in the November data. Furthermore, public health interventions (like increased vaccination campaigns) might slow, not accelerate, transmission in the near term, though these effects typically lag.

As of early December, the base rate (status quo) scenario remains that weekly cases will persist near current levels or climb modestly, resulting in a total considerably below the "Yes" threshold.
