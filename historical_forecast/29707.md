(a) Time left until outcome: This is a historical question as we are now in May 2025, and the question asks about October 2024, which has already passed.

(b) Status quo outcome: Based on September 2024 data, China's youth unemployment rate was 17.6%, down from 18.8% in August 2024.

(c) Scenario resulting in a No outcome: Continuing economic recovery in China, successful government job creation initiatives, seasonal hiring patterns, and gradual absorption of graduates into the workforce could keep the youth unemployment rate below 19.0% for October 2024.

(d) Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome: Economic headwinds intensifying, seasonal factors affecting employment negatively, continued pressure from the large number of graduates, and structural issues in the job market could cause the youth unemployment rate to increase above 19.0% in October 2024.

China's youth unemployment rate has shown considerable volatility in recent years, but the most recent data indicates a downward trend. The rate decreased from 18.8% in August 2024 to 17.6% in September 2024[1], suggesting an improving situation. Looking at longer-term patterns, China's youth unemployment peaked at 21.3% in July 2023 before declining to 14.9% by December 2023[4]. The rate then increased during 2024 but began to decline again from August to September.

Several factors support a continued decline or stabilization below 19.0%:

1. The clear downward momentum from August to September 2024 (18.8% to 17.6%) suggests an improving trend[1].

2. The Chinese government has been actively implementing policies to address youth unemployment, aiming to create over 12 million new urban jobs[3].

3. The overall urban unemployment rate has been relatively stable at around 5.2%, indicating broader labor market stability[4].

However, significant challenges remain:

1. Structural issues persist, including inadequate private sector job creation and skills mismatches between graduates and employer needs[4].

2. The large influx of new graduates (nearly 12 million in 2024) continues to put pressure on the job market[4].

3. Regulatory burdens in technology and other sectors that typically employ young workers could limit job creation[4].

4. Cultural factors, such as the demanding "9-9-6" work culture, have led some young people to opt out of the workforce entirely[4].

Given the recent data showing a clear downward trend from 18.8% to 17.6% between August and September 2024, and considering that economic indicators were showing modest improvement, it appears more likely that the unemployment rate would have continued this trajectory rather than reversing course and jumping above 19.0% in October 2024.

The status quo suggests continued improvement, and absent any major economic shocks reported in the search results, the most reasonable forecast would be for the rate to remain below 19.0%.

Probability: 20%
