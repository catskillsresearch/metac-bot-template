As a professional forecaster addressing this interview question, I need to analyze whether the USDA-posted recall by Yu Shang Food, Inc. will be closed before March 1, 2025.

(a) Time left until the outcome is known: About 9 months from now (from May 6, 2025 to when Metaculus checks the status after February 28, 2025).

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: The recall would remain active, as according to the information available, the recall is currently active and serious in nature.

(c) Scenario resulting in a No outcome: The severity of the Listeria outbreak, the widespread distribution of products with long shelf lives, continued detection of contamination in follow-up testing, and the fact that the recall involves products linked to infant mortality would lead authorities to maintain an active recall status beyond March 1, 2025.

(d) Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome: If the FSIS determines that all affected products have been successfully removed from the market, follow-up testing shows no further contamination, and the outbreak is fully contained with no new cases, they might close the recall earlier than expected.

Based on the search results provided and the current date of May 6, 2025, I can analyze whether the Yu Shang Food recall was closed before March 1, 2025.

The recall in question was issued on November 21, 2024, as an expansion of an earlier recall from November 9, 2024. This recall involved approximately 72,240 pounds of ready-to-eat meat and poultry products that may have been contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes[1][5].

Looking at the available evidence, several factors suggest that this recall was likely not closed before March 1, 2025:

1. The recall involved a serious Listeria outbreak that resulted in at least one infant death and multiple hospitalizations across four states (California, New York, New Jersey, and Illinois)[5]. The severity of these consequences typically leads to extended recall periods.

2. The products had "used by" dates ranging from August 21, 2025, through August 27, 2025[1], indicating a very long shelf life. This extended shelf life means that potentially contaminated products could remain in consumers' homes well beyond March 2025, necessitating an active recall status.

3. The California Department of Public Health was still urging consumers not to eat these products as of January 3, 2025[2], which was just two months before the March 1 deadline, indicating ongoing concern about these products.

4. The recall was significantly expanded from the initial announcement, growing from 4,589 pounds to 72,240 pounds of product[1], demonstrating the widespread nature of the contamination and suggesting a complex resolution process.

5. The recall involved products distributed nationwide and available online[5], making it more challenging to ensure all affected products were removed from circulation quickly.

6. The outbreak investigation was still ongoing as of November 2024, with whole genome sequencing being conducted to determine if environmental samples matched the outbreak strain[1]. Such investigations typically take several months to complete.

Given that the products had use-by dates extending into late August 2025, and the widespread, serious nature of the contamination (including an infant death), the FSIS would likely maintain an active recall status until they were confident that the risk to public health was minimized. The status quo for serious recalls involving pathogens like Listeria, especially those linked to fatalities, is to maintain active status until well after the shelf life of products has expired.

While it's possible that efficient recall execution and thorough testing could have led to an earlier closure, the weight of evidence suggests that a recall of this magnitude and severity would remain active beyond March 1, 2025.

Probability: 15%
