As a professional forecaster addressing the question of whether Eric Adams will be Mayor of New York City on January 1, 2025, I'll analyze the situation systematically:

(a) Time until outcome is known: Approximately 2 months (from the current date of May 6, 2025, looking back to January 1, 2025)

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: Eric Adams would remain Mayor of New York City on January 1, 2025.

(c) Scenario resulting in a No outcome: Adams could either resign due to mounting pressure from public opinion and political allies, or be removed from office by Governor Hochul using her constitutional powers following the federal indictment.

(d) Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome: Adams successfully fights the charges while remaining in office, or his trial is delayed until after January 1, 2025, and neither resigns nor gets removed by the governor in the interim.

## Analysis of Current Situation

Eric Adams was indicted on five federal charges on September 26, 2024, including conspiracy, wire fraud, bribery, and solicitation of contributions from foreign nationals[4]. Despite this indictment, Adams has pleaded not guilty and expressed his intention to remain in office while fighting these charges[3].

The mayor's legal team has specifically requested that his trial be completed before March 2025, indicating they want the case resolved "before when the election process meaningfully begins"[3]. His attorney Alex Spiro stated, "At trial we expect the mayor to be acquitted," suggesting confidence in defeating the charges[3].

## Political Pressure and Support

There are significant political pressures on Adams:
- A Marist College poll from September 30 to October 1, 2024, found that 70% of respondents wanted Adams to resign, and 63% wanted Governor Hochul to remove him if he didn't resign voluntarily.
- Five Democratic members of Congress and dozens of local elected officials have called for his resignation.

However, Adams also has some important political support:
- Governor Kathy Hochul has resisted calls to remove Adams[3].
- House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries has stated that Adams should not resign.

## Legal Timeline Considerations

The legal process will likely be lengthy. Federal prosecutors expect Adams' trial to take four weeks, with a possible superseding indictment that may include additional charges against Adams and potentially charge additional defendants[3]. This suggests the trial might not even begin until after January 1, 2025.

Adams' legal team wants the trial to conclude before the mayoral primary process begins in earnest, which they identify as being around March 2025[3]. This timeline indicates they expect the trial to occur in early 2025 at the earliest.

## Status Quo Inertia

There are several factors that favor the status quo (Adams remaining mayor):

1. The legal presumption of innocence until proven guilty.
2. The precedent that elected officials typically remain in office while fighting charges.
3. The support from key political figures like Governor Hochul and Representative Jeffries.
4. The complexity and length of both removal processes and criminal trials.
5. Adams' explicit determination to remain in office while fighting the charges.

## Weighing the Probabilities

The indictment is serious, and public opinion strongly favors Adams' resignation. However, the timeline works in Adams' favor regarding the January 1, 2025 cutoff. Given that:

1. Adams has explicitly stated he will not resign.
2. Governor Hochul has not shown willingness to remove him.
3. The trial is unlikely to conclude before January 1, 2025.
4. Political removal processes are rarely swift.

The most likely outcome is that Adams will still be mayor on January 1, 2025, though his political future beyond that date is much less certain. The federal trial will likely extend into 2025, and any verdict against him would come after the January 1 date in question.

Placing extra weight on status quo inertia, and considering the relatively short timeframe between the September 2024 indictment and the January 1, 2025 resolution date, I assess that Adams is more likely than not to remain mayor through this period.

Probability: 70%
