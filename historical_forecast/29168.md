(a) Time left until outcome is known: Approximately 12 days remain until November 5, 2024, the day before which Kamala Harris’s appearance on Joe Rogan’s podcast would count.

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changes: As of October 24, 2024, Kamala Harris has not appeared on the Joe Rogan podcast, and no official confirmation of her appearing on the show before the election has been announced. Discussions between Harris’s campaign and Rogan’s team reportedly occurred but did not confirm an appearance[3].

(c) Scenario resulting in a No outcome: The Harris campaign decides against the podcast appearance due to concerns over unpredictability and risk from Rogan’s unscripted format and probing questions. Scheduling conflicts and prioritizing other campaign events prevent booking the podcast. No episode listing with Harris’s name appears before November 5, 2024.

(d) Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome: Harris agrees to do the podcast after seeing potential strategic value in reaching Rogan’s audience, especially undecided or Trump-leaning voters. The campaign finalizes arrangements, and an episode featuring Kamala Harris is recorded and published before November 5, 2024, with her name listed next to the episode title on the official podcast page.

**Rationale:**

The current evidence shows some positive signals—Joe Rogan has publicly praised Kamala Harris, and her campaign has considered appearing on his show[2][3]. The podcast offers a unique platform to engage a key demographic not captured by traditional media. However, there remain significant risks for Harris: Rogan’s style is unscripted and confrontational, which could expose her to tough scrutiny and unpredictable questions[3]. Political commentators suggest her team would only take this risk if internal polling was troubling, implying it’s not a clear-cut strategic move.

Campaigns typically move cautiously about high-risk, high-visibility media appearances close to elections. Although discussions have occurred, the lack of official announcement by late October suggests a lower probability of a last-minute deal. Also, the logistical challenge of scheduling and recording a podcast episode with a busy vice president amid a costly campaign season is non-trivial.

Given world events and political campaigns tend to move incrementally rather than dramatically without notice, the status quo (No appearance) is the stronger baseline. Yet, the ongoing discussions and potential benefits keep the chance of a Yes alive.
