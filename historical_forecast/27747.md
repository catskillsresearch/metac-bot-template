(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
The Speed Chess Championship 2024 is scheduled to take place September 6-8, 2024, meaning the outcome will be known in about one week.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
Hikaru Nakamura is considered one of the two most likely champions alongside Magnus Carlsen. Nakamura has a historically dominant record in this event (five consecutive wins, 2017-2022) and is in strong form, having just advanced to the semifinals after defeating Ian Nepomniachtchi and reaching the Grand Final of the 2024 Bullet Chess Championship[3][5]. However, Magnus Carlsen—the current world #1 and defending Speed Chess Champion—remains the most significant obstacle, with a recent victory over Nakamura in the 2023 final and a higher peak blitz rating on chess.com[3].

If the tournament proceeds as expected with no upsets or external interruptions, either Carlsen or Nakamura will likely win, with a slight status quo edge given to Carlsen based on recent head-to-head results.

(c) **Scenario that results in a No outcome:**  
- Nakamura is eliminated by Alireza Firouzja in the semifinals.
- Nakamura reaches the final but loses to either Carlsen or Niemann.
- The tournament is canceled or postponed beyond October 1, 2024.

(d) **Scenario that results in a Yes outcome:**  
- Nakamura defeats Firouzja in the semifinals, then overcomes either Carlsen (most likely opponent) or Niemann in the final to win the championship.

## Rationale

- Nakamura’s historical record in this format is extraordinary, with five straight titles and a proven ability to come back in matches, especially in the bullet segment, which is decisive in this event[3].
- His current form is strong, demonstrated by his dominant performance in the Bullet Chess Championship and recent victory over Nepomniachtchi, where he outperformed predictive model expectations in the faster segments[3][5].
- Firouzja, his semifinal opponent, is dangerous and capable of an upset but has not demonstrated the same consistent dominance in this format as Nakamura.
- If Nakamura reaches the final, he is likely to face Magnus Carlsen, whose own blitz and bullet prowess is at its peak after recent achievements, including a record chess.com blitz rating and a decisive victory over Nakamura in the 2023 Speed Chess final[3].
- Knockout formats, while favoring favorites, still introduce significant variance. With only two matches left, even a small edge in each adds up: if Nakamura is a modest favorite against Firouzja (~65-70%) and a near coinflip against Carlsen, his combined probability to win is notably substantial, but not overwhelming.

Given all factors, including Nakamura's historical dominance, current form, the specific fast-chess skill required, and the formidable presence of Carlsen as his most likely final obstacle, a well-calibrated estimate for Nakamura winning the 2024 Speed Chess Championship is:

**Probability: 35%**
