I'll analyze the likelihood of Canada revoking Elon Musk's citizenship before April 1, 2025.

(a) Time left until outcome is known: Approximately 10 months (from May 6, 2025 to April 1, 2025). Since we're already past April 1, 2025, I need to analyze whether this event has already occurred based on the available information.

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: Elon Musk retains his Canadian citizenship.

(c) Scenario resulting in No outcome: The legal barriers to citizenship revocation prove insurmountable, the Canadian government decides not to pursue the matter despite public pressure, or the process extends beyond April 1, 2025, due to administrative and legal complexities.

(d) Scenario resulting in Yes outcome: The Canadian government determines Musk's statements and actions constitute a legitimate threat to Canadian sovereignty, finds legal grounds to expedite the revocation process, and completes it before April 1, 2025.

Based on the search results provided and considering we're already past the April 1, 2025 deadline (it's currently May 6, 2025), I need to determine if Canada has already revoked Musk's citizenship.

The search results show that as of February-March 2025, a petition had gained significant traction in Canada calling for the revocation of Musk's citizenship, with over 242,000 signatures[1][3]. This petition was sponsored by Charlie Angus, a member of Parliament who had previously called for Musk to be investigated for potential election interference[3].

The petition cited Musk's role in the Trump administration and his statement that "Canada is not a real country" as evidence that he "engaged in activities that go against the national interest of Canada"[1][3]. However, there is no information in the search results indicating that the Canadian government actually proceeded with or completed a revocation of Musk's citizenship.

Several factors make it unlikely that Canada revoked Musk's citizenship:

1. Legal barriers: One search result suggests "Canada can't revoke Musk's citizenship"[3], indicating significant legal obstacles. Musk obtained his Canadian citizenship through his mother, who was born in Saskatchewan[1][3].

2. Complex process: Citizenship revocation typically involves a lengthy legal process with multiple steps and opportunities for appeal, making it difficult to complete quickly.

3. Lack of precedent: There's no indication in the search results of similar cases where Canada revoked citizenship obtained by birth through a Canadian parent based on political activities or statements.

4. No government action reported: While the petition gained significant support, the search results don't indicate that the Canadian government initiated any formal process to consider revoking Musk's citizenship.

The status quo tends to persist in such matters, especially when legal barriers exist. Without specific information indicating that Canada has successfully revoked Musk's citizenship between March and May 2025, I must conclude that it likely hasn't happened.

Probability: 1%
