(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
As of today (May 6, 2025), the outcome has already been determined and the data for December 2024 should be available from the Iowa Environmental Mesonet. If answering as of early December 2024 (per your scenario), there would be just under one month before the end of December when the average can be finalized.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
Historically, Arctic temperatures at Barrow/Utqiagvik in December have been rising, but a jump of ≥4°F above the 1945–2023 average is exceptional, not routine. The "status quo" prior expectation would be that December 2024 comes in above the long-term average, but perhaps not by as much as 4°F, unless there are strong anomalies or drivers present.

(c) **Scenario for a No outcome:**  
- December 2024 temperatures are modestly warmer than the 1945–2023 average, but the anomaly is less than 4°F.
- This could occur if Arctic sea ice conditions in the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas stabilize or are not unusually low, or if major atmospheric circulation patterns (such as the Arctic Oscillation) are not especially positive (warm phase).
- Short-term weather patterns could bring periods of cold air from the interior Arctic, offsetting the recent warming tendency.

(d) **Scenario for a Yes outcome:**  
- December 2024 sees exceptionally low sea ice near Barrow, exposing more open water and releasing ocean heat to the atmosphere.
- A strong positive phase of the Arctic Oscillation prevails, bringing persistent warm air advection from the south.
- Regional ocean temperatures remain anomalously high.
- The combination of these factors leads to a December mean temperature at least 4°F above the 1945–2023 average—a threshold that recent winters have occasionally approached or surpassed as Arctic amplification accelerates.

## Rationale

Recent decades have shown a marked warming trend in the Arctic, especially during winter, driven by loss of sea ice and changes in atmospheric circulation[Arctic Council]. Barrow/Utqiagvik is on the front line of this change, with several recent Decembers ranking among the warmest on record. However, while trends favor warmth, extreme departures (≥4°F above the 1945–2023 December average) are still relatively rare, although becoming less so.

Good forecasters emphasize the inertia in climate systems: most years tend to show continuity with recent trends unless there is clear evidence of a major anomaly. Forecasts made before December could not be certain of the specifics for December 2024, and the 4°F threshold is substantial. The likelihood of such a large anomaly is higher now than in decades past, but is still not guaranteed without strong supporting signals (e.g., record-low sea ice or exceptionally persistent warm air flows).
