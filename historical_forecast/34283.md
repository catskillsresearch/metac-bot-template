(a) Time left until outcome: The question resolves on April 1, 2025, which is approximately 2 months from now (as today is May 6, 2025).

(b) Status quo outcome: If nothing changes, the outcome would be "No" because as of the most recent information available, moxidectin has not received WHO prequalification for onchocerciasis.

(c) Scenario for "No" outcome: The WHO prequalification process continues to require additional clinical trials and data collection beyond April 1, 2025. Regulatory hurdles and the comprehensive nature of the WHO prequalification process extend the timeline, despite GiveWell's funding support and recent approval in Ghana.

(d) Scenario for "Yes" outcome: The WHO expedites its review process based on the recent approval in Ghana (December 2024) and positive implementation results from the Twifo Atti-Morkwa district rollout. The prequalification process is completed before April 1, 2025, allowing for broader distribution of moxidectin for river blindness.

Based on the available information, I can provide the following forecast analysis:

Moxidectin has made significant progress toward global implementation for treating river blindness, with major milestones achieved in recent months. In December 2024, Ghana became the first river blindness-endemic country to approve moxidectin 2 mg oral tablets[1][2]. This approval represents an important step forward, as Ghana was also where the first studies of moxidectin in infected people were conducted[2].

Additionally, in January 2025, Ghana began rolling out moxidectin treatment in the Twifo Atti-Morkwa district through the MOMENTUM program[4]. This implementation is being closely monitored and could provide valuable real-world data to support the WHO prequalification process.

However, several factors indicate that WHO prequalification before April 1, 2025, remains unlikely:

1. **Timeline of the prequalification process**: In June 2024, GiveWell provided a 3-year grant of $637,549 to MDGH specifically to complete the WHO prequalification process for moxidectin[5]. The 3-year timeframe suggests that even the organizations most invested in this process anticipate it could take until mid-2027 to achieve prequalification.

2. **Additional clinical requirements**: The search results mention that the WHO has "unexpectedly required extensive extra clinical trials for moxidectin," which has introduced uncertainty into the timeline for prequalification. These additional requirements will likely extend the process significantly.

3. **GiveWell's internal forecast**: GiveWell assigned an 80% likelihood of moxidectin being prequalified before 2027[5]. This relatively conservative estimate from an organization directly funding the prequalification effort suggests they do not expect rapid approval.

4. **Historical precedent**: The regulatory approval process for drugs targeting neglected tropical diseases typically moves slowly. Even though moxidectin received FDA approval in 2018, it took until December 2024 for the first endemic country to approve it[1][2].

5. **Status of implementation**: While Ghana has begun implementing moxidectin in one district, this is described as a "pilot" program[4], suggesting that more data collection and evaluation will be needed before broader adoption.

The status quo strongly favors a "No" outcome. While progress has been made, the WHO prequalification process involves rigorous evaluation of quality, safety, and efficacy data, which typically requires substantial time. The three-year timeframe of GiveWell's grant and their 80% confidence estimate for prequalification by 2027 suggest that even organizations directly involved in the process don't expect imminent approval.

The Ghana approval and pilot implementation are positive signals, but they represent early steps rather than indications of imminent WHO prequalification. Given the documented additional clinical trial requirements and the typical timeline for WHO prequalification processes, it appears highly unlikely that moxidectin will achieve WHO prequalification for onchocerciasis before April 1, 2025.

Probability: 15%
