(a) **Time Left Until Outcome Known**  
There are about 8 months left until January 1, 2025.

(b) **Status Quo Outcome if Nothing Changed**  
If current trends persist and no major new negative shocks occur, Noodles & Company will not file for bankruptcy before January 1, 2025. The company is actively managing underperforming locations, closing some stores, and implementing cost-saving measures, which are typical of companies attempting to avoid bankruptcy, not preparing for it[1][2][3][4].

(c) **No Outcome Scenario**  
Noodles & Company continues to close 10–15 underperforming locations, enhances menu offerings, executes cost reductions, and focuses on profitable growth initiatives as planned. Despite ongoing losses, these efforts stabilize cash flow and buy more time with creditors and investors. The company avoids a bankruptcy filing through strategic downsizing, refranchising, and operational improvements[1][2][3][4].

(d) **Yes Outcome Scenario**  
Noodles & Company experiences a sharper-than-expected decline in traffic or same-store sales, faces an unexpected cash crunch, or becomes unable to refinance or service its debts in 2024. A macroeconomic shock or further loss of investor confidence could prompt a bankruptcy filing before the end of the year if these risks materialize. Worsening financial conditions outpace the benefits of recent closures and cost-cutting measures, leaving bankruptcy as the only viable option[4].

## Rationale

- **Current actions** (gradual closings, menu revitalization, cost cuts) signal a strategic—not desperate—response to financial stress, which typically precedes outright bankruptcy prevention[1][2][3].
- **Recent performance** is underwhelming, with same-store sales declines and net losses in early 2024, but latest data (Q2) shows a small 2% increase in same-store sales and improving guest satisfaction[1][2]. This suggests initiatives may be having a stabilizing effect.
- **Size of closures** is modest relative to the total footprint (10–15 of 475 restaurants), which should not by itself push the company into bankruptcy[1][2][3].
- **Management commentary** and the measured pace of change indicate control and planning, as opposed to urgent cash-driven shutdowns[1][2][3].
- **No recent news** of missed debt payments, abrupt mass layoffs, or payment defaults—typical red flags for imminent bankruptcy—has been reported as of August-September 2024.

Given the inertia in corporate bankruptcies and the company’s proactive (if painful) measures, the most likely scenario is that Noodles & Company will avoid a bankruptcy filing before January 1, 2025. However, risks remain above average due to continued losses, challenged traffic, and sector pressures.

**Probability: 20%**
