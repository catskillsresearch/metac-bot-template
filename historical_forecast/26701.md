(a) **Time left until outcome:**  
There are about two months remaining until September 29, 2024, when the outcome will be known.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
As of July 25, 2024, the total cryptocurrency market capitalization reported by CoinMarketCap was $2.35 trillion, which is well above the $2 trillion threshold[3]. If the market cap were to remain unchanged, or even experience moderate volatility, the outcome would be **Yes**.

(c) **Scenario for a No outcome:**  
A No outcome (market cap at or below $2 trillion) could occur if there is a substantial market downturn before September 29. This could be triggered by:
- Major negative regulatory actions (e.g., a significant US or global crypto crackdown).
- Macroeconomic shocks (such as a sudden rise in interest rates, recession fears, or a liquidity crunch).
- Large-scale hacks, bankruptcies, or other black swan events undermining confidence in the crypto sector.
Such events would most likely cause sharp drops in the prices of major cryptocurrencies, dragging the total market cap below $2 trillion.

(d) **Scenario for a Yes outcome:**  
A Yes outcome (market cap above $2 trillion) would follow from the continuation of the current status quo or even mild retracement. Possible supportive factors include:
- Sustained momentum from spot Bitcoin ETF inflows, which have already brought billions into the market and continue to attract institutional investors[3].
- General risk-on sentiment in global markets, especially if tech stocks and other high-growth assets remain strong.
- Positive developments such as increased adoption, new product launches, or continued growth in stablecoins and other segments[1][3].

## Rationale

The total market cap of all cryptocurrencies stood at $2.35 trillion as of July 25, 2024[3]. Recent history shows the market grew 60% in Q1 2024, driven by factors such as the approval and success of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US—these have been the fastest-growing ETFs historically and significantly increased institutional inflows[3]. Bitcoin, as the market leader, remains strong, trading at $67,500 as of late June 2024, far above the key level most analysts predicted for a post-halving period[1].

The path to a sub-$2 trillion market cap before September 29 would likely require a dramatic and sustained negative event because, even with typical crypto volatility, a drop from $2.35 trillion to below $2 trillion represents a decline of about 15%. While possible, such large moves generally coincide with severe negative catalysts such as regulatory shocks or a global flight from risk. Historically, markets do experience corrections, but absent a very clear negative trigger, the inertia in the market cap—especially with ongoing inflows from new ETF products and relative economic stability—favors a Yes outcome.

Good forecasters emphasize the status quo, especially when the current level is comfortably above the threshold and there is no immediate, visible trigger for collapse. The probability should reflect both the upside momentum and the non-zero but modest risk of a sharp downturn in the coming two months.

## Final Answer

Probability: **85%**
