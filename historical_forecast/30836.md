(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
The question will be resolved on January 1, 2025, giving less than a month (approximately three to four weeks) from the present date of December 6, 2024.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
As of December 2, 2024, Elon Musk's net worth is $353 billion, and Jeff Bezos, the second richest, is at $231 billion. Musk does not have double the wealth of Bezos; he would need to be at least $462 billion for that to be true. If net worths remain stable, the outcome is **No**.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
If the stock prices of Tesla, SpaceX, and other Musk holdings remain within typical volatility ranges or show only modest gains/losses, and if Bezos' wealth remains broadly stable, Musk will not reach double the wealth of the second richest person before 2025. This would also be the case if both their net worths rise or fall together, keeping the multiple well below two.

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
For Musk to have double Bezos’ wealth, one of the following would need to occur before year-end:
- A massive, rapid increase in Tesla’s or SpaceX’s valuation, adding at least $109 billion to Musk’s net worth in under a month, while Bezos’ wealth remains unchanged or even decreases.
- A simultaneous, dramatic decline in Bezos’s net worth (e.g., Amazon stock crashing) coupled with a surge in Musk’s assets.
- An extraordinary private transaction or major compensation package grant to Musk (public and recognized by wealth indices), which seems unlikely in the very short time frame given recent legal setbacks and compensation package rejections.

## Rationale

- **Weight of Status Quo:** The current gap between Musk and Bezos is $122 billion. Musk would need his net worth to increase by $109 billion (over 30%) in less than a month, without Bezos’ wealth also increasing, for the condition to be met.
- **Typical Volatility:** While Musk’s net worth has shown rapid changes, even his fastest recent gain ($100+ billion in about two months) would need to be repeated in an even shorter time frame, which is highly improbable given market conditions[1][2].
- **Market Context:** No imminent news or analyst predictions point to a major catalyst likely to propel Musk's wealth to such heights by year-end. Major events like compensation packages or one-time asset sales are not currently planned or expected, and legal obstacles have recently prevented such jumps[1].
- **Historical Precedent:** It is rare for the richest individual to double the wealth of the second richest; it has happened only a handful of times in modern history, always during periods of extraordinary market action and over longer periods.

Given the large gap needed to trigger a “Yes” outcome and the very short window left—with no plausible catalyst on the horizon—the status quo scenario (No) should be heavily weighted.

**Probability: 2%**
