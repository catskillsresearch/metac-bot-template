Looking at this interview question about cherry blossom peak bloom in Washington, DC for 2025, I'll provide a thorough analysis:

(a) Time left until outcome is known: Peak bloom is expected to occur in late March 2025, which is approximately 3-4 weeks from today (March 4, 2025). The National Park Service will confirm when 70% of the Yoshino cherry trees have reached full flower, at which point the outcome will be officially determined.

(b) Status quo outcome: Based on the National Park Service's official projection announced on February 27, 2025, peak bloom is expected between March 28-31, 2025[2][3]. This is the most likely outcome if current conditions and forecasts hold.

(c) Unexpected outcome scenario: An unexpected warm spell in mid-March could accelerate bud development and flowering, potentially pushing peak bloom to before March 28. Conversely, a late cold snap or unusual weather pattern could delay peak bloom beyond March 31. Last year's peak bloom occurred on March 17[2], demonstrating how variable the timing can be based on temperature fluctuations.

## Rationale for My Forecast

The National Park Service's projection of March 28-31 provides the strongest baseline for my forecast[2][3]. This official prediction comes from experts who analyze bud development stages and historical data, giving it substantial credibility.

Historical patterns indicate that peak bloom typically occurs between the last week of March and the first week of April[1], which aligns with the current projection. While last year saw an earlier bloom on March 17, NPS spokesperson Mike Litterst specifically noted that colder winter temperatures this year will likely delay the bloom compared to last year[2].

While the NPS projection is the most reliable indicator, I must account for uncertainty. Weather conditions in the coming weeks could still significantly impact the timing. The prediction was made in late February, and March weather patterns can be volatile.

Additionally, the definition of peak bloom (70% of Yoshino cherry trees in flower) means that the transition can happen relatively quickly under the right conditions[2][3]. The five developmental stages leading to peak bloom can accelerate or slow down based on temperature patterns.

Given that we're still about a month away from the projected dates, I need to allocate some probability to outcomes outside the official projection window. However, the status quo forecast deserves the highest weighting.

## Forecast Probabilities

Before March 28: 15%
March 28 or 29: 40%
March 30 or 31: 35%
After March 31: 10%
