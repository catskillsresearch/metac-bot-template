(a) **Time until outcome is known:**  
It is currently May 6, 2025. The official inflation rate for January 2025 is already available; the relevant January data has been released, as shown in the search results.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
The most recent available data shows Egypt’s annual urban consumer price inflation rate at 24.1% for December 2024, down from 25.5% in November 2024[3]. Early 2025 forecasts expected continued decline thanks to tight monetary policy, falling food prices, and a high base effect from prior inflation spikes. The general expectation was for inflation to keep dropping as these factors persisted. The projection was that January 2025’s rate would be at or below December’s level, barring major shocks.

(c) **Scenario resulting in an unexpected outcome:**  
A plausible unexpected outcome would involve a sharp devaluation of the Egyptian pound, a sudden surge in global commodity prices, renewed supply chain disruptions, or a return of large capital outflows, all of which could have rapidly pushed prices upward. An unanticipated fiscal stimulus or subsidy cut could also have briefly reversed the deflationary trend, resulting in a temporary bounce in annual inflation.

## Rationale

- The headline **urban consumer price inflation rate** for January 2025 is directly referenced in the CEIC database as 24.0% year-on-year[5]. This points to a minimal change from December's 24.1%, confirming the status quo scenario has largely persisted.
- The figure for February 2025 shows a dramatic drop to 12.8%[5], indicating that no such sharp collapse happened in January. The change happened between January and February, not before.
- There is no evidence in the search results of a major economic or policy shock during the January reference period; food prices were already falling and monetary policy remained tight[3].
- Both forecasts and historical momentum suggested a slow decline, in line with the reported 24.0% actual rate.

Given this, the "Less than 25%" category is overwhelmingly likely, since 24.0% meets that threshold. The chance of a reporting revision, data misinterpretation, or data error slightly raises the probability mass for higher categories, but this is minimal.

## Final Probabilities

Less than 25%: 97%  
≥25% and ≤27%: 2%  
Greater than 27%: 1%
