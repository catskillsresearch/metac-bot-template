(a) **Time left until outcome known:**  
The Icelandic parliamentary election is scheduled for November 30, 2024, and the mandate to form a government must be granted by January 1, 2025. This gives approximately 3 to 7 weeks from November 11, 2024, until outcome resolution.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
As of the most recent developments, Bjarni Benediktsson of the Independence Party serves as Prime Minister, following a coalition government collapse. The Progressive Party is not the incumbent party in the prime minister's seat[3][5].

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
If the Progressive Party underperforms in the election—remaining behind the Independence Party and the Social Democratic Alliance (Samfylkingin)—and does not secure a decisive role in coalition negotiations, the mandate will likely go to a leader from one of the larger parties. Recent polling suggests the Progressive Party has lost ground, polling around 9.1% and ranking fourth or lower, making a No outcome likely[5].

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
The Progressive Party would need to gain enough seats or emerge as a pivotal coalition partner, enabling them to negotiate for the prime ministership despite likely not being the largest party. This would require replicating the unusual coalition outcomes seen in 2017 or 2021, with other major parties willing to support a Progressive PM as the price of government formation[5].

## Rationale

Recent polling (Gallup, June 2024) shows the Progressive Party (Framsóknarflokkurinn) at 9.1%, trailing behind the Social Democratic Alliance (Samfylkingin, 29.9%), Independence Party (Sjálfstæðisflokkurinn, 18%), and the Centre Party (Miðflokkurinn, 13.5%)[5]. This suggests the Progressive Party is unlikely to be the largest party, or even a close second, after the November 2024 elections.

Coalition agreements in Iceland sometimes result in a PM from a smaller party, as with Katrín Jakobsdóttir (Left-Green Movement) in 2017. However, her party then had more leverage and the coalition arithmetic was more balanced; the Progressive Party’s low polling makes such a scenario less likely this cycle, unless dramatic shifts or highly unusual coalition talks occur[5].

Historically, status quo and inertia dominate: the party leading in seats or in coalition-building strength is likeliest to produce the next Prime Minister. Given the current polling, the Progressive Party is not in this position. Absent major unforeseen events, the most probable outcome is that the Progressive Party does not secure the prime ministership.
