I'll provide a comprehensive forecast for the BTC/gold ratio on March 30, 2025, following a structured analysis approach.

(a) Time left until outcome is known: 24 days (from May 6, 2025 to March 30, 2025 - this is a retrospective question as the current date is after the resolution date)

(b) The outcome if nothing changed: Based on the most recent data provided (January 2025), the BTC/gold ratio was 36.56 (BTC price of $104,008.80 divided by gold price of $2,845.20)

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued: According to the search results, Bitcoin was trading around $94,000-$95,000 in early March 2025[3]. Assuming gold prices remained relatively stable around $2,845, this would suggest a ratio of approximately 33.0-33.4.

(d) The expectations of experts and markets: Price predictions for Bitcoin in May 2025 range from $94,251.03 (short-term)[1] to $119,521 (longer-term)[2]. Gold price forecasts aren't explicitly stated in the search results, but given central banks' continued buying[1], prices likely remained stable or increased moderately. Market expectations therefore suggest a ratio between 33-42.

(e) An unexpected scenario resulting in a low outcome: A significant regulatory crackdown on cryptocurrencies following uncertainties around the proposed national Bitcoin stockpile could have triggered a sharp Bitcoin selloff, driving prices down to $70,000-$80,000. Meanwhile, heightened geopolitical tensions could have accelerated central bank gold purchases, pushing gold to $3,200+, resulting in a ratio of approximately 22-25.

(f) An unexpected scenario resulting in a high outcome: Clear implementation details about the U.S. national Bitcoin stockpile policy could have triggered institutional FOMO, pushing Bitcoin prices toward $130,000. Simultaneously, improving economic conditions could have reduced gold's appeal as a safe haven, causing its price to decline to $2,600, resulting in a ratio of approximately 50.

Based on my analysis of the available data and considering historical trends, expert forecasts, and potential scenarios, here is my forecast for the BTC/gold ratio on March 30, 2025:

Percentile 10: 27.5
Percentile 20: 30.0
Percentile 40: 33.5
Percentile 60: 36.0
Percentile 80: 39.5
Percentile 90: 43.0
