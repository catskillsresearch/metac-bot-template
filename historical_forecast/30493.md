(a) **Time left until outcome:**  
From November 26, 2024 to December 30, 2024, there are about 34 days remaining until the question is resolved.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
Historically, Donald Trump’s national favorability ratings aggregated by FiveThirtyEight have stabilized in the low 40% range. After leaving office, his favorability was about 41.4% in early 2021[4]. There has been little evidence of a sustained upward trend toward or above 44%; instead, his favorability has exhibited notable stability with slight fluctuations linked to major events[4][5]. If this historical pattern holds, his rating is likely to remain below 44.0%.

(c) **Scenario for a No outcome:**  
Trump’s favorability remains in the 41–43% range. The 2024 election aftermath fails to provide a significant boost, or is accompanied by controversies, legal matters, or further political polarization that suppress his favorability. Public perception does not shift meaningfully, and the aggregation of polls by FiveThirtyEight continues to reflect a stable but not growing support base.

(d) **Scenario for a Yes outcome:**  
A major event or shift—such as Trump winning the 2024 election or experiencing a large, sustained “rally” effect—drives his favorability above the usual baseline. If he successfully unifies and energizes Republican and independent voters post-election, or benefits from positive coverage or developments, his aggregated rating could rise to or above 44.0%.

## Rationale

Trump’s favorability ratings have demonstrated strong inertia, rarely deviating from their long-term average without extraordinary catalysts. His firm Republican base sets a “floor,” but broader national averages have not exceeded the mid-40% range since his presidency ended[4][5]. Despite the possibility of short-lived post-election “bumps,” history shows that such effects are usually limited in scope and duration. Absent a clear, sustained shift in public sentiment or a major positive event, the most likely scenario is that Trump’s 538 favorability will remain below 44.0% by December 30, 2024.

Given the persistence of public opinion and the lack of anomalous upward movement in recent history, forecasters should weight the status quo outcome more heavily than scenarios requiring significant change.

Probability: **27%**
