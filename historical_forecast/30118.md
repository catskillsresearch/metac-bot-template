**Time until outcome:** 20 days (December 5, 2024 announcement).  
**Status quo outcome:** *No*, based on the absence of yellow dominance in current predictions and Pantone’s recent warm/neutral preferences[2][3].  
**Scenario for No:** Pantone selects an earthy tone (e.g., **Mocha Mousse**’s brown or **Cinnamon Slate**’s plum-brown) as expected, with HSV hue outside 45–75[3].  
**Scenario for Yes:** Pantone pivots unexpectedly to a yellow-leaning shade like **Yellow Jasper**, aligning with Spring/Summer 2025 fashion trends[4], or introduces a new yellow-adjacent hue (e.g., gold-green hybrid).  

**Rationale:**  
- **Historical bias:** Pantone’s 2015–2024 selections favor reds, blues, and neutrals, with yellow only appearing once (2021’s **Illuminating**)[2].  
- **2025 consensus:** Major forecasters prioritize **earthy neutrals** (browns, muted plums) and **nature-inspired greens**, not yellow[3][4].  
- **Yellow’s role:** **Yellow Jasper** appears in trend reports but as a supporting hue, not a frontrunner[4].  
- **Pantone’s conservatism:** Recent selections (**Peach Fuzz**, **Blue Nova**) avoid bold hues, favoring approachable tones[3], reducing Yellow’s odds despite its presence in palettes.  

**Probability:** 15%  
*(Low likelihood due to overwhelming consensus toward non-yellow hues, but residual uncertainty exists given Pantone’s occasional surprises.)*
