I'll analyze the likelihood of President Biden issuing 3 or more executive orders in December 2024 based on historical patterns and current information.

(a) Time until outcome known: Approximately 7 months (from May 6, 2025 to December 2024 retrospectively)

(b) Status quo outcome: Based on recent executive order patterns, President Biden appears to be issuing executive orders at a steady pace, with multiple executive orders already recorded in May 2025. This suggests active use of executive authority continuing through his presidency.

(c) Scenario resulting in No outcome: If Biden issues only 1-2 executive orders in December 2024, perhaps due to holiday season slowdowns, transition preparations after the November 2024 election, or a strategic decision to focus on other methods of policy implementation during his final full month in office.

(d) Scenario resulting in Yes outcome: Biden issues 3+ executive orders in December 2024 as part of a final push to cement his legacy and accomplish remaining policy goals before potentially leaving office, consistent with the "lame duck" period tendency of presidents to use executive authority to secure their achievements.

## Historical Patterns of Biden's Executive Orders

Looking at President Biden's executive order history reveals a declining trend after his first year:
- 2021: 77 executive orders (approximately 6.4 per month)[2]
- 2022: 29 executive orders (approximately 2.4 per month)[3]
- 2023: 24 executive orders (approximately 2 per month)[1]

This gradual decrease aligns with typical presidential patterns, where first-year executive orders tend to be more numerous to establish the administration's agenda.

## Recent Executive Order Activity

The search results show that President Biden has remained active with executive orders through May 2025, with recent orders addressing:
- Regulatory Relief for Domestic Production of Critical Medicines (May 5, 2025)[5]
- Improving Biological Research Safety and Security (May 5, 2025)[5]
- Ending Taxpayer Subsidization of Biased Media (May 1, 2025)[5]
- Establishment of the Religious Liberty Commission (May 1, 2025)[5]

This indicates that Biden has maintained a consistent pace of executive order issuance throughout his presidency, including multiple orders in a single month even in 2025.

## December 2024 Context

December 2024 would have represented the final full month of Biden's term (assuming no reelection), following the November 2024 election. This timing is significant for several reasons:

1. **Lame Duck Period**: Presidents often use their final months to solidify their legacy through executive actions, especially if there will be a transition to a new administration.

2. **Year-End Policy Completion**: Administrations typically try to finalize outstanding policy initiatives before year's end, particularly in election years.

3. **Historical Precedent**: Outgoing presidents have historically increased their rate of executive orders during their final months in office.

## Key Considerations for Prediction

The average monthly rate of executive orders from 2022-2023 was approximately 2-2.4 per month. However, December 2024 would not have been an average month due to its position as a potential transition period.

While the data shows a declining trend in orders per year, the evidence from May 2025 indicates Biden has remained active with executive orders, issuing at least 4 in early May alone. This suggests that Biden continued to use executive authority robustly throughout his presidency.

Given the historical patterns of presidents increasing executive action during their final months, especially if facing a transition, and Biden's demonstrated willingness to use executive orders (including multiple in a single month as recently as May 2025), the likelihood of him issuing 3 or more executive orders in December 2024 appears reasonably high.

However, I must account for the possibility of unusual circumstances or strategic decisions that might have limited executive action during that specific month.

Probability: 75%
