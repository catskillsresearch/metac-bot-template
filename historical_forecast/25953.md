(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  
As of July 10, 2024, there are 20 days until the outcome will be known at 12:00 CEST on July 30, 2024.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
Gabriel Attal of the Together coalition is the current Prime Minister, but following the 2024 snap election, his government lacks a parliamentary majority, and the Together coalition finished second in seat count behind the left-wing New Popular Front (NFP)[1][2][4].

(c) **Scenario that results in a No outcome:**  
Negotiations in the fragmented new National Assembly fail to produce a Together-led coalition or governing pact. The NFP, as the largest bloc, either forms a government or, at minimum, secures enough support to block Together from retaining the premiership. President Macron appoints a Prime Minister from outside the Together coalition, likely from the NFP or a consensus/technocratic candidate, or leaves the post vacant in the event of a political impasse[1][2][4].

(d) **Scenario that results in a Yes outcome:**  
Despite Together’s reduced seat count, cross-bloc negotiations produce either a grand coalition or a caretaker arrangement that allows a Together Prime Minister (potentially Gabriel Attal or another figure) to remain or return, likely through a deal that prevents a successful vote of no confidence. Alternatively, protracted coalition talks or deadlock allow the status quo to persist past July 30, with Attal remaining in office in a caretaker capacity due to absence of an agreed successor[2][4].

## Rationale

- The Prime Minister in France is appointed by the President, but their ability to govern hinges on avoiding a no-confidence vote in the National Assembly[1][2][4]. In this situation, the fragmented parliament makes stable government formation challenging, but the Together coalition’s diminished position (second in seat count, and lacking clear allies) makes it harder for them to credibly retain the premiership.
- The NFP, as the largest bloc, is publicly asserting its claim to the post, and there is no credible reporting of an imminent cross-bloc deal that would keep Together in power as of July 10, 2024.
- Historically, French presidents have appointed Prime Ministers from outside their own coalition when parliamentary arithmetic demands it, especially after snap elections with divided results[3].
- The primary reason for Together retaining the post would be political deadlock—if no coalition can command a working majority, Attal might temporarily remain as a caretaker. However, political pressure from the election result suggests movement towards an NFP-led or compromise government before the end of July.
- The status quo favors change, as President Macron’s hand is politically weakened by election results, and the opposition is vocal and numerically superior.

## Final Answer

Probability: 25%  
It remains possible, due to procedural inertia or political deadlock, that a Together Prime Minister could still be in office on July 30, 2024, but the most likely outcome is that the Prime Minister will *not* belong to the Together coalition at that time, given the results and prevailing political dynamics[1][2][4].
