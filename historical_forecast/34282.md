(a) **Time Left Until the Outcome**  
As of January 31, 2025, there are just over two months until April 6, 2025, the cutoff for this forecast.

(b) **Status Quo Outcome if Nothing Changed**  
No official date has been announced for an independence referendum as of January 31, 2025. If this remains the case until April 6, 2025, the question resolves as **No**.

(c) **Scenario Resulting in a No Outcome**  
The government continues its current approach: the commission on the referendum process does not finish its work, and no political consensus emerges to commit to a date. Given unresolved practical, economic, and political questions, Greenlandic leaders opt to address these before making a formal announcement. The elections proceed without an official referendum date being set.

(d) **Scenario Resulting in a Yes Outcome**  
Political momentum sharply increases, possibly due to external pressures (e.g., renewed US interest or escalated tensions with Denmark), or a breakthrough in the commission’s work. The ruling party, perhaps seeking to capitalize on independence sentiment during the election campaign, officially schedules the referendum to coincide with or shortly after the April elections, and publicly announces the date before April 6, 2025.

## Rationale

Greenland’s independence remains a popular and central political aspiration, and the question of a referendum is prominent in the 2025 election cycle[1][3][4]. However, several critical procedural and political steps must be completed before an official date is announced:

- The commission tasked with defining referendum logistics and legitimacy has only recently been formed and has not finished its work[1][2].
- Even the most pro-independence parties (including Naleraq) are, as of January 2025, not prepared to set a referendum date[1].
- Key unresolved issues include questions of economic sustainability, the future of Danish block grants, and practical governance matters[1][3].
- No credible source, as of January 31, 2025, reports any official announcement of a referendum date, and current reporting emphasizes that such an announcement is unlikely in the immediate term[1][2][3][4].

While the situation around Greenland’s elections is fluid and new developments are possible, strong institutional inertia and the need for orderly process make a sudden acceleration towards announcing a referendum date unlikely. The status quo strongly favors a **No**, as procedure and political caution typically dominate over rapid, transformative decisions.

Nevertheless, a slight possibility exists that external pressures or a calculated political move ahead of the elections could lead to an official announcement. This would require both the commission to complete its work ahead of schedule and Greenland’s leadership to decide the political climate is right for such an announcement, both of which seem improbable within the remaining two months[1][3][4].
