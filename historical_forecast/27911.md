(a) Time left until outcome: 26 days (from May 6, 2025 to the October 1, 2024 deadline)
(b) Status quo outcome: No (Catalent has not filed its 10-K as of the current date)
(c) No outcome scenario: Catalent continues to delay its filing due to complications from the pending Novo Holdings acquisition, or the revocation of its Exchange Act registration prevents proper filing.
(d) Yes outcome scenario: Catalent completes its 10-K filing before October 1, 2024, following the recent release of its financial results, maintaining compliance despite the notification of failure to file.

I notice there's a discrepancy in the dates provided. The current date is listed as May 6, 2025, but the question concerns events in 2024, and the background information states "as of September 4, 2024." Since I'm being asked to provide a forecast about an event in 2024 from a perspective in 2025, this would be a retroactive assessment, not a forecast. However, I'll proceed with the analysis based on the information provided.

Based on the search results and background information, Catalent received a notification of failure to file its 10-K annual report on August 29, 2024. Looking at historical patterns, Catalent has filed its 10-K reports in the past, though sometimes with delays - the 2023 10-K was filed in December 2023, significantly later than the typical filing window[3].

A critical factor in this forecast is that Catalent is in the process of being acquired by Novo Holdings, with the transaction expected to close toward the end of calendar year 2024[5]. Such major corporate transactions often complicate and delay financial reporting processes, as resources are diverted to merger-related activities and reporting requirements may change.

The most concerning indicator is the SEC notation that Catalent's Exchange Act registration has been revoked as of March 1, 2024[1]. This is highly unusual for a publicly traded company and could potentially impact its ability or obligation to file standard SEC reports like the 10-K.

However, Catalent did release its fourth quarter and fiscal 2024 financial results on August 29, 2024[2], which suggests the company has completed much of the financial reporting work that would go into a 10-K filing. This is a positive signal that the company may be able to complete its 10-K filing before the October 1 deadline.

The history of delayed filings (2023 10-K filed in December) suggests a pattern of eventually complying with filing requirements, even if late[3]. However, the combination of the acquisition process, the revocation of Exchange Act registration, and the notification of failure to file creates substantial uncertainty.

Given these factors, and considering that the status quo as of the current date is non-filing, I would assign a relatively low probability to Catalent filing its 10-K before October 1, 2024. The revocation of Exchange Act registration is particularly concerning and may fundamentally alter the company's filing requirements or abilities.

Probability: 25%
