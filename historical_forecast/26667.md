(a) **Time left until the outcome is known**

As of July 29, 2024, there are about two months (just over 60 days) remaining until the September 30, 2024 resolution date for this question.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changes**

To date, Planet Nine has not been directly detected[1][2][3][4]. Current telescopes have ruled out roughly 78% of the hypothesized sky area for Planet Nine, but the remaining 22% is in a region that existing instruments cannot adequately cover[2][3][5]. No credible claims of detection meeting the question’s criteria have been made as of late July 2024[1][2][3][4][5]. If nothing changes—that is, if no new telescopic capability or breakthrough occurs before the deadline—the outcome is “No.”

(c) **Brief scenario for a No outcome**

Planet Nine remains undetected through September 30, 2024, despite ongoing analyses and the use of all currently available telescopes. The remaining search region is inaccessible to existing instruments due to its extreme distance and faintness[2][3][5]. The Vera C. Rubin Observatory (formerly LSST), widely expected to be the game-changer for detecting such objects, is not planned to come online until 2025[2][3][5], after the resolution date. Without a new instrument or a serendipitous detection, the answer defaults to No.

(d) **Brief scenario for a Yes outcome**

A Yes outcome would require that, within the next two months:
- A direct optical detection of a new solar system planet, fitting the mass/radius and orbital period criteria, is confirmed by credible sources.
- This could happen if an existing survey or telescope (e.g., Pan-STARRS, Subaru, or another facility) serendipitously identifies a moving object in archival or ongoing data.
- The detection would need to be rapidly analyzed, confirmed, undergo peer review or public announcement, and pass the rigorous thresholds for a major planetary discovery—all before September 30, 2024.

## Rationale

The pace of change in this domain is slow, and the search for Planet Nine has been ongoing for nearly a decade without success[1][2][3][4][5]. Recent years have yielded more refined orbital predictions and significant progress in narrowing down the search area, but also a clear acknowledgment that the necessary observational capability to probe the last, most challenging segment of sky won’t be available until after the deadline—specifically, once the Rubin Observatory begins operations in 2025[2][3][5].

While incremental improvements in archival data analysis or a lucky detection are theoretically possible, no evidence in the published literature or public communications from the search teams indicates that such a discovery is imminent[2][3][4][5]. The scientific community remains hopeful but realistic: without a major new observing capability coming online before the deadline, the likelihood of a sudden, last-minute breakthrough is low.

Historical patterns in planetary science—where most discoveries follow from new instrumentation, rather than reanalysis of existing data—also suggest the status quo (no discovery) should carry extra weight in probabilistic forecasting.

## Probability Estimate

Given the lack of imminent new survey capabilities, the absence of recent discovery announcements, and consensus among experts that the next key search phase won’t begin until after the target date, the probability of Planet Nine being discovered before September 30, 2024, is exceedingly low.

**Probability: 1%**
