(a) Time left until outcome: 47 days (from February 12, 2025 to March 31, 2025)

(b) Status quo outcome: Yes - The UN currently has exactly 193 member states

(c) Scenario for No outcome: A new country is admitted to the UN before March 31, 2025, such as Palestine being upgraded from observer status to full membership, or a territory gaining independence and quickly being admitted. Alternatively, a current member state could withdraw or be expelled from the UN.

(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: The membership remains stable with no additions or removals to the current 193 member states, which is consistent with the relatively slow pace of UN membership changes in recent decades.

Based on the available information, I need to assess whether the UN will maintain exactly 193 member states by March 31, 2025. This is a short-term forecast covering less than two months from the current date.

The United Nations currently comprises exactly 193 sovereign states as full member states[1][4][5]. This number has remained stable for some time, with two additional entities (Vatican City and Palestine) holding non-member observer status[5].

The UN's membership has evolved significantly since its founding in 1945 with 51 original members[1]. However, changes to UN membership typically occur through deliberate processes that take considerable time. New members must be recommended by the Security Council and then approved by a two-thirds majority in the General Assembly.

Looking at recent documentation, there is no indication of imminent changes to the membership roster. The UN's budget contribution records from late April 2025 continue to operate within the framework of 193 member states[3]. The Security Council's current composition for 2025 reflects the established membership structure[2].

Most importantly, there are no publicly reported applications for UN membership in the final stages of consideration. While there are territories with aspirations for statehood and UN recognition, including Taiwan and Kosovo, none appear positioned to achieve membership in the short timeframe before March 31, 2025.

The status quo bias is particularly strong in this case because:

1. UN membership changes occur infrequently
2. The admission process is lengthy and politically complex
3. There are no reports of countries in the final stages of admission
4. No current member states have indicated imminent withdrawal

Given the institutional inertia and the absence of any concrete signals pointing to membership changes in this short timeframe, I must place significant weight on the status quo continuation. The most likely outcome is that the UN will maintain exactly 193 member states on March 31, 2025.

Probability: 95%
