(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
The outcome will be known shortly after December 31, 2024, when the Iowa Environmental Mesonet (IEM) posts the complete December data for the Jacksonville Naval Air Station. As today is November 26, 2024, there are just over five weeks remaining until the outcome is determined.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
Historically, December high temperatures in Jacksonville, FL average between 65°F and 70°F, with highs rarely exceeding 79°F[5][2]. Exceeding 80°F in December is rare, but not unprecedented. In most recent years, the temperature has not surpassed 80°F; if historical patterns hold, the status quo outcome is "No."[5][2]

(c) **Scenario for a No outcome:**  
December 2024 follows typical climatic patterns, with daily high temperatures mostly in the 60s and 70s, and none of the daily highs at Jacksonville Naval Air Station ever exceed 80°F during the month as recorded by IEM[5][2]. This outcome would align with the long-term averages, which show that December high temperatures above 80°F are infrequent[5].

(d) **Scenario for a Yes outcome:**  
A short-lived but anomalous warm spell occurs during December 2024, potentially driven by an unseasonably strong subtropical ridge, resulting in one or more days where the high temperature at Jacksonville Naval Air Station surpasses 80°F. This is possible under certain meteorological patterns (such as record warmth) and has occurred in the recent past, e.g., 84°F in December 2023 at other Jacksonville stations[3]. NOAA's winter outlook does suggest a greater chance of warmer and drier conditions than average for Northeast Florida in December 2024[3], which marginally increases the likelihood of a warm spike.

## Rationale

- **Historical precedent:** The vast majority of December days do not reach 80°F, but record events above this level have occurred. For example, 84°F in December 2023, although this is extremely rare and not at every station[3].
- **Climatological averages:** The daily high temperature in December almost never exceeds 79°F, per long-term breakdowns[5]. Most years, December stays below this threshold at this specific station.
- **2024 seasonal outlook:** NOAA predicts a warm and dry winter for Northeast Florida, which slightly increases the chance of a warm anomaly, but does not dramatically change the baseline probability[3].
- **Status quo bias:** The world changes slowly, and most meteorological patterns remain within historical ranges from year to year, arguing in favor of a "No" outcome most of the time.

## Final Forecast

Given the rarity of >80°F highs in December at Jacksonville, a generally warm seasonal outlook, and the specific requirement for the Naval Air Station reading, the likelihood is still below even odds but is not negligible.

**Probability: 18%**
