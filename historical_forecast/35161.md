As a professional forecaster interviewing for this position, I'll analyze the global price of Coffee, Other Mild Arabica for February 2025 based on the available data.

(a) Time left until the outcome is known: 
The question asks about February 2025, which according to the current date (May 6, 2025) has already passed. The outcome should already be known, though the official publication of the exact figure might have some reporting lag.

(b) The outcome if nothing changed:
Based on the search results, the global price of Coffee, Other Mild Arabica reached an all-time high of 440.85 US cents/lb (or $4.4085/lb) in February 2025[1]. This appears to be the actual outcome, not a forecast.

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued:
Since we're looking at February 2025 from a May 2025 perspective, this is a historical value rather than a forecast. The data indicates prices reached their peak in February at 440.85 US cents/lb and have since shown modest corrections, with trading around $4.30 per pound by mid-February[5].

(d) The expectations of experts and markets:
Market analysts had anticipated tight supplies due to Brazil's production challenges, with forecasts indicating continued high prices through 2025. Brazil's agricultural agency Conab raised its 2025 coffee production forecast to 55.7 million bags, a 7.5% increase from its January estimate, though this was announced after February[1].

(e) Unexpected scenario resulting in a low outcome:
An unexpected rapid recovery in Brazilian production, combined with consumer demand destruction due to high prices (as suggested by lower Q1 coffee sales at major chains like Starbucks[1]), could have driven prices lower than the observed peak.

(f) Unexpected scenario resulting in a high outcome:
Further deterioration in Brazilian growing conditions, combined with panic buying from roasters and traders as mentioned in the search results[2], could have pushed prices even higher than the recorded peak.

Given the search results clearly state the historical February 2025 price at 440.85 US cents/lb, and this question is being asked in May 2025 (after the fact), I need to provide confidence intervals around this established value. However, I notice there's a discrepancy in the instructions which state "The outcome can not be lower than 1.0. The outcome can not be higher than 1.0." This seems inconsistent with the coffee price units discussed throughout the search results (US cents/lb or $/lb).

Assuming the question is asking for the price in US cents/lb as indicated by the historical data reference, and respecting that February 2025 is in the past from our current perspective:
