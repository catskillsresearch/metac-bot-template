(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  
The preliminary November 2024 nonfarm payroll numbers from the BLS are scheduled for release on December 6, 2024. As of December 2, 2024, there are 4 days remaining until the official outcome is known[3].

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
The status quo is that nonfarm payroll employment increases—October 2024 saw a (small) gain of +12,000 jobs, despite being well below expectations and a significant drop from prior months[4][5]. Historically, outright declines in nonfarm payrolls are rare outside of recessions or major shocks, so a flat or slightly positive number is the default scenario[2][4].

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
A "No" outcome would occur if the BLS reports a negative change in total nonfarm payroll employment for November 2024—that is, a net job loss. This could stem from:
- Ongoing economic shocks (e.g., unresolved hurricane disruptions spreading into November),
- Accelerating weakness in core sectors (such as manufacturing or retail) that outweighs strength in health care and government,
- Broader economic deterioration or a sharp pullback in business hiring.

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
A "Yes" outcome will occur if the BLS reports that total nonfarm payroll employment increased or was unchanged (i.e., did not decline) in November 2024. This could result from:
- A rebound from hurricane disruptions that suppressed October's figures,
- Continued hiring strength in major sectors like health care and government,
- Labor market stability supported by still-elevated job postings and positive wage growth.

## Rationale

- **Recent Trend:** October 2024 posted a very small increase (+12,000 jobs), but remained positive even during what appears to have been a highly disrupted month[4][5]. 
- **Sector Performance:** Health care and government sectors continued to show strong job gains, offsetting losses in manufacturing and retail[4][5].
- **Hurricane Effects:** Major hurricanes likely depressed October's figure and may lead to a rebound in November[4][5]. Temporary layoffs or employment disruptions from natural disasters tend to reverse in subsequent months.
- **Historical Norms:** Annual and monthly data show job losses are rare unless a recession is underway. Even weak months amid softening demand have tended to hover near zero (not negative)[2][5].
- **Broader Labor Market Health:** The unemployment rate remains stable, wage growth is still positive, and job postings remain elevated, indicating underlying labor demand[5].
- **Data Revisions:** While previous months’ figures have been revised downward, the actual reported changes have remained positive, reinforcing the stickiness of modest job growth[4].

Given the above, the **base rate (status quo)** is that the BLS reports a positive change. The biggest risk is that the hurricane disruption lingers or that weakness in cyclical sectors accelerates. However, the evidence for an actual month-on-month net payroll decline is currently weak, and most labor market indicators remain consistent with ongoing, if slower, expansion.

## Final Answer

**Probability: 85%**

There is a high likelihood (85%) that the BLS will report an increase (or no decrease) in nonfarm payroll numbers for November 2024[2][4][5]. The most probable outcome is a rebound or at minimum a small gain, consistent with recent trends and historical patterns.
