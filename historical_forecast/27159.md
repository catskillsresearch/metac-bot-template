(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  
Approximately 1.5 months remain until September 30, 2024.  

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
_No human-to-human transmission of H5N1 will be reported globally before September 30, 2024._ As of August 14, 2024, all human H5N1 cases have been traced to direct animal exposure, with no cases of human-to-human transmission identified by the CDC, WHO, or other major public health bodies[1][2][3][4].

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
Human H5N1 cases continue to be reported only in individuals with direct exposure to infected animals (primarily poultry or dairy cattle), and there are no official CDC reports or credible evidence of person-to-person spread. Risk assessments remain low to moderate, and global surveillance does not detect clusters consistent with human-to-human transmission[3][5].

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
A human H5N1 case is reported where the CDC (or WHO, cited by the CDC) assesses—with more than 50% confidence—that infection likely resulted from contact with another infected person rather than direct animal exposure. This could occur, for example, if a family or healthcare worker of an index H5N1 case (with no other exposures) subsequently tests positive, prompting an official CDC assessment that human-to-human transmission likely occurred. The CDC would need to state this explicitly in their reporting for the outcome to resolve as Yes.

## Rationale

Recent reports and technical assessments all indicate that, as of August 14, 2024, *all* known human H5N1 infections have involved direct animal exposure—usually with infected poultry or, more recently and notably, dairy cattle[1][2][3][4][5]. No human-to-human transmission has been identified or reported by the CDC during the current outbreak[3].

Although the current situation has created new opportunities for the virus to adapt (given its presence in cattle and occasional mammal-to-human transmission[5]), influenza A(H5N1) maintains a poor track record for sustained human-to-human transmission. All technical updates and risk assessments from the CDC and WHO continue to describe the risk to the general population as low and specifically note the absence of any confirmed person-to-person spread[3][5]. 

Given historic inertia in the emergence of efficient human-to-human transmission, the lack of current evidence for such spread, and the short time remaining until the question closes, the status quo outcome (No) should be given substantial weight.

**Wild card factors**—such as viral mutation or a significant unrecognized transmission event—always exist, but there have been no signals or reports to date indicating such a development is imminent. Should person-to-person spread be identified, it would almost certainly be widely publicized and rapidly assessed by the CDC and WHO.

**Probability: 5%**

This reflects a very low—but not zero—likelihood of a CDC-reported human-to-human H5N1 transmission event before September 30, 2024, in line with historical precedent and the current outbreak situation[1][2][3][4][5].
