(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  
As of September 17, 2024, there are 14 days (about two weeks) until the resolution date of October 1, 2024.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changes:**  
No Form 4 reporting a share sale by Donald Trump has been posted on the Trump Media & Technology Group investor relations page. If this remains unchanged, the outcome is "No."

(c) **Scenario for a No outcome:**  
Donald Trump does not sell any TMTG shares, or—if he does—the required Form 4 is not posted on the company investor relations page before October 1, 2024. This could be due to Trump deciding to hold (as he publicly suggested), delays in filing, or timing issues with the investor relations site.

(d) **Scenario for a Yes outcome:**  
Trump sells any amount of TMTG shares after the lockup ends (September 19, 2024) and a corresponding Form 4, listing him as the reporting insider and disclosing the sale, is posted on the company’s investor relations page before October 1, 2024.

## Rationale

- **Lockup period conclusion:** Trump is first able to sell after September 19, 2024, leaving approximately 12 days before the October 1 deadline for any sale and for a Form 4 to be filed and publicly posted.
- **Public signals:** Trump recently told a reporter he is "not prepared to start selling shares," and this statement caused the stock price to rise, suggesting his intent (at least for now) is not to immediately sell. Historically, insiders often delay selling immediately after a lockup to avoid negative market optics and to maintain investor confidence[1].
- **Financial incentives:** Trump’s stake remains substantial (near $2 billion), but the stock’s poor performance in early September (losing all 2024 gains) might discourage immediate sales, as selling now could lock in losses or fuel further declines[1]. There is also heightened scrutiny and market sensitivity to any insider selling.
- **Precedent:** CEO Devin Nunes has reportedly sold shares, suggesting some insiders are taking liquidity, but Trump’s unique role may make him more hesitant.
- **Reporting logistics:** The probability is slightly reduced by the need for any Form 4 to appear on the specific investor relations site by October 1. Even if a sale occurs, a reporting or posting delay would resolve as "No."
- **Reputational and political factors:** As the public face of TMTG and with the firm closely tied to his brand, Trump has incentives to avoid the appearance of abandoning the company, especially in an election year.

## Conclusion

Given the short time window, explicit public statements against selling, negative signals from the recent stock slide, and additional risk of reporting delays, the "No" outcome (no Form 4 reporting a Trump sale posted before October 1) remains the default and most likely result. While the incentives to sell exist, the balance of evidence and typical insider behavior after lockup expiries—especially for high-profile figures—make a sale and timely disclosure less probable within the narrow window.

**Probability: 15%**
