(a) **Time left until resolution:**  
There are 36 days until October 1, 2024.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
As of the most recent reports (August 21, 2024), Ukrainian forces had not yet captured Glushkovo or been reported by ISW as controlling it. If the situation does not significantly change, the outcome will be **No**—Glushkovo will not be marked as under Ukrainian control on the ISW map before October 1, 2024[2][3][4].

(c) **Scenario for a No outcome:**  
- Ukrainian forces continue to make only marginal advances in Kursk Oblast.
- Russian forces effectively defend or reinforce Glushkovo, leveraging river barriers and destroyed bridges to slow Ukrainian momentum[1][4].
- ISW never marks Glushkovo as under Ukrainian control (including “claimed” control) before the deadline, even if skirmishes occur nearby.

(d) **Scenario for a Yes outcome:**  
- Ukrainian forces exploit disrupted Russian logistics (due to destroyed bridges in Glushkovo Raion) and achieve a breakthrough[4].
- Ukrainian advances continue at the current or increased pace, pushing past Korenevo and crossing the Seim River to reach and seize Glushkovo.
- ISW updates its interactive map to label the coordinates of Glushkovo as Ukrainian (or “claimed Ukrainian”) controlled at any point before October 1, 2024.

## Rationale

**Ukrainian advances:**  
Ukrainian forces have made rapid and deep advances in Kursk Oblast since their incursion began in early August, with control claimed over up to 82 settlements and expansion into new districts, including near Glushkovo[2][3][4]. Ukrainian units have already advanced to within 17 kilometers of Glushkovo, and the combat zone is now at the border of Glushkovsky District[2][3]. The recent destruction of key bridges—including the major road bridge in Glushkovo—has likely disrupted Russian ground lines of communication and could weaken Russian defensive capabilities in the area[1][4].

**Constraints and uncertainties:**  
- **Pace of advance:** The Ukrainian operation has reportedly slowed recently, and ISW analysts caution that Ukraine may not doctrinally control all the territory within its claimed advances[3].
- **Russian resistance:** Russian forces are likely to reinforce strategically important settlements like Glushkovo. Even with logistical disruptions, the destroyed bridges may hinder Ukrainian advances as much as Russian defenses[1][4].
- **Geographical obstacles:** The Seim River forms a natural barrier. Crossing it, especially after bridge destruction, could delay or prevent Ukrainian capture of Glushkovo unless pontoon bridges or other means are established.
- **ISW reporting:** The outcome is determined solely by how ISW depicts control on its map. Even if Ukraine claims an advance, if ISW does not reflect it, the answer is “No.”

**Status quo weight:**  
Good forecasting practice gives extra weight to the status quo, especially given natural operational slowdowns, the likelihood that Russian forces will prioritize defending administrative centers, and the complexity of river crossings. While Ukraine has surprised observers with the scale and speed of its incursion, the leap from advancing near the district border to actually controlling Glushkovo is substantial—particularly within a 5-week window and given ISW’s typically conservative mapping of control.

## Final Probability

Factoring in
- continued Ukrainian momentum,
- ongoing Russian resistance and defensive advantages (river, bridges),
- ISW’s cautious approach to mapping control,
- and the moderate operational slowdown recently reported,

**Probability: 37%**  
This reflects a meaningful, but less-than-even, chance that Ukrainian forces will be marked by ISW as having captured Glushkovo before October 1, 2024. The most likely outcome—if trends hold—is continued fighting near, but not a clear and mapped capture of, the town by the deadline[2][3][4].
