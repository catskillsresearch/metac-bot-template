(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
The NICS background checks for April 2025 are expected to be published by the FBI in the first week of May 2025. As of May 6, 2025, this release is imminent—likely just days away.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
If recent monthly patterns persisted unchanged, April 2025 would register NICS checks similar to April 2024. April 2024 saw more than 1 million adjusted checks, with the long-standing streak of each month exceeding 1 million NICS checks continuing[1]. Recent years show April figures between 1.7 million and 2.3 million total background checks (including non-purchase checks)[3][5].

(c) **Outcome if the current trend continued:**  
The trend from late 2024 through early 2025 is downward. March 2025 saw declines both month-over-month and year-over-year, with the first quarter of 2025 being the lowest in five years[2]. If this downward trajectory continues, April 2025 checks would be lower than April 2024, possibly closer to 1.7 million to 2.0 million total checks.

(d) **Expectations of experts and markets:**  
Experts project that April 2025 background checks will be slightly below recent April figures, based on several factors:
- No major new gun control measures or "panic buying" events.
- Cooling consumer demand due to economic uncertainty and reduced political urgency post-election[2].
- Ongoing but not yet implemented legislative changes.
Analysts expect the monthly total to come in at the lower end of the recent range, between 1.7 million and 2.1 million[2][5].

(e) **Unexpected scenario for a low outcome:**  
A sudden national economic setback, such as a sharp recession or an abrupt spike in unemployment, could further dampen discretionary spending and drive April 2025 NICS checks significantly below trend—possibly falling closer to or even slightly below 1.5 million total checks.

(f) **Unexpected scenario for a high outcome:**  
A major, widely publicized violent event, proposed restrictive federal legislation, or a major Supreme Court ruling could spur a surge in firearm demand, leading to a short-term spike in background checks—potentially exceeding 2.3 million for the month, rivaling post-pandemic or major election surges.
