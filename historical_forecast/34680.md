(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  
As of February 6, 2025, there are just over 4 weeks—until March 10, 2025—for the eighth Starship integrated flight test to reach an altitude of 160 kilometers.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changes:**  
No Starship integrated flight test will occur between now and March 10, 2025; thus, the requirement will not be met, and the outcome is No.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
SpaceX does not launch an eighth Starship integrated flight test (IFT-8) between February 3 and March 10, 2025, or, if a launch somehow occurs, the vehicle fails to reach 160 kilometers altitude intact. All currently available information indicates no IFT-8 is scheduled before mid-May 2025, and there are no credible announcements or evidence to the contrary[1][4].

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
SpaceX announces and rapidly executes an additional—previously unannounced—Starship integrated flight test (IFT-8) on very short notice and successfully launches before March 10, 2025, with the vehicle reaching at least 160 kilometers altitude intact, as verified by SpaceX telemetry or credible sources. There is currently no information supporting this scenario[1][4].

## Rationale

Historical trends and the current status strongly favor the status quo outcome. As of February 6, all reports and credible schedules point to the next Starship test flight (IFT-9) not occurring until at least mid-May 2025, with no evidence of an IFT-8 planned or in preparation for February or early March[4]. Previous Starship launches have not achieved the rapid turnaround initially envisioned by SpaceX, and the most recent test (IFT-7, January 16, 2025) ended in failure during the initial phase of flight[1][5].

SpaceX is known for ambitious targets and sometimes surprising rapid action, but federal regulatory processes, vehicle refurbishment or replacement after failures, and observed launch cadence make the probability of staging, preparing, and flying a new integrated test flight within the next month extremely low.

Good forecasting practice gives heavy weight to the status quo, especially when all publicly available evidence and past cadence support it. Unless entirely new and credible information emerges indicating an imminent, unannounced launch, the probability of the eighth Starship integrated flight test reaching 160 kilometers before March 10, 2025, is exceedingly low.

**Probability: 1%**
