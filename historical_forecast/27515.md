(a) **Time left until outcome known:**  
The Apple event is officially confirmed for September 10, 2024, which is less than three weeks from August 23, 2024, the current reference date[4][5].

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changes:**  
Apple's iPhones officially support up to 27W wired and 15W MagSafe charging as of the iPhone 15 series. There is no official Apple announcement yet for a 40W (or higher) fast charging iPhone, so the default outcome is **No**â€”unless Apple announces this new capability at the September 2024 event or through another official channel before October 1, 2024.

(c) **Scenario for a No outcome:**  
Apple announces the iPhone 16 series at its September event, but the official specifications only mention charging speeds below 40W, refer only to "faster charging" without specifying wattage, or make no mention of improved charging capabilities. Alternatively, no iPhone event occurs before October 1, 2024.

(d) **Scenario for a Yes outcome:**  
During or by the end of the September 2024 Apple event (or via an official Apple press release or technical documentation), Apple clearly announces that at least one iPhone model (most likely a Pro variant) supports 40W or higher charging, specifying the wattage in their official materials.

## Rationale

Recent rumors and leaks are consistent in suggesting that Apple may introduce a significant charging speed upgrade for at least the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max, with several sources mentioning 40W wired charging as a possibility. This would be a notable jump from the current 27W peak on the iPhone 15 series.

However, these reports remain unconfirmed by Apple and are based solely on leaks and supply-chain rumors. Historically, Apple has been conservative with battery and charging announcements, often prioritizing battery longevity and device safety over raw charging speeds. Notably, Apple rarely highlights wattage in keynote presentations, typically referencing real-world outcomes like "50% charge in 30 minutes," and has not previously joined the ultra-fast charging race seen in the Android ecosystem.

On the other hand, the competitive landscape is shifting, with rivals (including Samsung and Xiaomi) touting much higher charging rates. Given the iPhone 16 Pro models are expected to feature larger batteries and more power-hungry AI features, there is technical justification for an increase. There is also precedent in the recent Apple support documentation referencing higher MagSafe charging rates, though it did not confirm 40W wired charging.

**Weighting the evidence:**  
- The strongest direct evidence (rumors, technical document leaks) points to the possibility of 40W being accurate for at least the Pro models.
- There is no official Apple confirmation or pre-release mention in official channels of 40W wired charging as of August 23, 2024.
- Apple could choose either to announce this explicitly (resolving as Yes), introduce faster charging without specifying wattage (resolving as No), or skip the charging upgrade entirely (No).

Given the convergence of credible leaks, technical rationale, and competitive pressure, but balanced by Apple's conservative track record and the lack of official confirmation, the probability should reflect some tilt toward Yes, but not a majority.
