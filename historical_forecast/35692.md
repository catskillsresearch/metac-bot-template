I'll address this forecasting question systematically, analyzing the available information about Rippling's potential IPO plans.

(a) Time until outcome is known: The outcome is already known, as we are currently on May 6, 2025, and the resolution date was April 1, 2025.

(b) Status quo outcome: Based on the available information, Rippling did not announce plans for an IPO before April 1, 2025, so the status quo outcome is "No."

(c) Scenario resulting in a No outcome: Rippling continues to focus on private funding rounds, as evidenced by their Series F fundraising in April 2024, without making any formal IPO announcements through either an SEC Form S-1 filing or on their company news section by April 1, 2025.

(d) Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome: Rippling could have followed up on CEO Parker Conrad's 2023 statement about contemplating an IPO by making a formal announcement either through an SEC Form S-1 filing or on their company news section before April 1, 2025.

## Analysis of Available Information

The search results provide several key pieces of information about Rippling's status regarding a potential IPO:

1. Historical context: As of August 2024, there were "no official announcements regarding Rippling's IPO plans," though there was speculation due to the company's strong performance and high valuation[1].

2. Recent funding: In April 2024, Rippling raised $200 million in a Series F round at a reported valuation of $13.5 billion[1][2]. This significant private funding round could indicate that the company wasn't yet ready to pursue an IPO at that time.

3. CEO statements: In April 2023, CEO Parker Conrad told The Information that he was "eyeing a forthcoming public offering," though he withheld specific timing details[4]. This statement is now over two years old, and there's no evidence in the search results of more recent public statements about IPO plans.

4. Timeline consideration: The most recent information in the search results is from January 2025[5], which is still prior to the resolution date of April 1, 2025. However, this blog post doesn't mention anything about IPO plans.

## Status Quo Bias and Additional Considerations

As noted in the prompt, good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. The status quo as of the last comprehensive information (August 2024) was that Rippling had not announced IPO plans.

Several factors suggest continuation of this status quo:

1. Rippling secured significant private funding in April 2024, suggesting they had access to capital without needing to go public immediately.

2. CEO Parker Conrad's 2023 statement about a potential IPO did not specify timing and is now relatively dated.

3. The search results don't indicate any SEC Form S-1 filing or announcement on Rippling's news section about IPO plans before April 1, 2025.

While Rippling has shown strong growth and financial performance, with ARR exceeding $350 million by the end of 2023 and expansion into international markets[1], these factors alone don't necessarily translate to an imminent IPO announcement.

## Conclusion

Based on the available information, there is no evidence that Rippling announced plans for an IPO before April 1, 2025, either through an SEC Form S-1 filing or on their company news section. The company appears to have continued focusing on private funding and expansion during this period.

Given that we are now past the resolution date (May 6, 2025) and there is no indication in the search results of an IPO announcement before April 1, 2025, I can confidently assess that the outcome is "No."

Probability: 0%
