(a) **Time left until outcome**: 11 days (March 20 → March 31, 2025)  
(b) **Status quo outcome**: Call Her Daddy remains above Candace, as their current ranks (#4 vs. #5) and stability metrics suggest no imminent reversal absent new developments[1][3].  
(c) **Unexpected outcome scenario**: A viral Candace episode (e.g., high-profile political endorsement or controversy) could spike downloads, while Call Her Daddy’s relative lack of recent news leaves it vulnerable to stagnation[1][5].  

### Rationale  
1. **Stability of top podcasts**: Established shows in the 4-5 range rarely swap positions without specific catalysts (new episodes, media coverage, or algorithm changes)[3].  
2. **Candace’s upward trajectory**: Despite its #5 rank, Candace Owens’ podcast has demonstrated rapid growth since its June 2024 launch, suggesting underlying momentum[1][2].  
3. **Call Her Daddy’s advantage**: The show’s $30M+ brand value and consistent topical relevance (dating/relationships) provide a defensive moat against rank erosion[4][5].  

**Final probabilities**:  
Call Her Daddy: 65%  
Candace: 35%
