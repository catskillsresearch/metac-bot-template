(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
The outcome to this question is already known. The 2025 (36th) GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Video Game has been announced.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
*Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door* did not win the 2025 GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Video Game. The award went to *Dragon Age: The Veilguard*[2][3].

(c) **Scenario that results in a No outcome:**  
GLAAD announces a winner for Outstanding Video Game, and it is not *Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door*â€”which is the case for the 36th award cycle, as *Dragon Age: The Veilguard* won[2][3].

(d) **Scenario that results in a Yes outcome:**  
The only scenario that would result in a "Yes" outcome would be if *Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door* were officially named the winner of the Outstanding Video Game category at the 36th GLAAD Media Awards. This did not happen; the official announcement confirms a different winner[2][3].

Despite *Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door* being nominated, praised for its improved and explicit representation of its transgender character Vivian[1][2][3][5], and seen as a positive milestone for inclusive localization, it did not claim the award. The result is clear, verifiable, and final according to multiple authoritative sources from both GLAAD and extensive media coverage.
