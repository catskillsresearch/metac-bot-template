(a) Time until outcome: The OBR is scheduled to release its next economic and fiscal outlook on March 26, 2025, which is in 20 days from today (May 6, 2025).

Wait, there appears to be a discrepancy in the dates provided. The query states today is May 6, 2025, but also mentions that the OBR report was to be released on March 26, 2025, which would have already occurred. The research assistant's analysis was dated March 15, 2025, before the March report. Since we're now in May 2025, the March 2025 OBR report would have already been published, but the specific results aren't provided in the search results.

(b) Status quo outcome: Based on the most recent information prior to March 2025, the OBR projected CPI inflation to be 2.6% in 2025 (from their October 2024 report)[1]. This would place the outcome in the "2.5-2.7" range if nothing changed.

(c) Unexpected outcome scenario: An unexpected outcome could arise if global energy prices suddenly decreased significantly due to a major breakthrough in renewable energy production or a substantial increase in oil production from major producers. This could push inflation predictions lower than expected, potentially into the "2.1 or lower" range, contrary to the upward trend observed in recent forecasts.

As a professional forecaster, I need to carefully analyze the available information to provide an accurate assessment of the likely OBR inflation estimate for 2025 as of March 2025.

The most recent OBR forecast from October 2024 projected CPI inflation to rise to 2.6% in 2025[1]. This was already a significant increase from their previous forecast of 1.5% from March 2024.

More recent data from the Bank of England's February 2025 Monetary Policy Report indicates further upward pressure on inflation. The BoE revised their projection upward, expecting CPI inflation to reach 3.7% in Q3 2025, compared to their previous November 2024 projection of around 2.75% for the second half of 2025[2].

Several factors are driving this upward revision:

1. Energy prices have increased since late 2024, with the direct energy price contribution to 12-month CPI inflation expected to increase from -0.6 to +0.4 percentage points in 2025 Q3[2].

2. The October 2024 Budget policies are projected to push up CPI inflation by around 0.5 percentage points at their peak[1].

3. Regulated price changes and government policies announced in the Autumn Budget 2024 are expected to cause inflation to rise in the near term[2].

When forecasting the OBR's March 2025 estimate, I must consider that the OBR typically provides an annual average inflation rate rather than quarterly figures like the BoE. The OBR also conducts its own independent analysis, which may differ somewhat from the BoE's projections.

Given the significant upward revision in the BoE's inflation forecast between November 2024 and February 2025, it's reasonable to expect that the OBR would also revise its forecast upward from the October 2024 figure of 2.6%. The magnitude of this revision is likely to be substantial, though perhaps not as dramatic as the BoE's revision to 3.7% for Q3 2025.

Taking into account the status quo bias and leaving room for unexpected outcomes, my forecast is:

Option_A: 2.1 or lower: 0.03
Option_B: 2.2-2.4: 0.07
Option_C: 2.5-2.7: 0.15
Option_D: 2.8-3.0: 0.35
Option_E: 3.1-3.3: 0.25
Option_F: 3.4 or higher: 0.15
