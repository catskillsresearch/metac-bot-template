(a) **Time until outcome is known:**  
As of May 6, 2025, April 1, 2025 has already passed. However, the scenario described is from the perspective of February 14, 2025, at which point about 6.5 weeks remained until April 1, 2025.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changes:**  
If current trends continue and no extraordinary global events occur, the world remains "normal" through April 1, 2025. None of the specified dramatic criteria—such as artificial general intelligence, a 10% population decline, 30% one-year GDP growth, alien technosignatures, a shocking UAP explanation, World War III, or nuclear war—are expected to occur imminently.

(c) **Scenario that results in a No outcome:**  
A No outcome requires that at least one of the listed world-altering events happens before April 1, 2025. For example:
- A credible and widely accepted announcement of artificial general intelligence with public demonstrations.
- An exceptionally rapid and verifiable 10% drop in the global population due to pandemic, war, or disaster.
- Official confirmation of alien technosignatures by the scientific community.
- Outbreak of global warfare recognized as "World War III" or a nuclear detonation in war.
Given current data, none of these scenarios are underway or imminent, and such events would be highly visible.

(d) **Scenario that results in a Yes outcome:**  
A Yes outcome requires simply that none of the above events occur before April 1, 2025. Current projections in economics, demographics, and science suggest ongoing stability, with no evidence that any of these transformative or catastrophic criteria are close to being fulfilled.

## Rationale

The best forecasts weight heavily toward continuity because most years—including tumultuous ones—do not see the type of unprecedented change outlined in the criteria. As of early 2025:

- There is consensus among economic authorities (IMF, UN, OECD, EY) that global growth for 2025 is projected at roughly 2.8–3.3%, far below the 30% threshold[1][3][4][5].
- No indications exist of a sudden, severe global population decline; demographers and international agencies report stable trends.
- Despite intense research activity in AI, most domain experts remain skeptical of AGI arriving by 2025. While some leaders, such as Sam Altman, maintain optimism about near-term AGI, the majority of experts forecast a much later timeline, typically in the 2040s or 2050s[4][5]. There have been no public, credible announcements of AGI as of early 2025.
- There have been no verified discoveries of alien technosignatures, nor any consensus on a worldview-shattering explanation for UAPs.
- While geopolitical tensions persist, there is no open conflict that would plausibly be classified as "World War III," nor have there been reports of nuclear detonations as acts of war.

Given the lack of evidence for any of these criteria being met and the strong tendency for "normal" years to outnumber extraordinary ones, the most reasonable forecast continues to assign a very high probability that the world will remain "normal" through April 1, 2025.
