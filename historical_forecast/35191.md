(a) Time until outcome: 40 days (from May 6, 2025 until April 1, 2025 - which has already passed)
(b) Status quo outcome: No pardon has been issued to Edward Snowden as of May 6, 2025
(c) No outcome scenario: President Trump continues to defer making a decision on Snowden's pardon, citing the controversial nature of the case and preferring to let the courts handle it, similar to his position during his first term.
(d) Yes outcome scenario: Not possible at this point, as the resolution date of April 1, 2025 has already passed.

Based on the search results and the current date (May 6, 2025), I can provide a definitive answer to this forecasting question.

The question asks if Edward Snowden would receive a presidential pardon before April 1, 2025. Since today's date is May 6, 2025, we are already past the resolution date specified in the question. The search results do not indicate that Edward Snowden received a pardon before April 1, 2025.

The most recent information from the search results shows that as of February 4, 2025, President Trump stated he was "not ready to discuss" the possibility of pardoning Snowden, saying: "I'm not talking about that right now. There's a huge difference of opinion. Some people say he should be pardoned. Some people say it would be terrible. I'm not getting involved in that."[3]

Prior to that, in December 2024, there was reported support among some Trump advisers for a potential Snowden pardon. Matt Gaetz indicated there was "pretty broad support for a pardon" among those in the transition team[1]. Other Trump nominees like Tulsi Gabbard and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. had previously expressed support for pardoning Snowden[1].

However, the search results contain no information about an actual pardon being granted between February 4, 2025, and April 1, 2025. Given that we are now past the resolution date and no pardon was reported in the search results, the outcome is clear.

As a forecaster, I recognize that the status quo (no pardon) has persisted despite the advocacy from some of Trump's allies. This aligns with Trump's previous reluctance during his first term, when he "passed over the option of granting Snowden a pardon in 2021" and "said he would let the courts work it out."[1]
