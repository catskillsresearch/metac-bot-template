(a) **Time left until resolution:**  
There are approximately 2.5 months remaining until September 30, 2024, the cutoff date for the PHEIC declaration to be considered for this question.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changes:**  
As of now, there has been no WHO declaration of a PHEIC concerning avian influenza in humans. The default—if the epidemiological situation remains unchanged and no extraordinary event occurs—would be a “No” outcome.

(c) **Scenario that results in a No outcome:**  
- Human infections with HPAI (such as H5N1) remain sporadic and limited.
- There is no clear evidence of efficient or sustained human-to-human transmission.
- Human cases do not significantly increase in number or geographic spread.
- The WHO continues to monitor the situation but does not convene or is not advised by the Emergency Committee to declare a PHEIC.
- No formal announcement is made via WHO communication channels by September 30, 2024.

(d) **Scenario that results in a Yes outcome:**  
- There is a notable increase in human cases of HPAI, possibly with evidence of limited or sustained human-to-human transmission.
- Cases appear in multiple countries, indicating international spread.
- The public health risk is assessed as extraordinary or unexpected, with implications beyond the affected country’s borders.
- The WHO convenes its Emergency Committee under the International Health Regulations (IHR), determines that the criteria for a PHEIC are met, and formally declares one before September 30, 2024, as published on their website or through official press releases[1][5].

## Rationale

- **PHEIC Criteria:** Declaring a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) requires an event that is serious, sudden, unusual or unexpected, with cross-border implications and a possible need for international action[1][5].
- **Current Situation:** As of the latest available information (mid-July 2024), there is no evidence that the WHO has convened an emergency committee resulting in a PHEIC declaration for avian influenza in humans. Human H5N1 cases remain rare and have not demonstrated sustained human-to-human transmission.
- **Historical Precedent:** For prior PHEIC declarations (e.g., H1N1, COVID-19), the trigger was either rapid international spread or compelling evidence of unusual or severe disease in humans[4].
- **Recent WHO Practice:** The WHO regularly reviews potential PHEIC events and publishes decisions. Without significant escalation in risk indicators, the default has been to avoid PHEIC declarations for localized or animal-focused outbreaks[1].
- **Timeframe for Change:** While there is always potential for rapid developments in infectious disease scenarios (such as sudden clusters or a major mutation), most PHEIC declarations have followed weeks or months of mounting evidence and international pressure.

Given these factors, the weight of the “status quo” outcome is high: it would require a major, unusual change in the epidemiology of avian influenza among humans to trigger the declaration within the remaining timeframe.
