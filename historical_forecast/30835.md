**Time until outcome:** 25 days remaining until January 1, 2025 (as of December 6, 2024).  
**Status quo outcome:** Michel Barnier remains Prime Minister if Macron delays appointment or retains him despite the no-confidence vote.  
**No scenario:** Macron retains Barnier if the no-confidence vote unexpectedly fails (though reports indicate it was "all but certain" to pass), or if Macron refuses to appoint a replacement and maintains a caretaker government.  
**Yes scenario:** The successful December 4 no-confidence vote forces Barnier’s resignation, and Macron swiftly appoints a new PM (as he pledged to do "within days" on December 5[2]) to address the crisis.  

**Rationale:**  
1. **Vote outcome:** Multiple sources confirm Barnier’s government fell to the December 4 no-confidence vote[2]. Historical precedent (60+ years since a successful no-confidence vote) underscores the urgency, eliminating status quo stability.  
2. **Macron’s commitment:** Macron explicitly stated on December 5 that he would appoint a new PM "within days," directly signaling intent to resolve the crisis quickly[2].  
3. **Political timing:** With budget pressures and a leadership vacuum following Barnier’s resignation[4], Macron faces intense pressure to act before year-end. Delaying until 2025 risks compounding France’s fiscal crisis and political instability, making swift appointment likelier.  
4. **Constitutional norms:** Macron retains authority to appoint unilaterally if needed, bypassing prolonged negotiations. While fragmented parliament complicates consensus, urgency likely overrides procedural delays.  

**Probability: 95%**  
*(Based on Macron’s public commitment to immediate action post-vote and the resolved no-confidence motion creating an unavoidable leadership vacuum.)*
