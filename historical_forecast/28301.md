(a) Time left until outcome: 10 days (from May 6, 2025 to the resolution date of October 1, 2024)

(b) Status quo outcome: NO - As of the latest available information, none of the specified tech companies (Amazon, Apple, Google/Alphabet, IBM, Meta/Facebook, Nvidia, Oracle, Salesforce, Tesla) have announced layoffs in September 2024 according to TechCrunch's tracker.

(c) Scenario for NO outcome: The current economic conditions remain stable through September 2024, and none of the listed companies face urgent financial pressures requiring immediate workforce reductions. Companies continue their normal operations without implementing major restructuring plans that would result in layoffs being reported on TechCrunch's tracker.

(d) Scenario for YES outcome: Economic pressures intensify, or a specific company faces unexpected challenges (such as Amazon following through on its restructuring warning after the return-to-office mandate), leading to a September layoff announcement that gets recorded on TechCrunch's tracker before October 1, 2024.

Based on the search results and the current state of the tech industry, I can provide a comprehensive forecast about potential layoffs at major tech companies before October 1, 2024.

The tech industry has experienced significant workforce reductions throughout 2024, with over 260,423 employees laid off across more than 380 tech companies worldwide since the start of the year[2]. U.S.-based corporations have accounted for the majority of these cuts, with 151,593 job cuts representing over half of the global total[2].

Looking at specific companies mentioned in the query:

Amazon recently ordered employees back to the office five days a week on September 16, 2024, with warnings about restructuring. While this could potentially signal future layoffs, no September layoff event has been recorded on TechCrunch's tracker as of the available information.

Apple has already had layoff events in February, April, and August 2024, with the most recent affecting workers in its digital services division. The pattern suggests quarterly adjustments, but there's no confirmation of a September event.

Google/Alphabet implemented layoffs in January, April, May, and June 2024, showing a pattern of workforce adjustments throughout the first half of the year, but none reported for September yet.

Salesforce has eliminated jobs in January and July 2024, and was reportedly cutting more than 1,000 jobs while simultaneously hiring for AI-related positions[5]. However, no September layoff has been reported.

Tesla conducted significant layoffs in April 2024, cutting more than 10% of its workforce, but has not announced further reductions for September.

Other companies on the list (IBM, Meta/Facebook, Nvidia, Oracle) have either had minimal or no layoffs recorded by TechCrunch in 2024.

## Forecasting Considerations

When assessing the likelihood of September layoffs, several factors are worth considering:

**Historical patterns**: Tech layoffs have continued throughout 2024, with major companies like Workday laying off 1,750 employees (8.5% of staff) and Dell cutting approximately 18,500 jobs across multiple rounds[2][5]. This suggests the industry remains in a period of workforce adjustment.

**Economic context**: 38% of companies surveyed in December 2023 anticipated layoffs in 2024, with 50% citing recession concerns as a primary reason[3]. This indicates a cautious approach to staffing across industries.

**AI integration**: 40% of companies planning layoffs attributed them to replacing workers with AI[3], a trend that continues to affect the tech sector specifically.

**Status quo bias**: As a forecaster, I must acknowledge that the status quo (no September layoffs reported yet for these specific companies) should carry significant weight in my assessment, especially given the short timeframe remaining until October 1.

**Specific company signals**: Amazon's recent return-to-office mandate and restructuring warning represents the most concrete signal among the listed companies that might indicate imminent layoffs, but this has not yet manifested in a TechCrunch listing.

Given that we're already well into September with no reports from TechCrunch about layoffs at these specific major tech companies, and considering the relatively short time remaining until the resolution date, the status quo outcome (NO) appears most likely. While the tech sector continues to experience layoffs broadly, the specific companies and timeframe in question show no concrete evidence of imminent September layoffs according to the designated resolution source.

Probability: 25%
