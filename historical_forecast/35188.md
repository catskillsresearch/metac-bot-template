(a) Time left until outcome: The outcome will be known in about 42 days (from May 6, 2025, back to April 1, 2025). However, this question asks about events before April 1, 2025, which has already passed.

(b) Status quo outcome: Based on the search results and the current date (May 6, 2025), we would need to determine if the New York Times used the phrase "constitutional crisis" in its U.S. section between February 19, 2025 (when the research was conducted) and April 1, 2025. The search results indicate that the New York Times did use this phrase on February 11, 2025, in an Instagram post that stated "President Trump has caused a constitutional crisis as he tests the boundaries of executive power..."[1]

(c) No outcome scenario: The New York Times could have refrained from using the exact phrase "constitutional crisis" in its U.S. section despite political tensions, instead opting for alternative terminology to describe governmental challenges.

(d) Yes outcome scenario: The New York Times could have published articles in its U.S. section using the exact phrase "constitutional crisis" to describe escalating political tensions related to President Trump's actions testing the boundaries of executive power, as indicated in their February 11, 2025 Instagram post.

Looking at the evidence available, the NYT Instagram post from February 11, 2025 explicitly used the phrase "constitutional crisis"[1]. However, I need to be careful about several factors:

1. The question specifically asks about usage in the "U.S. section" of the New York Times
2. An Instagram post may not necessarily correspond to an article in the U.S. section
3. The post excerpt indicates this was likely related to a full article, but we don't have confirmation it appeared in the U.S. section specifically

The search results also mention a podcast episode titled "The Constitutional Crisis of 2025 with Prof. Alexander Keyssar" from January 19, 2025[5], which suggests the concept of a constitutional crisis was being discussed in early 2025, though this is not from the New York Times.

Given that the Instagram post from NYT on February 11, 2025 explicitly used the phrase "constitutional crisis" in relation to President Trump's actions, and considering the context suggests this was likely part of their news coverage, there's a strong possibility this phrase appeared in their U.S. section between February 11 and April 1, 2025.

However, without explicit confirmation that this Instagram post corresponded to an article in the U.S. section specifically, I cannot be 100% certain. The status quo somewhat favors a "Yes" outcome based on the Instagram post, but there remains uncertainty about the specific section placement.

Probability: 75%
