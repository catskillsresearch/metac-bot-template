(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
There are about 6 weeks (approximately 42 days) remaining until the Forbes Real-Time Billionaires List ranking on December 31, 2024, will determine the answer.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
As of November 15, 2024, Larry Ellison is ranked #2 on the Forbes Real-Time Billionaires List, with an estimated net worth of $228.4 billion, narrowly ahead of Jeff Bezos at $227.3 billion, and behind Elon Musk at $299.9 billion[5]. If the rankings remain static, this would resolve as **Yes**.

(c) **Brief scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
A plausible scenario for a "No" would involve Amazon’s stock outperforming Oracle’s during the remainder of 2024—possibly due to strong holiday sales or a positive financial report—allowing Jeff Bezos to overtake Ellison for the #2 spot. Likewise, a notable surge in Meta's or LVMH's valuation could allow Mark Zuckerberg or Bernard Arnault to leapfrog Ellison if Oracle’s stock stagnates or drops[5].

(d) **Brief scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
The most straightforward "Yes" scenario is for Oracle’s stock to remain stable or outperform Amazon, Meta, and LVMH through the end of December 2024. Even modest growth or no major negative news about Oracle (and/or mild negative movement in Amazon or Meta stock) would allow Ellison to maintain a slight edge over Bezos and Zuckerberg, preserving his #2 ranking[5].

## Rationale

In high-stakes billionaire rankings, the status quo is a robust predictor because large fortunes rarely change rankings swiftly without major market or company-specific events. Ellison’s recent performance shows he has held the #2 spot for about a month, following a period of volatility where he and Bezos swapped positions based on relatively small fluctuations in Oracle and Amazon stock prices[5]. The margin between Ellison and Bezos is currently about $1.1 billion—modest by their standards, and easily overcome in a single trading session if market sentiment changes.

However, barring a dramatic, sustained outperformance by Amazon (or a steep drop in Oracle), the current tech sector environment and historical end-of-year market stability slightly favor the status quo. Mark Zuckerberg, Bernard Arnault, and Warren Buffett presently trail by $20 billion or more—making it unlikely (though not impossible) for them to overtake the #2 spot without extraordinary market movement within six weeks[5].

Oracle’s exposure to AI trends and contract wins has previously buoyed Ellison’s fortune, and unless there is a major reversal or a significant positive surprise for Bezos (e.g., a historic Amazon stock rally), Ellison keeping the #2 spot is marginally more likely. That said, the gap is so narrow that even a modest move in big tech stocks could flip the rankings on any given day.

## Final Forecast

**Probability:** 60%

Ellison is slightly favored to remain ranked in the top 2 of the Forbes Real-Time Billionaires List on December 31, 2024, given the current status, his stable margin over Bezos, and typical market inertia in the absence of significant, unexpected events[5].
