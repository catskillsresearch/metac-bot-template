(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 36 days (from August 26, 2024, to October 1, 2024).

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be that "The Winds of Winter" is not released before October 1, 2024.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome: George R.R. Martin continues to work on the manuscript at his current pace, which by all accounts is not near completion. Publishing processes (editing, printing, distribution) typically take several months after manuscript completion, making a release before October 1, 2024, extremely unlikely even if he were to finish writing imminently.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome: George R.R. Martin has secretly completed the manuscript and the publisher has been preparing for a surprise release. Despite his public statements suggesting otherwise, he announces within days that the book is complete and will be available through an expedited publishing process before October 1, 2024.

Based on the available information, I assess that "The Winds of Winter" will not be released before October 1, 2024, with very high confidence.

First, the most recent information from August 2024 explicitly states there is no official release date, with Martin himself indicating the book is "not done yet" and still "months away" from completion[4]. This alone makes an October 1, 2024 release virtually impossible given standard publishing timelines.

Second, Martin has a well-established pattern of missing deadlines for this particular book. Fans have been waiting for approximately 13 years since the previous volume[1], and despite periodic updates, the completion date has consistently been pushed back. This historical pattern strongly suggests that any optimistic timeline should be viewed with extreme skepticism.

Third, experts and fan sites tracking the book's progress estimate the earliest possible release would be late 2025 or 2026[5]. One source explicitly states: "All I can say is that it won't be coming out in 2024"[5]. This assessment comes from those who closely follow Martin's progress and understand the publishing process.

Fourth, Martin himself has indicated that "When Winds of Winter is done, the word will not trickle out, there WILL be a big announcement"[2]. As of August 26, 2024, no such announcement has occurred, which would be necessary with only 36 days remaining before October 1.

The publishing process typically requires months of editing, production, printing, and distribution after a manuscript is complete. With Martin still writing as of August 2024, and no announcement of completion, the likelihood of the book being available for purchase (not pre-order) on Amazon before October 1 is extremely low.

While there is always a small possibility of a surprise announcement and expedited publishing process, this would be unprecedented in the industry for a book of this magnitude and contradicts all available evidence about the current state of the manuscript.

Probability: 1%
