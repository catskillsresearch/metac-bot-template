(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
As of July 23, 2024, there are 69 days until September 30, 2024, when the question will be resolved based on NHC data.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
Currently, only one major hurricane (Beryl) has occurred in the 2024 Atlantic season. If no further major hurricanes form by September 30, the outcome would be **No**[4].

(c) **Scenario for a No outcome:**  
The season proves less active than forecasted, with only three or four major hurricanes forming by September 30—fewer than the five required. This could occur if atmospheric conditions unexpectedly suppress storm formation or intensification (e.g., increased wind shear, unexpected ocean cooling), despite warm ocean temperatures and La Niña favoring more storms.

(d) **Scenario for a Yes outcome:**  
The season tracks with or exceeds established forecasts from CSU and NOAA, which call for 4–7 and 5 major hurricanes, respectively, for the full season[1][3][5]. Multiple major hurricanes develop during the climatological peak (August–September)—a typical pattern in very active years. At least four additional major hurricanes form before September 30, bringing the season total to five or more.

## Rationale

- The **climatological peak** of Atlantic hurricane activity is mid-August through late September, meaning the vast majority of major hurricanes in active years form during the remaining two months before the deadline.
- **All reputable forecasts** for 2024 (NOAA, CSU, Allianz) predict a much higher-than-average number of major hurricanes, with most ranges including at least five, reflecting high ocean heat and supportive atmospheric conditions[1][3][5].
- As of July 23, only one major hurricane has occurred, which is a lower count than some of the most hyperactive recent years at this date, but still exceptionally early for a Category 5 (Beryl)[4].
- The probability of four more major hurricanes forming before September 30 is tightly linked to whether the season meets the high end of the forecasted activity, and especially whether the season’s peak delivers typical or above-typical results.

**Historical perspective:**  
In similarly forecasted hyperactive years (e.g., 2005, 2017, 2020), the majority of major hurricanes formed between August and September. With “major hurricanes” defined as Category 3+, it is typical for most such storms to cluster in this peak window.

**Downside risk:**  
Forecasts, while “well above average,” are not guarantees. In some active forecasted years, a mix of unfavorable conditions or storm tracks could reduce the number of storms that reach major hurricane intensity before September 30.

**Weighting the status quo:**  
Given one major hurricane to date, four more must form in the next two months. While forecasts strongly favor an active season, and the coming period is climatologically primed for major hurricane formation, this is not a certainty. The single most probable outcome is more than one but less than five major hurricanes; however, this year’s conditions and modeling suggest a higher risk than usual of reaching five or more.
