(a) **Time until the outcome is known:**  
The outcome will be known when Similarweb releases its Top Websites Ranking update for March 2025, which should be published in early March 2025. As of today (May 6, 2025), this update is already available, but the search results provided do not include the relevant global ranking data for chatgpt.com or wikipedia.org in March 2025.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
As of February 2025, chatgpt.com was ranked #6 globally[1]. Wikipedia.org has historically been ranked within the global top 10, commonly just above or below chatgpt.com, but the exact position in February 2025 is not documented in the available sources. If the trend holds and no dramatic shifts occur, it is probable that both sites remain close in ranking, with wikipedia.org typically maintaining a very stable position in the top 10.

(c) **Scenario for a No outcome:**  
A No outcome occurs if wikipedia.org retains a higher global rank than chatgpt.com in the March 2025 Similarweb update. This could happen if:
- Wikipedia.org's overall traffic remains steady or increases slightly, keeping it ahead of chatgpt.com.
- Chatgpt.com's traffic plateaus or experiences only marginal growth, failing to surpass Wikipedia's ranking.

(d) **Scenario for a Yes outcome:**  
A Yes outcome happens if chatgpt.com overtakes wikipedia.org in the global ranking. This requires:
- Continued rapid growth of chatgpt.com's web traffic, pushing it to surpass Wikipedia.org.
- Wikipedia.org remaining stable or experiencing a slight dip, allowing chatgpt.com to move ahead in rank.

## Probabilistic Rationale

Given the most recent concrete information, chatgpt.com had reached #6 globally by February 2025, which demonstrates strong momentum and rapid growth[1]. Historically, Wikipedia.org rarely drops out of the global top 10, usually holding positions between #5-#7. However, because the explicit rank of wikipedia.org for February or March 2025 is unavailable, we cannot verify whether chatgpt.com had already overtaken Wikipedia, or remains just below or above it.

Website rankings, especially for sites near the top, are generally stable but can be sensitive to sudden surges (as seen with chatgpt.com recently). Since web traffic growth tends to slow as sites get larger and as competition increases in the upper echelons of global rankings, the status quo—Wikipedia ahead of or neck-and-neck with chatgpt.com—should be slightly favored. However, considering chatgpt.com's strong upward trajectory, the chance of a crossover is nontrivial.

Most forecasters would place extra weight on the status quo due to the general stability at the top of Similarweb’s rankings, but would adjust upward for the likelihood of chatgpt.com’s rapid ascent.

## Final Forecast

Probability: **55%**

This reflects a slight edge to chatgpt.com overtaking wikipedia.org, driven by its rapid growth and momentum, but acknowledges the resilience and stability of Wikipedia’s global traffic and rank. The outcome is close to even odds due to the lack of definitive rank data for Wikipedia in February or March 2025, with a small bias toward change given chatgpt.com's recent trajectory.
