(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
The August 2024 US Core CPI data will be released by the BLS on September 11, 2024[2]. As of August 22, 2024, there are about 20 days left until the outcome is known.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
The most recent month-over-month increase in Core CPI was 0.2% in July 2024, following a 0.1% increase in June[4]. For much of 2024, core inflation has been showing moderate, stable readings. Recent professional forecasts expect a further moderation but not a dramatic drop[1]. Therefore, if recent trends continue and no significant economic shocks occur, the status quo expectation would be another 0.2% increase.

(c) **Scenario that results in a No outcome:**  
A "No" would occur if the reported Core CPI MoM change for August 2024 is not 0.2%—that is, it is either 0.1%, 0.3%, or any other value once rounded. This could happen if, for example:
- Cooling in housing or shelter costs (e.g., rents flatten or fall) leads to a weaker reading,
- Service sector prices unexpectedly stabilize or decline,
- There is a broader downturn in consumer demand, perhaps due to labor market deterioration, leading to less price pressure,
- Or, conversely, if there is a sudden upward shock in core categories (like insurance, medical, or rents), the reading could jump past 0.2%.

(d) **Scenario that results in a Yes outcome:**  
A "Yes" would result if the seasonally adjusted Core CPI MoM change is exactly 0.2% as reported and rounded by the BLS. This would most likely occur if:
- Housing/shelter costs remain sticky but don’t accelerate,
- Service sector inflation continues at recent modest rates,
- There are no major surprises in core goods prices,
- And labor market and monetary policy trends continue as seen in July.

## Rationale

The July 2024 Core CPI was 0.2%, in line with both market expectations and recent professional forecasts. Quarter-over-quarter and annual forecasts from the Survey of Professional Forecasters (as of August 9, 2024) show a slow glide toward the Fed’s target, with core CPI for Q3 2024 (which includes August) expected at 2.6% annualized—roughly 0.21% per month if growth is steady[1]. Forecasts for the broader quarter and general economic expectations point to continued moderation, but not a rapid collapse or acceleration.

Recent inflationary drivers—housing, insurance, some services—remain persistent, but there are also offsetting factors: the labor market has softened, and there is emerging evidence of slower wage growth, both of which could cap further increases in core inflation[4]. While the monthly CPI data is inherently volatile and subject to small shocks, the lack of major new developments or policy surprises as of late August supports the persistence of current trends.

Good forecasting practice gives additional weight to the most recent outcome and moderate expectations, especially in a period of slow economic change. Currently, there is little evidence of a large enough shift to move the MoM figure definitively off 0.2%, up or down.

**Probability: 60%**

- This probability leans toward "Yes" (0.2%) as the most likely single outcome, reflecting the inertia in recent inflation data, professional forecasts, and the lack of any disruptive new information[1][4][5]. However, month-to-month CPI is volatile, so there remains material uncertainty around the precise figure.
