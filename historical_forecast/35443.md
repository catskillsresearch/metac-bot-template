(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  
As of May 6, 2025, the 97th Academy Awards ceremony has already taken place (scheduled for March 2, 2025), so the result should be available and public.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
Based on the official Oscars website, the winner of the 2025 Oscar for Best International Feature Film is *I'm Still Here* (Brazil)[1].

(c) **Scenario for an unexpected outcome:**  
An unexpected outcome would involve either a clerical or reporting error leading to the wrong announcement, or a last-minute disqualification or rule change causing the Oscar to be awarded to a different film, or perhaps the emergence of a previously overlooked contender due to unforeseen events. However, given that the results are already official, this scenario is extremely unlikely.

## Rationale

Good forecasters rely on timely, credible, and direct sources—here, the official Oscars site lists *I'm Still Here* (Brazil) as the winner for Best International Feature Film at the 97th Academy Awards[1]. While pre-ceremony analysis highlighted "Emilia Pérez" as a top contender and predicted it as a likely winner, the actual outcome at the ceremony is the authoritative resolution.

Given this, the moderate probability typically left for upsets and surprises is negligible—the status quo outcome is locked by official Academy results. Almost no weight remains on alternatives.

## Final Probabilities

Emilia Perez: 0%  
I'm Still Here: 99%  
Another movie: 1%

*I'm Still Here* is the 2025 Oscar winner for Best International Feature Film, according to the Oscars official record[1]. All available evidence supports this outcome as final.
