(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
Roughly 1.5 months, as today is November 12, 2024, and the question resolves on December 30, 2024.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changes:**  
The cheapest new Tesla Model 3 is listed at $44,130 for the 2025 model year, which is **above** the $43,000 threshold. Therefore, the status quo outcome is **No**—the price will not be under $43,000[5].

(c) **Scenario for a No outcome:**  
Tesla maintains current pricing with the cheapest Model 3 at or above $44,130, having eliminated the Standard Range trim. No significant end-of-year price reductions occur. The cheapest Model 3 listed on Tesla’s website on December 30, 2024, remains at or above $43,000[5][3].

(d) **Scenario for a Yes outcome:**  
Tesla initiates a price cut—possibly as part of an end-of-quarter or end-of-year push—bringing the entry price for the Model 3 back below $43,000. This is plausible given Tesla’s history of making abrupt price changes, especially to boost sales numbers at quarter or year-end, but would require a price drop of at least $1,130 from the current $44,130 base price[5][3].

## Rationale

Tesla’s track record includes frequent and sometimes significant price adjustments, often in response to demand fluctuations, inventory, or market dynamics. However, the recent elimination of the Standard Range trim has set a new, higher entry point for the Model 3 at $44,130. For the price to dip below $43,000, Tesla would need to either:

- Reintroduce a cheaper trim (unlikely in such a short window), or  
- Apply a discount of at least $1,130 to the base model.

While end-of-year price adjustments are not unprecedented, the magnitude needed here is notable and would require a strategic rationale from Tesla’s management. Additionally, the current automotive environment shows ongoing inflationary pressures and rising EV production costs, which further reduce the likelihood of a substantial price cut. No recent news or leaks suggest that Tesla is imminently planning such a move.

Given the above and weighing the status quo heavily—as is best practice in forecasting, since most things do not change quickly—the most likely scenario is that the Model 3 remains priced at or above $44,130 on December 30, 2024.
