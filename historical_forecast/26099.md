(a) Time left until outcome: Approximately 5 months (from May 2025, the current date, until September 30, 2024). However, since the current date (May 6, 2025) is actually past the resolution date (September 30, 2024), the outcome should already be known. Based on the search results provided, which only go up to July 2024, I don't have information past that date.

(b) Status quo outcome: No new nuclear-armed state has emerged. The world remains with nine nuclear-armed states: the United States, Russia, the United Kingdom, France, China, India, Pakistan, Israel, and North Korea.

(c) Scenario resulting in a No outcome: The high technical barriers to developing nuclear weapons, combined with international monitoring and pressure, prevent any new country from successfully developing and testing a nuclear weapon. Countries with potential nuclear ambitions continue their programs in secret but don't reach the testing phase by the deadline.

(d) Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome: A country that has been secretly developing nuclear capabilities for years completes final preparations and conducts a nuclear test, which is detected by international monitoring systems. Alternatively, a country publicly announces a successful nuclear test as a strategic move to enhance its security position amid heightened global tensions.

## Rationale

Looking at the available evidence, there are several strong reasons to believe the status quo of nine nuclear powers will persist through September 30, 2024:

First, developing nuclear weapons is an extraordinarily complex technical challenge requiring significant resources, specialized expertise, and time. The search results don't indicate any country is on the verge of joining the nuclear club in the immediate future[3]. While there are concerns about proliferation, there's no specific evidence pointing to an imminent new nuclear power.

Second, the international monitoring system designed to detect nuclear tests is highly sophisticated. The International Monitoring System (IMS) of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty has global coverage that would likely detect any significant nuclear test[3]. This creates a strong deterrent against testing for countries trying to develop nuclear weapons secretly.

Third, the timeframe is extremely short. With the information available only up to July 2024 and the resolution date being September 30, 2024, there are only about 2-3 months remaining. The development cycle for nuclear weapons typically spans years, not months.

The search results focus primarily on the modernization of existing nuclear arsenals rather than new proliferation threats. All nine current nuclear powers are upgrading or modernizing their arsenals, with the United States embarking on a massive modernization program that could cost up to $2 trillion over the next 30 years[3]. The focus on modernization rather than new proliferation suggests that the status quo of nine nuclear states is likely to persist in the very near term.

While there are concerning developments in the nuclear landscape, including deteriorating arms control frameworks and regional tensions[1][2], these factors are more likely to influence long-term proliferation prospects rather than trigger a new nuclear state within the next few months.

It's worth noting that nuclear proliferation often happens in response to regional security dynamics. Currently, the most concerning regions (Middle East, Korean Peninsula) have established patterns of deterrence, and while tensions exist, there's no indication of an imminent breakthrough by a new nuclear power.

The status quo has considerable inertia. Since North Korea's first nuclear test in 2006, no new country has joined the nuclear club. This 18-year period without a new nuclear power suggests that the barriers to entry remain significant.
