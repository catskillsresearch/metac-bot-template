(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  
There are approximately 32 days remaining until April 1, 2025.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
As of February 28, 2025, neither U.S. Steel nor Nippon Steel has filed an SEC Form 8-K announcing the termination or abandonment of the merger agreement. Despite President Biden’s block of the deal in January and ongoing political opposition, both companies are actively pursuing legal remedies and exploring alternative deal structures. The deadline to abandon the deal set by CFIUS has been extended to June 18, 2025, well beyond the April 1 question window[4]. Thus, under the status quo and barring a new development, the merger will *not* formally collapse before April 1, resulting in a **No** outcome.

(c) **Scenario that results in a No outcome:**  
- The legal challenge against Biden’s block proceeds without a resolution or decisive court ruling before April 1.
- The companies continue negotiations with stakeholders, possibly pursuing alternative arrangements, but do not file a Form 8-K to terminate or abandon the merger before April 1.
- The CFIUS and regulatory review processes continue past April 1, as allowed by the extended deadline[4].

(d) **Scenario that results in a Yes outcome:**  
- A court issues a prompt, unfavorable ruling for Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel in March, causing one or both parties to file a Form 8-K terminating or abandoning the merger before April 1.
- Either company, in light of changing political or regulatory assessments, unilaterally decides to terminate the deal and announces it via an 8-K before April 1.
- Some external factor (e.g., a major market shift, unexpected new regulatory intervention, or a breakdown in negotiations) prompts a formal abandonment of the merger before April 1.

---

## Rationale

- The official extension of the CFIUS-imposed abandonment deadline to June 18, 2025, indicates both regulatory authorities and the companies expect any formal decision about abandoning the merger to occur after April 1[4].
- Both companies have made clear they remain committed to seeking a path forward and have not signaled imminent abandonment[1][4][5].
- The expedited court case could, in theory, produce a rapid and decisive outcome, but as of February 28, briefing is not due to conclude until March 17; even then, court rulings and the subsequent company action could easily fall after April 1[1].
- Political pressure is high and scenarios exist where the deal collapses, but the path of least resistance—given the extended deadlines and current company positions—is for the merger to *not* collapse in the next 32 days.

## Final Forecast

Probability: **85%**

The probability that the U.S. Steel/Nippon Steel merger will *not* collapse before April 1, 2025 (i.e., **No** outcome), is 85%.
