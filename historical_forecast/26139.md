(a) **Time remaining until outcome known:**  
The 2024 Paris Olympic marathon events are scheduled for August 10 (women’s) and August 11 (men’s), so as of July 15, 2024, there’s about 3–4 weeks until the outcome is known.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
Historically, Kalenjin men are strong favorites and often win the men’s Olympic marathon, while women’s races are more open with strong competition from Ethiopia, Japan, and others. The default, most likely scenario is that a Kalenjin athlete wins the men’s race, with only moderate probability for the women’s, so the baseline is "No"—that both winners will have Kalenjin roots, though the probability is substantial[5].

(c) **Scenario for a No outcome:**  
A No outcome occurs if either (or both) of the marathon races are won by an athlete with no Kalenjin ancestry. This is most likely in the women’s event, where Ethiopian or Japanese runners, who are highly competitive internationally, could win, or if an unexpected winner with no Kalenjin background prevails due to race dynamics, weather, or health issues affecting the favorites[5].

(d) **Scenario for a Yes outcome:**  
A Yes outcome would require both the men’s and women’s marathons to be won by athletes with Kalenjin origin. This could happen if top Kalenjin male marathoners like Eliud Kipchoge, or their peers, and a leading Kenyan (or naturalized Kalenjin) woman win their respective races, which is plausible given their historical performance and depth in these events[2][4][5].

## Rationale

The Kalenjin are disproportionately successful in the men’s marathon—recent golds, including 2016 and 2020, were won by Eliud Kipchoge, a Kalenjin[4]. It’s reasonable to expect a Kalenjin winner in the men's event again, though there is competition, including Ethiopia’s Sisay Lemma, and upsets can happen[3].  
On the women’s side, while Kalenjin and, more broadly, Kenyan women have become more competitive, the field is more internationally diverse. Ethiopian women especially are strong marathon contenders, and the recent trend doesn’t show the same level of dominance as among the men[5]. There are also strong athletes from other countries who could cause surprises.

No major changes to selection or eligibility have occurred for 2024, so historical trends are likely to continue[5]. The probability is therefore higher than random chance but far from certain, with the largest risk being the increasing competitiveness of non-Kalenjin women in the marathon[5].

Given that good forecasters weight the status quo heavily, and considering the open nature of the women’s race, the probability that both winners will have Kalenjin roots is moderate but not high.
