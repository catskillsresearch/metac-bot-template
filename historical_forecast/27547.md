(a) Time left until outcome: 38 days (August 23, 2024 to September 30, 2024)

(b) Status quo outcome: The CDC's assessment remains at "Very Low" (current level) or rises to "Low" or "Moderate" but does not exceed "Moderate"

(c) No outcome scenario: The CDC updates its risk assessment but determines that while there is some increased risk from clade I mpox in Africa, the combination of US preparedness, absence of domestic clade I cases, and effectiveness of public health measures keeps the overall risk to the general US population at "Moderate" or below.

(d) Yes outcome scenario: Clade I mpox cases are detected in the US and begin spreading in communities, leading the CDC to assess both a higher likelihood of infection and more severe potential impact, resulting in an overall risk assessment above "Moderate" (High or Very High) before October 1.

Based on the current information available, I believe the probability of the CDC's mpox risk assessment exceeding "Moderate" before October 1, 2024, is quite low for several reasons:

First, the CDC explicitly stated on August 7, 2024, that "the risk of clade I mpox spreading to the United States is very low at this time"[2]. This assessment was made even after awareness of the increasing cases in Africa, suggesting a cautious but not alarmed stance.

Second, there are currently no known cases of clade I mpox in the United States[1][5]. While the 2022-2023 outbreak (clade IIb) continues at a low but steady pace, this variant has not triggered a risk assessment above "Very Low" as of July 8, 2024.

Third, the US government has been preparing since December 2023 and has described itself as "well prepared to rapidly detect, contain, and manage clade I cases should they occur domestically"[1]. This includes expanded surveillance, testing capacity, and vaccination recommendations.

The European CDC's risk assessment from August 16, 2024, rates the overall risk to the EU/EEA general population as "low"[4]. While not directly applicable to the US, this suggests that other major health authorities are also not assessing extremely elevated risk levels for Western countries.

For the CDC to raise its risk assessment above "Moderate," we would likely need to see:
1. Introduction and sustained community transmission of clade I mpox in the US
2. Evidence that the transmission rate is significantly higher than expected
3. Indications that the impact of infection is more severe than anticipated

With only 38 days until the resolution deadline, there is limited time for such a scenario to unfold. Even if cases were detected in the US, the CDC would likely maintain a "Moderate" or lower assessment for the general population while possibly issuing higher risk assessments for specific subgroups.

The status quo bias is particularly relevant here. The CDC tends to change risk assessments gradually in response to clear evidence. Given that the current assessment is "Very Low," moving beyond "Moderate" would represent a substantial jump requiring compelling new data.

While the WHO's declaration of a PHEIC on August 14, 2024[5] does indicate serious global concern, it's worth noting that previous PHEICs for other diseases have not automatically resulted in the CDC assessing "High" or "Very High" risks for the US general population.
