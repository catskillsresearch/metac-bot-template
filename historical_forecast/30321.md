(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 41 days (from November 20, 2024 to December 31, 2024).

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be "No" - based on the current drought conditions in South Carolina, it appears that less than 300,000 residents are currently living in drought areas.

(c) A scenario resulting in a No outcome: If winter precipitation patterns align with typical La Niña conditions, South Carolina could receive adequate rainfall through December, reducing drought coverage or maintaining it at levels below the threshold where 300,000 residents would be affected.

(d) A scenario resulting in a Yes outcome: If the current expanding drought trend continues and intensifies through December, particularly affecting densely populated areas of South Carolina, the number of residents living in drought conditions could exceed 300,000 by December 31, 2024.

As of November 2024, South Carolina is experiencing increasing drought conditions, with 11% of the state in moderate drought[5]. The Southeast region as a whole has seen a significant increase in drought coverage, rising from 38.3% to 65.2% between October and November 2024[3]. This upward trend is concerning, but we need to carefully consider several factors to make an accurate forecast.

The current drought pattern in South Carolina appears to be part of a larger regional trend. The state has experienced fluctuating conditions throughout 2024, with alternating periods of drought and excessive rainfall, especially from June through November[3]. October 2024 was particularly dry in parts of the region, contributing to the expansion of drought conditions we're seeing now.

Looking at historical patterns, drought in the Southeast tends to be dynamic rather than static. While the current trend shows expansion, we must consider potential mitigating factors. The upcoming winter season could bring changes in precipitation patterns. However, the 2024-2025 winter outlook, influenced by La Niña conditions, suggests a likelihood of continued or worsening drought across the southern United States, including South Carolina[5].

The population distribution in South Carolina is an important consideration. The state has approximately 5.3 million residents, with higher population densities in urban areas such as Charleston, Columbia, and Greenville. If the drought expands to include these more densely populated regions, the number of affected residents could increase rapidly. However, if drought remains concentrated in less populated rural areas, the population threshold of 300,000 might not be reached.

It's worth noting that back in November 2023, 48% of South Carolina was experiencing moderate or worse drought conditions[5]. This historical reference point suggests that widespread drought in the state is not unprecedented, though current conditions (11% in moderate drought) are less severe than they were at this time last year.

The status quo bias is important here - while drought conditions are expanding, they're doing so from a relatively low baseline (11% in moderate drought). For 300,000 residents (approximately 5.7% of the state's population) to be affected by December 31, the drought would need to either expand significantly in geographic coverage or specifically impact more densely populated areas.

Given the current trends, the La Niña influence, and the short timeframe (41 days), I believe there's a moderate probability that South Carolina will have 300,000 or more residents living in drought by December 31, 2024. The expanding drought pattern is concerning, but the baseline is still relatively low, and weather patterns can change rapidly.

Probability: 45%
