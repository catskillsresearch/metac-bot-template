(a) Time left until the outcome is known: 62 days (July 31, 2024 to September 30, 2024)

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: RFK Jr. would have approximately 1.7 million followers, far short of the 15 million threshold.

(c) Scenario resulting in a No outcome: RFK Jr.'s follower growth continues at its current pace, gaining perhaps 1-2 million additional followers by September 30, but falling well short of 15 million. This could be due to limited campaign visibility, lack of viral content, or the attention being primarily focused on the major party candidates Trump and Harris.

(d) Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome: RFK Jr. experiences an unprecedented viral surge on TikTok, perhaps triggered by a major campaign moment, controversial statement, or endorsement from influential TikTok creators. This would need to generate approximately 13.3 million new followers in just 62 days, requiring a growth rate far exceeding what even Trump or Harris achieved with their initial platform launches.

To forecast this question effectively, I need to analyze RFK Jr.'s current TikTok presence, growth trends, and potential catalysts that could dramatically increase his follower count.

Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has maintained a TikTok presence since at least May 2023, with his account currently having 1.7 million followers[4][5]. This represents modest growth over more than a year on the platform. By comparison, Donald Trump gained 5.6 million followers within a week of joining TikTok, and Kamala Harris gained 2.8 million followers within days of launching her account[4].

The data shows that despite RFK Jr. being on the platform longer than either major party candidate, his follower growth has remained relatively slow and steady. Even more telling, when Trump joined TikTok, he gained 3.2 million followers in just 24 hours - nearly double RFK Jr.'s total follower count accumulated over more than a year[4].

Looking at engagement metrics, RFK Jr.'s videos have received fewer views and likes compared to the major candidates. CBS News reported that Biden's campaign videos (before Harris became the presumptive nominee) received half as many likes and three-quarters as many views as Kennedy's, despite Kennedy being on the platform much longer[4]. While Kennedy performs relatively well with young voters, with 18% of those under 30 supporting him in a May poll, this hasn't translated to explosive TikTok growth[4].

For RFK Jr. to reach 15 million followers by September 30, he would need to gain approximately 13.3 million new followers in 62 days. This would require a daily growth rate of about 214,500 new followers consistently for two months. Even Trump, with his massive name recognition and strong social media presence, didn't maintain that pace after his initial surge.

There are no indications of any upcoming campaign events or strategy shifts that would trigger such unprecedented growth. While RFK Jr. does appeal to some younger voters who use TikTok frequently (26% of his supporters use TikTok often, compared to 15% for Biden and 14% for Trump), this demographic advantage hasn't previously translated to follower counts approaching what would be needed[4].

Historical precedent also weighs against such a dramatic increase. RFK Jr. has been active on the platform throughout his campaign without experiencing viral surges of the magnitude required. In February 2024, his account faced controversy when it was revealed that comments made from his official account on an OnlyFans model's video in 2022 were attributed to a young campaign staffer who had previously owned the account[3]. Even this controversy did not result in a follower surge approaching what would be needed.

Given the current growth trajectory, the large gap between current followers and the target, the lack of catalysts for explosive growth, and the historical precedent of his TikTok performance, reaching 15 million followers by September 30 appears highly unlikely.

Probability: 2%
