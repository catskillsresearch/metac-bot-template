(a) Time until outcome is known: 8 days from now (August 15) until September 15, 2024, with final resolution by September 26, 2024.

(b) Status quo outcome: Based on recent data, China has already demonstrated the capability and willingness to send more than 40 aircraft into Taiwan's ADIZ in a single day, with the most recent example being 56 aircraft on July 10, 2024.

(c) No outcome scenario: No major political provocations or military exercises occur during the period. China reduces military pressure in response to international diplomatic efforts or to focus resources elsewhere. The historical pattern of large incursions being tied to specific events holds, and no such events materialize during this timeframe.

(d) Yes outcome scenario: China conducts planned military exercises in response to perceived provocations from Taiwan or the US. The ongoing escalation following President Lai's inauguration continues or intensifies. China uses the period to demonstrate military strength ahead of a significant political anniversary or international event.

Based on the recent data and trends in Chinese military activity near Taiwan, I assess there is a significant probability that more than 40 Chinese aircraft will violate Taiwan's ADIZ in a single day between August 15 and September 15, 2024.

## Analysis of Historical Patterns

Taiwan has experienced a substantial increase in ADIZ violations in recent months. June 2024 saw at least 305 violations, making it the second-highest monthly total on record, only behind August 2022 when China responded to Nancy Pelosi's visit with large-scale military exercises[3]. The data indicates that in the first ten days of July 2024 alone, there were numerous violations, including one day (July 10) with 56 aircraft, which tied the all-time record from October 2021.

The frequency and scale of ADIZ violations have noticeably increased since President Lai Ching-te's inauguration on May 20, 2024. In May 2024, there were 289 violations, with 82 occurring on May 23-24 during the PRC's Joint Sword 2024A exercise[3]. This pattern suggests a deliberate pressure campaign targeting the new Taiwanese administration, which China has labeled as separatist.

## Factors Increasing Probability

**Recent Record-Setting Activity**: The fact that China has already sent 56 aircraft in a single day as recently as July 10, 2024, demonstrates both capability and willingness to conduct large-scale incursions[3].

**Post-Inauguration Pressure Campaign**: China has significantly increased military pressure following Lai Ching-te's inauguration, with ADIZ violations rising from an average of 6 per day before the inauguration to 10 per day after. This indicates a sustained campaign rather than isolated incidents[3].

**Established Pattern of Large Incursions**: Large-scale incursions of >40 aircraft are typically triggered by political events or major exercises. The time period in question (August 15-September 15) could coincide with planned exercises or responses to diplomatic developments.

## Factors Decreasing Probability

**Exceptional Nature of Large Incursions**: Despite the upward trend, days with >40 aircraft remain relatively rare and usually tied to specific events. Without a known trigger during the forecast window, such massive incursions might not occur.

**Resource Constraints**: Maintaining high-intensity air operations requires significant resources and could be difficult to sustain over extended periods without specific strategic objectives.

**International Pressure**: Potential diplomatic efforts to reduce tensions in the Taiwan Strait could lead to a temporary reduction in military activities.

## Status Quo Considerations

While the frequency of ADIZ violations has indeed increased dramatically, the status quo still shows that days with more than 40 aircraft remain exceptional events. In April 2024, reports indicated 17 Chinese combat aircraft entering Taiwan's ADIZ in a single day[5], and even with the escalation following Lai's inauguration, most days see fewer than 40 aircraft.

However, the status quo has clearly shifted toward more aggressive posturing by China, with June and May 2024 representing the second and third-highest monthly totals on record[3]. The record-tying incursion of 56 aircraft on July 10, 2024, suggests that the threshold of 40+ aircraft has become more attainable in the current political climate.

## Timing Considerations

The August 15-September 15 window falls approximately 3-4 months after Lai's inauguration. Historical patterns suggest that China often continues or even intensifies pressure campaigns over such timeframes rather than reducing them, especially when dealing with administrations they consider hostile.

Given these factors, and weighing the status quo appropriately, I assess that there is a higher than even probability that China will send more than 40 aircraft into Taiwan's ADIZ on at least one day during the specified period.

Probability: 65%
