(a) Time until outcome: 2 months, 15 days (from July 15, 2024 to September 30, 2024)

(b) Status quo outcome: China does not control any part of Taiwan, which continues to function as a self-governing entity.

(c) No outcome scenario: Tensions remain high with continued military exercises, economic pressure, and diplomatic isolation attempts by China, but no actual invasion or transfer of control occurs before September 30, 2024.

(d) Yes outcome scenario: China launches a rapid, successful military invasion of Taiwan, capturing at least half of the island's territory and population before September 30, 2024, or Taiwan's government unexpectedly agrees to reunification under pressure.

Based on the information available, I assess that the People's Republic of China will not control at least half of Taiwan before September 30, 2024, with very high confidence.

The expert surveys and forecasts from early 2024 indicate significant concern about tensions in the Taiwan Strait, but they do not suggest an imminent full-scale invasion. A CSIS survey showed that while 67% of U.S. experts and 57% of Taiwan experts believed a Taiwan Strait crisis was likely in 2024, the most anticipated escalatory actions were nonmilitary coercion or military exercises rather than blockades or invasions[3]. This indicates that even experts concerned about rising tensions did not expect a full takeover in 2024.

Metaculus forecasters, who have a strong track record in geopolitical predictions, estimated only a 29% chance of a "full-scale" blockade of Taiwan before 2030 and a 20% chance of a "full-scale" invasion before 2030[5]. Given that these probabilities are spread over a six-year timeframe, the likelihood of such events occurring specifically before September 30, 2024 would be significantly lower.

Several strategic factors make a successful invasion extremely unlikely in the near term:

1. Military logistics considerations suggest China would need substantial preparation time and favorable conditions for an invasion. Experts note that China would prefer to annex Taiwan without a war if possible[4].

2. The international environment remains unfavorable for China to take such drastic action, as it would likely trigger severe economic sanctions and potentially military responses from the United States and allies.

3. The May 2024 inauguration of Taiwan's new president has already passed without triggering an immediate invasion, despite concerns about China's response to the election results[3].

4. There is a strong status quo bias in international relations, particularly for such consequential actions. China has consistently employed a strategy of gradually increasing pressure rather than sudden, dramatic escalation.

The peaceful reunification scenario is also highly unlikely within this timeframe. Public opinion in Taiwan strongly favors maintaining the status quo or independence, with only about 6.7% supporting immediate unification according to cited polling. There are no signs of a dramatic shift in public sentiment that would enable a voluntary reunification before September 30, 2024.

China's current approach appears focused on long-term pressure through military exercises, economic measures, and information operations rather than immediate forceful takeover. While tensions are certainly high and growing, the timeline for potential conflict appears to extend well beyond September 2024, with some analysts focusing on 2027 as a more plausible timeframe for potential military action[4].
