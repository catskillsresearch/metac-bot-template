(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
From October 22, 2024, there are approximately 70 days left until January 1, 2025.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
As of October 2024, Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce are publicly not engaged, and their representatives have directly denied any engagement[2][3]. If no further developments occur, the outcome will be NO.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
No official engagement announcement is made by either Taylor Swift, Travis Kelce, or credible sources before January 1, 2025. The couple continues as they are, maintaining their relationship without confirming any engagement to the public[2][3].

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce, or their official representatives, publicly announce their engagement before January 1, 2025. This would be confirmed by major media outlets or direct statements from the couple[1][2][3].

## Rationale

The status quo is strongly supported by public denials of engagement from both representatives and major media sources as recently as October 2024[2][3]. While rumors and speculation have persisted throughout 2024, including apparent optimism from friends and insiders that an engagement could happen soon[1], there has been no credible confirmation or shift in the coupleâ€™s public position. Engagement rumors are common in high-profile relationships but rarely lead to sudden announcements without some substantiating leaks or circumstantial buildup.

Given roughly two months remain, and no official or credible signs point to an imminent engagement, the probability should heavily weight the status quo. Although an announcement remains possible, the best forecast is that, absent clear changes, no engagement will be announced before the deadline.

Probability: 25%
