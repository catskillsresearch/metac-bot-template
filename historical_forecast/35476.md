(a) Time left until outcome: The question asks whether NASA's SPHEREx space telescope will be launched before April 1, 2025. As of today (May 6, 2025), this date has already passed, so the outcome should be known.

(b) Status quo outcome: Based on the search results, the launch was originally scheduled for February 28, 2025, but was delayed multiple times. If nothing changed from the last reported schedule in the search results, the launch would have occurred on March 4, 2025, which is before April 1, 2025.

(c) Scenario for No outcome: A scenario that would result in a No outcome would be if additional technical issues or weather concerns caused further delays beyond April 1, 2025. For example, if during final testing, engineers discovered a critical issue with the spacecraft or launch vehicle that required significant time to address, pushing the launch date past April 1.

(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: A scenario that would result in a Yes outcome would be if the launch proceeded as planned on March 4, 2025, or even with minor additional delays that still allowed for launch before April 1, 2025. The search results indicate that as of February 28, 2025, NASA and SpaceX were targeting March 4 for the launch.

Looking at the available information, I can see a series of delays that occurred leading up to the planned launch:
- Originally targeted for late February 2025[3]
- Then specifically planned for February 28, 2025[1]
- Then delayed to March 2, 2025[5]
- Then delayed to March 4, 2025 to "evaluate launch vehicle hardware data"[2]

The search results show a pattern of relatively minor delays, shifting the launch date by a few days each time. The last reported target date was March 4, 2025, which is nearly a month before the April 1 deadline. While space launches frequently experience delays, the pattern here suggests relatively minor technical issues requiring days (not months) to resolve.

Given that the final reported launch date of March 4, 2025 provided nearly four weeks of buffer before the April 1 deadline, and considering that the delays had been relatively short (a few days each), it seems highly probable that the launch occurred before April 1. The mission appears to have been in the final stages of preparation, with the spacecraft already at the launch site undergoing final checks[4].

Without explicit confirmation of the actual launch date in the search results, I must rely on the trajectory of preparations and the pattern of delays. The status quo points strongly to a launch before April 1, 2025, as the preparations were well advanced and the delays had been relatively minor.

Probability: 85%
