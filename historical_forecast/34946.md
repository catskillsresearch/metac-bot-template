To answer this forecasting question, I'll start by analyzing the key parameters:

(a) Time left until outcome: From today (May 6, 2025) to the outcome determination date (April 1, 2025): The outcome has already been determined, as April 1, 2025, has passed. However, I'll approach this as if I were answering from the perspective of February 10, 2025, as indicated in the research assistant's report.

(b) Status quo outcome: As of February 10, 2025, the recall is active. If nothing changes, the status quo outcome would be "No" - the recall would remain active on April 1, 2025.

(c) Scenario for No outcome: The USDA could still be monitoring the effectiveness of the recall by April 1, 2025, especially if they're tracking whether all affected products have been recovered or if any adverse reactions have been reported. Regulatory processes might move slowly, or UP Products might face delays in providing sufficient documentation to satisfy FSIS requirements for closing the recall.

(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: Given the small volume of the recall (only 400 pounds) and the nature of the issue (undeclared allergen rather than contamination), UP Products could quickly address the labeling issue, recover affected products, and provide the necessary documentation to FSIS. The recall could then be closed before April 1, 2025.

## Analysis and Rationale

The UP Products recall announced on January 13, 2025, involved approximately 400 pounds of sausage products due to an undeclared soy allergen[1][5]. This is a relatively small recall compared to others, such as the DJ's Boudain recall mentioned in the research, which involved over 17,000 pounds of product.

Several factors suggest this recall might be resolved relatively quickly:

1. **Scale of the recall**: At only 400 pounds, this is a small amount of product to track and recover[1].

2. **Nature of the issue**: The recall is due to misbranding and an undeclared allergen (soy), not contamination or foodborne illness[1][5]. Allergen-related recalls typically involve correcting labeling rather than addressing production contamination.

3. **Limited distribution**: The products were only shipped to a restaurant and retail locations in Michigan, and a retail location in Wisconsin[1]. Limited distribution can make product recovery more manageable.

4. **Timeframe**: From the January 13 announcement to the April 1 cutoff date is approximately 2.5 months, which seems reasonable for resolving a relatively straightforward allergen labeling issue.

However, I must also consider factors that support the status quo (recall remaining active):

1. **Regulatory processes**: USDA recall processes can move slowly, with thorough verification required before officially closing a recall.

2. **Unknown recovery rate**: We don't have information on what percentage of affected products have been recovered, which is often a key factor in closing recalls.

3. **Possible complications**: If any allergic reactions were reported or if the company faced challenges in locating all affected products, this could delay closure.

The forecast should give weight to the status quo, as regulatory processes often take longer than expected. However, the specific characteristics of this recall (small volume, allergen issue rather than contamination, limited distribution) suggest it could be resolved more quickly than average.

Based on the available information, and weighing the factors that could accelerate or delay closure of this recall, I estimate that there is a moderate-to-high probability that this recall will be closed before April 1, 2025.

Probability: 65%
