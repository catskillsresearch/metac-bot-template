(a) **Time until outcome is known:**  
The outcome of the Liberal Party of Canada’s leadership election will be announced on March 9, 2025. From today (May 6, 2025), the contest has already concluded, and thus, the outcome should be known.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
As of late January 2025, Mark Carney was the frontrunner in party endorsements (52 to Chrystia Freeland’s 26) and led in the most recent poll (27% to 21% among Liberal voters). The race was widely characterized as a two-candidate contest between former central banker Mark Carney and former Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland, both high-profile figures with the fundraising and recognition to mount a serious bid. Other declared candidates were considered “long shots at best”[4]. Therefore, the status quo expectation is that Mark Carney would win the leadership.

(c) **Scenario for an unexpected outcome:**  
A scenario resulting in “Someone else” winning—despite Carney and Freeland’s prominence—would likely require a dramatic event such as a scandal, health incident, or withdrawal by both leading candidates. Alternatively, a late-entry consensus candidate or a surge in membership sign-ups orchestrated by a smaller campaign could deliver an upset. However, given fundraising requirements, party rules, and the consolidation of support and name recognition around Carney and Freeland, such a scenario is unlikely but not impossible[4].

## Rationale

Good forecasting practice places extra weight on the status quo and leading indicators, especially since political systems and party machinery tend to favor high-profile, well-organized, and well-resourced candidates. Mark Carney’s substantial lead in endorsements and polling, combined with his status as a political “heavy hitter,” sets clear expectations—especially with other potential strong candidates declining to run and lesser-known contenders described as “long shots at best”[4]. However, leadership races can have unpredictable elements, and internal party dynamics or late-campaign developments may affect the outcome.

Given the data up to February 3, 2025:
- Mark Carney is the status quo favorite.
- Chrystia Freeland, while prominent, trails notably in both endorsements and polling.
- The probability of a “Someone else” win remains low but nonzero, to account for unlikely but plausible disruptions, surprises, or a breakdown in the frontrunner’s campaign.

## Final Probabilities

Mark Carney: 75%  
Chrystia Freeland: 20%  
Someone else: 5%
