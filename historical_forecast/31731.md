(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  
The official percentage will be reported after the presidential election scheduled for January 26, 2025. Today is January 20, 2025, so there are approximately 6 days until the outcome is known.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
Based on recent electoral history, Lukashenko received 81.04% of the official vote in 2020[4]. Official results for previous elections have also consistently placed his percentage around 80%, regardless of documented public opposition and widespread allegations of fraud[4][2]. If these patterns, state control, and regime stability persist as in recent cycles, the most plausible status quo outcome is an official result for Lukashenko close to 81%.

(c) **Outcome if the current trend continued:**  
Over the last cycles, despite deepening repression and growing international isolation, the regime’s official numbers have not significantly shifted, even during the unprecedented 2020 protests[4][2]. Lukashenko retains full control of the electoral apparatus and no credible opposition is allowed on the ballot[5]. If these trends continue, the official result is likely to be within a few percentage points of the 2020 figure—most likely 80% to 83%. Small adjustments (up or down) might be used to suggest either modest reform or to assert overwhelming support.

(d) **Expectations of experts and markets:**  
Independent observers, analysts, and international media expect an election outcome similar to previous cycles—an official landslide for Lukashenko, regardless of actual public support[3][2][5]. No credible betting market exists for Belarusian outcomes due to the non-competitive, controlled nature of the vote. Political analysts generally forecast Lukashenko’s official share between 75% and 85%, with the most cited figure near 80%[4].

(e) **Unexpected scenario (low outcome):**  
A surprisingly low official percentage (for instance, below 70%) could arise if Lukashenko or his entourage sought a tactical shift—perhaps to feign reform or simulate “competition” to ease Western sanctions or legitimize the regime internationally. Alternatively, a severe regime fracture or coordinated internal elite dissent during the vote count could force a lower reported figure. Both scenarios are improbable under current conditions.

(f) **Unexpected scenario (high outcome):**  
A higher result (above 85%) might occur if the regime feels threatened, perceives the need to demonstrate even more dominance, or if the administrative elite seeks to send a message of unity to Moscow or internal hardliners. This could also happen if the opposition is further weakened or if the ballot is even more tightly controlled, with token candidates or larger numbers of invalid/disqualified ballots[5][2].
