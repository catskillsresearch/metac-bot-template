(a) Time left until outcome: 55 days (from May 6, 2025 until January 1, 2025)

Wait, there's confusion in the dates. Given that today is May 6, 2025, the outcome date of January 1, 2025 has already passed. However, based on the search results provided (which show content from 2024), I'll answer as if today were before January 1, 2025.

(b) Status quo outcome: No - Neither Elon Musk nor Dana White has been officially announced as having been offered a salaried federal position.

(c) Scenario for No outcome: Trump decides to keep Musk in an informal advisory capacity rather than offering him a paid position, perhaps due to potential conflicts of interest with Musk's business interests. No formal announcement of a salaried position is made before January 1, 2025.

(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: Trump formally announces Musk as Secretary of Government Efficiency or a similar titled position with a federal salary before January 1, 2025, making official what has been suggested in preliminary announcements.

## Analysis of Current Information

Based on the search results provided, there is strong evidence that Elon Musk is being considered for a position in the Trump administration. The search results indicate that Trump has pledged to make Musk a "secretary of federal 'cost-cutting'" and that Musk "has suggested he can find trillions of dollars in government spending to wipe out."[3] Another search result mentions that "Elon Musk will likely have influence in how the Trump Administration approaches automotive issues."[2]

However, there are several important points to consider:

1. While Musk is mentioned as a likely appointee, the search results do not explicitly confirm whether this would be a paid position or an unpaid advisory role.

2. The search results make no mention of Dana White being considered for any position within the Trump administration.

3. The most specific information comes from search result [3], which states Trump "has pledged to make South African-born Elon Musk, a vocal supporter of the Trump campaign, a secretary of federal 'cost-cutting'." This suggests a formal title that would likely be a paid position.

## Historical Context

Elon Musk has been a significant supporter of Trump's 2024 campaign, with search result [1] noting that "Musk has jumped into the 2024 US election with more gusto than any other naturalized American tech mogul" and that "he looks set to make a formal political debut this week with an assured cabinet level position should Trump take the White House."[1]

The search results also indicate that Musk "is now the second most important figure after Trump in the MAGA movement," suggesting his influence and likelihood of receiving a formal position.[1]

## Factors Affecting Probability

Several factors increase the probability of Musk receiving a paid position:
- His high-profile support for Trump
- Explicit mentions of a "secretary" position
- His stated ability to identify significant government spending cuts
- References to him making a "formal political debut"

Factors decreasing the probability:
- Potential conflicts with Musk's existing business interests (Tesla, SpaceX, X/Twitter)
- No explicit confirmation of salary in the search results
- The possibility that Musk might prefer an unpaid advisory role to avoid regulatory complications

## Status Quo Bias Consideration

As a forecaster, I must acknowledge that the status quo (no formal paid appointment) tends to persist unless there is strong evidence to the contrary. However, the search results provide substantial indications that Musk is likely to receive a formal position.

Given that Trump has explicitly pledged to make Musk a "secretary of federal 'cost-cutting'" and that Musk is described as making a "formal political debut," there is significant evidence pointing toward a formal, paid position rather than just an advisory role.

Probability: 80%
