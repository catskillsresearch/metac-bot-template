As a professional forecaster interviewing for a job, I'll analyze the available data and provide my forecast for the Q4 2024 US Corporate Profits from current production.

(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known:
Based on the search results, the BEA typically releases corporate profits data in their preliminary estimate report after the advance GDP estimate. The advance GDP estimate for Q4 2024 was released on January 30, 2025[4]. The preliminary corporate profits data should be published in late February or March 2025, which means we are likely looking at 2-4 weeks from today (May 6, 2025) before this outcome is known.

(b) The outcome if nothing changed:
If nothing changed from Q3 2024, we would see another decrease of $10.6 billion in profits from current production.

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued:
The recent pattern shows alternating quarters of increases and decreases in corporate profits. Q1 2024 saw a decrease of $21.1 billion, Q2 2024 had an increase of $57.6 billion, and Q3 2024 had a decrease of $10.6 billion. If this alternating pattern continues, Q4 2024 would likely show an increase, but the magnitude is uncertain.

(d) The expectations of experts and markets:
The search results don't provide specific expert forecasts for Q4 2024 corporate profits. However, the GDP data shows that real GDP increased at a rate of 2.3% in Q4 2024, which is a deceleration from 3.1% in Q3 2024[4]. The increase in GDP was primarily driven by consumer spending and government spending, partly offset by decreases in investment[4]. These factors suggest a mixed environment for corporate profits.

(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome:
A significant drop in corporate profits could occur if the decrease in investment seen in the GDP data reflects broader business uncertainty, leading to companies cutting costs and reducing margins. Additionally, if the 2.5% increase in core PCE price index (excluding food and energy)[4] indicates rising input costs that companies couldn't pass on to consumers, this would squeeze profit margins further.

(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome:
A substantial increase in profits could happen if the consumer spending growth reported in the GDP data translated into higher corporate revenues while companies maintained strict cost controls. Additionally, productivity data shows a 1.2% increase in labor productivity for Q4 2024[5], which could contribute to profit growth if companies managed to produce more with relatively stable labor costs.

Taking all these factors into consideration, and recognizing that corporate profits can be volatile and subject to various economic forces, here's my forecast:

Percentile 10: -$30 billion
Percentile 20: -$15 billion
Percentile 40: $5 billion
Percentile 60: $20 billion
Percentile 80: $35 billion
Percentile 90: $50 billion
