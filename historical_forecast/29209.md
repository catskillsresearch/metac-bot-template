(a) **Time Left Until Outcome Is Known**  
As of October 25, 2024, there are just over two months remaining before January 1, 2025. The question resolves on the date of any FOMC rate cut announcement made between September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2024.

(b) **Status Quo Outcome if Nothing Changes**  
The Federal Reserve announced its most recent rate cut on September 19, 2024, lowering the target range to 4.75%–5%[1][4]. There have been no further FOMC meetings or rate cuts announced since then, and no future meetings are scheduled before year-end according to the official FOMC calendar as of October 25, 2024[2]. If no unscheduled meeting or new announcement occurs before January 1, 2025, the outcome will be No.

(c) **Scenario for a 'No' Outcome**  
- The FOMC makes no further rate cut announcements between September 30, 2024, and January 1, 2025.
- The Fed maintains the current target range (4.75%–5%) through the remainder of the year.
- No extraordinary or unscheduled FOMC meetings are held that result in a rate cut announcement.

(d) **Scenario for a 'Yes' Outcome**  
- An unscheduled FOMC meeting is called in response to unexpected negative economic data or financial instability.
- The FOMC announces a further rate cut in a statement released before January 1, 2025.
- Scheduled or unscheduled communications (such as a press release or official minutes) from the FOMC announce a reduction in the target federal funds rate within the specified period.

## Rationale and Probability Assessment

The recent September 2024 rate cut was the first in four years, driven by slowing labor market indicators and improvements on inflation toward the Fed’s 2% target[1][4]. The FOMC’s statement and recent Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) indicated balanced risks, with projections for additional cuts mostly anticipated for 2025 rather than the remainder of 2024[1][4].

Analyst commentary and market expectations after September's cut suggest diminished odds of a further 2024 rate cut, particularly as some late-September data showed a stronger-than-expected labor market and persistent inflation[3][4]. The FOMC has no more scheduled meetings in the remainder of 2024; an additional cut could only come via an emergency, unscheduled meeting[2].

Historically, the Fed rarely calls unscheduled meetings unless confronted by acute financial or economic shocks. The current economic environment does not display clear signs of crisis as of late October 2024, making an additional cut before January unlikely under the status quo.

Given these factors, the base rate—the status quo—suggests that no further rate cut will be announced before January 1, 2025, unless new, significant negative developments arise. The probability of a 'No' outcome is therefore high, but not absolute, as low-probability shocks remain possible.
