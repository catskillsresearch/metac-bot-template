(a) **Time left until outcome known:**  
As of March 13, 2025, there are about 19 days until April 1, 2025, when the outcome regarding the EPA's ranking on the DOGE Agency Efficiency Leaderboard will be determined.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
As of the most recent public data (March 4, 2025), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was not ranked #1; the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) held the top spot for "Most Savings," with EPA behind at third place as of February 25, 2025[1][2].

(c) **Scenario for a No outcome:**  
If the EPA's cost-cutting measures are not implemented rapidly or are delayed in their full realization, or if another agency (such as HHS or ED) maintains or accelerates their own efficiency initiatives, the EPA will *not* move to #1 in total savings by April 1, 2025. Likewise, if DOGE's methodology or data reporting lags or does not reflect the EPA's planned 65% cuts within the month, the current leaders will likely persist at the top[1][2].

(d) **Scenario for a Yes outcome:**  
A "Yes" requires that the EPA's planned major cuts—reported as "65 – or so – percent"—are rapidly and fully implemented, and that these savings are recognized in DOGE's metrics before April 1, 2025. If these aggressive actions are reflected swiftly in official reporting, and if other agencies do not make equally dramatic cuts, the EPA could ascend to the #1 spot in total savings on the leaderboard[1][2].

## Rationale

Recent patterns show that the DOGE Agency Efficiency Leaderboard rankings are highly dynamic, with significant shifts occurring within weeks. For instance, the leader changed from the Department of Education (ED) to HHS in just one week in late February to early March 2025[1][2]. This volatility suggests the possibility of substantial changes in the short time before April 1, 2025.

The EPA has announced substantial cuts (65%), and if these are executed and *reflected* in the DOGE data promptly, the agency could leapfrog competitors. However, several uncertainties persist:
- The timeline for implementing and reporting these cuts is unclear.
- Other agencies are also actively pursuing cost savings.
- The DOGE leaderboard's calculation methodology for “Most Savings” is not fully transparent, so last-minute adjustments or reporting changes could shift rankings[2].

Given the current status (EPA not #1), the default, or status quo, outcome is "No." Historically, while changes can happen quickly, most of the time the current situation tends to persist unless there is clear, timely action—and visible evidence—that alters the underlying numbers. In forecasting, greater weight is given to the status quo absent verified, imminent, and large-scale change, but the fast-moving environment here increases the probability of an upset.

**Probability: 38%**

This reflects that while the EPA is a plausible contender for #1 by April 1, 2025, the majority likelihood remains that the EPA will *not* overtake the current leader in "Most Total Savings" unless the planned cuts are not only implemented but also clearly recorded and credited in DOGE's leaderboard data by the deadline[1][2].
