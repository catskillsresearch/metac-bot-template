(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
The question resolves on April 1, 2025. As today is May 6, 2025, this date has already passed. The window for new accusations closed over a month ago.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
As of the cutoff date, there is no public record or credible reporting that the United States has accused Russia of invading any country other than Ukraine during the relevant period[1][3][4].

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
No new U.S. government statement is made before April 1, 2025, accusing Russia of invading another country with ground forces. All official communications, news briefings, and reports continue to focus solely on the Russian invasion of Ukraine, with no expansion of accusations to other countries.

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
The U.S. government publicly accuses Russia—via statements from the White House, Department of State, or Department of Defense—of sending ground military forces into a country other than Ukraine without the consent of that country's government, and this is clearly reported in open sources before April 1, 2025.

## Rationale

Current and historical U.S. government statements and news coverage through early 2025 consistently reference only the Russian invasion of Ukraine, with no mention of an official accusation against Russia for invading any other country during this period[1][4]. The U.S. has maintained intense scrutiny of Russian actions, especially with regard to Ukraine, making it likely that any additional invasion would be rapidly publicized and condemned. Yet, no such accusation is documented in the provided sources or in the historical record up to April 1, 2025.

While geopolitical tensions remain high, the status quo persists: the U.S. has focused its official accusations on Ukraine, and relevant official sources (White House, State Department, Pentagon) have not released statements that meet the criteria outlined in the resolution description.

Given these facts and the tendency for international relations to change gradually—unless a significant, disruptive event occurs, which would be widely reported—the most likely outcome is a **No**.
