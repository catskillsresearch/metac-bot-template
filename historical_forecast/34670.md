(a) The outcome is already known. The 67th Annual Grammy Awards took place on Sunday, February 2, 2025, and we now have the results as of today, February 3, 2025.

(b) The status quo outcome is that Billie Eilish won 0 Grammy awards at the 67th Annual Grammy Awards.

(c) An unexpected outcome could have occurred if there had been a tie in one or more categories, or if there had been a scoring error discovered after the initial announcements, resulting in a correction that awarded Billie Eilish a Grammy. Such post-award corrections are extremely rare but have happened in other award contexts.

Based on the search results, Billie Eilish was nominated for seven Grammy awards at the 67th Annual Grammy Awards in 2025, including major categories such as Record of the Year ("Birds of a Feather"), Album of the Year ("Hit Me Hard and Soft"), and Song of the Year ("Birds of a Feather")[1][2]. Despite these nominations, she did not win any awards at the ceremony.

The awards in her nominated categories went to other artists:
- Record of the Year: Kendrick Lamar for "Not Like Us"[1][2]
- Album of the Year: Beyonc√© for "Cowboy Carter"[1][2] 
- Song of the Year: Kendrick Lamar for "Not Like Us"[1][2]
- Best Pop Solo Performance: Sabrina Carpenter for "Espresso"[1][2]
- Best Pop Vocal Album: Sabrina Carpenter for "Short n' Sweet"[1][2]
- Best Pop Duo/Group Performance: Lady Gaga & Bruno Mars for "Die With a Smile"[1][2]
- Best Dance Pop Recording: Charli XCX for "Von Dutch"[1][2]

Billie and her brother Finneas handled the situation gracefully. Finneas posted on Instagram saying, "Great Grammys!!! So honored to have been nominated amongst so many amazing songs/albums. I don't wanna see ANYONE with a photo of me or Billie as their PFP [profile picture] gettin' in fights with other artists' fans in comment sections!!! Be at peace Congratulations to all!"[1][2]

Billie herself was seen having a good time at the event, photographed with other celebrities like Sabrina Carpenter, Chappell Roan, and Cynthia Erivo[1]. She also reposted a photo of Best Rap Album winner Doechii on her Instagram Story, showing support for other artists[1].

This was the first time since 2022 that Billie Eilish had gone home from the Grammy Awards without winning any awards[3]. Prior to this ceremony, she had already won nine Grammy Awards throughout her career[2][3].

Since the 67th Annual Grammy Awards have already occurred and the results are known, there is no uncertainty about the outcome.
