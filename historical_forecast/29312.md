(a) **Time Remaining Until Outcome Is Known**  
The 2024 presidential election will take place on November 5, 2024, so there is roughly one week until the outcome in Arizona and Georgia will be known.

(b) **Status Quo Outcome if Nothing Changed**  
The status quo, based on late October polling averages and trends, shows Donald Trump narrowly leading Kamala Harris in both Arizona and Georgia. Most high-quality polls put Trump ahead by very slim margins—ranging from 1–2 points in Arizona and 1–2 points in Georgia, with leads generally within the margin of error[1][3][5]. If the election were held today with no late shifts, Trump would be favored to win both states.

(c) **Scenario for a No Outcome**  
A “No” outcome occurs if Trump fails to win the popular vote in either Arizona or Georgia. This could happen if:
- Late-deciding voters break for Harris, especially among key groups like independents and suburban voters.
- Harris benefits from higher-than-expected turnout among Democratic-leaning demographics, such as urban voters, young people, or Latinos (particularly in Arizona).
- The Democratic campaign successfully consolidates support from third-party and protest voters.
- Unexpected events (e.g., major news developments, turnout surges, effective last-minute campaigning) shift the narrow polling margins in one or both states.

(d) **Scenario for a Yes Outcome**  
A “Yes” outcome requires Trump to win the popular vote in both Arizona and Georgia. This scenario would likely unfold if:
- The current polling leads for Trump solidify or grow in the last week, with Republican turnout meeting or exceeding expectations.
- Harris fails to consolidate Democratic support or see a significant late surge in turnout among key Democratic blocs.
- Trump’s gains with Latino voters in Arizona and continued edge among white and rural voters hold through Election Day[3].
- Early voting trends, showing robust Republican participation (especially in Georgia), are sustained and translate into an effective Election Day ground game[5].

## Rationale

Both Arizona and Georgia are among the closest states in 2024, with polling data consistently showing razor-thin margins. As of late October, Trump leads in both states in most reputable polls, but often by only 1–2 points—within the polls’ margins of error[1][3][5]. Arizona in particular is extremely close, with some polls showing Harris closing the gap and outperforming Trump among women and independents, while Trump has gained ground with Latino voters[3]. Georgia appears somewhat more favorable for Trump with strong Republican early turnout, but still remains close[1][5].

Polls this late in the cycle, especially state-level polls, tend to be relatively predictive, but late movement and turnout dynamics can still create upsets. The status quo outcome, therefore, should be weighted more heavily: if the current environment holds, Trump is narrowly favored to win both states. However, the closeness means a modest late shift or turnout imbalance could easily change the result in one or both states.

Given the available data, Trump’s edge is real but slim—strong enough to make him the favorite, but not enough to rule out Harris flipping one state, especially Arizona, at the last moment.

**Probability: 65%**  
Trump wins both Arizona and Georgia, but with high uncertainty due to razor-thin margins and significant potential for late volatility[1][3][5].
