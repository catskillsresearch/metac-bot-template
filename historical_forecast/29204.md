(a) **Time until outcome is known:**  
As of October 25, 2024, there are approximately two months remaining before January 1, 2025, the date at which this question will resolve.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changes:**  
The merger agreement between U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel remains in place, with both companies publicly stating their intent and determination to complete the transaction[1][2][4][5]. The deal has received all non-U.S. regulatory approvals and overwhelming shareholder approval but still awaits U.S. regulatory clearance[1][2][3][4]. If no affirmative blocking action or termination occurs, the outcome resolves as "No" (the merger does *not* collapse before January 1, 2025).

(c) **No outcome scenario:**  
CFIUS completes its review in December 2024, and even if it recommends against the merger, no executive order blocking the deal is issued before January 1, 2025. Alternatively, the companies do not voluntarily abandon the deal or announce a termination, nor do they file a terminating SEC Form 8-K. The merger agreement remains technically active as of January 1, 2025, regardless of pending regulatory hurdles.

(d) **Yes outcome scenario:**  
Before January 1, 2025, one of the following occurs:  
- The U.S. President issues an executive order blocking the deal.
- U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel jointly announce a cancellation.
- Either party unilaterally terminates the agreement.
- Either company files an SEC Form 8-K indicating termination or abandonment.

## Rationale

The default, inertia-driven outcome is "No": the merger does *not* collapse, as both firms remain committed and no formal blocking action or termination has occurred[1][2][4]. Regulatory reviews, particularly by CFIUS, are ongoing, with a December 2024 decision deadline after a refiling, which makes presidential action possible but not automatic before January 1, 2025. The companies have not indicated any willingness to abandon the deal, and neither side has filed for termination or signaled imminent collapse[1][2][5].

While political opposition is high, and President Biden is widely expected to block the deal, there is no concrete evidence from the public record that an executive order or termination will actually occur *before* January 1, 2025[1][3][5]. Regulatory and political processes often move more slowly than anticipated, particularly with the presidential election in November 2024 possibly introducing further delays or hesitation. If the White House delays formal intervention until after the election or until further review, the merger technically remains alive as of January 1, 2025.

Good forecasters give extra weight to inertia unless there is clear, actionable evidence of imminent change. As of late October 2024, there is significant resistance but no definitive, scheduled action to collapse the deal within the next two months. Thus, while the risk of collapse is much higher than in a typical M&A, the likelihood of a formal, question-resolving event *before* the deadline still appears only moderate.

**Probability: 35%** (that the US Steel/Nippon Steel merger will collapse before January 1, 2025)
