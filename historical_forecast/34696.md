Based on the available data, I'll analyze the year-over-year percentage change in US federal government employment for February 2025.

(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known:
The outcome will be known when the FRED releases February 2025 data, which typically happens in early March 2025. Since today is May 6, 2025, this data should already be available, though it's not provided in the search results.

(b) The outcome if nothing changed:
Based on the search results, federal government employment declined by 10,000 in February 2025[1]. This suggests a negative change from the previous year, but we don't have the exact percentage.

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued:
The current trend shows a decline in federal employment. According to the February 2025 employment report, federal government employment specifically declined by 10,000 jobs[1].

(d) The expectations of experts and markets:
The search results don't provide explicit expert forecasts for federal employment changes. However, the implementation of a hiring freeze in January 2025 would be expected to create downward pressure on federal employment numbers.

(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome:
An aggressive implementation of the hiring freeze with minimal exemptions, combined with higher-than-expected retirement or resignation rates among federal employees responding to the return-to-office mandate, could lead to a significant year-over-year decline in federal employment.

(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome:
Extensive use of exemptions for national security, immigration enforcement, and public safety roles could offset much of the expected decline. Additionally, if the hiring freeze implementation was delayed or had numerous carve-outs, federal employment might show unexpected resilience.

Given the available information, I need to make a forecast based on limited data. The search results indicate that federal government employment declined by 10,000 in February 2025[1], suggesting a negative change from the previous year. As of November 2024, federal employment was just over 3 million[5], which had been increasing since its recent low in 2014. The hiring freeze implemented in January 2025 would be expected to halt this growth trend and potentially reverse it.

From the Current Employment Statistics Highlights for February 2025, we know there was a specific decline in federal employment[1]. This suggests the hiring freeze was having an impact, though we don't know the exact percentage change year-over-year.

Considering all factors and the uncertainties involved, here is my forecast:

Percentile 10: -2.0%
Percentile 20: -1.5%
Percentile 40: -1.0%
Percentile 60: -0.7%
Percentile 80: -0.3%
Percentile 90: 0.0%
