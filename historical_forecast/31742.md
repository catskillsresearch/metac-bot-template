(a) Time left until outcome: The outcome will be known when Metaculus accesses the DSCA Major Arms Sales notifications page on or after March 1, 2025. From today (May 6, 2025), this outcome is already known, as we are past the resolution date.

(b) Status quo outcome: Based on the search results, there were 9 major arms sales listed for February 2025[5]. This falls within the "5-9" range option.

(c) Unexpected outcome scenario: An unexpected outcome could have occurred if there had been a significant geopolitical event or crisis in January or early February 2025 that prompted an unusually high number of expedited arms sale approvals, pushing the total above 9. Alternatively, a temporary freeze or slowdown in the approval process due to administrative changes or policy reviews could have reduced the number below 5.

When forecasting the number of arms sales the US State Department would approve in February 2025, I need to analyze recent trends, contextual factors, and historical patterns.

Looking at the search results, we can see that the Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) website shows that there were 5 arms sales approvals in January 2025[5]. Additionally, recent arms sales notifications were published in the Federal Register in early January 2025[1][2], indicating ongoing activity in the arms sales approval process.

The search results also show a consistent pattern of arms sales approvals, with the DSCA reporting multiple major arms sales in April 2025, including to Poland (AIM-120D missiles), Romania (PATRIOT Air Defense System), the Netherlands (Tomahawk missiles), and the Philippines (F-16 aircraft)[5]. This demonstrates that the arms sales approval process remained active in the months following February 2025.

The arms sales approval process follows established legal frameworks, including provisions requiring congressional notification when sales reach certain thresholds[3][4]. This creates a relatively predictable administrative process, though the actual number of approvals can vary based on geopolitical factors, foreign policy priorities, and the readiness of specific sales packages.

Given the information that there were 5 arms sales approvals in January 2025, and considering that February is a shorter month, we might expect a similar or slightly lower number. However, the specific information from the search results indicates that there were 9 major arms sales in February 2025[5].

As a professional forecaster, I recognize that while the status quo is the most likely outcome based on the available data, I should also account for uncertainty and the possibility of unexpected events or reporting discrepancies.

Option_A (0-4): 0.05
Option_B (5-9): 0.90
Option_C (>9): 0.05
