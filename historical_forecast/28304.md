(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  
10 days remain until September 30, 2024, when the AAA national average will be observed.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
As of September 17, 2024, the national average retail price of regular gasoline is $3.20 per gallon. If this price holds steady or continues its recent downward trend, the AAA-reported price on September 30 will **not** exceed $3.30 per gallon.

(c) **Scenario leading to a No outcome:**  
The price continues its current trajectory—either stabilizing or declining, due to typical post-summer demand reduction, weaker crude oil prices, and ongoing market equilibrium. No major supply disruptions or geopolitical events occur. The national average remains below $3.30 per gallon on September 30.

(d) **Scenario leading to a Yes outcome:**  
A significant, abrupt crude oil price spike (e.g., from a major geopolitical conflict, major hurricane disrupting Gulf Coast refining, or sudden refinery outages) occurs in the next 10 days. This triggers a rapid rise in gasoline prices, pushing the national average above $3.30 per gallon by September 30.

## Rationale

The status quo outcome is weighted most heavily:  
- AAA's last reported national average as of September 17 is $3.20, already well below $3.30 and showing a strong downward trend over the late summer and early fall[5].
- Multiple expert forecasts, including the EIA's September 2024 Short-Term Energy Outlook, expect average U.S. retail gasoline prices to drop to about $3.40 by year-end, with the post-summer period usually seeing further seasonal declines[2].
- Regional data confirm this trend, with 16 states already seeing sub-$3 averages as of mid-September, and prices in major driving regions dropping consistently[5].
- There are no indications from recent news or AAA/DOE data that the market expects a reversal in the immediate short term—no major supply shocks or international incidents have emerged in the past few weeks.

While gasoline prices can be volatile, especially if new supply disruptions occur, such moves are rare and typically require significant, unexpected external shocks. Given the context and the typical stability of prices over short 1-2 week periods absent a major catalyst, rapid upward movement seems unlikely. Historical experience and expert projections both support probability estimates that heavily favor prices remaining below $3.30.

## Final Answer

Probability: **13%**

This reflects the remote but non-zero possibility of a short-term shock (such as a geopolitical crisis or large Gulf Coast refinery outage) pushing prices above $3.30 before September 30, but otherwise, the steady or declining trend is the overwhelming status quo.
