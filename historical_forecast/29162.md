(a) **Time until outcome is known:**  
The outcome will be determined after the close of the final trading day of November 2024. From October 24, 2024, this is just over one month.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
If current S&P 500 levels remained unchanged through November, the index would close flat—neither up nor down for the month. Historically, prices drift gradually, so the most likely scenario in the absence of new information is a slight positive or negative change, but not a dramatic shift.

(c) **Scenario for a No outcome (S&P 500 declines in November):**  
A negative outcome could arise if unexpected adverse events occur, such as:
- A surprise from the U.S. Federal Reserve (e.g., delaying rate cuts or signaling hikes).
- An economic shock—like disappointing corporate earnings, a sudden rise in inflation, or geopolitical instability.
- Heightened uncertainty or volatility surrounding the U.S. presidential election suppressing risk appetite further than expected[1].

(d) **Scenario for a Yes outcome (S&P 500 rises in November):**  
A positive outcome would likely result if:
- The Federal Reserve moves toward rate cuts or signals dovish policy that boosts risk assets later in the year[1].
- Uncertainty around the U.S. election is resolved, potentially leading to increased investor confidence and risk-taking.
- Economic growth remains resilient, supporting higher earnings and valuations, in line with recent institutional forecasts expecting higher year-end levels[1][3][5].

## Rationale

Most major institutional forecasts for 2024 point to higher S&P 500 closing values by year-end,[1][3][5] and some specifically forecast that most gains will be concentrated in the later part of the year as election and policy uncertainty subside. Goldman Sachs and RBC Capital Markets expect the first Fed rate cuts and a resolution of election uncertainty in late 2024 to lift equity prices, with targets for the S&P 500 between 5,300 and 6,000 by December[1][3][5].

However, these forecasts target year-end, not specific months, and considerable short-term volatility is possible around the election. The S&P 500 has generally had a positive drift in recent years, especially in Q4, but forecasting a single month remains difficult due to unpredictable shocks and short-term sentiment changes.

Given the positive bias in year-end forecasts, the prospect of more accommodative monetary policy, and typical seasonal strength, the weighted probability (with some conservatism for potential shocks in November) favors a modest chance the S&P 500 will end higher at the end of November than October. Still, this is far from certain, and good forecasters place meaningful weight on the status quo and the risk of negative surprises.
