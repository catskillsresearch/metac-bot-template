(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  
There are 18 days remaining until November 29, 2024, when the Baker Hughes US rotary rig count will be referenced to determine the outcome.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
As of November 8, 2024, the total number of active US drilling rigs is 585 and has been unchanged for three consecutive weeks[4]. If this level persists through November 29, the outcome would be **No**—the count does not exceed 590.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
Rig activity remains stable or decreases, consistent with current market trends. No significant uptick in commodity prices or shifts in policy or investment occurs to break the current pattern. Companies maintain a cautious approach, focusing on capital discipline rather than ramping up drilling. The rig count stays below or at 590 when reported for November 29, 2024[4].

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
A sudden, unexpected rally in oil or gas prices or a major policy change rapidly incentivizes drilling. This leads to a burst of new rig activations, with at least 6 more rigs added over the next three reporting periods—crossing the 590 mark by the November 29 count. Such a swing would require breaking both recent stability and underlying industry caution, which is atypical given the current climate[4].

## Rationale

Recent data shows the US rig count stable at 585 for three weeks, amid subdued oil and gas prices and an industry preference for maintaining financial discipline over production growth[4]. There have been no significant market, policy, or geopolitical developments as of early November 2024 that would prompt a notable, immediate increase in rig activity.

Historically, abrupt weekly increases of 5 or more rigs are uncommon absent major exogenous shocks. With only three weekly updates (potentially fewer, based on reporting cadence) before the resolution date, the window for a rapid change is both narrow and unsupported by current trends.

While unforeseeable factors (such as a sharp commodity price spike or major supply disruption) could change the trajectory, experienced forecasters give substantial weight to the status quo, especially in the absence of catalysts. The industry’s current strategy, the lack of market momentum, and the calendar timing all work against a sharp, near-term increase in rig count.
