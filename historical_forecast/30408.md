(a) Time left until outcome: About 7 months and 25 days (from May 6, 2025 until December 31, 2024)
    - Note: This is a logical impossibility as we are currently in May 2025, which is after December 31, 2024.

(b) Status quo outcome: If nothing changed from the last reported rate of 6.84% (as of November 22, 2024), the outcome would be "Yes" as this is below 7.00%.

(c) Scenario for a No outcome: Economic inflation pressures could increase in December, causing the Federal Reserve to pause rate cuts or signal a more hawkish stance. This could push mortgage rates back above 7.00% by December 31, 2024.

(d) Scenario for a Yes outcome: The Federal Reserve continues its rate-cutting cycle through December, economic data shows cooling inflation, and increased housing inventory helps stabilize the market, keeping the 30-year fixed mortgage rate below 7.00%.

As a professional forecaster, I'll analyze the available data to determine the probability of the 30-year fixed mortgage rate being below 7.00% on December 31, 2024.

Based on the search results, the 30-year fixed mortgage rate has shown significant volatility in recent years. As of September 2024, the rate averaged 6.5% and ended August at 6.35%[4]. The rate has been declining in recent months, with refinance activity increasing due to falling rates[4].

Looking at historical patterns, we can see that rates have fluctuated considerably. In 2023, rates ranged from a low of 6.11% to a high of 8.45%[5]. By the end of 2023, after reaching a peak in October, rates had declined to around 6.67%[5].

The most recent data available indicates that the 30-year fixed mortgage rate was at 6.76% with a recent change of -0.05%[1], suggesting a slight downward trend.

Several factors support the likelihood of rates staying below 7.00%:

1. The recent trend shows rates declining after periods of increase
2. Refinance activity is increasing, indicating market expectations of continued lower rates
3. The rate has already dropped substantially from its 2023 peak

However, there are factors that could push rates above 7.00%:

1. Rates did cross the 7% mark earlier in 2024[2]
2. Economic uncertainty or inflation concerns could reverse the current trend
3. Historical volatility suggests rapid changes are possible

Given the status quo rate of 6.84% (as stated in the query) and the observed downward trend, there is a higher probability that rates will remain below 7.00% by year-end. The rate would need to increase by only 0.16 percentage points to cross the 7.00% threshold, which is certainly possible given historical volatility, but the current momentum doesn't strongly support this direction.

Weighing all factors and giving extra weight to the status quo (as rates tend to move gradually in most cases), I believe there is a reasonable likelihood that rates will remain below 7.00% on December 31, 2024.

Probability: 75%
