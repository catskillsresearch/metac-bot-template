(a) The time left until the outcome is known: 54 days (from May 6, 2025 to March 31, 2025)
Actually, this question's outcome has already been determined as we are now in May 2025, and the resolution deadline was March 31, 2025.

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed: François Bayrou remains as Prime Minister of France.

(c) A scenario for a No outcome: Bayrou continues to navigate the fragmented parliament successfully, using special constitutional powers when necessary while maintaining sufficient abstentions from key political blocs to prevent successful no-confidence votes.

(d) A scenario for a Yes outcome: Growing opposition to Bayrou's use of special powers to force through legislation triggers a successful no-confidence vote, with previously abstaining parties like the National Rally or Socialist Party joining the opposition to remove him from office.

Based on the available information, I need to assess whether François Bayrou was removed from his position as Prime Minister before March 31, 2025.

François Bayrou was appointed Prime Minister of France on December 13, 2024, becoming the fourth prime minister to hold office in a single year - an unprecedented situation in the Fifth Republic's history[3]. His appointment came after his predecessor, Michel Barnier, was removed through a no-confidence vote[3].

The political landscape Bayrou inherited was extremely challenging. The 2024 legislative elections resulted in a fragmented parliament with no bloc holding a clear majority[2]. This created an inherently unstable environment for governance, particularly for passing critical legislation like the 2025 budget.

Early in his tenure, Bayrou faced significant opposition. The hard-left France Unbowed party (LFI) and the Green Party both announced intentions to file or support no-confidence motions against his government[2]. Despite this opposition, his government survived a no-confidence vote on January 16, 2025, thanks to abstentions from the National Rally and the Socialist Party[3].

The primary challenge for Bayrou's government was passing the 2025 budget, which had been long overdue. His predecessor was toppled precisely because of failure to pass this budget[2]. On February 3, 2025, Bayrou resorted to using special constitutional powers to force the budget through parliament without a vote[1], a move that typically triggers automatic no-confidence motions in the French system.

Indeed, this led to another challenge to his leadership, but as of February 5, 2025, Bayrou survived a third no-confidence vote related to the budget dispute[5]. This demonstrated some resilience in his position, despite the contentious nature of his governance approach.

A significant factor potentially contributing to Bayrou's ability to remain in office was the constitutional constraint preventing President Macron from calling early elections before July 2025[2]. This limitation may have reduced the incentive for some political actors to create further instability by removing another prime minister without a clear alternative governance structure.

In his policy approach, Bayrou attempted to build bridges across political lines. He proposed reopening discussions on the unpopular 2023 pension reform that had raised the retirement age to 64[2][4], offering an olive branch to left-wing parties whose support or abstention was crucial for his government's survival.

The historical pattern of prime ministerial instability in France during 2024 (with four prime ministers in a single year) certainly suggested Bayrou's position remained precarious. However, his survival of three no-confidence votes in the early months of 2025 indicated some level of political equilibrium, albeit a fragile one.

The search results provided only cover events up to early February 2025, so they don't directly confirm whether Bayrou remained in office through March 31, 2025. However, given that he had survived multiple challenges by early February and that another change in leadership would have been highly disruptive, the status quo assumption suggests he likely remained in office through the specified date.

Probability: 65%
