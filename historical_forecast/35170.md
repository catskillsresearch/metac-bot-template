I'll analyze how many executive orders Donald Trump is likely to sign in February and March 2025 based on the available information.

(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known:
The outcome will be known by the end of March 2025. Today is May 6, 2025, so the outcome is already known, though not provided in the search results.

(b) The outcome if nothing changed:
Based on the search results, Trump signed 83 executive orders in 2025 as of February 3rd[2]. However, the search results don't specify exactly how many were signed in January versus February.

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued:
Trump had signed 58 executive orders by February 6, 2025[1][3][4]. This represents an unprecedented pace of approximately 1.6 executive orders per day (58 orders over 36 days). If this pace continued through February and March (53 more days), we would expect approximately 85 more executive orders.

(d) The expectations of experts and markets:
The search results show that Trump launched a "massive 10-to-1 deregulation initiative" requiring agencies to repeal ten regulations for each new one[3]. This suggests experts would expect a continued high volume of executive orders focused on deregulation. Legal firms like Holland & Knight and DLA Piper have specifically created tracking services for these executive orders, indicating they anticipated a significant number[1][4].

(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome:
Trump could suddenly shift focus to legislative priorities rather than executive actions, especially if Republican congressional leadership requested he allow them to handle certain policy areas through legislation. Additionally, administration resources might become stretched thin after the initial flurry of activity, slowing the pace of executive orders.

(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome:
A major domestic or international crisis could prompt numerous emergency executive orders. Additionally, if Trump decided to use executive orders to systematically dismantle specific Biden-era policies beyond what was initially planned, we could see a dramatic increase above the already unprecedented pace.

Given the available information and the uncertainties involved, here is my forecast for the number of executive orders Donald Trump likely signed in February and March 2025:

Percentile 10: 45
Percentile 20: 55
Percentile 40: 70
Percentile 60: 85
Percentile 80: 100
Percentile 90: 120
