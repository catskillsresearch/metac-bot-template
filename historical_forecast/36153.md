(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
The 36th GLAAD Media Awards ceremony will be held on March 27, 2025. Today is May 6, 2025, so the outcome should already be determined and likely known publicly[5]. However, as of the last available information dated March 18, 2025, the outcome was not yet announced.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
Life is Strange: Double Exposure is a nominated finalist for Outstanding Video Game at the 36th GLAAD Media Awards[2][3][5]. Unless new information has emerged since the last update, it remains a nominee without confirmation of a win.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
If another nominated game—such as Fear the Spotlight, Minds Beneath Us, or Paper Trail—is selected by the GLAAD voters and review panel as having superior LGBTQ representation, originality, cultural impact, or overall quality, Life is Strange: Double Exposure would not win the award[3][5].

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
If the GLAAD voting body and review panel determine that Life is Strange: Double Exposure best fulfills the award’s criteria—fair, accurate, inclusive representation; boldness and originality; cultural impact; and overall quality—it would be announced as the winner for Outstanding Video Game[1][5].

## Rationale

The Life is Strange franchise has a strong reputation for authentic LGBTQ representation and has been celebrated by GLAAD previously, which makes Double Exposure a credible and competitive nominee[1]. The franchise is recognized for narrative boldness and inclusivity, matching well with the award’s criteria. However, the GLAAD selection process involves over 700 voters and a review panel who may weigh originality, impact, and quality differently each year[5].

The absence of leaks, front-runner indications, or unusual momentum for any nominee means the default expectation is that the award outcomes will reflect recent historical trends. Life is Strange games are often strong contenders but do not always win; outcomes are variable and depend on the strength of competing titles each year.

Given the current data:
- Strong fit to the criteria.
- Positive historical track record but not a guarantee.
- No evidence as of March 18, 2025, that Double Exposure is favored over the other nominees.
- GLAAD’s decision-making incorporates some unpredictability due to panel review.

Given these factors, the most reasonable probability estimate is slightly above a naïve equal-share guess due to Double Exposure’s franchise reputation, but not high enough for strong confidence without further evidence.

Probability: 35%
