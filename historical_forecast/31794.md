(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
Roughly one week remains until the outcome is determined, as the last trading day of January 2025 typically falls near the end of the month. Today is May 6, 2025, but the scenario was last assessed as of January 23, 2025.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
As of January 1, 2025, the S&P 500 stood at approximately 5,903[4]. The default “no major move” scenario—where the index closes January at or slightly above its opening level—implies a high likelihood of a small positive return, simply because the index historically trends upward in most months, and 2025 began with bullish momentum[4][2].

(c) **Brief scenario for a No outcome (index falls in January):**  
A "No" outcome would occur if the S&P 500 closes January 2025 below its level on the final trading day of December 2024. This could happen via:
- A sudden macroeconomic shock (e.g., unexpectedly poor earnings reports, negative economic data).
- Geopolitical crisis or rapid escalation of international tensions.
- Higher-than-expected inflation or interest rate surprises.
- Early-year market correction after a strong rally in late 2024, prompting profit-taking or risk reduction[4][3].

(d) **Brief scenario for a Yes outcome (index rises in January):**  
A "Yes" outcome would occur if the S&P 500 closes January 2025 above its level on the final trading day of December 2024. This could happen through:
- Continued positive momentum from strong corporate earnings and economic data.
- Market optimism around expected tax cuts or new fiscal stimulus measures.
- Stable monetary policy, with no negative surprises from the Federal Reserve.
- Global risk sentiment remaining stable, with U.S. market leadership intact[2][4].

## Rationale

- **Historical bias:** The S&P 500 has a slight historical tendency to rise in January, with positive returns in a majority of recent years, and strong momentum was observed entering 2025[4][2].  
- **Consensus forecasts:** Strategists at Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and others project continued gains, with price targets suggesting upside over the course of 2025, and most see earnings and macroeconomic support persisting, at least in the near term[2][3][1].  
- **Range of outcomes:** Most technical and fundamental forecasts for early 2025 suggested a test of 5,400–5,600 as potential support in case of a pullback, but an overall bullish structure and targets up to 6,560 for the year[4].  
- **Uncertainties:** While near-term corrections are always possible, there were no specific or imminent negative catalysts highlighted as of late January 2025, and most risks mentioned were longer-term or conditional[1][3].

Given the lack of adverse developments between December 2024 and January 23, 2025, and the continuation of the positive macro and earnings backdrop, the status quo (index rising or holding steady) should be given more weight.

## Final Answer

Probability: 70%  
The S&P 500 is more likely than not to close January 2025 higher than its December 2024 level, based on current trends, consensus targets, and absence of significant negative shocks as of the latest data[2][4][3].
