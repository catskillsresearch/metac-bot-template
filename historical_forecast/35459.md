Given the query and background information about the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, let's analyze the components relevant to forecasting the net worth of the 500th-ranked billionaire on March 28, 2025.

**(a) Time Left Until the Outcome is Known:**
There are approximately 29 days until the outcome is known on March 28, 2025.

**(b) Status Quo Outcome:**
As of previous years, being ranked 500th on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index typically requires a net worth in the multi-billion-dollar range. Without specific historical data, it's reasonable to assume that this trend may continue, making it plausible for the 500th-ranked billionaire to have more than $6.5 billion.

**(c) Scenario for a "No" Outcome:**
A scenario that could result in the 500th-ranked billionaire having less than $6.5 billion would involve significant market downturns or economic instability that erode wealth across the board, particularly affecting those at the lower end of the top 500. Additionally, if there were a sudden increase in the number of billionaires with substantial wealth, it could also push less wealthy individuals below the $6.5 billion threshold.

**(d) Scenario for a "Yes" Outcome:**
A scenario leading to a "Yes" outcome would involve a stable or growing global economy, particularly in regions where the lower-tier billionaires are concentrated. Continued growth in stock markets or an increase in the valuation of private companies held by these billionaires could maintain or increase their net worths above $6.5 billion.

Given these considerations, and putting extra weight on the status quo outcome since global economic trends typically evolve gradually:

**Final Answer:**
**Probability: 60%**

This prediction is based on the historical trend of the 500th-ranked billionaire typically having a net worth in the multi-billion-dollar range and the general stability of the global economy, though it is tempered by the uncertainty of market volatility over the next month.
