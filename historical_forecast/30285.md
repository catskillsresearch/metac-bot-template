(a) **Time left until outcome known:**  
As of November 19, 2024, there are about 1.5 months—roughly six weeks—until the January 1, 2025 resolution deadline.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
No direct optical detection of Planet Nine has occurred as of the current date. The strongest available telescopes have already ruled out much of the search area accessible to them; the remainder is too distant or crowded with background stars for current instruments[1][3][5]. The leading new facility, the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, will not begin operations until after the deadline[1][2][3]. Thus, if nothing changes, Planet Nine remains undiscovered by 2025.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
The remaining potential sky region where Planet Nine could exist is not observable with enough sensitivity given current instrumentation before 2025[1][3][5]. No new data, breakthroughs, or candidate detections are reported prior to the deadline. Without the Rubin Observatory’s survey, no new surveys or archival data yield a convincing, optically confirmed detection.

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
A research team could make a breakthrough by analyzing existing datasets (e.g., from Pan-STARRS, TESS, or other wide-field surveys) or by identifying Planet Nine in previously overlooked archival images before the deadline. This would require not only the detection of a moving planetary object consistent with Planet Nine’s expected properties, but also independent confirmation and broad scientific acceptance within less than two months—a highly compressed timeline.

## Rationale

The search for Planet Nine has advanced significantly since the 2016 hypothesis, with mounting indirect evidence and refinement of likely orbital parameters[4][5]. However, no direct optical discovery has been made as of November 2024[1][3][5]. 

Most of the predicted region has been searched with existing telescopes, but the remaining 22% of the orbital pathway is farther and harder to observe, lying beyond the reach of current surveys like Pan-STARRS[3]. The upcoming Rubin Observatory is widely recognized as the facility most likely to find Planet Nine, but it will only begin operations in 2025, after the question’s deadline[1][2][3]. No alternative survey or observational campaign with sufficient sensitivity is scheduled or likely to produce a result before then.

Further, while there is ongoing analysis of existing data, there have been no announcements or even strong rumors of an imminent discovery as of the cutoff date. The scientific process, especially for a claim of this magnitude, is slow: optical confirmation, peer review, and community consensus would all need to progress unusually rapidly—within six weeks—to yield a positive resolution by 2025.

Historically, astronomical discoveries of this kind often require new, more capable instrumentation rather than reanalysis of existing data, particularly when the search area is challenging and crowded by background stars. Given the timeline and available resources, the status quo strongly favors a No outcome.
