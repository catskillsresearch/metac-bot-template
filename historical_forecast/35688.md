To address this forecasting question about Fort Knox gold holdings, I'll analyze the available information systematically:

(a) Time left until outcome is known: 26 days (from May 6, 2025 to April 1, 2025 - this is in the past, so the outcome should already be known)

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: The U.S. Mint would list Fort Knox gold holdings at 147.3 million ounces, as this appears to be the most recently reported figure.

(c) Scenario resulting in a No outcome: The U.S. Mint updates their official website to reflect a different amount than 147.3 million ounces, perhaps due to an audit finding discrepancies or reclassification of some gold reserves.

(d) Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome: The U.S. Mint maintains the 147.3 million ounces figure on their website through April 1, 2025, either because this remains the accurate count or because no updates have been made to the website.

Given that the query asks about a date in the past (April 1, 2025) while today's date is May 6, 2025, I need to analyze what likely occurred based on the search results provided.

According to the search results, as of February 20, 2025, the gold holdings at Fort Knox were reported as 147.3 million ounces[5]. This information comes from a recent source and aligns with the historical pattern of minimal changes to the Fort Knox gold reserves over time.

The search results indicate that Fort Knox holds about half of the Treasury's stored gold, with a total of 147.3 million ounces as reported by the U.S. Mint[5]. This figure appears consistent with the historical information provided in the September 1974 inspection document, which listed Fort Knox holdings at 147.4 million fine troy ounces[3].

The search results also mention that "no gold has been transferred to or from the depository for many years" except for very small quantities removed for purity testing during scheduled audits[5]. This indicates a high probability of stability in the reported figures.

Furthermore, while there was mention of a potential inspection in 2025 (with Treasury Secretary Bessent saying he would "happily arrange an inspection for any senator who is interested"), there's no evidence in the search results that such an inspection occurred or resulted in a change to the reported figures before April 1, 2025[5].

Looking at the historical pattern, Fort Knox gold holdings have remained remarkably stable. The 1974 audit showed 147.4 million ounces, and the February 2025 report shows 147.3 million ounces - only a 0.1 million ounce difference over approximately 50 years[3][5].

Considering these factors, and giving substantial weight to the status quo (as good forecasters should), it seems highly likely that the U.S. Mint would have continued listing Fort Knox gold holdings as 147.3 million ounces on April 1, 2025. There's no evidence in the search results of any significant change to this figure occurring between February 20, 2025, and April 1, 2025.

Probability: 95%
