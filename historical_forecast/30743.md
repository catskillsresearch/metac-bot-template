(a) Time left until the outcome is known:
- 2 days remain until December 6, 2024.

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed:
- As of now, Snoqualmie Pass ski resorts (including Alpental) are projected to start their 2024/25 ski season from December 19 or December 20, 2024, based on On the Snow’s published projections[1]. There is no evidence Alpental is open currently. Thus, the status quo outcome is "No" — Alpental will not be listed as Open on December 6, 2024.

(c) Scenario resulting in a No outcome:
- If the season opening for Alpental remains scheduled for December 19 or later, or if unfavorable weather means skiable conditions have not yet arrived, Alpental will not be open on December 6. On the Snow will report it as "Closed" on that date[1].

(d) Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:
- If there is an earlier-than-expected opening — for example, if early winter storms allow for sufficient snow cover and the resort management decides to open ahead of projections — then Alpental could be listed as Open by On the Snow on December 6, 2024[3][5]. However, there is no clear information supporting such an early opening this year.

## Rationale

While some Washington resorts project season openings as early as November 22, 2024[3], the most specific and recent projection for Snoqualmie Pass resorts (which includes Alpental) is December 19 or December 20, 2024[1]. This is reinforced by On the Snow’s own regional schedule. No source in the search results specifically announces an earlier opening, nor is there news suggesting Alpine conditions or operations have changed unexpectedly. Ski resort opening dates are sometimes advanced due to exceptional early snowfall, but such events are rare, and projections are generally reliable within a two-week window[1][3].

Given we are only two days from the resolution date and all current information from official and aggregated sources suggests a later opening, a "No" outcome carries the overwhelming likelihood.
