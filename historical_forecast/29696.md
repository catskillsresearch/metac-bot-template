(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
There are 22 days until November 29, 2024, the date when Jackson Hole Mountain Resort is scheduled to open and when On the Snow’s report will be checked for the resort’s status.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
Jackson Hole Mountain Resort is scheduled to open on November 29, 2024, as announced by multiple authoritative sources, including the resort itself, and this is being publicly promoted as the season opening day[1][2][5]. The “Open” status should appear on On the Snow’s Ski Report if these plans hold.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
A "No" outcome would occur if an unforeseen event prevents the resort from opening on November 29, 2024. The most credible risk is insufficient early-season snowfall or an extreme weather event (such as unseasonably warm temperatures), which could force the resort to delay its opening. Other, less likely events include operational or lift construction delays, accidents, or regulatory issues that prevent opening.

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
A "Yes" outcome would occur if the resort opens as planned on November 29, 2024, and On the Snow’s reporting system reflects the resort as “Open” on that date. This is the expected scenario based on all current information, including the resort’s communications, construction updates, and the absence of negative indicators about weather or operations[1][2][3][5].

## Rationale

Jackson Hole Mountain Resort has officially set November 29, 2024, as its opening day for the 2024–25 season, with all current communications confirming preparations are on schedule and major lifts (including new construction) expected to debut as planned[1][3][5]. The resort historically opens in late November barring severe weather delays, and no evidence as of early November 2024 suggests such a delay is likely this year[4].

The primary risk to a “Yes” outcome would be abnormal weather patterns resulting in insufficient skiable terrain. However, Jackson Hole’s long-term track record, substantial infrastructure, and early snowmaking capabilities make a delay uncommon, though not impossible. No operational, staffing, or regulatory issues are reported.

On the Snow’s report usually aligns with the official status of the resort and is updated promptly when opening occurs.

Given the current facts and the tendency for the status quo to persist absent unusual events, the base rate and current plans strongly favor an “Open” status on November 29, 2024.
