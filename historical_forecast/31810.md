(a) The time until the outcome is known: 56 days (from today, May 6, 2025, until approximately April 1, 2025, which has already passed)

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed: Twitter/X remains blocked in all eight countries (China, Iran, Myanmar, North Korea, Pakistan, Russia, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela)

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome: One or more of the eight countries lifting their ban on Twitter/X due to policy changes, diplomatic agreements, or changes in Twitter/X's compliance with local regulations.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome: All eight countries maintaining their bans on Twitter/X, with no significant policy changes or political developments causing any country to restore access.

Given that the resolution date (April 1, 2025) has already passed relative to the current date (May 6, 2025), I should approach this differently. Instead of forecasting, I'll determine what actually happened based on the available information.

Based on the search results provided, I don't have specific information about Twitter/X's blocking status as of April 1, 2025. The most recent information comes from October 2024, which indicates Twitter/X was blocked in eight countries: China, Iran, Myanmar, North Korea, Pakistan, Russia, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela[1]. There's no information in the search results about any changes to this list between October 2024 and April 2025.

Looking at historical patterns, government censorship of social media platforms tends to be persistent rather than temporary, especially in countries with strong centralized control over information flow. The eight countries mentioned have maintained long-standing restrictions on various Western social media platforms.

Since I don't have explicit evidence of any country removing their Twitter/X ban between October 2024 and April 2025, and considering that such significant policy changes would likely be documented, the most reasonable conclusion is that the status quo continued.

However, I must acknowledge that without specific information from April 2025, there remains uncertainty about potential policy changes that might have occurred in any of these countries during this period.

Probability: 85%
