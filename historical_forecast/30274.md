(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
From November 19, 2024, to January 1, 2025, there are approximately six weeks remaining.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
If current conditions persist, there will be *no* bilateral ceasefire announced before January 1, 2025. Russia continues to reject comprehensive ceasefire proposals, preferring to maintain the status quo and only offering temporary, unilateral pauses for tactical reasons[1][4].

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
Negotiations remain stalled, and both sides continue fighting at current or slightly reduced intensity. Russia maintains its hardline stance, rejecting all proposals for a broad ceasefire, while Ukraine and its Western allies prepare for extended conflict or seek only limited humanitarian pauses. No announcement is made by both governments to halt all military operations across the territories.

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
A dramatic diplomatic breakthrough occurs, possibly catalyzed by intensified Western or U.S. pressure following the U.S. election. Both Ukraine and Russia agree to and publicly announce a comprehensive, bilateral ceasefire covering all operations—including in disputed and occupied regions—before January 1, 2025. This would require a change in the Kremlin's stance and assurances sufficient for both sides to make a joint announcement.

## Rationale

- **Russian Stance:**  
Putin’s government continues to reject broad ceasefire proposals and prefers to maintain military and territorial status quo. While Russia occasionally declares short, unilateral ceasefires for holidays or tactical advantage, it disregards calls for monitored, bilateral ceasefires and instead accuses Ukraine of violations to discredit them[1][4]. As of late 2024, there is no indication Moscow is willing to announce a true bilateral halt to hostilities.
  
- **Ukrainian Stance:**  
President Zelenskyy has recently stated he hopes to end the war in 2025 via diplomacy, but he did not reference a 2024 timeline or any imminent breakthrough[5]. Ukraine continues to seek major preconditions—such as NATO membership or full territorial restoration—that are unacceptable to Russia at this stage[4].

- **International Mediation & U.S. Influence:**  
While there are ongoing private talks and speculation about U.S.-led initiatives following Trump's election, there is, so far, no concrete evidence of an imminent, all-encompassing ceasefire deal[2]. The time window before January 1 is narrow; even optimistic diplomatic efforts (such as the Turkish initiative earlier in 2024) have not overcome core impasses[4]. U.S. leverage may increase after January 2025 but is less likely to deliver a breakthrough within weeks.

- **Pattern of Short-term or Unilateral Ceasefires:**  
Russia has used brief, unilateral ceasefires for tactical reasons—such as around major holidays—but these do not meet the question’s criteria (bilateral, all-encompassing, publicly announced for all territories)[3][1].

- **Status Quo Bias:**  
Large, complex conflicts rarely resolve suddenly, especially after years of failed diplomacy. The strongest weight goes to continuity (no new major agreement), especially with no public signs of movement from either Moscow or Kyiv.

## Final Answer

**Probability: 10%**

A comprehensive, bilateral ceasefire announcement before January 1, 2025, is highly unlikely under current conditions, though it cannot be ruled out entirely if there is an unexpected diplomatic breakthrough[1][4][5].
