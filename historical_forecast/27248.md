As a professional forecaster, I'll analyze the probability of an HHS public health emergency declaration for mpox before October 1, 2024.

(a) Time left until outcome: 46 days (August 15, 2024 to September 30, 2024)

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: No declaration of a public health emergency for mpox by HHS before October 1, 2024

(c) Scenario resulting in No outcome: The clade I mpox outbreak remains primarily contained in Africa with minimal spread to the US. US case numbers stay low and manageable within existing healthcare infrastructure. The WHO PHEIC declaration leads to increased international coordination and containment measures that effectively prevent significant international spread. HHS monitors the situation but determines that domestic conditions don't warrant a formal PHE declaration.

(d) Scenario resulting in Yes outcome: Cases of the more severe clade I mpox begin appearing in the US, showing potential for community spread. Following the WHO's PHEIC declaration on August 14, 2024, US public health officials determine that proactive measures are needed. HHS declares a PHE to mobilize resources, enhance testing capacity, facilitate vaccine distribution, and implement coordinated response measures before widespread domestic transmission occurs.

Now for my rationale:

Current US mpox situation appears stable. According to CDC data, the US has seen a significant reduction in mpox cases compared to the peak of the 2022 outbreak. The current average of 59 reported cases per week represents a fifty-five-fold reduction from the peak, with levels remaining stable since October 2023[1]. These cases are from the less severe clade II variant, not the concerning clade I currently spreading in Africa.

The threshold for an HHS declaration is substantial. Historical precedent shows that the previous mpox PHE declaration on August 4, 2022, came after a significant domestic outbreak was already underway, with thousands of cases reported weekly. Currently, we're nowhere near those numbers, suggesting a high threshold for action.

However, the WHO's recent action is significant. The WHO Director-General declared the mpox outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on August 14, 2024[4]. This international recognition of the threat could influence US decision-making, as international bodies have flagged the potential for global spread.

The variant's severity is concerning. The current African outbreak involves the more severe clade I variant, which has a higher fatality rate (~3%) compared to the clade II variant that circulated in the 2022-2023 US outbreak[2]. If this more dangerous variant were to appear in the US, it could prompt a more urgent response.

US vaccination rates remain suboptimal. According to CDC data, more than two-thirds (67%) of new mpox cases occur among persons not previously vaccinated, and only 39% of persons at risk for mpox exposure have received at least one dose of vaccine[1]. This vaccination gap could influence decision-making if threat levels increase.

The timeframe is relatively short. With only 46 days between August 15 and October 1, 2024, there would need to be a rapid deterioration in conditions or new intelligence about the threat to prompt such a declaration in this window.

Putting greater weight on the status quo: The current domestic situation shows stable, low-level transmission of clade II mpox, with no reported US cases of the more concerning clade I variant as of the data available. While international developments are concerning, the US tends to be measured in its emergency declarations, typically waiting for clear evidence of domestic impact. Without a significant change in the US epidemiological picture, the status quo of no declaration is likely to persist.

Probability: 30%
