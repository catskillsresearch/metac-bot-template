(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
The winners of the 2024 Golden Joystick Awards will be announced on November 21, 2024. As of November 7, 2024, this is approximately two weeks away.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
No information about winners is available yet; if this remains true, the default outcome is that we do not know whether Astro Bot has won. Since the question requires a winning announcement, the status quo is a "No" until official results confirm otherwise.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
Astro Bot does not win in any of the following categories at the 2024 Golden Joystick Awards: Best Audio Design, Best Soundtrack, or Console Game of the Year. This would occur if other nominees—perhaps Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, Helldivers 2, or another contender—receive more public votes and/or jury support in each relevant category[1][2][4].

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
Astro Bot is announced as the winner in at least one of Best Audio Design, Best Soundtrack, or Console Game of the Year at the 2024 Golden Joystick Awards. Given its strong showing in nominations and critical acclaim, it could receive enough votes or judge support to win an award in any of the specified categories[1][2][4].

## Forecaster Rationale

Astro Bot is tied for the most nominations this year and is recognized in all three relevant categories: Best Audio Design, Best Soundtrack, and Console Game of the Year[2][4]. It enjoys strong critical reception and visibility as a PlayStation exclusive—factors that tend to benefit titles in public voting systems like the Golden Joystick Awards[2][3].

However, the outcome is still uncertain. Public voting can be unpredictable, and Astro Bot faces significant competition from other critically acclaimed games, especially Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, which has equal nomination prominence and broad fan support[1][2][4]. The introduction of new categories (Best Audio Design, Best Soundtrack) this year further adds to the unpredictability, as there is no historical precedent for how voters and the jury will weigh candidates in these fields[4].

With no leaks, early voter trends, or credible projections available as of November 7, 2024, the outcome is genuinely unknown. Still, based on nomination strength and recent award trends, Astro Bot should be considered a strong contender, though not a clear favorite.

**Probability: 40%**

This moderately optimistic probability reflects Astro Bot’s status as a leading nominee and critical darling, but acknowledges stiff competition and the inherent unpredictability of the public vote.
