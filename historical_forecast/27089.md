(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
As of August 9, 2024, there are approximately 7 weeks (until September 30, 2024) before the outcome must be determined.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changes:**  
Apple has not yet officially announced any new iPhone model supporting Wi-Fi 7. If no official announcement occurs before October 1, 2024, the outcome is No.

(c) **Scenario for a No outcome:**  
If Apple delays its annual iPhone launch event past September 30, 2024, or decides not to announce Wi-Fi 7 support in the iPhone 16 lineup, or if the rumored feature does not make it into the final product specifications at launch, there will be no official announcement of any iPhone supporting Wi-Fi 7 within the required timeframe.

(d) **Scenario for a Yes outcome:**  
If Apple holds its traditional September keynote event—as expected—and officially unveils new iPhone models (likely the iPhone 16 Pro or Pro Max) with Wi-Fi 7 (IEEE 802.11be) support mentioned in Apple's press materials, specifications, or during the event presentation, the outcome will be Yes.

## Rationale

- Multiple credible reports from analysts such as Jeff Pu and Ming-Chi Kuo, as well as consistent rumors and reporting across leading tech outlets, indicate that the iPhone 16 Pro models are "widely expected" to support Wi-Fi 7[2][3][4][5].
- The announcement of new iPhones in September is a well-established Apple tradition. Apple typically announces its new iPhones in early to mid-September, well ahead of the October 1 cutoff.
- No evidence exists to suggest Apple will delay its September iPhone event in 2024.
- Therefore, unless Apple makes an unexpected change to its event schedule or product specifications, it is highly likely that a new iPhone (at least the 16 Pro) with Wi-Fi 7 will be announced before October 1, 2024.

Given the history of accurate supply chain leaks, the consensus among analysts, and no indications of delay, the probability that a qualifying iPhone will be announced with Wi-Fi 7 before the deadline is extremely high—but not absolutely certain.

**Probability: 95%**
