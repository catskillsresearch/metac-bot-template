(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
With today being May 6, 2025, the outcome for the EGX 30 return in January 2025 is already knowable, as both the December 2024 and January 2025 final trading day prices are established as of now.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
The EGX 30 index saw strong performance in 2024, reaching record highs in the first half of the year, and the momentum—supported by improving economic indicators, export growth, and ongoing reforms—continued through late 2024[3][4]. Entering 2025, Egypt’s economy was showing recovery signs despite ongoing inflation and currency pressures; reforms contributed to positive manufacturing growth[3][5]. GDP growth rates were improving, and although IMF forecasts for 2025 were revised downward, the expectation at the start of the year remained stability with modest growth[1][3][4]. In this context, the most likely status quo outcome for the EGX 30 return in January 2025 is a modest, positive monthly return—most plausibly in the '≥0% and <5%' range.

(c) **Unexpected scenario description:**  
An unexpected outcome could result from a sharp, unforeseen shock—such as a sudden devaluation of the Egyptian pound, an escalation in regional geopolitical conflict, or abrupt policy changes. For example, if investor confidence were rocked by a surprise central bank move, heightened capital controls, or a regional crisis, the EGX 30 could post a negative monthly return, possibly plunging below -5%. Alternatively, an unexpected surge in foreign investment or a dramatic, positive policy announcement could provoke a return above 5% in a single month.

**Rationale:**
- The most recent macroeconomic reports heading into January 2025 show a recovering but still cautious environment[1][2][3][4][5].
- Inflation is projected to decline but remains high, and interest rates are holding steady, limiting both upside exuberance and downside panic[5].
- Egypt’s GDP growth, export volume, and manufacturing sector performance were all improving in late 2024, suggesting a supportive backdrop for equities at the turn of the year[3][4].
- However, continued currency volatility, inflationary pressures, and geopolitical risks mean that while the central forecast is modest positivity, small but nontrivial probabilities remain for both larger moves upward or downward.

## Final probabilities

- Less than -5%: 7%
- ≥-5% and <0%: 18%
- ≥0% and <5%: 60%
- Greater than 5%: 15%
