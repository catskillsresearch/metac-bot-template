(a) **Time until outcome is known:**  
About 2 months and 10 days remain until January 1, 2025.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
If current trends continue—with no confirmed nuclear tests as of October 22, 2024—the outcome would be *No*; North Korea will not have tested a nuclear weapon before January 1, 2025.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
North Korea continues its pattern from 2018 through October 2024: frequent missile and satellite launches, heightened nuclear rhetoric, and expansion of its nuclear arsenal and materials, but without detonating a nuclear device. International monitoring (CTBTO, news agencies, Wikipedia) reports no new test, so the question resolves as *No*[2][3][5].

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
North Korea conducts and announces a nuclear test before January 1, 2025. This test could occur as a calculated provocation ahead of the U.S. presidential inauguration, or in response to perceived military threats, and is detected by the International Monitoring System and reported by credible international media and Wikipedia[2][3].

## Rationale

- **Historical Evidence:** North Korea has not tested a nuclear device since September 2017, despite repeatedly threatening to expand its nuclear arsenal and conducting numerous missile and military technology tests[2][3][4][5]. The gap of over seven years is the longest since their first test in 2006.
  
- **Current Activity:** In 2024, North Korea’s activities have focused on missile launches (including intermediate-range and multi-warhead missiles), satellite launches, and increased production of nuclear materials—but none of these have been nuclear detonations[1][3][4][5]. All evidence points to a strategy of military signaling short of crossing the nuclear test threshold.

- **Leadership and Rhetoric:** Kim Jong Un’s stated goals for 2024 include boosting nuclear capability and increasing "war readiness," possibly to gain leverage for future diplomatic negotiations[4][5]. However, these statements have not yet translated into a renewed nuclear test.

- **Analyst Expectations:** While experts have suggested that an "October surprise" or escalatory act is possible, particularly ahead of the U.S. election, there is no specific evidence or announcement pointing toward an imminent nuclear test as of October 22, 2024[2]. Most provocations have stopped short of nuclear testing, which carries higher international risks.

- **Forecasting Principle:** Because the status quo has persisted for years and North Korea has not yet crossed this threshold even amid heightened tensions, the probability of a test before January 1, 2025, remains moderate but below even odds. Good forecasters typically weigh the status quo more heavily when change is costly and risky.
