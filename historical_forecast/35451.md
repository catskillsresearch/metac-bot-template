(a) **The time left until the outcome is known**: Approximately 33 days remain until March 30, 2025.

(b) **The status quo outcome if nothing changed**: As of November 2024, Bluesky had approximately 1.3 million daily unique posters. If nothing changed, this number might remain roughly stable at around 1.3 million unique posters[1].

(c) **The outcome if the current trend continued**: Given Bluesky's rapid growth and user dissatisfaction with other platforms, the number of unique posters could increase. However, there's limited recent data on the exact growth rate post-November. A logical assumption would place the number somewhere above 1.3 million.

(d) **The expectations of experts and markets**: There is no clear consensus from experts or market analyses regarding specific projections for March 30, 2025. However, the overall trend suggests that Bluesky is gaining popularity as an alternative to other platforms[4].

(e) **An unexpected scenario resulting in a low outcome**: If there were significant platform changes or widespread dissatisfaction with Bluesky's features, leading to a decrease in user engagement, or if a major event shifted attention away from Bluesky during March 2025, we might see fewer than 1.3 million unique posters. This could occur if a competing platform made enticing feature updates or if there were significant technical issues on Bluesky.

(f) **An unexpected scenario resulting in a high outcome**: Should there be another major controversy on a competing platform or a significant increase in Bluesky's functionality and user experience, it could attract even more users and posters. For example, if Bluesky were to introduce a highly appealing new feature or if a major influencer shifted to Bluesky, it might see a substantial increase in unique posters beyond 1.5 million.

**Final Forecast:**

Given the available information and the inherent uncertainties in forecasting, here is a probabilistic outlook for Bluesky's daily unique posters on March 30, 2025:

Percentile 10: 900,000  
Percentile 20: 1,050,000  
Percentile 40: 1,200,000  
Percentile 60: 1,350,000  
Percentile 80: 1,500,000  
Percentile 90: 1,700,000  

This forecast assumes continued growth based on previous trends and potential positive developments, while also accounting for possible fluctuations based on external factors and uncertainties.
