(a) **Time until outcome is known:**  
From the perspective of November 18, 2024 (the evaluation date), there are approximately six to seven weeks left until December 2024 is completed and the Federal Register lists for that month are finalized. The official resolution will occur as soon as the Metaculus admins access the Federal Register page for Biden’s executive orders in 2024 after December concludes, but no later than January 7, 2025.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changes:**  
Recent history shows that President Biden has signed executive orders in December of each year, with orders appearing in the Federal Register for December 2021, 2022, and 2023[1][2][3]. There is no evidence this pattern will change, and no announcement or policy shift suggests a deliberate pause in December 2024[3][5]. If this pattern holds, at least one executive order will likely be listed in December 2024.

(c) **Scenario for a No outcome:**  
A *No* will occur if the Federal Register lists **one or more** executive orders by President Biden for December 2024. This is the historical norm, as Biden has consistently issued and published executive orders in every December of his presidency so far[1][2][3]. Even a single executive order, signed or published for December 2024, will trigger a *No* outcome.

(d) **Scenario for a Yes outcome:**  
A *Yes* will occur only if the Federal Register lists **exactly zero** executive orders by Biden for December 2024. This would require that he neither signs nor submits any executive order for publication dated in December 2024, and no outstanding orders from earlier in the year are registered in the Federal Register for December publication. This scenario has not occurred in any recent December during Biden’s term, nor is there any sign it is likely for 2024[1][2][3][5].

## Rationale

The status quo strongly favors at least some executive order activity by President Biden in December. Every year of his presidency so far has seen such activity, and there are no signals suggesting a change to this pattern[1][2][3]. Executive orders remain a routine part of presidential governance, and the end-of-year months are not typically a period of inactivity. The Federal Register is prompt in listing such orders, and delays are rare and typically affect only the timing, not the count.

A scenario where no executive orders are signed or listed in December would be notably out of character with both recent presidential and Biden-specific patterns. Unless Biden announces a policy of no executive orders or an unforeseen event prevents all such actions, the status quo is highly likely to prevail.

Probability: **5%** 

(Historically, the probability that the Federal Register lists zero Biden executive orders in December is extremely low, but not strictly impossible.)
