(a) Time left until outcome: 25 days (from March 6, 2025 to April 1, 2025)

(b) Status quo outcome: No. As of March 6, 2025, Chime has made confidential filings with the SEC but has not publicly announced an IPO plan through an S-1 filing or on their news website.

(c) No outcome scenario: Chime continues its preparations but delays making any public announcement until after April 1, 2025, possibly due to market conditions, regulatory processes, or strategic reasons.

(d) Yes outcome scenario: Chime finalizes its IPO preparations and makes an official announcement via an S-1 filing or on its news website before April 1, 2025, proceeding with its reported plans for a 2025 public debut.

Based on the available information, I need to assess the likelihood of Chime announcing an IPO before April 1, 2025. Let me analyze the facts systematically.

## Current Status and Timeline

Chime has already taken significant steps toward an IPO. In December 2024, the company submitted a confidential draft registration statement to the SEC for a proposed initial public offering[4][5]. This is a clear indication of their intention to go public. Multiple reports indicate that Chime is targeting 2025 for its public debut[1][2][3].

The confidential filing with the SEC is a preliminary step many companies take before publicly announcing IPO plans. It allows them to work through regulatory feedback privately before making a public commitment. This suggests Chime is serious about going public but is proceeding methodically.

## Timing Considerations

While Chime is reportedly targeting 2025 for its IPO, the specific timing remains flexible. Multiple sources indicate that the timing is "not finalised" and could change[3]. The company is likely monitoring market conditions, as IPO timing often depends on favorable market environments.

The fact that we're already in March 2025 and Chime submitted its confidential filing back in December 2024 suggests they've had several months to work through the regulatory process. This timeline would be consistent with a public announcement in the near future, potentially before April 1.

## Status Quo Bias and Historical Patterns

As a forecaster, I must give appropriate weight to the status quo - that no announcement has yet been made. Companies often take longer than initially expected to go public after confidential filings. The IPO process is complex and can face unexpected delays.

However, Chime's actions demonstrate serious intent. They have:
- Submitted confidential SEC filings[1][3][5]
- Reportedly engaged Morgan Stanley to lead the IPO[5]
- Been consistently reported to be targeting a 2025 IPO across multiple sources[1][2][3][4][5]

## Market Factors

The fintech sector has seen increased IPO activity, with other major players like Klarna also preparing for public offerings in 2025[5]. This suggests a potentially favorable market environment for fintech IPOs.

## Probability Assessment

Given that:
- Chime has already filed confidentially with the SEC (December 2024)
- Multiple sources consistently report a 2025 target for going public
- We're now in March 2025, giving them 3+ months since filing
- The criteria require only an announcement, not the actual IPO
- There are still 25 days until the deadline

However, balancing these factors against:
- The explicit statement that timing is "not finalised"[3]
- The typical unpredictability of IPO timelines
- The status quo that no announcement has yet been made

I believe it's more likely than not that Chime will announce its IPO plans before April 1, 2025, but there remains significant uncertainty.

Probability: 65%
