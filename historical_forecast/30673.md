(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  
The outcome will be determined just after January 1, 2025, when reporting for weeks 51 (ending December 20) and 52 (ending December 27) is published—roughly 4 weeks from the current date (December 3, 2024).

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
The most recent data show 77 cases reported in one week in late November 2024[5]. If this weekly rate continues or increases (following the observed upward trend), a simple projection for two weeks would be 154 cases (77 cases x 2). However, the trajectory to date has been upward, and recent four-week totals have reached as high as 263 cases, averaging 65.75 per week and increasing[3][4]. If the upward trend continues, weeks 51 and 52 could see a combined total well above 154, potentially approaching or exceeding the 275-case threshold.

(c) **Scenario for a No outcome (<275 cases):**  
For New Zealand to report fewer than 275 cases across weeks 51 and 52, the weekly case count would need to average less than 137.5 per week. If weekly counts remain stable at recent levels (around 77 per week) or even decrease, the combined total would remain comfortably below 275. This could happen if:
- Public health interventions sharply reduce transmission.
- There is an unexpected decrease in social mixing (e.g., due to weather, local responses, or holidays).
- Data reporting practices change or there are delays in notifications.

(d) **Scenario for a Yes outcome (≥275 cases):**  
To exceed 275 cases in two weeks, weekly counts would need to spike to roughly 138 or higher per week. Given the upward trend, if the epidemic accelerates—due to high transmission rates, increased testing, or more widespread outbreaks—weekly counts could rise rapidly. For example, if week 51 reports 140 cases and week 52 reports 150, the combined figure would total 290, well above the threshold.

## Rationale

- **Recent Trend:** The most recent four-week period had 263 cases, the highest monthly total of 2024, and the epidemic is described as being in its early stages[3][4]. Recent single weeks have reached 77 cases[5], and the progression over recent months shows escalation: from 48-59 per week (Sept), to 48-72 per week (Oct-Nov), and now 77 per week (late Nov)[1][2][3][5].

- **Epidemic Status:** Health authorities expect "similarly high levels of cases over the next 12 months or more," indicating the peak may be some time away, and the risk for further increases in weekly cases is elevated[3].

- **Base Rate Heuristic:** While cases could plateau, the status quo scenario (projecting forward from November) suggests a continuing rise or at least sustained high weekly numbers.

- **Downside Risks:** There is limited evidence that interventions (e.g., vaccination drives) have thus far reversed the upward trend in case notifications, although vaccination rates for one-year-olds did rise from 63% to 82% during 2024[4]. The effect of this may not be immediate.

- **Holiday Season Effects:** December may see changes in social mixing, which could either amplify transmission (due to gatherings/travel) or dampen it—this is a source of uncertainty.

## Forecast

Based on the strong upward trend, official statements about the early stage of the epidemic, and recent weekly data, the most likely outcome is that New Zealand will report **more than 275 whooping cough cases over weeks 51 and 52 combined**.

**Probability: 80%**
