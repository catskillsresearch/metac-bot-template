(a) **Time until outcome is known:**  
As of December 2, 2024, just under four weeks remain until the fourth Federal Reserve balance sheet release for December 2024, which will determine the outcome.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changes:**  
The latest available weekly data show total assets as follows (in millions of dollars):

- 4-Dec-2024: 6,895,827
- 11-Dec-2024: 6,897,485
- 18-Dec-2024: 6,889,332
- 25-Dec-2024: Data not yet published[2].

If the trend of the past weeks continues, the balance sheet will remain slightly above $6.8 trillion at year-end, but it is decreasing gradually[2].

(c) **Scenario that results in a No outcome:**  
The balance sheet remains above $6.8 trillion at the end of December 2024. This would occur if the current slow pace of reduction continues or slows further, possibly due to the Fed approaching its threshold for "ample" reserves and choosing to moderate or halt runoff[1][2][4].

(d) **Scenario that results in a Yes outcome:**  
The balance sheet falls below $6.8 trillion in the next three to four weeks. This would require either an acceleration in the pace of runoff or a one-off reduction in assets (such as a repayment of emergency lending or similar), pushing total assets below the $6.8 trillion threshold in the last December release[1][2][4].

## Rationale

Recent data from December 2024 show the balance sheet hovering just above $6.89 trillion, with minimal weekly changes—less than $10 billion per week in reduction[2]. With only a few weeks left in the year, the likelihood of crossing below $6.8 trillion in that window would require a sharp acceleration of the drawdown not seen in recent months.

The status quo is slow reduction, and the Federal Reserve has signaled its intention to slow or halt the runoff as it gets closer to the "ample reserve" threshold[1][4]. There is no evidence of imminent large asset reductions or policy shifts that would dramatically accelerate the drawdown in the next weeks.

Good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo, especially in a stable policy environment with clear Fed communications and no observed surprise events. While the margin is relatively close, the available evidence favors the balance sheet staying above $6.8 trillion.

Probability: 80% (No — the Fed's balance sheet will NOT fall below $6.8 trillion by the end of December 2024)
