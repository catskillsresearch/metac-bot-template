(a) **Time left until outcome is known**:
There are about 2 months remaining until April 5, 2025, the cutoff date for this forecast.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed**:
Currently, TikTok is not available for download on the App Store or Google Play in the US, having been removed after January 19, 2025, in accordance with the enacted law banning the app absent a sale by ByteDance[1][2][3]. If nothing changes—no sale, no legal reversal, and no new regulatory developments—TikTok will remain unavailable, resulting in a **No** outcome.

(c) **Scenario for a No outcome**:
- ByteDance does not divest TikTok’s US operations to a domestic buyer.
- Ongoing legal efforts to overturn or suspend the law are unsuccessful, and the Supreme Court’s ruling stands[1][3].
- The executive order delaying the ban is either not legally effective or fails to result in further action.
- TikTok remains unavailable for download via US app stores through April 5, 2025.

(d) **Scenario for a Yes outcome**:
- ByteDance successfully negotiates a sale of TikTok’s US operations to an approved US-based entity and completes the transaction in time.
- The divestiture satisfies statutory and regulatory requirements, enabling Apple and Google to restore TikTok to their US app stores before April 5, 2025.
- Alternatively, a new legal or legislative development (e.g., amending or repealing the law) emerges, enabling TikTok’s return to app stores during the specified window.

## Rationale

- **Heavily Weighted Status Quo**: The Supreme Court has already upheld the ban, and TikTok is currently unavailable in US app stores[1][2][3].
- **Presidential Executive Order Limitations**: While President Trump issued an executive order delaying the ban for 75 days, legal consensus is that executive orders cannot override acts of Congress. Thus, unless ByteDance completes a sale—or Congress passes new legislation—the ban remains binding[1][3].
- **Sale Uncertainty**: There is no public reporting that a qualified buyer is imminently finalizing a purchase. Arranging, vetting, and closing such a major transaction typically requires significant time and regulatory scrutiny.
- **Legal/Legislative Uncertainty**: No new legal or legislative efforts are currently underway or likely to change the law before April 5, 2025. The Supreme Court decision significantly reduces the odds of successful legal reversal in the time remaining[1][3].
- **Inertia in Platform Policy**: Both Apple and Google will adhere strictly to US law and are unlikely to restore the app unless all legal uncertainties are resolved.

Given these factors and the short time window, the highest-weight scenario is continued unavailability.

**Probability: 15%**

This reflects a small chance for an unexpected deal or legal/legislative change, but the overwhelming odds are that TikTok will not return to both major US app stores before April 5, 2025[1][2][3].
