(a) **Time until outcome known**: The winner of the 2025 Razzie for Worst Screenplay will be revealed on March 1, 2025. As of February 25, 2025, this is about 5 days away.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed**: Based on current nomination counts, critical reception, and Razzie trends, the status quo points to Joker: Folie à Deux being the most likely winner. It leads all films with seven Razzie nominations, including several major categories, and has been widely panned both critically and by audiences. The Razzies often select high-profile, much-hyped failures, and Joker: Folie à Deux fits this pattern closely[1][3][5].

(c) **Unexpected outcome scenario**: The Razzies sometimes make tongue-in-cheek or counterintuitive picks. An upset could occur if, for instance, voters decide to give Worst Screenplay to Madame Web, which, despite fewer nominations, generated significant negative buzz and internet mockery for its script. Another surprise could be Megalopolis, given the Razzies’ historical willingness to “punish” ambitious projects that fell short. Reagan and Kraven the Hunter are less likely but could still win if voters opt for a less publicized, but still poorly received, contender[1][4].

**Rationale**  
Good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome, since Razzie voting patterns change slowly and often reward the most prominent, negatively perceived film[3][4]. At the same time, some moderate probability should be reserved for the other candidates given the unpredictability and satirical streak of the Razzie voters.

**Final Probabilities**  
Joker: Folie à Deux: 49%  
Kraven the Hunter: 7%  
Madame Web: 22%  
Megalopolis: 13%  
Reagan: 9%
