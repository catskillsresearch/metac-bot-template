(a) Time left until outcome: 19 days (from September 11, 2024 to October 1, 2024)

(b) Status quo outcome: No - if Rivian maintains their current pattern of infrequent posting

(c) No outcome scenario: Rivian continues their irregular posting schedule and doesn't prioritize updating their Stories site before October 1st, potentially due to focusing resources on their ongoing R2 roadshow events or other business priorities.

(d) Yes outcome scenario: Rivian publishes a new post about their R2 roadshow events (which are actively ongoing through September according to the search results) or releases other company news/updates on their Stories site before October 1st.

As a professional forecaster, I need to assess the likelihood of Rivian posting on their Stories site in the next 19 days. Let me analyze the available information systematically.

The question states that Rivian's most recent post was on August 15, 2024, which is approximately 27 days before today (September 11, 2024). This provides a baseline for their recent posting frequency. However, the search results don't give us a comprehensive view of their posting schedule to establish a clear pattern.

What we do know is that Rivian is currently in the midst of a significant marketing push with their R2 roadshow tour. According to the search results, they have events scheduled in multiple cities during September 2024:
- Vancouver from September 2-7
- Portland from September 12-24[5]
- Nashville from October 3-7
- New York City from October 11-13[5]

This active marketing campaign provides potential material for new Stories posts. Companies typically leverage their owned media channels (like their Stories site) to amplify marketing initiatives and generate additional exposure for these types of events.

However, there are some factors suggesting Rivian might not post:

1. The search results indicate some technical issues with the Rivian Stories site, with multiple results showing access barriers requiring users to "confirm that you are a human being" and "enable Cookies and reload the page"[1][3]. This could suggest the site is not being actively maintained.

2. There's no clear evidence of a regular posting schedule that would make a new post highly predictable.

3. Rivian may be focusing their communication efforts on other channels like Instagram, as evidenced by recent activity there[2].

Given the context of the ongoing R2 roadshow events throughout September, I believe there's a moderate likelihood that Rivian will want to leverage their Stories platform to promote these events or share updates about them. The timing aligns well with their marketing needs.

However, I must give weight to the status quo observation that their posting frequency appears somewhat irregular, and there may be technical or resource allocation issues affecting the site.

Considering all factors and giving some weight to the status quo, I estimate there's a slightly better than even chance of Rivian posting on their Stories site before October 1st, 2024.

Probability: 60%
