(a) Time left until outcome is known: 12 days (from December 19, 2024, until the end of December 2024)

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: Continued dryness with 0.00 inches of rainfall for December 2024, as there has been no measurable rain since November 10, 2024, through December 14, 2024.

(c) Unexpected outcome scenario: A sudden shift in weather patterns brings several unexpected rain events to Miami in the final weeks of December, pushing the total rainfall significantly above average despite the dry start to the month.

Based on the available data, I'll provide my forecast for December 2024 rainfall in Miami, Florida.

## Historical Context and Current Situation

Miami is currently experiencing an unusually dry period, with no measurable rainfall recorded since November 10, 2024[1][3]. As of December 14, the area is classified as "Abnormally Dry" by drought.gov, indicating concerning conditions but not yet severe drought. 

December typically falls within Miami's dry season, though some precipitation is expected. The historical average for December rainfall in Miami ranges from approximately 1.7 to 2.2 inches (43-55mm), typically spread across about 6 days with precipitation[3][4]. It's extremely rare for Miami to experience a completely rainless Decemberâ€”this has only happened once since 1950, in 1968.

## Analysis of Current Meteorological Conditions

The first half of December 2024 has already passed with no measurable rainfall. Looking at specific forecasts for the remaining days of December, there appears to be minimal precipitation expected. For example, Christmas Day is predicted to have 0.00 inches of precipitation according to AccuWeather, with only a 16-24% chance of rain according to The Weather Channel[5]. 

However, New Year's Eve (December 31) shows a higher probability of precipitation, with AccuWeather predicting nearly a 60% chance of a "passing shower in the afternoon"[5]. This suggests at least some rainfall may occur in the final days of the month.

## Forecast Considerations

Several factors influence my prediction:

1. **Dry start to the month**: With zero rainfall through at least December 14 (and likely through December 17 based on the search results), approximately half the month has already passed with no precipitation.

2. **Historical rarity**: A completely rainless December has only happened once in over 70 years of records, suggesting some rainfall is likely before month's end.

3. **Current drought conditions**: The ongoing dry period increases the likelihood of below-average precipitation continuing.

4. **Forecast uncertainty**: While long-range forecasts show mostly dry conditions, there's inherent uncertainty, particularly for precipitation events which can be localized and brief.

## Probability Assessment

Given the already dry first half of December and forecasts showing minimal precipitation for most of the remaining days, I believe Miami will finish December 2024 with below-average rainfall. The most likely outcome is that total precipitation will remain under 0.30 inches, though I cannot rule out the possibility of isolated shower activity pushing totals slightly higher.

0.30 inches or below: 70%
0.31-0.60 inches: 20%
0.61-0.90 inches: 8%
Greater than 0.90 inches: 2%
