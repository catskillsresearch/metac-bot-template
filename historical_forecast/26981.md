(a) **Time left until outcome is known**:  
As of August 8, 2024, there are 7 days until the start of the forecast window (August 15, 2024), and then exactly 31 days until the end date (September 15, 2024). The outcome will be known in about 39 days.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed**:  
In the weeks and months leading up to August 2024, it has been common to see multiple days per month where more than 10 Chinese aircraft violate Taiwan’s ADIZ. For example, large-scale violations have occurred several times in recent months, including incidents where up to 17 or more aircraft entered the ADIZ in one day in April 2024[5]. Daily violations have averaged above 10 per day since Taiwan’s new president took office in May 2024[3]. If these patterns persist, the status quo expectation is that there will be at least one day with more than 10 violations in the specified period.

(c) **Scenario for a No outcome**:  
A "No" outcome would occur if—despite recent trends—there are no days between August 15 and September 15, 2024, when more than 10 Chinese aircraft enter Taiwan’s ADIZ. This could happen if China deliberately de-escalates its air operations for diplomatic, domestic, or strategic reasons, perhaps seeking to avoid inflaming tensions during a sensitive period, or if increased international pressure leads the People’s Liberation Army to reduce activities.

(d) **Scenario for a Yes outcome**:  
A "Yes" outcome would occur if, as has happened frequently in 2024, China sends more than 10 aircraft into Taiwan’s ADIZ on one or more days in the specified window. This is likely if China continues or increases current military pressure tactics, stages another major deterrence exercise, or reacts to perceived provocations from Taiwan or external actors[3][5].

## Rationale

Recent data show a sustained or even intensified campaign of ADIZ violations by China. The average daily count since May 2024 has been at or above 10, with spikes during or after major political events (e.g., leadership inaugurations, drills, or visits by U.S. officials)[3][5]. Large-scale air incursions have become a routine part of China’s signaling toward Taiwan, with a record-tying 56 violations reported on one day in July 2024 and regular double-digit violation days in recent months.

The background factors driving these activities (heightened PRC pressure on the new DPP administration, lack of any major de-escalation signals, upcoming sensitive anniversaries, and cyclical military exercises) all suggest continuity or escalation. Given this, the status quo expectation is that more than 10 aircraft will violate the ADIZ on at least one day within the forecast window.

Barring a sudden and sustained change in PRC behavior—such as a pause in ADIZ activity for diplomatic reasons—the probability strongly favors a "Yes" outcome.
