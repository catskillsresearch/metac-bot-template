(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  
The outcome will be determined after the market close on December 31, 2024. As of December 6, 2024, there are approximately 25 calendar days (or about 18–19 trading days) remaining until resolution.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
On November 20, 2024, Tesla closed at $342.03 per share. Even more notably, by the first week of December, Tesla closed at $403.84[2]. If this level is maintained, or if there is no significant adverse movement, Tesla would exceed the $300 threshold on December 31, 2024[2].

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
For the answer to resolve as "No," Tesla’s stock would need to decline by at least $103.84 (over 25%) from its early December closing price of $403.84 to below $300 by the December 31 close. This would likely require a major negative catalyst, such as a market-wide crash, a severe company-specific event (e.g., disastrous earnings, regulatory action, or leadership crisis), or unexpected macroeconomic or geopolitical shocks that disproportionately affect growth stocks or Tesla specifically.

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
If Tesla’s stock maintains its recent gains or even declines moderately but stays above $300, the question resolves as "Yes." This is the outcome if the post-election rally holds, if investor sentiment remains favorable (e.g., continued optimism about Elon Musk’s advisory role and Tesla’s prospects), or if any negative news fails to overpower current momentum. Even a substantial pullback from $403.84 would leave room for Tesla to close above $300[2].

## Rationale

The most important factor to weigh is the current price ($403.84) compared to the resolution threshold ($300)[2]. A more than 25% price drop would need to occur over the next three weeks for a "No" outcome—a rare but not unprecedented move for Tesla, which is historically volatile. However, such a drop would typically require a significant new negative event, as most market environments do not produce extreme short-term losses absent major catalysts.

Recent trends suggest renewed investor optimism following the 2024 U.S. presidential election and Elon Musk’s reported advisory role, contributing heavily to the recent rally[2]. While Tesla's volatility means sharp drawdowns are always a risk, the *status quo*—where nothing dramatic happens—favors the stock remaining well above $300 into year-end. Analysts' past 2024 targets (ranging lower) appear outdated or superseded by the recent rally and current trading data[2][5].

Given the proximity to the resolution date, the significant buffer above $300, and a lack of known impending negative catalysts, the probability that Tesla closes 2024 at or above $300/share is very high.

**Probability: 97%**
