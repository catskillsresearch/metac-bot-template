(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  
There are about 5 weeks remaining until December 1, 2024, during which the Federal Reserve could announce an interest rate cut that would resolve the question as "Yes."

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
The most recent rate cut was announced at the September 18, 2024 FOMC meeting, lowering the target range to 4.75%-5.00%[1]. There have been no further rate cuts announced as of October 25, 2024.

(c) **Scenario for a "No" outcome:**  
The Federal Reserve does not announce any additional rate cuts at its meetings (notably its early November 2024 meeting) or in between, so the target federal funds rate remains unchanged after the September cut until after December 1, 2024.

(d) **Scenario for a "Yes" outcome:**  
The FOMC announces another rate cut at its scheduled November 2024 meeting, or at an emergency meeting before December 1, 2024, thereby lowering the target range and satisfying the question's criteria.

## Rationale and Analysis

The Federal Reserve shifted to an easing stance in September 2024, cutting rates by 50 basis points after gaining confidence that inflation was moving closer to target and seeing labor market risks grow[1]. Multiple forecasters and market analysts have interpreted this as the beginning of a rate-cutting cycle, with some, such as Morningstar and various financial institutions, predicting at least one further cut by year-end[5][1].

However, the Fed's own projections, as per the September 2024 Summary of Economic Projections, indicated a cautious approachâ€”signaling likely only one more cut for all of 2024, with the consensus rate for December 2024 being in line with just the September cut[2][5]. This aligns with the official and public-facing communications suggesting patience and continued data dependence.

The next opportunity for a rate cut is the early November FOMC meeting. For the Fed to act again in that narrow window, it would likely require continued improvement in inflation data and/or further softening in labor market conditions. While financial markets and some analysts expect a second cut, the Fed's communications have been careful not to commit, reflecting uncertainty about both inflation's trajectory and the resilience of the labor market[1][5].

**Weighting the outcomes:**  
Professional forecasters assign significant weight to the status quo because central banks, and especially the current Fed, are typically cautious and prefer gradualism. Unless there is clear economic deterioration or inflation falls decisively below target, the Fed may opt to hold, particularly if the September cut was seen as an insurance move or if they wish to observe the effects before moving again.

## Final Probability Estimate

- Status quo, data-driven policy, and FOMC projections suggest only a moderate chance of an additional cut before December 1.
- Market expectations and analyst forecasts argue that a second cut is likely, perhaps in November, but not guaranteed.

**Probability: 60%**

There is a moderate likelihood that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates again before December 1, 2024, but the decision will heavily depend on upcoming data and the Fed's cautious approach[1][5].
