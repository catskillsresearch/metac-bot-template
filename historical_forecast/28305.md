I'll provide a comprehensive forecast analysis for the job interview question regarding U.S. gasoline prices.

(a) Time left until outcome: 10 days (from September 20, 2024, to September 30, 2024)

(b) Status quo outcome: Based on recent trends, the national average retail price of regular gasoline appears to be around $3.50 per gallon and has been declining. If this trend continues without disruption, prices would likely fall below $3.40 by September 30.

(c) Scenario resulting in No outcome: Continued declining price trends driven by balanced supply and demand fundamentals, absence of major supply disruptions, and seasonal factors that typically reduce demand after summer. With 10 days of continued gradual price decreases, the national average falls below $3.40 by September 30.

(d) Scenario resulting in Yes outcome: A late-September hurricane disrupts Gulf Coast refining operations, or an unexpected geopolitical event affects global oil markets, causing a sudden price spike. Alternatively, an unexpected surge in demand or refinery outages could halt or reverse the current declining price trend, keeping prices above $3.40.

## Current Price Environment and Recent Trends

The national average price for regular gasoline has been declining in recent months. As of mid-September 2024, prices have dropped approximately 13% from their peak in April, representing a decrease of nearly 50 cents per gallon. The national average has recently hovered around $3.50 per gallon, showing a continued downward trend.

During the recent Labor Day weekend, the national average was $3.50 per gallon, notably lower than the $3.81 recorded during the same period in 2023. This represents a significant year-over-year decline of approximately 8.1%.

## Supply and Demand Fundamentals

The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) forecasted that U.S. retail gasoline prices would average about $3.70 per gallon during the summer driving season (May to September), but prices have trended lower than these projections. The EIA subsequently lowered its 2024 oil price outlook after steep price declines in May, now projecting retail gasoline prices at $3.42 per gallon for 2024.

U.S. crude oil production continues to set records, with the EIA increasing its 2024 outlook for U.S. oil production to 13.24 million barrels per day. This robust domestic production, particularly from the Permian region, has helped maintain adequate supply, putting downward pressure on prices.

## Seasonal Factors

Gasoline prices typically decline after the summer driving season ends in early September. With the conclusion of summer travel, demand naturally decreases as families return to school routines and vacation travel diminishes. This seasonal pattern supports the current downward price trajectory.

However, September is also peak hurricane season, which poses a significant risk to Gulf Coast refineries. Any major hurricane disrupting refinery operations could cause a sudden price spike, potentially pushing the national average above $3.40 by month's end.

## Market Balance and Price Stability

Experts attribute the recent price stability and declines to a "confluence of economic factors" rather than direct government intervention. The market appears to be achieving a better balance after the disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war. Current demand remains somewhat below pre-pandemic levels, which has helped maintain price stability.

## Forecasting Considerations

When forecasting gasoline prices, I must consider:

1. The current downward momentum suggests continued price declines
2. The seasonal pattern typically shows post-Labor Day price decreases
3. The short timeframe (10 days) limits the probability of major disruptive events
4. Hurricane season remains a significant wild card that could reverse price trends
5. U.S. production remains robust, providing a buffer against minor supply disruptions

Given the status quo trends and the relatively short timeframe remaining, the most likely outcome is continued price declines. However, the hurricane risk factor cannot be dismissed entirely, especially as we remain in peak hurricane season through September.

Probability: 35%
