(a) **Time Left Until the Outcome Is Known**

The World Series is scheduled to begin on October 25, 2024. A full seven-game series would conclude no later than early November 2024, assuming a standard schedule of one game per day with scheduled off days. As of October 23, 2024, the outcome will be known within approximately 2–3 weeks[2][3].

(b) **Status Quo Outcome if Nothing Changed**

As no games have been played and no results are in, the status quo is that the Yankees have *not* lost the World Series in 7 games. The default is "No," since the specific scenario required for a "Yes" — a 4-3 Yankees loss — has not occurred[2][3][4].

(c) **Scenario That Results in a No Outcome**

Several plausible scenarios would result in a "No":
- The Dodgers win the series in fewer than 7 games (e.g., 4-0, 4-1, or 4-2)[4].
- The Yankees win the series in any number of games[4].
- The series is shortened, canceled, or otherwise does not reach exactly 7 games before January 1, 2025[4].
- Any outcome other than the Yankees *losing* in *exactly* 7 games is a "No."

(d) **Scenario That Results in a Yes Outcome**

The only scenario that satisfies the criteria for "Yes" is:
- The World Series is completed with exactly 7 games played, and the Yankees lose the seventh game to the Dodgers, making the final series result 4-3 in favor of the Dodgers.

## Rationale

As of October 23, 2024, no games of the 2024 World Series have been played and all outcomes remain possible[3][4]. Predictive analysis suggests a tightly contested series is plausible, as both teams had strong regular seasons and postseason performances[1][3][4]. However, most expert predictions either favor the Dodgers winning in fewer than 7 games or the Yankees winning the series[1][4]. No major sources are specifically forecasting a Yankees 7-game series loss.

The status quo in forecasting, especially before an event starts, is generally skewed toward outcomes that *do not* require a very specific chain of events. The "Yankees losing in 7" outcome is only one of several possible results, while the "No" outcome includes all other possibilities (Yankees win, Dodgers win in fewer than 7 games, series interrupted, etc.). Given historic rates of Game 7s in World Series (about 30% of all series reach 7 games), and considering the Yankees must both lose the series and do so in Game 7, the forecast probability must be lower than the baseline chance of any series going exactly 7 games.

## Final Answer

Probability: 12%

This reflects the small but non-negligible chance that the World Series will go the full distance and the Yankees will lose Game 7, given team parity and historical seven-game frequency, but also the fact that most expert opinions and the wide number of other scenarios make this exact outcome relatively unlikely as of October 23, 2024[1][3][4].
