Based on the available information and current forecasts, I'll provide my professional assessment regarding the likelihood of a Federal Reserve interest rate cut before September 30, 2024.

(a) Time left until outcome: About 2 months (from July 22, 2024, to September 30, 2024)

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: No rate cut before September 30, 2024. The Federal Reserve has maintained the federal funds rate at 5.25%-5.50% since July 2023.

(c) Scenario resulting in a No outcome: The Federal Reserve remains concerned about inflation not showing sufficient sustained progress toward the 2% target. Economic data released in August and early September 2024 indicates persistent inflation pressures or a surprisingly strong labor market, causing the Fed to maintain its cautious stance and delay rate cuts until later in the year or 2025.

(d) Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome: Inflation data in August and early September shows clear, consistent progress toward the 2% target. The labor market shows signs of cooling without deteriorating dramatically. The Federal Reserve gains "greater confidence" in inflation's downward trajectory and implements its first 0.25% rate cut at the September 18, 2024 FOMC meeting.

## Analysis of Current Situation

The Federal Reserve has maintained the federal funds rate at 5.25%-5.50% since July 2023, taking a cautious approach toward potential rate cuts. Based on the most recent projections from the June 2024 FOMC meeting, Fed officials are forecasting just one 0.25% cut for the entirety of 2024[5]. This represents a significant shift from earlier in the year when markets expected multiple cuts to be underway by now.

The delay in implementing rate cuts has primarily been driven by inflation's upward surprise in early 2024[5]. While the Fed has acknowledged "modest further progress toward the Committee's 2 percent inflation objective" in recent months, they remain cautious about moving too quickly to ease monetary policy[5].

## Timing Expectations

Multiple forecasters, including Morningstar analysts, project that the first rate cut will occur at the September 18, 2024 FOMC meeting[2][5]. This would align with the current forecast of one cut in 2024, bringing the federal funds rate to around 5.1% by year-end as projected in the Fed's June 2024 Summary of Economic Projections[5].

However, it's important to note that the Fed has consistently emphasized a data-dependent approach. They have repeatedly stated that rate reductions will not occur until there is "greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent." This leaves open the possibility that if inflation data remains stubborn, the Fed could delay cuts beyond September.

## Weighing the Evidence

Several factors support the likelihood of a September rate cut:

1. The Fed's own projections indicate one cut in 2024, and the September meeting provides a logical timing point with updated economic projections.
2. Multiple independent analysts forecast September as the most likely time for the first cut[2][3][5].
3. The Fed has acknowledged "modest further progress" on inflation, a shift from the "lack of further progress" noted in their May meeting[5].

Factors against a rate cut before September 30:

1. The Fed remains cautious and has revised its inflation expectations upward.
2. Previous timing expectations have already been delayed multiple times.
3. The Fed has explicitly avoided pre-committing to any specific timing.

## Status Quo Bias Consideration

As a professional forecaster, I recognize that changes to monetary policy tend to occur more gradually than market expectations often suggest. The Fed has maintained its current rate for a year now and has consistently erred on the side of caution. While September appears to be the most likely timing for a cut based on current projections, the Fed has demonstrated its willingness to delay action when data doesn't align with expectations.

Given the Fed's cautious stance and data-dependent approach, the most likely outcome remains a single cut in 2024, with the September meeting being the most probable timing. However, there remains uncertainty about whether the conditions the Fed requires for a cut will be met by that time.

Probability: 65%
