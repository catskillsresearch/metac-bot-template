(a) The time left until the outcome is known: 5 days. The 97th Academy Awards will take place on Sunday, March 2, 2025, which is 5 days from today (May 6, 2025).

Wait - I need to correct myself. Today's date is May 6, 2025, which means the 97th Academy Awards already took place on March 2, 2025. The outcome is already known.

(b) The status quo outcome: Based on the search results, "Anora" won the Best Picture award at the 97th Academy Awards. Multiple sources confirm this outcome, including the Oscars' official website and industry publications.

(c) A scenario that could have resulted in an unexpected outcome: If the Academy voters had been swayed more by "Emilia Pérez," which led with 13 nominations, or "The Brutalist," which had strong momentum and 10 nominations, the result could have been different. The preferential ballot system used for Best Picture voting sometimes leads to surprising upsets, particularly when multiple strong contenders split the first-place votes, allowing a broadly liked film to emerge victorious through second and third-place rankings.

Looking at the search results, I can definitively state that "Anora" directed by Sean Baker won the Best Picture award at the 97th Academy Awards held on March 2, 2025[1][2][5]. The film competed against a strong field of nominees including "The Brutalist," "A Complete Unknown," "Conclave," "Dune: Part Two," "Emilia Pérez," "I'm Still Here," "Nickel Boys," "The Substance," and "Wicked"[2].

Going into the awards ceremony, "Emilia Pérez" had led with 13 nominations, followed by "Wicked" and "The Brutalist" with 10 nominations each[2]. Despite not having the most nominations, "Anora" emerged victorious in the Best Picture category.

The Academy's official website confirms this win, as does IGN's comprehensive list of winners from the ceremony[1][2]. The Popverse also explicitly states that "Anora" was the winner in their coverage of the event[5].

This outcome aligns with what we know about Oscar voting patterns, where the preferential ballot system can sometimes favor films with broad appeal across the Academy membership rather than those with the most nominations. Sean Baker was also nominated for Best Director for "Anora," indicating strong overall support for the film[2].

Since the Academy Awards have already taken place and the results are known, the probabilities for the outcome are:

Anora: 100%
The Brutalist: 0%
Conclave: 0%
A Complete Unknown: 0%
Another movie: 0%
