(a) Time left: 45 days (from May 6, 2025 to December 20, 2024 - note that this is a past date since we're currently in May 2025)

(b) Status quo outcome: No. Based on current data, lithium carbonate prices have already fallen below CNY 68,000 per tonne, which is below the CNY 70,000 threshold required for a "Yes" outcome.

(c) Scenario for "No" outcome: Continued oversupply in the lithium market keeps prices depressed below CNY 70,000 through December 20, 2024. Battery manufacturers maintain high inventory levels while EV demand growth remains slower than anticipated, despite government subsidies.

(d) Scenario for "Yes" outcome: An unexpected surge in EV demand in Q4 2024, possibly driven by enhanced government subsidies, coupled with supply constraints from mine closures, pushes prices above CNY 70,000 and maintains them at that level through December 20, 2024.

Based on the research provided and current market conditions, I believe the probability of lithium carbonate prices continuously remaining above CNY 70,000 before December 21, 2024 is very low. Let me explain my reasoning:

The lithium market has been experiencing a persistent oversupply situation throughout 2024. Current prices have already fallen below the CNY 70,000 threshold, with Trading Economics reporting lithium carbonate trading below CNY 68,000 per tonne, its lowest level in over four years[2]. This represents a significant decline from previous highs.

## Supply and Demand Dynamics

The fundamental issue facing the lithium market is the imbalance between supply and demand. Despite some mine closures in Australia and China, overall production continues to outpace consumption[2]. The data shows that Chinese EV sales, while growing at 38% annually as of March 2024, have not met expectations[2]. This indicates that the anticipated boost in demand from government subsidies has not materialized strongly enough to absorb the excess supply.

Battery manufacturers are maintaining elevated inventory levels and showing little urgency to secure new lithium supplies, further suggesting that upward price pressure is unlikely in the near term[2]. The seasonal patterns also work against price recovery, as Q4 typically sees a slowdown in EV sales after peak periods, which could further depress lithium demand[3].

## Expert Forecasts and Projections

Trading Economics' analysts project lithium prices to trade at approximately CNY 67,264 per tonne by the end of the current quarter, which falls below the CNY 70,000 threshold required for a "Yes" outcome[2]. This forecast aligns with the broader market sentiment.

S&P Global Commodity Insights has provided a range forecast of $9,924 to $11,627 per metric ton until 2026, which at current exchange rates represents approximately CNY 70,000-82,000[3]. However, actual spot prices have already dipped below this range, indicating that market conditions are weaker than even these conservative forecasts anticipated.

## Potential Market Recovery Factors

While there is consensus among analysts that lithium prices might see a "mild recovery" in Q4 2024, this appears insufficient to consistently maintain prices above CNY 70,000[4]. The expected recovery would be driven by:

- Increased activity to meet end-of-year targets
- Low inventory levels necessitating restocking
- Strong battery production in March and April finally filtering through upstream

However, these factors may only provide temporary relief rather than sustained price support above the threshold.

## Status Quo Persistence

As a forecaster, I recognize that market conditions typically evolve gradually rather than changing dramatically in short periods. The lithium market has been on a clear downward trajectory throughout 2024, with prices having decreased 10.59% since the beginning of 2025[2]. This established trend would require significant disruption to reverse course and maintain prices above CNY 70,000 consistently.

The research indicates that lithium prices have already fallen below the threshold, and forecasts suggest they will remain at or below this level. Given that we're looking backwards from May 2025 to December 2024, and the data shows prices below CNY 68,000, it appears the question has already been resolved with a "No" outcome.
