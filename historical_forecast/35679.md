(a) **Time Left Until Outcome Is Known:**  
As of March 5, 2025, there are 7 days until the planned launch date of March 12, 2025.

(b) **Status Quo Outcome if Nothing Changed:**  
The official and currently maintained target is March 12, 2025, at 7:48 p.m. EDT for launch. NASA and SpaceX have not reported any new technical, logistical, or weather-related concerns as of March 5, 2025[1][5]. If no issues arise in the next week, the launch will occur on March 12, 2025.

(c) **Scenario for an Unexpected Outcome:**  
Crewed space launches are sometimes delayed at the last minute due to:

- Unfavorable weather at the launch site or along the ascent corridor.
- Minor technical concerns discovered during pre-launch checks or final integration.
- Issues with the International Space Station’s readiness, including schedule conflicts or unforeseen contingencies.

A plausible scenario for delay would involve a scrub on March 12 due to weather, hardware, or a range violation, pushing the launch to March 13 or later. Extended technical issues could push the launch into the following week or even into April.

**Rationale:**  
Most crewed Commercial Crew launches occur on the initially scheduled date, or within a few days due to minor weather or technical slips, especially if the vehicle and crew are already in final preparations and no concerns have been announced. However, a small chance for a longer slip always remains because of the unpredictability of launch operations and the stringent safety requirements for human spaceflight.

## Final Probabilities

- March 12, 2025 or earlier: **85%**  
  (Strong status quo, no announced issues, one week out)[1][5].
- March 13, 2025: **8%**  
  (Single-day slip due to common launch factors).
- March 14–21, 2025: **5%**  
  (Minor but multi-day slip due to weather, minor technicals).
- March 22–March 31, 2025: **1%**  
  (Unusual but possible slip from new technical discovery or ISS conflicts).
- After March 31, 2025: **1%**  
  (Major technical or external issue emerges unexpectedly).
