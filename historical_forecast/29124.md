(a) Time left until outcome: 13 days. South Dakota voters will decide on Constitutional Amendment G during the general election on November 5, 2024.

(b) Status quo outcome: South Dakota currently has a near-total abortion ban with exceptions only to save the mother's life. If Amendment G fails, this ban remains in place.

(c) Scenario for No outcome: Conservative voters mobilize strongly in the final weeks of the campaign, effectively messaging that Amendment G would allow unregulated late-term abortions. Religious organizations successfully persuade undecided voters that the amendment goes too far. Lower-than-expected turnout among younger and more liberal voters in this traditionally conservative state leads to the amendment's defeat.

(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: The substantial polling lead (53% support vs. 35% oppose) holds through Election Day. Women and moderate voters, concerned about the lack of exceptions for rape and incest in the current law, turn out in high numbers. The 11% of undecided voters break slightly in favor of the amendment, reflecting broader national trends supporting abortion access following the Dobbs decision.

Based on the available information, I assess that Constitutional Amendment G is more likely than not to pass, but with significant uncertainty. The current polling shows a substantial 18-point advantage for the "Yes" position, with 53% support compared to 35% opposition[3]. This represents a notable increase from November 2023 polling, suggesting momentum in favor of the amendment.

However, several factors complicate this forecast:

First, South Dakota is traditionally a conservative state, and ballot measures on contentious social issues can see significant shifts in the final weeks of campaigning. The 11% of voters who remain undecided could substantially impact the outcome[3].

Second, opposition messaging focusing on late-term abortions, parental notification, and safety regulations is actively being deployed[5]. These arguments sometimes gain traction in the final stages of campaigns.

Third, turnout will be crucial. Presidential election turnout is typically high, but differential turnout among demographic groups could significantly affect the result.

Fourth, the status quo in South Dakota is a near-total abortion ban. While national trends have favored abortion rights ballot measures since Dobbs, South Dakota's conservative electorate may differ from other states.

Despite these uncertainties, the substantial polling lead (18 points) provides a strong signal. The trend showing increased support between November 2023 and June 2024 suggests the amendment has momentum. Additionally, abortion rights measures have generally overperformed polling in most states since 2022.

While I acknowledge the possibility that conservative mobilization or effective messaging could close this gap, the current evidence suggests the amendment is favored to pass.

Probability: 65%
