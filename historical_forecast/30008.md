(a) **Time left until outcome known:**  
As of November 13, 2024, there are 7 days until the 58th Annual CMA Awards on November 20, 2024, when the winners will be announced.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
Chris Stapleton has a strong track record at the CMA Awards, especially in the Male Vocalist of the Year category, which he has won seven times. He is nominated in five major categories: Entertainer of the Year, Album of the Year, Male Vocalist of the Year, Single of the Year, and Song of the Year[2][4]. The status quo—based on his consistent prior wins, especially as Male Vocalist—suggests he is likely to win at least one award.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
Chris Stapleton does not win any of the following categories: Entertainer of the Year, Album of the Year, Male Vocalist of the Year, Single of the Year, or Song of the Year. This could occur if other frontrunners, such as Morgan Wallen (the year’s most-nominated artist), Cody Johnson, Luke Combs, or Lainey Wilson, sweep these categories due to shifting industry sentiment, voter fatigue regarding prior winners, or simply because their recent works resonate more with voters this cycle[1][3][5].

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
Chris Stapleton wins at least one of the five specified categories. His most probable path is through the Male Vocalist of the Year award, given his previous dominance and continued respect in this field. He also has credible chances in the Album, Single, and Song of the Year categories given his nominations for "Higher" and "White Horse," both of which have received recognition for critical and commercial success[2][4]. With five nominations, he has multiple shots at a win.

---

Given the historical tendency for Stapleton to win Male Vocalist of the Year (seven times previously), his multiple nominations in major categories, and his strong industry reputation, the probability that Chris Stapleton wins at least one of these 2024 CMA Awards categories is high.

Probability: 85%
