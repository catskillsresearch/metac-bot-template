(a) Time left until outcome: Less than 2 months (from January 31, 2025 to April 1, 2025)
(b) Status quo outcome: William Ruto remains President of Kenya
(c) No outcome scenario: William Ruto continues serving as President of Kenya through April 1, 2025 without any successful impeachment proceedings, resignation, or other removal from office.
(d) Yes outcome scenario: William Ruto resigns, is impeached, is removed through a coup, or otherwise ceases to be President before April 1, 2025.

Based on the available information, I need to assess the probability that William Ruto will cease to be President of Kenya before April 1, 2025. This requires analyzing recent evidence of his status and any potential threats to his presidency.

The search results indicate that as of early January 2025, William Ruto was actively serving as President of Kenya. On January 1, 2025, he delivered an end-of-year address discussing reforms initiated by his government and expectations for stronger economic performance in 2025[2]. He also emphasized that his administration has "successfully laid a solid foundation to hasten the country's socioeconomic progress in 2025"[2].

Additionally, on January 5, 2025, President Ruto stated that "this is the year we will deliver key projects" and noted that his government has "successfully stabilised the country's economy"[3]. These statements indicate forward-looking leadership with no suggestion of imminent departure from office.

The official website of the Kenyan presidency confirms that Ruto has been president since September 13, 2022, after winning the August 9, 2022 presidential election[1]. Prior to becoming president, he served as Deputy President from April 2013 to September 2022[1][4]. This demonstrates his established position within Kenya's political system.

There is no indication in any of the search results of:
- Impeachment proceedings
- Plans for resignation
- Political instability that might lead to a coup
- Serious health concerns
- Elections scheduled before April 2025

When forecasting, it's important to consider the base rate of presidential removals. Most presidents complete their terms as scheduled, making unplanned departures relatively rare. Without specific evidence pointing to threats to Ruto's presidency, the status quo is the most likely outcome.

Looking at the current date (May 6, 2025) provided in the query, we can now determine with certainty that the outcome period has already passed. However, I must base my forecast on information available only up to January 31, 2025, as specified in the personalization instructions.

Given that:
1. Ruto was actively governing in early January 2025
2. He was making forward-looking statements about his administration's plans for 2025
3. No credible threats to his presidency were evident in the search results
4. The status quo typically persists in the absence of strong evidence to the contrary
5. Only two months remained until the resolution date, limiting the time for major political changes

Probability: 5%
