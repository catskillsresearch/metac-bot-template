(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
As of August 5, 2024, there are just under 2 months—approximately 8 weeks—remaining until the October 1, 2024 resolution deadline.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
The current cumulative death toll from armed conflict between Israel and Hezbollah since October 8, 2023, is about 573 deaths (527 in Lebanon, 46 in Israel)[3]. If the current pace continues with no major escalation, the total will remain far below the 1,000-death threshold by October 1, 2024[3][4].

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
The conflict remains at its present intensity, featuring periodic deadly exchanges (airstrikes, rocket fire, targeted killings) but avoids full-scale escalation. The death toll continues to rise gradually, as it has for the past 10 months, and does not reach 1,000 before October 1, 2024[3][4][5].

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
A significant escalation occurs: either Israel launches a major ground operation in southern Lebanon, or Hezbollah initiates a large-scale offensive, resulting in daily mass casualties reminiscent of the 2006 war. International diplomatic interventions fail to prevent rapid intensification, and within weeks the cumulative toll jumps past 1,000[3][4].

## Rationale

- **Current Death Toll & Trajectory:**  
  As of early August 2024, approximately 573 deaths have been reported, with the rate of new fatalities remaining relatively steady and well below the pace required to reach 1,000 by October 1, 2024[3][4]. Even prominent escalations (such as the deadly strike on July 27 and subsequent retaliations) have not triggered exponential increases in fatalities[4].

- **Historical Context:**  
  The 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war saw over 1,300 deaths in barely over a month, but the intensity of that conflict has not yet been matched in the current exchange[3]. The current conflict, while highly destructive and tense, has been characterized by tit-for-tat strikes rather than all-out war.

- **Signals of Escalation:**  
  While both sides have issued threats and some high-profile assassinations have occurred, there is no clear evidence of imminent, dramatic escalation as of early August 2024[3][4]. International actors continue pressuring for de-escalation.

- **Reporting and Attribution Uncertainty:**  
  Fatality counts are subject to some underreporting and delayed confirmation, especially among combatants. However, even allowing for some undercounting, the gap to 1,000 is substantial, and there is no credible reporting that suggests major unreported mass casualties[3][5].

- **Probabilistic Weight on Status Quo:**  
  Given the world often operates on inertia absent a new, dramatic trigger, the best forecast usually puts more weight on the status quo outcome. In this case, barring an abrupt trigger (such as a major cross-border invasion), a surge to over 400 additional deaths in just under 2 months appears unlikely by recent trends.

**Probability: 15%**

This reflects a low but not negligible chance of dramatic escalation that could push the toll past 1,000, but the baseline outlook—based on current trends and events to date—is for the threshold not to be met before October 1, 2024[3][4][5].
