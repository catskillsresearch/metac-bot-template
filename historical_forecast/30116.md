(a) Time left until outcome: approximately 7 months (May 6, 2025 to December 5, 2024, which has already passed)

(b) Status quo outcome: Based on available information, the 2025 Pantone Color of the Year appears to be "Mocha Mousse," a warm brown shade, which would result in a No outcome.

(c) No outcome scenario: Pantone officially announces Mocha Mousse or another non-red color such as White Grape (green), Yellow Jasper (yellow), or Deja Vu Blue (blue) as their 2025 Color of the Year, with an HSV hue value falling outside the red range (H ≥ 330 OR H < 15).

(d) Yes outcome scenario: Despite current predictions favoring browns and other non-red colors, Pantone makes a surprise selection of a reddish-brown or burgundy shade with an HSV hue value that falls within the red range specified (H ≥ 330 OR H < 15).

Based on the search results provided, I can offer a comprehensive assessment of whether red will be the closest color to the 2025 Pantone Color of the Year.

## Historical Pattern Analysis

Looking at Pantone's selection history over the past decade, red or red-adjacent hues have appeared multiple times (Marsala in 2015, Rose Quartz in 2016, Living Coral in 2019, and Viva Magenta in 2023). However, Pantone rarely selects colors from the same family in consecutive years. Following 2023's Viva Magenta (red family) and 2024's Peach Fuzz (orange family), historical patterns suggest a move away from the red spectrum for 2025.

## 2025 Color Trends

The most significant evidence comes from multiple reliable sources reporting that "Mocha Mousse" has been selected as Pantone's 2025 Color of the Year. This warm brown shade is described as "simple, warming, and sophisticated" and represents the broader trend toward comforting, earthy tones[3]. This selection aligns with the current industry-wide movement toward warm browns, as evidenced by similar choices from other companies (like Dunn-Edwards' "Caramalized").

The Fashion Color Trend Reports for Spring/Summer 2025 from both London and New York Fashion Weeks further support a non-red direction. These reports highlight colors such as deep greens, earthy oranges, golds, purples, light blues, and various brown tones[1][2]. Notably absent are any prominent red or red-adjacent hues.

## Expert Predictions

Color forecasting experts have consistently predicted non-red options for 2025:

- VeriVide predicted potential colors including "White Grape" (green), "Yellow Jasper" (yellow), "Deja Vu Blue" (blue), and various brown shades like "Rum Raisin," "Cocoa," and "Bitter Chocolate"[4].
- The Nordroom highlighted deep plum and orange-brown shades as potential contenders, noting a shift away from "years of safe blue and green tones"[2].

None of these expert predictions point to a red or red-adjacent color for 2025.

## Current Status and Uncertainty Factors

The most current information strongly suggests that "Mocha Mousse" has already been selected as the 2025 Color of the Year[3]. This brown shade would not fall within the red spectrum as defined by the criteria (H ≥ 330 OR H < 15 in the HSV model).

While Pantone's official announcement typically comes in December, the reported selection of Mocha Mousse appears to be based on reliable industry information rather than mere speculation. However, without the official announcement and exact hex code, there remains a small possibility that the selected brown could have reddish undertones that might technically qualify under the HSV criteria.

## Weighing the Evidence

The overwhelming evidence indicates a non-red selection for 2025:
1. Multiple reputable sources confirm "Mocha Mousse" as the selection
2. Current color trends strongly favor browns and other earth tones
3. Industry experts predict greens, blues, yellows, or browns
4. Historical patterns suggest moving away from the red family after recent red/orange selections

Given the status quo bias in forecasting and the consistent information across multiple sources, the likelihood of a red or red-adjacent color being selected for 2025 is very low.

Probability: 5%
