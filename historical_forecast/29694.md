(a) **Time until outcome is known:**  
About 8 weeks remain until December 31, 2024.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
Waymo’s rider-only ride-hailing service is available to the general public in 2 states: Arizona and California[1][2][3].

(c) **Scenario for a No outcome (not exactly 4 states):**  
Waymo sticks to its announced timeline: expansion into Austin, TX, and Atlanta, GA, occurs “early 2025” and not before year-end 2024[4][5]. No other unexpected state launches or regulatory accelerations are announced or implemented before December 31. Thus, the service remains in only 2 states at the end of 2024.

(d) **Scenario for a Yes outcome (exactly 4 states):**  
Waymo accelerates its launch timelines, and fully public rider-only service becomes available in both Texas (Austin) and Georgia (Atlanta) before December 31, 2024. No other states gain access, so the total is exactly 4 by year's end. This would require a change to the current, explicitly stated “early 2025” launch date[4].

## Rationale

- Waymo’s official statements and Uber’s press release both specify that autonomous ride-hailing through Waymo in Austin and Atlanta will begin in “early 2025,” not before the end of 2024[4][5].
- There are no credible reports indicating a change in launch timeline or unannounced expansions to other states.
- All current operations in Arizona and California are established, large, and open to the general public, fulfilling the Metaculus criteria[1][2][3].
- Given regulatory complexity, operational caution, and the explicit public commitments around timing, an unscheduled acceleration for launches in both Texas and Georgia before December 31, 2024, would be a major departure from normal industry practice and is thus very unlikely.

Professional forecasters should overweight the status quo unless there is concrete evidence for acceleration. Organizations rarely move faster than their latest public roadmaps in this highly scrutinized, regulated industry.
