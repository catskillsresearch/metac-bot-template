**Rationale:**  
The data shows Pereira as the reigning champion with a strong winning streak, including three successful title defenses in 2024, and being on track to break Jon Jones’ light heavyweight defense record. Ankalaev is undefeated since 2018 and the top contender, with excellent grappling skills, making the fight highly competitive and unpredictable. Betting markets and expert predictions lean slightly towards Pereira to retain his title, reflecting his momentum and knockout power. However, MMA fights are notoriously uncertain, and Ankalaev’s skill and confidence present a serious challenge. Given the small margin in betting odds and the evenly matched nature of the fighters, a forecast should slightly favor Pereira but acknowledge the significant possibility of an upset.

**Final answer:**  
Probability: 65%
