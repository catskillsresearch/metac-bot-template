(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**
- From November 1, 2024, there are two months—until January 1, 2025—for moxidectin to be prequalified by the WHO for onchocerciasis.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changes:**
- As of November 1, 2024, moxidectin is not on the WHO prequalification list for onchocerciasis. The status quo outcome is therefore "No"—moxidectin will not achieve PQ before 2025 unless a new development occurs[1].

(c) **Scenario that results in a No outcome:**
- The WHO does not announce or add moxidectin to its prequalification list for onchocerciasis before January 1, 2025—whether because additional clinical trials or regulatory steps are still pending, or because the application remains under review.

(d) **Scenario that results in a Yes outcome:**
- The WHO formally announces and lists moxidectin as prequalified for the indication of onchocerciasis before January 1, 2025, either via its official prequalification list or through a publicly verifiable announcement by a credible source.

## Rationale

**Weight of the Status Quo:**  
Good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo, since regulatory approvals—especially for neglected disease drugs—rarely accelerate without clear, public signals. The status quo is that PQ for moxidectin has not been granted for onchocerciasis as of November 1, 2024.

**Recent Developments:**  
- On October 29, 2024, the revised 9th NTD Expression of Interest (EOI) including moxidectin was published by the WHO[1]. This signals that moxidectin is now actively included in expressions of interest for prequalification but does NOT itself constitute prequalification or approval.
- No credible source or official WHO update indicates that moxidectin has completed the prequalification process for onchocerciasis as of November 1, 2024.

**Barriers and Timelines:**  
- The PQ process often takes months or even years, particularly when additional clinical data have been requested by WHO, as was the case for moxidectin prior to this point[2][5].
- Even with inclusion in the EOI, the transition from “included in EOI” to “fully prequalified and listed” is rarely immediate and typically follows further review of submitted data.

**Likelihood of Rapid Progress:**  
- There is no evidence of imminent or expedited action by WHO to push moxidectin to PQ in the remaining two months of 2024.
- Precedent suggests that new inclusions in EOI precede, not coincide with, PQ listings.
- No public pressure or extraordinary circumstances have been signaled that would make a late-2024 PQ unusually likely.

## Final Assessment

- **Status quo:** No PQ for moxidectin as of November 1, 2024.
- **Recent update:** Inclusion in EOI, but not yet PQ.
- **No credible sign** of PQ being completed before 2025.
- **WHO processes and timing** suggest a "No" is most probable unless unexpected, rapid developments occur.

**Probability: 5%**

This reflects a small chance that something undisclosed or very rapid could occur, but the base rate and available signals heavily favor "No."
