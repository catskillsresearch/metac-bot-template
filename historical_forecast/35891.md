(a) Time left until outcome is known: 6 days (March 12, 2025 is election day)

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: The People's United Party (PUP) would maintain their majority in the House of Representatives, as they currently hold 26 of 31 seats from the 2020 election.

(c) An unexpected outcome scenario: Despite their internal division, the UDP factions could collectively perform better than expected if voter dissatisfaction with the PUP government is high enough to overcome the split opposition vote. Alternatively, smaller parties or independents could gain unprecedented support in multiple constituencies, preventing either major party from securing a majority.

The upcoming Belizean general election on March 12, 2025, presents a fascinating political scenario with several unique factors influencing the potential outcome. As a forecaster, I need to carefully analyze the current political landscape, historical context, and key dynamics at play.

## Current Political Context

The election scheduled for March 12, 2025, will have over 204,378 registered voters deciding which party will form the next government[1]. This election features 90 political candidates representing 6 political parties and 4 independents[1]. The incumbent People's United Party (PUP), led by Prime Minister John Brice√±o, called the election 244 days before the end of his five-year term[1].

The most striking feature of this election is the unprecedented division within the opposition United Democratic Party (UDP). For the first time in Belize's history, the Election and Boundaries Department has recognized 41 UDP candidates across 31 constituencies[1]. This means voters in several constituencies will have the option to choose between two or even three candidates under the UDP banner.

## Historical Perspective

Looking at the 2020 general election results provides important context:

- The PUP won a decisive victory with 26 seats in the 31-member House of Representatives
- The UDP secured only 5 seats
- Voter turnout was impressively high at 81.86%[1][3]

This represented a significant shift in power after the UDP had held government for multiple terms. The PUP received 58.83% of the total votes (88,040 votes), while the UDP received 38.34% (57,374 votes)[1].

## Key Factors Affecting the Forecast

The most significant factor influencing this election is the internal rift within the UDP. This unprecedented split means opposition votes will likely be divided in many constituencies, potentially benefiting the incumbent PUP significantly. When opposition votes split between candidates of the same party, it typically helps the unified governing party maintain its position.

The PUP also benefits from incumbency advantage. Having been in power since 2020, they have had the opportunity to implement policies and demonstrate governance capabilities. Historically, incumbent advantages are substantial in many democratic systems.

Limited polling data is available in the search results, though there is mention of a "2024 Belize Poll" that predicted "a close victory for the People's United Party" with a projected 41% of the total ballots[4]. While this suggests a competitive race, the impact of the UDP split wasn't likely factored into this earlier poll.

## Probability Assessment

When making my forecast, I need to balance several considerations:

1. **Status quo advantage**: The PUP enters the race with strong incumbency benefits and a unified party.

2. **Opposition division**: The unprecedented split in the UDP creates a significant disadvantage for the opposition.

3. **Uncertainty factors**: Despite these advantages for the PUP, I must account for unforeseen developments, potential shifts in voter sentiment, and local constituency dynamics.

Given the structural advantage created by the opposition split and the PUP's incumbency benefits, they appear strongly positioned to maintain their majority. However, as a good forecaster, I need to leave room for unexpected outcomes.

People's United Party: 78%
United Democratic Party: 20%
Another outcome: 2%
