As a professional forecaster interviewing for a job, I'll analyze the question about unruly passenger incidents for the week of March 2, 2025.

(a) Time until outcome: The outcome will be known after March 2, 2025, when the FAA reports the data for that week. This is approximately 9 months and 3 weeks from the current date (May 6, 2025).

(b) Status quo outcome: Based on the most recent data available, airlines reported more than 1,240 unruly passenger cases in 2024 as of August 21, 2024[2]. While we don't have the specific rate per 10,000 flights, the rate of unruly passenger incidents has dropped by over 80% since the record highs in early 2021, but unacceptable behavior continues to occur[2].

(c) Unexpected outcome scenario: A significant change in FAA enforcement policies, a major airline incident that goes viral, or new disruptive factors (similar to the mask mandate conflicts during the pandemic) could dramatically alter the trajectory. For instance, if the FAA were to relax its zero-tolerance policy or if a new contentious issue emerged that created tension on flights, we might see a sudden spike in incidents.

## Analysis of Historical Trends

The rate of unruly passenger incidents has shown significant variability over recent years. After reaching record highs in early 2021, there was a substantial decline of over 80% in the rate of incidents[2]. However, the search results indicate that unruly behavior continues to be a problem, with more than 1,240 reported cases in 2024 as of August[2].

The International Air Transport Association reported that unruly passenger incidents increased by 47% from 2021 to 2022, changing from one incident per 835 flights to one incident per 568 flights[5]. This translates to approximately 1.76 incidents per 10,000 flights in 2022 (10,000 ÷ 568 = 17.6 per 10,000 flights).

## Enforcement and Deterrence Factors

The FAA has implemented several measures that may influence the rate of unruly passenger incidents:

1. The FAA pursues legal enforcement action against passengers who assault, threaten, intimidate, or interfere with airline crew members, with potential civil penalties up to $37,000 per violation[2].

2. The FAA has referred over 310 of the most serious cases to the FBI for criminal prosecution review since late 2021, including 43 more cases during the year prior to August 2024[2].

3. The continued partnership between the FAA and FBI demonstrates a strong commitment to addressing this issue, which likely serves as a deterrent.

## Forecast Considerations

While the absolute number of incidents has decreased from the 2021 peak, the rate appears to have stabilized at a level higher than pre-pandemic norms. Without specific weekly data, it's difficult to identify seasonal patterns that might affect the week of March 2, 2025.

The most common types of incidents involve "non-compliance, verbal abuse and intoxication," with physical abuse occurring much less frequently (approximately 1 in every 17,200 flights as of 2022)[5].

Given the continued enforcement efforts by the FAA and the stabilization of incident rates, I would expect the rate for March 2025 to be similar to recent rates, barring any unexpected developments.

## Final Probability Assessment

Considering all factors, including the status quo bias and allowing for unexpected outcomes, my forecast for reported incidents of unruly passengers per 10,000 flights for the week of March 2, 2025, is:

Option_A (≤1.3): 30%
Option_B (>1.3 and <1.7): 40%
Option_C (≥1.7 and ≤2.0): 20%
Option_D (>2.0): 10%

I've assigned the highest probability to Option B as it represents a rate similar to what we've observed in recent years, while accounting for the continued enforcement efforts. I've allowed for significant probability in Option A to reflect the possibility of further improvements in passenger behavior due to ongoing deterrence measures. Options C and D account for the possibility of incidents increasing or unexpected events causing a spike in unruly behavior.
