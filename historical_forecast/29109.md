(a) Time until outcome: Approximately 2 months until January 1, 2025, when Metaculus will access the Wikipedia page to determine the resolution.

(b) Status quo outcome: Currently, Brazil is NOT blocking access to Twitter/X as the Supreme Court lifted the ban on October 8, 2024, after X complied with court requirements.

(c) No outcome scenario: Wikipedia continues to reflect the current reality that the ban was lifted in October 2024, and Brazil does not reimpose any new ban on Twitter/X for the remainder of 2024.

(d) Yes outcome scenario: Brazil imposes a new ban on Twitter/X before the end of 2024 due to renewed non-compliance, content moderation issues, or escalation of tensions between Elon Musk and Brazilian authorities.

Based on the search results provided, I can offer a comprehensive analysis of this forecasting question.

The evidence clearly shows that Brazil's Supreme Court lifted its ban on Twitter/X on October 8, 2024, after the company complied with the court's requirements[5]. Justice Alexandre de Moraes had initially suspended the platform on August 30, 2024, following X's refusal to appoint a legal representative in Brazil and comply with orders to block certain accounts[1][4].

The lifting of the ban occurred after X met two specific conditions: blocking profiles that were disseminating false information and appointing a legal representative for the company in Brazil[5]. Additionally, X paid 28.6 million reals (approximately $5.1 million) in fines as part of the resolution[5].

Multiple reputable sources confirm that X has returned to normal operation in Brazil and regained access to its approximately 22 million Brazilian users[3]. This represents a clear resolution to the legal standoff that had been ongoing between Elon Musk and the Brazilian judiciary.

When considering the likelihood of a reversal before year-end, I must acknowledge that while tensions existed between Musk and Brazilian authorities, particularly Justice Moraes, the formal legal requirements have now been satisfied. X has demonstrated compliance by:

1. Paying substantial fines
2. Appointing a legal representative
3. Complying with content moderation requirements

The ban lasted approximately 40 days (from August 30 to October 8, 2024)[2][5], and with the conditions that prompted the ban now resolved, there is limited justification for reimposing restrictions in the near term. The legal framework that led to the ban now appears to be satisfied.

For Wikipedia to list Brazil as "currently" blocking Twitter/X at the end of 2024, a new ban would need to be imposed in the next two months. Given that the company has now complied with Brazilian legal requirements and paid significant penalties, such a scenario seems unlikely without a major new development.

Considering the status quo—that the ban has been lifted following compliance with court orders—and the relatively short timeframe remaining in 2024, I assess that Wikipedia will most likely reflect the current reality that Brazil is not blocking Twitter/X.

Probability: 12%
