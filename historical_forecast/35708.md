(a) Time left until outcome is known: 26 days (from May 6, 2025 to April 1, 2025 - note that this date has already passed)
(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: Climate.gov remains online
(c) Scenario for No outcome: Technical failures, government shutdown, budget cuts, or policy decisions could have taken the site offline
(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: The site continued normal operations with regular updates and maintenance

Looking at the search results, I can provide a clear analysis of whether NOAA's Climate.gov remained online on April 1, 2025.

Based on the evidence available, Climate.gov was indeed online on and after April 1, 2025. The search results show that Climate.gov was actively publishing content after this date, with material dated April 10, 2025, specifically mentioning "April 2025 ENSO update: La Ni√±a has ended"[1]. This clearly indicates the website was functional and publishing new content after April 1, 2025.

Additionally, the Climate Prediction Center, which is interconnected with Climate.gov, published information regarding ENSO predictions on April 10, 2025, stating "ENSO-neutral is favored during the Northern Hemisphere summer, with a greater than 50% chance through August-October 2025"[2]. This further confirms that the climate information infrastructure, including Climate.gov, was operational during this period.

The Event Tracker section of Climate.gov shows entries from April 18, 2025, about "2025 summer minimum sea ice extent in Antarctic"[3], providing additional evidence that the site not only remained online but continued to be updated with new scientific information after the April 1 deadline.

It's worth noting that despite concerns raised in the February 2025 National Security Archive report about "Disappearing Data" related to climate information removal from government websites, Climate.gov has maintained its operations. This suggests that either Climate.gov was not targeted for information removal or that any such efforts did not result in the site being taken offline.

The site appears to be actively maintained and continues to serve as a central repository for climate information, data, tools, and educational resources. Given the evidence of regular updates and new content posted after April 1, 2025, it's clear the website has remained functional.

While NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) noted staffing constraints affecting some of their communications capabilities[5], this appears to have impacted only the level of media engagement rather than the fundamental operation of the Climate.gov website itself.

Probability: 100%
