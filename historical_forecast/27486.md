As a professional forecaster interviewing for this position, I'll analyze whether the Federal Reserve will cut rates by 50 basis points at their September 2024 meeting.

(a) Time until outcome: 4 months and 11 days (from May 6, 2025 to September 17-18, 2024 - looking back in time)

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: The Fed would maintain its current federal funds target rate of 5.25%-5.50%.

(c) No outcome scenario: The Fed proceeds with a more cautious approach, implementing a standard 25 bps cut at the September meeting as economic data shows continued progress on inflation without severe deterioration in employment figures.

(d) Yes outcome scenario: Economic conditions worsen significantly before September, with rising unemployment and clear signs of recession risk, prompting the Fed to take more aggressive action with a 50 bps cut to support the economy.

Based on the available information as of July/August 2024, a September rate cut appears increasingly likely, but the size of this cut requires careful analysis.

## Current Economic Context

The Federal Reserve has maintained the federal funds rate at 5.25%-5.50% since July 2023, but Chair Powell has recently indicated that a rate cut "is approaching" and could be on the table for the September meeting[3]. This represents a significant shift in the Fed's stance, acknowledging both progress on inflation and growing concerns about employment.

The Fed has moderated its description of inflation from "elevated" to "somewhat elevated," signaling progress toward its 2% target[3]. Additionally, the Fed has emphasized its dual mandate, which includes full employment alongside inflation control. This balanced approach suggests the Fed is becoming increasingly concerned about labor market conditions.

## Rate Cut Size Considerations

Several factors suggest a standard 25 bps cut is more likely than a larger 50 bps reduction:

**Historical precedent**: The Fed typically begins easing cycles with 25 bps cuts to maintain policy flexibility and avoid signaling excessive concern.

**Powell's cautious language**: The Fed Chair has deliberately avoided providing specific guidance on the pace of cuts, stating: "You would think, base case, that policy rates would move down from here, but I don't want to give specific guidance on the pace of when that would happen"[3]. This suggests a measured approach.

**Projected path**: As of July 31, markets were projecting three 25 bps cuts in 2024, taking the federal-funds rate to 4.50%-4.75% by December[1]. This implies a gradual rather than aggressive easing cycle.

**Recent Fed projections**: In June 2024, the Fed was projecting just one rate cut for the entire year[4]. While this outlook may be "too pessimistic" according to some analysts[4], it indicates the Fed's cautious approach.

## Arguments for a Larger Cut

Despite the arguments for a standard 25 bps cut, there are scenarios that could lead to a larger 50 bps move:

**Economic deterioration**: If unemployment continues to rise and economic data deteriorates substantially before September, the Fed might opt for a more aggressive cut.

**Inflation progress**: The Fed noted in June that there had been "modest further progress toward the Committee's 2 percent inflation objective"[4]. If this progress accelerates, it could give the Fed more room to focus on supporting employment with a larger cut.

**Market expectations shift**: If market participants begin pricing in larger cuts and financial conditions tighten significantly, the Fed might feel compelled to meet these expectations to avoid market disruption.

## Weighing the Evidence

While economic conditions are evolving, the evidence strongly favors an initial rate cut of 25 bps rather than 50 bps:

1. The Fed's communication has consistently emphasized a cautious, data-dependent approach.

2. Even analysts projecting multiple cuts in 2024 are generally expecting standard 25 bps increments rather than larger moves.

3. The Fed's own projections from June suggested just one cut in 2024, indicating a very gradual approach to policy normalization[4].

4. Chair Powell's careful avoidance of specific guidance on the pace of cuts suggests the Fed wants to maintain flexibility rather than commit to aggressive easing.

Looking at the historical pattern of Fed behavior, the central bank typically moves cautiously when changing direction, particularly at the beginning of an easing cycle. While economic conditions could deteriorate further before September, the current evidence suggests the Fed will begin with a standard 25 bps cut and reassess from there.

Probability: 25%
