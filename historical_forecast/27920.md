(a) **Time Left Until Outcome Is Known**

As of today, September 6, 2024, there are **24 days** remaining until the October 1, 2024 deadline by which Ethiopia and Somalia must publicly announce an agreement settling their dispute over the Somaliland port deal for the question to resolve as Yes.

(b) **Status Quo Outcome If Nothing Changed**

If present trends continue and no significant diplomatic breakthrough occurs during the scheduled third round of talks or through separate channels, the default outcome is **No agreement announced**—Somalia continues to reject the Ethiopia–Somaliland MoU, and both countries remain at odds over the port deal[1][5].

(c) **No Outcome Scenario**

A No outcome would occur if:
- The third round of talks in Ankara on September 17, 2024 ends without agreement.
- No subsequent breakthrough is announced by October 1, 2024.
- Ethiopia continues to deepen its ties with Somaliland while sidestepping the Somali Federal Government, fueling further deterioration in bilateral relations[1][5].
- Somalia maintains its public position that the deal is a violation of its sovereignty and does not endorse any settlement[1][5].

(d) **Yes Outcome Scenario**

A Yes outcome could result if:
- The third round of Turkish-mediated talks yields a breakthrough, leading to a joint public announcement that Ethiopia and Somalia have reached an agreement settling their dispute over the port deal.
- The agreement could involve Ethiopia gaining agreed-upon port access via Somalia or Somalia recognizing Ethiopia’s arrangement in a way that respects Somali sovereignty.
- Both governments publicly acknowledge the agreement, and Somalia ceases its opposition to Ethiopia’s access in connection with the Somaliland deal, as reported by credible sources before October 1, 2024[4].

## Rationale

- **Status quo bias:** Public positions remain entrenched, with Somalia publicly and repeatedly rejecting the Ethiopia–Somaliland MoU as an attack on its sovereignty and threatening to expel Ethiopian troops if the deal goes forward[1][5]. Ethiopia, meanwhile, is working around the Somali Federal Government, further antagonizing Mogadishu[1].
- **Negotiation history:** Two rounds of Turkish-mediated talks have already failed to yield a settlement, though Turkish officials report “convergence on some major principles.” However, no concrete, public breakthrough has been achieved so far, and the second round ended with continued differences[1][4].
- **Time constraints:** With only about three weeks after the third round of talks and historical precedent for slow-moving diplomatic processes on issues of sovereignty and territorial integrity, the timeline is extremely tight for such a significant shift in positions[4].
- **Entrenched conflict:** Deep-rooted issues regarding sovereignty, national identity, and recognition of Somaliland make compromise politically costly for Somalian leaders, and there is little evidence of a shift in Mogadishu’s red lines so far[1][5].
- **Signals of movement:** There are reports of “convergence” and hints of possible deals, and Turkey’s mediation creates an opportunity for face-saving compromises[4]. However, as of now, there are no solid public signals that both sides are on the verge of announcing a settlement.

Given historical inertia in similar diplomatic disputes, the fundamental stakes for both sides, and the lack of a public softening in Somalia’s stance, the **status quo outcome (“No agreement”) should be weighted significantly higher than the “Yes” scenario** in this time frame.

**Probability: 20%**

A breakthrough this month is possible but unlikely; the baseline is a continued standoff.
