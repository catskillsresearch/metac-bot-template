(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
Approximately 7 weeks remain before April 1, 2025 (current date is February 9, 2025).

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
The National Weather Service (NWS) continues to refer to the body of water as the "Gulf of Mexico." The Gulf Marine Text page and associated forecasts persist with the traditional name.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
Despite the executive order, bureaucratic processes, technical updates, and official database changes are not completed before April 1, 2025. The Department of the Interior and the U.S. Board on Geographic Names make progress or announce intent, but the NWS does not update its public-facing language or web pages to "Gulf of America." Thus, the designated NWS page continually displays "Gulf of Mexico" up to and including April 1, 2025.

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
The Department of the Interior, under the executive order, expedites the database change in the Geographic Names Information System (GNIS), and the NWS promptly updates their web content, marine products, and communications. By April 1, 2025, the NWS Gulf Marine Text page refers to the area as the "Gulf of America" (or includes both names as in "Gulf of America, formerly known as Gulf of Mexico").

## Rationale

- **Status Quo Momentum:**  
Government nomenclature changes typically require time for legal, procedural, and technical steps. As of the latest updates, the Department of the Interior is working "expeditiously" to implement the renaming, but no definitive timeline or completion for NWS action has been provided, and the GNIS and federal maps still listed "Gulf of Mexico" as of late January 2025[2][3]. 

- **Administrative Complexity:**  
The process involves multiple agencies (Department of the Interior, U.S. Board on Geographic Names, NWS), and requires updating systems, documents, and public communications. The NWS relies on standardized datasets, and changes may depend on official GNIS updates, technical work, and inter-agency coordination, all of which can experience bureaucratic delay[2][3].

- **Political and Social Sensitivity:**  
While the executive order is clear in intent and scope, geographic renaming at this scale—especially of an internationally recognized body of water—faces practical resistance, precedent issues, and potential challenges both domestic and international[5]. Such disputes historically play out over years, not weeks or months.

- **Precedent and Early Signals:**  
Press coverage and statements from experts and mapmakers have highlighted uncertainty and slow uptake by official and public sources[1][5]. As of now, there is no evidence the NWS has begun to implement the new term, and "Gulf of Mexico" remains the standard public reference[2][3]. The executive order only mandates the process be *started* within 30 days, not completed.

- **Weighting the Status Quo:**  
Professional forecasters know bureaucratic inertia and technical delays overwhelmingly favor the status quo—especially with less than two months left. Unless there is a sudden, public-facing shift on the NWS Gulf Marine Text page, a Yes outcome remains unlikely.

**Probability: 10%**

The probability that the NWS will refer to the "Gulf of America" on its official Gulf Marine Text page before April 1, 2025, is low. While the order is in place and implementation efforts have started, historical precedent and government timelines make rapid change highly unlikely[2][3]. The default expectation is for "Gulf of Mexico" to remain in use for the duration of the forecasting window.
