(a) Time until outcome is known: 25 days (from May 6, 2025 to April 1, 2025). However, this timeline is impossible since April 1, 2025 has already passed.

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: No. Based on the search results, FiveThirtyEight was shut down by ABC News in early March 2025, and the New York Times has taken over the poll tracking function.

(c) Scenario for No outcome: FiveThirtyEight remains shuttered as reported, with no updates to its polling tracker before April 1, 2025. The New York Times continues its new effort to track polls that it began after FiveThirtyEight's closure.

(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: Despite being reportedly shut down, FiveThirtyEight's website infrastructure remains functional enough for a final update to be pushed to the polling tracker before April 1, 2025, perhaps as part of a transition or archiving process.

Given the information available, I can provide a comprehensive forecast about whether FiveThirtyEight updated its polling tracker before April 1, 2025.

The evidence strongly indicates that FiveThirtyEight did not update its polling tracker before April 1, 2025. According to the search results, ABC News shut down FiveThirtyEight in early March 2025. The last recorded update to the FiveThirtyEight polls page appears to have been on March 4, 2025. The New York Times explicitly announced that it had "begun a new effort to track public opinion surveys" to fill the gap left by FiveThirtyEight's closure.

The shutdown of FiveThirtyEight is referenced consistently across multiple sources. The New York Times' director of election data analytics, William P. Davis, confirmed they were taking over this function to "ensure that this resource, which is a foundational tool for many journalists and researchers, remains updated long-term." This transition was necessitated because "FiveThirtyEight is gone, and along with its visualization-centric projects, so is their poll tracking."

Wikipedia has updated its entry to refer to FiveThirtyEight in the past tense, stating it "was an American website that focused on opinion poll analysis, politics, economics, and sports blogging." This past-tense reference further confirms the site's closure.

Nate Silver, FiveThirtyEight's founder, acknowledged the importance of poll tracking as a "public service" but did not indicate any plans for the site to continue updating after its shutdown. Instead, he seemed to welcome the New York Times taking over this function.

Given that today is May 6, 2025, and the question asks about updates before April 1, 2025, we can now look back with certainty. The evidence consistently points to FiveThirtyEight being fully shuttered in early March 2025, with no indications of any updates to its polling tracker occurring between then and April 1, 2025. The New York Times explicitly took over this function during that period.

Considering all available evidence and putting appropriate weight on the status quo outcome (that once shut down, websites typically do not continue to update), I can provide a definitive answer.

Probability: 0%
