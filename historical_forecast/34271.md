(a) **Time Until Outcome Known:**  
The official February 2025 Eurozone inflation rate is already available and reported by Eurostat and Trading Economics as of early April 2025. Thus, the outcome is effectively known as of now.

(b) **Status Quo Outcome if Nothing Changed:**  
The reported annualized inflation rate for the Euro Area in February 2025 is **2.3%** according to both Eurostat and Trading Economics[1][4]. This is below the 2.4% threshold in question.

(c) **Scenario for a No Outcome:**  
A "No" outcome occurs if the finalized, widely referenced inflation rate for February 2025 remains at or below 2.4%. The flash estimate from Eurostat and the data on Trading Economics both confirm a rate of 2.3% for February, followed by a further drop to 2.2% in March 2025[1][4]. No material upward revisions or late-data adjustments are reported. Disinflation in energy and stable food prices have contributed to the softening.

(d) **Scenario for a Yes Outcome:**  
A "Yes" outcome would require a subsequent upward revision to the already published February inflation figure â€” such that the finalized Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) for February 2025 is revised **above 2.4%**. This could theoretically happen if post-publication data reveals much higher price increases in a major component, but current official releases do not indicate any reason to expect such a revision.

**Rationale:**  
As a forecaster, I place significant weight on the status quo outcome, especially when data is already released and confirmed by multiple reputable sources. Eurostat and Trading Economics both report February 2025 inflation at 2.3%[1][4]. The downward trend into March 2025 and lack of any signals for upward revisions make a late reversal unlikely. While all forecasts carry a degree of uncertainty due to possible data revisions, these are typically minor. Therefore, the probability of the inflation rate being revised above 2.4% is extremely low.

**Probability: 2%**
