(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
The outcome—whether Bashar al-Assad is President of Syria on December 31, 2024—will be known in 26 days from the current reference date of December 5, 2024.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
Until early December 2024, the status quo was that Bashar al-Assad retained tight control over Syria's presidency, supported by constitutional provisions and longstanding regime security[2]. Barring extraordinary events, Assad was constitutionally eligible to remain president until at least 2028[2].

(c) **Scenario that results in a No outcome:**  
A "No" outcome requires Assad to no longer hold the presidency on December 31, 2024. This would result from a defeat or forced removal from power—such as a sudden, successful rebel offensive, regime collapse, or foreign intervention that ousts Assad before the specified date.

(d) **Scenario that results in a Yes outcome:**  
A "Yes" outcome requires Assad to maintain power and continue officially as President of Syria through December 31, 2024. This would entail the regime withstanding domestic and external challenges, maintaining control of the capital, and preventing any decisive transfer of power.

## Rationale

Historically, Bashar al-Assad and his family have weathered frequent domestic uprisings, international isolation, and a lengthy civil war, maintaining a firm grip on power through a combination of military force, foreign alliances, and tightly managed political processes[2][3]. The 2024 parliamentary elections and the legislative framework suggested an entrenched, stable presidency up to 2028[1][2].

However, in late November and early December 2024, the military and political landscape changed dramatically. A broad coalition of opposition groups swiftly captured large swathes of Syrian territory, including major cities like Aleppo, after years of relative stalemate[4]. According to authoritative and convergent sources—including the Council on Foreign Relations—on December 8, 2024, Bashar al-Assad’s regime fell following the capture of Damascus and Assad’s subsequent flight to Moscow, signaling a clear and public end to his tenure as president[5]. This effectively ends his presidency before the December 31, 2024, threshold.

Given this well-documented ouster—including confirmation that Assad fled the country and was deposed by opposition forces—there is no credible path for Assad to regain the presidency by December 31; the collapse of regime control and loss of both military and political power are decisive[4][5].

## Final Answer

Probability: 0%

Bashar al-Assad will not be President of Syria on December 31, 2024, as he was deposed and fled the country on December 8, 2024, according to multiple authoritative sources[4][5].
