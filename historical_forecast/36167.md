(a) **Time until outcome is known:**  
From March 19, 2025, to March 31, 2025, is 12 days. The outcome will be determined by what appears on the ISW interactive map as of March 31, 2025.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
As of March 18, 2025, Ukrainian forces are still shown as controlling some territory in Kursk Oblast on the ISW maps[2]. If there is no significant change, Kursk would *not* be shown as completely retaken by Russia on March 31—resulting in a "No" outcome.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
Ukrainian forces maintain a foothold in any part of Kursk Oblast, and the ISW map on March 31, 2025, continues to display "Ukrainian Advances in Russia." Regardless of Russian statements or ongoing offensives, if the ISW map shows any Ukrainian-controlled area in Kursk, the answer is "No."

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
Russian forces recapture all territory in Kursk Oblast previously controlled by Ukraine before March 31, and the ISW map as of that date shows *no* "Ukrainian Advances in Russia" or any Ukrainian-controlled positions within Kursk. This would clearly satisfy the resolution criteria for a "Yes" outcome.

## Rationale

Based on the information as of March 18, 2025:

- Ukrainian forces are still present in Kursk Oblast according to ISW’s latest maps[2].
- There are public Russian claims (as of March 13) that they are close to driving Ukrainian troops out and retaking all of Kursk[3], but these have not yet been reflected on the ISW map, which is the resolution source.
- The time window (12 days) is short for a complete operational reversal, especially given that significant Ukrainian presence has persisted for weeks.
- March is typically a period when deteriorating ground conditions (the rasputitsa) slow down mobile offensives, possibly limiting the speed and effectiveness of Russian advances during the spring thaw.

In the absence of clear, recent momentum or evidence of a rapid Russian breakthrough, the status quo baseline—that Ukrainian control, however limited, will likely persist in some pocket—should be weighted most heavily in the forecast. Russian claims alone, without corroborating third-party mapping or evidence of collapse, are not enough for a confident forecast of total retaking within this short period.

## Final Assessment

**Probability: 30%**

- The scenario for a "Yes" remains possible if the Russian offensive achieves a breakthrough and Ukrainian positions collapse quickly, but the most likely outcome given current information is that at least a small area controlled by Ukraine will remain by March 31, 2025, according to the ISW map[2][3]. The status quo (Ukrainian presence persists) remains the higher probability outcome.
