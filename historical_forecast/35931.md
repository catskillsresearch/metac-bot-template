I'll analyze the likelihood of the Project 2025 Tracker classifying at least 120 objectives as "Done" by April 1, 2025.

(a) Time left until outcome: 25 days (from May 6, 2025 to April 1, 2025 - this is a retroactive analysis since the current date is past the resolution date)

(b) Status quo outcome: Based on the available data, it appears that several Project 2025 objectives were completed by March 14, 2025, with more scheduled for completion throughout March and into April. However, the exact number classified as "Done" by April 1 is unclear from the search results.

(c) No outcome scenario: Implementation of Project 2025 faces significant public opposition (only 13% support according to available data) leading to effective resistance through legal challenges, congressional opposition, or administrative hurdles, resulting in fewer than 120 objectives being classified as "Done" by April 1, 2025.

(d) Yes outcome scenario: The strategic placement of Project 2025 authors in top administration positions facilitates rapid implementation of planned objectives, with the administration prioritizing quick policy changes, especially those achievable through executive action, resulting in 120 or more objectives being classified as "Done" by April 1, 2025.

## Analysis of Current Implementation Status

From the search results, we can see that the implementation of Project 2025 was actively underway as of March 14, 2025. The search results indicate that many of Project 2025's authors were placed in top-level positions in the administration and had "already started implementing it"[4]. 

The Project 2025 Tracker was documenting these implementations, with specific examples including:
- The Department of Homeland Security completed the elimination of the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties on March 21, 2025[2]
- Trade policy changes were being tracked, with several tariff-related actions documented through March 2025[3]
- FEMA reforms to shift disaster response costs from federal to state governments were being implemented[5]

## Implementation Pace Considerations

Several factors suggest a substantial pace of implementation:

1. Strategic positioning: Project 2025 authors in key government positions would facilitate faster implementation[4].

2. Executive actions: Many Project 2025 objectives appear to be implemented through executive orders and administrative actions, which can be executed relatively quickly compared to legislation.

3. Clear timeline: The search results show specific completion dates for objectives, indicating an organized implementation schedule[2][3].

However, counterbalancing factors exist:

1. Public opposition: Only 13% of Americans supported Project 2025 according to the search results[4], potentially creating political pressure against rapid implementation.

2. Complexity: Some objectives likely require complex regulatory processes or interagency coordination.

3. Legal challenges: Controversial policy changes often face court challenges that can delay implementation.

## Numerical Assessment

The search results don't provide a clear count of how many objectives had been classified as "Done" by March 14, 2025, nor do they specify the total number of objectives in Project 2025. This makes a precise numerical forecast challenging.

The Project 2025 Tracker appears to be actively monitoring implementation, with multiple sources confirming ongoing tracking efforts[4]. The search results show several objectives completed or scheduled for completion in March 2025, suggesting momentum in the implementation process.

Without more specific numerical data, I must rely on the qualitative evidence suggesting active implementation but also significant opposition. The strategic placement of Project 2025 authors in key positions suggests a commitment to implementation, but the 25-day timeframe until April 1, 2025 (from the latest search result date) may be insufficient to reach 120 completed objectives if the implementation was still in its early stages.

## Status Quo Consideration

As a forecaster, I recognize the importance of considering status quo outcomes. Typically, policy implementation proceeds more slowly than planned due to bureaucratic inertia and various forms of resistance. Without clear evidence of an extremely rapid implementation pace already underway, it would be unusual to see 120 distinct policy objectives fully implemented within the first few months of an administration.

The search results suggest implementation was proceeding, but don't indicate an extraordinary pace that would clearly surpass the 120-objective threshold by April 1, 2025.

Probability: 45%
