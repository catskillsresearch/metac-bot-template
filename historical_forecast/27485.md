(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
The FOMC September 2024 meeting is scheduled for September 17–18, so the outcome will be known in about four weeks.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
The federal funds target rate remains at approximately 5.3%. If there is no change, the Fed will leave rates unchanged at the September meeting.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
If economic data between late August and mid-September show a rebound in inflation or a stabilization/improvement in the labor market—for example, a strong August jobs report or a hotter-than-expected inflation print—the Fed may choose to hold rates steady. Fed officials, particularly Chair Powell, have emphasized data dependence and signaled caution if disinflation progress stalls or reverses[3][4].

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
If incoming data continue to point to weakening economic growth, rising unemployment, and subdued inflation—such as another disappointing jobs report or further deceleration in core inflation—the Fed will likely respond with a 25 bps rate cut at the September meeting. This action aligns with recent Fed communications suggesting a rate cut is "on the table," strong market pricing for cuts, and Wall Street consensus forecasts of a September rate cut[1][2][3][4].

## Rationale

The balance of current data and Fed communication strongly favors a rate cut at the September meeting:

- **Market expectation:** Futures markets are pricing in multiple rate cuts in 2024, with a September cut widely anticipated as the starting point[1][3].
- **Fed signaling:** The Fed's language has shifted notably. Chair Powell and the July FOMC statement both indicate that a rate cut is approaching, provided that data continue to show "modest further progress" on inflation and ongoing labor market softness[3].
- **Economic backdrop:** July's jobs report significantly missed expectations, unemployment has increased, and inflation is described as only "somewhat elevated." These developments match conditions Powell highlighted as necessary for a cut[3][4].
- **Consensus forecasts:** Major Wall Street economists and strategists now expect a cut in September, with some predicting a possible 50 bps move, though a 25 bps cut remains the base case[3][4].

However, the Fed is highly data-dependent, and there remains a non-trivial risk that a strong August jobs/inflation report could delay the initial rate cut or prompt a "wait and see" decision. Additionally, while some market participants expect a larger (50 bps) cut, moderation is likely unless the data deteriorate notably further.

Given the above, while the status quo (no cut) is possible, the preponderance of evidence and momentum is in favor of at least a 25 bps cut.
