(a) Time left until outcome: Approximately 7 months (from May 6, 2025 to January 1, 2025)

(b) Status quo outcome: WeWork continues to operate and Adam Neumann does not return as CEO.

(c) Scenario for No outcome: WeWork fails financially during its bankruptcy proceedings and ceases operations, OR Adam Neumann successfully negotiates a return to WeWork as CEO as part of a restructuring deal.

(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: WeWork successfully navigates bankruptcy and continues operating under new leadership without Neumann, maintaining its course with its current restructuring plans.

Based on the available information, I'll analyze the likelihood of WeWork continuously operating through January 1, 2025, without announcing Adam Neumann's return as CEO.

WeWork's current situation shows a company in bankruptcy proceedings with significant challenges. The most recent information indicates that Neumann made an attempt to buy back WeWork in March 2024, offering $650 million, but faced significant obstacles[5]. His bid was effectively blocked when a bankruptcy court judge approved WeWork's request for interim new financing over Neumann's objection[5]. 

WeWork's advisers have argued that Neumann's proposal through his new real estate firm Flow is not "actionable" as it would need to clear $4 billion in secured debt that WeWork had before filing for bankruptcy[5]. This suggests significant financial barriers to Neumann regaining control.

Although Neumann stated "This is not over" at the Bloomberg Technology Summit in May 2024[5], bankruptcy lawyers have noted that his bid in its current form faces substantial challenges. The confirmation hearing scheduled for May 30, 2024, was described as Neumann's "last opportunity" to convince the bankruptcy judge[5].

Current CEO Sandeep Mathrani has forecasted that WeWork would be cash-flow positive in 2024[4], suggesting the company has a restructuring plan that doesn't involve Neumann.

The status quo strongly suggests that Neumann will not return as CEO. He resigned in 2019 under pressure from investors[1], and since then has established new ventures, including his family office (166 2nd Financial Services) and Flow[1][5]. His recent attempt to buy WeWork appears to have been rebuffed by the bankruptcy court.

While WeWork's financial stability remains uncertain, there's no immediate indication that it will cease operations before January 1, 2025. The company appears to be working through its bankruptcy process with plans to continue operations.

Given the significant hurdles Neumann faces in his bid to regain control of WeWork, the court's rejection of his financing proposal, and WeWork's apparent preference for alternative restructuring plans, the status quo outcome (WeWork continues to operate without Neumann as CEO) seems most likely.

Probability: 85%
