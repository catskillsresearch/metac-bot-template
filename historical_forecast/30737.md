(a) **Time left until the outcome is known**: The question's outcome depends on accessing NOAA's data for November 2024, which may be verified on or after the resolution date. Given the current date is 12/04/2024, the information is likely to become available soon. However, there's a possibility that if issues arise in accessing the page, resolution may wait up until January 7, 2025.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed**: As of the latest available data, the global temperature for November 2024 was not yet confirmed to be greater than 1.31째C above the reference level according to NOAA.

(c) **Scenario for a No outcome**: A scenario where the November 2024 global temperature anomaly is less than or equal to 1.31째C would result in a **No** outcome. This could occur if there were a significant cooling trend not accounted for in current estimates or if there was an error in previous predictions that suggested higher anomalies.

(d) **Scenario for a Yes outcome**: A scenario where the November 2024 global temperature anomaly is confirmed to be greater than 1.31째C would result in a **Yes** outcome. This scenario aligns with continued warming trends observed in recent years and is consistent with overall global warming patterns.

Given the information available before 12/04/2024, while we do not have the official resolution data, global temperatures have been setting records and consistently showing positive anomalies. However, specific November 2024 data from NOAA confirming a temperature anomaly >1.31째C is not yet verified. Therefore, considering the status quo of warming trends but without the exact November data, the probability is based on overall trends rather than specific November data.

**Probability: 55%**
