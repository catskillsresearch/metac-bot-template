(a) Time left until outcome is known: Approximately 25 days (from March 7, 2025, until reports from March 2025 are accessible after April 1, 2025).

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: No cube-shaped UFO sightings reported for March 2025, as cube-shaped sightings are historically rare.

(c) Scenario resulting in a No outcome: March 2025 follows the historical pattern where cube-shaped UFO sightings remain rare, and none are reported during this specific month.

(d) Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome: At least one person reports a cube-shaped UFO sighting during March 2025, and NUFORC publishes this report in their database.

Based on the search results and the information provided, I can assess the likelihood of a cube-shaped UFO being reported to NUFORC in March 2025.

The National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC) maintains the largest independently collected database of UFO/UAP sighting reports available online. Their database is regularly updated with new reports as they are processed. According to the search results, NUFORC added 396 new reports received since March 13 (as noted in their December 22, 2024 update)[1].

Looking at the historical context, cube-shaped UFO sightings are relatively rare. The information indicates that December 2024 had six cube-shaped sightings, which was notable given their historical infrequency. This suggests that while cube-shaped reports do occur, they are not common in the NUFORC database.

Examining the recent reporting patterns from the search results, I can see that NUFORC has already received and logged several reports for the early months of 2025. The database shows reports from various states including Missouri (with reports dated 03/13/2025, 03/15/2025, and 03/28/2025)[2], South Carolina (with a report from 03/11/2025)[4], and others. This demonstrates that the reporting system is active and functioning for 2025 events.

The database is organized in various ways, including by event date, state/country, shape of UFO, and date posted[3]. This organization makes it possible to track specific types of sightings, such as cube-shaped UFOs.

Given that:
1. NUFORC continues to actively collect and publish reports in 2025
2. Reports for March 2025 are already being logged in the system
3. Cube-shaped UFOs, while rare, do appear in the reporting history

However, considering that:
1. Cube-shaped sightings are historically uncommon
2. The specific timing requirement (March 2025) narrows the window of opportunity
3. The status quo suggests most months would not have a cube-shaped sighting

The probability of a cube-shaped UFO being reported in March 2025 is relatively low but not negligible. December 2024 demonstrated that clusters of cube-shaped reports can occur, but this appears to be an exception rather than the rule.

Weighing the historical rarity against the recent precedent, and considering that the status quo typically prevails (as good forecasting practice suggests), I would assess that the probability is below 50% but not extremely low given the December 2024 precedent.

Probability: 25%
