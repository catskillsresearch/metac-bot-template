As a professional forecaster, I'll carefully analyze this question about Joe Biden signing 2+ executive orders between Election Day and January 1, 2025.

(a) Time left: The outcome will be known in approximately 26 days (from May 6, 2025 to January 1, 2025).

(b) Status quo outcome: Based on the search results and historical data provided, President Biden has consistently signed multiple executive orders in December throughout his presidency, averaging 3.67 orders in December (6 in 2021, 2 in 2022, 3 in 2023). If this pattern continues, the outcome would be "Yes."

(c) Scenario for No outcome: President Biden decides to focus on transition activities rather than issuing new executive orders. Given that he signed only one executive order in November 2024 and none in October 2024, this reduced pace of activity could continue through December, resulting in fewer than 2 executive orders during the specified period.

(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: As a lame duck president in his final month in office, Biden accelerates executive order issuance to cement his legacy and implement final policy priorities before leaving office. Following his historical pattern of increased December activity (averaging 3.67 orders), he signs at least 2 executive orders on pressing issues like biological research safety (mentioned in search result #1 as a May 5, 2025 executive order).

## Historical Analysis

Looking at Biden's executive order patterns throughout his presidency:

In 2021, Biden signed 77 executive orders, with 6 in December alone[3]. In 2023, he signed 24 executive orders throughout the year[2]. The search results also indicate he has continued to issue executive orders in 2025, with at least one on biological research safety signed on May 5, 2025[1].

December has consistently been an active month for Biden's executive orders:
- December 2021: 6 orders
- December 2022: 2 orders
- December 2023: 3 orders

This indicates a clear pattern of multiple December executive orders throughout his presidency.

## Lame Duck Period Considerations

Presidential behavior during the lame duck period (between election and the next administration taking office) often shows increased executive action. Outgoing presidents frequently use executive orders to solidify their legacy and implement policies that might be difficult to reverse. This historical pattern suggests an increased likelihood of executive order activity during December 2024.

Additionally, the search results show that Biden has continued to use executive orders even into 2025 (with the May 5, 2025 order on biological research safety)[1], demonstrating his ongoing willingness to use this presidential power.

## Additional Contextual Factors

The search results indicate Biden has used executive orders for significant policy implementations throughout his presidency, including:
- A May 2022 executive order on police reform[5]
- An executive order prioritizing rehabilitation for federal prisoners[5]
- Orders addressing cybersecurity, federal sustainability, and various other policy domains[4]

The White House continues to maintain an active Presidential Actions page where executive orders are published[1], indicating the administrative infrastructure for issuing orders remains in place.

While putting appropriate weight on the status quo pattern of multiple December executive orders, I must also consider the uncertainty inherent in predicting specific presidential actions. However, given Biden's consistent history of December executive orders (never fewer than 2 in any December of his presidency), and the typical pattern of increased executive action during the lame duck period, there is strong evidence supporting a "Yes" outcome.

Probability: 75%
