(a) Time left until outcome: Based on the current date (May 6, 2025), the outcome of this question is already known, as it depends on data from November 2024, which would have been released around December 12, 2024.

(b) Status quo outcome: According to the search results, Hartford, CT had a home value increase of 7.0% according to Zillow data mentioned in the first search result[1].

(c) Scenario for No outcome: If Hartford's housing market experienced a slowdown after the data from search result [1] was published, possibly due to increased inventory, longer days on market, or economic factors affecting Connecticut specifically, the year-over-year increase could have fallen below 7.0%.

(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: If the housing market in Hartford maintained or accelerated the 7.0% growth rate mentioned in search result [1], possibly driven by continued demand in Connecticut where home prices were reported to be up 10.9% year-over-year in February (though this is from 2023 data)[3].

Looking at the available search results, I can see that Hartford, CT had a home value of $362,743 with a 7.0% change according to Zillow data from November 20, 2024[1]. This directly answers the question about whether Hartford's year-over-year home price increase was greater than or equal to 7.0% in November 2024.

The data from the other search results provides additional context but is either older or less specific to Hartford. For instance, information about Connecticut's overall housing market from 2023 shows a 10.9% year-over-year increase[3], but this is both outdated and for the entire state rather than Hartford specifically.

Another search result shows Hartford's home value at $323,663[5], but this appears to be from August 2024 data and doesn't provide the year-over-year percentage change needed to answer the question.

Given that we have direct evidence from the most recent and relevant search result (November 20, 2024) showing exactly 7.0% year-over-year growth for Hartford[1], and no more recent data contradicting this, I can conclude that the answer is yes.

Probability: 100%
