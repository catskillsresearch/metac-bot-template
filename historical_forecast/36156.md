(a) The time left until the outcome to the known is 11 days (from March 18, 2025 to March 29, 2025).

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be that Tesla maintains a higher market cap than Walmart, as the most recent data shows Tesla at $844.9 billion versus Walmart at $736.8 billion.

(c) A scenario resulting in a No outcome would be if Tesla's stock stabilizes or rebounds from its recent decline, while Walmart maintains its current growth trajectory or experiences slower growth, keeping Tesla's market cap above Walmart's by March 29, 2025.

(d) A scenario resulting in a Yes outcome would be if Tesla's stock continues its significant downward trend described by JPMorgan analysts as "potentially historic," while Walmart maintains steady growth or experiences a surge in value, allowing Walmart to surpass Tesla's market cap by March 29, 2025.

When addressing this forecasting question, I need to carefully examine the available data and recent trends for both companies.

Looking at the most recent comprehensive market cap data from March 2025, Tesla ranks 10th globally with a market cap of $844.9 billion, while Walmart ranks 13th with $736.8 billion[4]. This represents a gap of approximately $108.1 billion between the two companies.

However, there's a significant discrepancy in the data. Another source from March 6, 2025, reports Tesla's market cap at just $260 billion and Walmart at $259 billion[1]. While this source shows a much smaller gap between the companies, it still indicates Tesla maintaining a slight edge over Walmart. The large difference between these figures suggests potential methodological differences in calculation or reporting dates.

A more recent data point from May 2, 2025 (which is actually a future date from our current perspective) indicates Walmart's market cap at $790.09 billion, representing a 9.44% increase over the previous 30 days[5]. This suggests Walmart is experiencing strong upward momentum.

Tesla's stock is experiencing what JPMorgan analysts describe as a potentially historic decline in early 2025. This negative momentum is a crucial factor that could significantly reduce Tesla's market cap advantage over Walmart in the short term.

As a forecaster, I must weigh the status quo heavily, as markets typically don't undergo dramatic shifts in short timeframes. The $108.1 billion gap between Tesla and Walmart (based on the most reliable data) is substantial and would require significant movement to close within 11 days. However, Tesla's documented volatility and current downward trajectory combined with Walmart's steady growth presents a plausible scenario where this gap could narrow or even reverse.

Given the contradicting data points about the current gap, I need to consider both scenarios:
1. If the gap is indeed over $100 billion, it would be highly unlikely for Walmart to surpass Tesla in just 11 days under normal market conditions.
2. If the gap is much smaller (as suggested by the $260 billion vs $259 billion data), then even modest movements could shift the relative positions.

The JPMorgan analysis suggesting a historic decline for Tesla adds significant weight to the possibility of Walmart overtaking Tesla. However, historic market shifts of this magnitude typically play out over longer timeframes than 11 days.

Probability: 35%
