(a) **Time Left Until Outcome Is Known**  
There are about 1.5 months until March 31, 2025—the resolution date.

(b) **Status Quo Outcome If Nothing Changed**  
As of February 2025, OpenAI is not listed as "Exempt" on the Delaware Division of Corporations' records. Historically, OpenAI's for-profit entities (such as OpenAI LP) have not been classified as "Exempt;" only the nonprofit parent holds tax-exempt status, and exemptions in Delaware are typically for recognized nonprofits, not public benefit corporations (PBCs)[3][5].

(c) **Scenario Resulting in a No Outcome**  
OpenAI successfully transitions its primary operations to a Delaware public benefit corporation, but this new entity is not listed as "Exempt" on March 31, 2025. This would be the default scenario if:

- The PBC structure is implemented, but Delaware only lists classic 501(c)(3) nonprofits as "Exempt."
- The legal and regulatory complexity of the restructure delays the formal conversion or reclassification past the resolution date[2][3].
- Investigations or regulatory reviews from California or the IRS delay OpenAI's ability to change its exemption status[4].

(d) **Scenario Resulting in a Yes Outcome**  
By March 31, 2025, Delaware's Division of Corporations lists OpenAI's relevant entity (file number 5902936) as "Exempt." This could occur if:

- OpenAI's legal team successfully completes the restructure and files necessary documentation to have the new PBC (or another qualifying entity) recognized as "Exempt" in Delaware before March 31, 2025.
- Delaware determines that the particular features of OpenAI's post-conversion structure—such as nonprofit control, charitable assets, or a unique arrangement—qualify the entity for exemption.

**Rationale and Forecast**  
OpenAI has publicly committed to a substantial corporate restructure, moving core operations into a Delaware public benefit corporation and shifting control away from the original nonprofit board[1][2]. However, available reporting and legal analysis highlight several obstacles:

- "Exempt" status under Delaware law is generally reserved for strictly nonprofit, tax-exempt organizations[3]. Most public benefit corporations, even if mission-driven, do not qualify for this designation[5].
- OpenAI's own statements suggest that the nonprofit will become a shareholder in the for-profit PBC, not the controlling entity, which is unlikely on its own to satisfy "Exempt" requirements[2].
- Legal opinions emphasize that such restructurings are complex and subject to regulatory scrutiny, which could delay or complicate any change in official status[3][4].
- As of February 2025, there is no definitive evidence—public filings, announcements, or legal precedents—indicating that the new OpenAI entity will be listed as "Exempt" by Delaware on or before March 31, 2025.

Given the weight of institutional inertia, legal/regulatory hurdles, and the absence of direct precedents for a for-profit public benefit corporation being classified as "Exempt" in Delaware, the status quo outcome (No) remains the most likely.

**Probability: 15%**

There is a slim possibility of a rapid and creative legal/administrative maneuver leading to "Exempt" status, but the base rate and structure of the proposed transition make this outcome unlikely.
