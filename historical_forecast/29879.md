(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
As of November 11, 2024, there are approximately 50 days until January 1, 2025—the deadline by which the new Icelandic prime minister must receive the mandate from the president for the question to resolve "Yes." The parliamentary election is scheduled for November 30, 2024, so government formation will need to happen swiftly for "Yes" to be possible.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
Currently, Bjarni Benediktsson of the Independence Party is the caretaker prime minister. If no government is formed and no mandate is given by January 1, 2025, the question resolves "No." Historically, the Independence Party has dominated Icelandic politics and often held the prime ministership[5].

(c) **Scenario for a No outcome:**  
A "No" outcome would occur if:
- The Social Democratic Alliance (SDA, Samfylkingin) does not secure enough seats to lead coalition formation.
- Coalition negotiations are protracted and no one receives the mandate by the January 1, 2025 deadline.
- Another party, such as the Independence Party or another coalition partner, secures the mandate instead.
- Even if the SDA is the largest party, coalition math or political agreements could prevent its leader from becoming prime minister, as has occurred in previous Icelandic coalitions[5].

(d) **Scenario for a Yes outcome:**  
A "Yes" outcome would happen if:
- The Social Democratic Alliance becomes the largest party in the election (as current polls suggest).
- The SDA successfully assembles a coalition and its leader receives the president’s mandate to form a government before January 1, 2025.
- Other opposition parties (such as the Pirates, Progressive Party, Reform, or Left-Greens) agree to support or join an SDA-led government, allowing the SDA leader to emerge as the new prime minister.

## Rationale

Recent polling indicates the Social Democratic Alliance is poised for a historic result, polling nearly 30% and leading the field[5]. The current government parties, including the Independence Party, are experiencing historically low support, and public appetite for a political reset is apparent[2][5]. In Iceland, coalition government is the norm, and the largest party does not always claim the prime ministership; this was evident in 2017 when the Left-Green Movement leader became PM despite the Independence Party being larger.

However, the process of coalition formation in Iceland is complex and can be unpredictable. The SDA’s lead in the polls gives it a strong starting position for coalition talks, but whether it can lock in the necessary partners (amidst a fragmented parliament and historic aversions between some parties) remains to be seen. Delays in coalition talks are possible, especially if negotiations are contentious. Should this happen and no mandate is given by January 1, the resolution will be "No" by default.

Historically, change is slow and the status quo—where the Independence Party and its allies find a way to retain or negotiate their way to the premiership—cannot be discounted. But current momentum and polling data point to a genuine opportunity for the Social Democratic Alliance to lead the next government.
