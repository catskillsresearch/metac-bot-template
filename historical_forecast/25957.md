(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
As of July 10, 2024, there are 11 days remaining until the official conclusion of the 2024 Tour de France on July 21, when the winner will be formally recognized.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
Tadej Pogačar would win the 2024 Tour de France. He is the consensus pre-race and mid-race favorite due to his recent dominating form (notably his commanding victory at the 2024 Giro d’Italia), superior team support, and the compromised condition of his main rival, Jonas Vingegaard, who is returning from a serious crash earlier in the season[2][4][5].

(c) **Scenario that results in a No outcome:**  
Pogačar suffers a setback—such as a crash, illness, or tactical error—that significantly hampers his performance or forces him to abandon the race. Alternatively, a rival like Vingegaard, Roglič, or Evenepoel exploits a moment of weakness or stages an extraordinary comeback, overtaking Pogačar in the general classification during a critical mountain stage or the final time trial[1][3][4].

(d) **Scenario that results in a Yes outcome:**  
Pogačar maintains his current form and avoids major mishaps, leveraging his strong UAE Team Emirates squad to defend or extend his lead through the mountain stages and time trial, ultimately crossing the finish in Nice as the overall winner and being officially recognized as such[2][3][5].

## Rationale

Tadej Pogačar is widely regarded as the strongest overall contender for the 2024 Tour de France. He arrived at the race on the back of a dominant Giro d'Italia and with arguably the most formidable team in recent Tour history, featuring several potential podium finishers as domestiques[2][5]. His competitors—including two-time defending Tour champion Jonas Vingegaard—face significant questions, especially regarding Vingegaard’s fitness and team support after his spring injury and a turbulent season for Visma-Lease a Bike[2][4].

The course design, which features early and repeated high-mountain challenges plus a decisive individual time trial, suits Pogačar’s strengths as a climber and an all-rounder[3]. Major cycling analysts and team insiders have referred to the 2024 Tour as “Pogačar’s race to lose,” reinforcing the consensus that he is the default pick if the race follows expected patterns and he avoids mishaps[2].

Nonetheless, professional cycling—especially a Grand Tour spanning three weeks—always carries substantial uncertainty. Crashes, illness, and tactical surprises have derailed favorites in previous editions. The presence of elite rivals such as Vingegaard, Roglič, and Evenepoel ensures that any lapse can be swiftly punished, and the Tour’s unpredictable nature remains a meaningful factor[4].

Weighing all factors, prudent forecasters give extra weight to the status quo, especially with expert and bookmaker consensus, superior team dynamics, and race conditions aligning with the favorite. Therefore, while acknowledging real risks, the probability that Tadej Pogačar will win the 2024 Tour de France remains high.

**Probability: 70%**
