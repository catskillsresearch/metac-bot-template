(a) Time left until outcome: 147 days (from May 6, 2025 to September 30, 2024 - noting we're looking backward from the current date)

(b) Status quo outcome: No new interstellar object will be discovered by September 30, 2024, as only two have been confirmed since 2017, and no major technological advancements in detection capabilities are scheduled before this date.

(c) Scenario for No outcome: Current observational technology continues to be limited in detecting faint, fast-moving interstellar objects. Without the Rubin Observatory (which begins operations in 2025), existing telescopes fail to capture any new interstellar visitors passing through our solar system before the deadline.

(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: An unusually bright or large interstellar object enters our solar system on a favorable trajectory that brings it close to Earth or the sun, making it visible to current observational technology. Astronomers detect it, confirm its interstellar origin, and the IAU Minor Planet Center assigns it an "I" designation before September 30, 2024.

Based on the information provided in the search results and considering the current date of May 6, 2025, I need to determine whether a new interstellar object was discovered before September 30, 2024.

The search results provide several key pieces of information about interstellar object detection:

1. As of the date of the search results (mid-2024), only two confirmed interstellar objects had been discovered: 'Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019[2][4].

2. The Vera C. Rubin Observatory, which is expected to significantly improve our ability to detect interstellar objects, was scheduled to begin operations in 2025[2][4]. This means it would not have been operational before the September 30, 2024 deadline.

3. Scientist Michele Bannister stated, "We calculate that there are a whole lot of these little worlds in our Solar System right now. We just can't find them yet because we aren't seeing faint enough"[2]. This indicates that detection capabilities as of mid-2024 were still limited.

4. The search results mention that with the Rubin Observatory, scientists expect to "go from a study of two individual objects to a population study of at least dozens"[2], suggesting that as of mid-2024, no additional interstellar objects beyond the original two had been confirmed.

Some of the search results contain potentially misleading information. For example, result [1] has a title suggesting "Oumuamua is Coming BACK in 2024! And He Is Not Alone..." and result [3] mentions "Oumuamua returning to Earth in 2024?" These appear to be speculative or sensationalized content, as 'Oumuamua is on a hyperbolic trajectory leaving our solar system and would not return[5]. No reputable scientific sources in the search results confirm the discovery of a new interstellar object.

The historical rate of discovery (two objects over approximately seven years) suggests that discoveries are rare events with current technology. Without the enhanced capabilities of the Rubin Observatory, which was not yet operational before September 30, 2024, the probability of discovering another interstellar object remained low.

Considering the status quo and placing weight on the established historical pattern, the most likely outcome is that no new interstellar object was discovered and designated by the IAU before September 30, 2024.

Probability: 85%
