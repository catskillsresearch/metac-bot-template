(a) Time left until outcome: The outcome of this question will be known shortly after the 2024 US elections on November 5, 2024, once results for both the presidential race and House of Representatives are certified. This is about 6 months from today (May 6, 2025).

(b) Status quo outcome: Currently, Republicans control the House of Representatives (220-212 with three vacant seats)[1], while Democrats hold the presidency (Joe Biden is President until January 2025).

(c) Scenario for No outcome: The Republican candidate wins the presidency AND Republicans maintain control of the House of Representatives. Alternatively, the Democratic candidate wins the presidency AND Democrats flip the House to gain control. In either case, the same party would hold both the White House and the House of Representatives.

(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: The Republican candidate wins the presidency BUT Democrats flip enough seats to gain control of the House. Or, the Democratic candidate wins the presidency BUT Republicans maintain control of the House of Representatives. In either scenario, different parties would control the White House and the House.

The 2024 congressional and presidential races are expected to be extremely competitive based on current polling and analysis. Looking at the available information, several key factors influence my forecast:

First, gerrymandering provides Republicans with a significant structural advantage in House races. The Brennan Center estimates that gerrymandering gives Republicans an advantage of around 16 House seats compared to fair maps[2]. This built-in advantage makes it more likely that Republicans will maintain control of the House.

Currently, Republicans hold the House by a very narrow margin of 220-212 with three vacant seats[1]. This razor-thin majority means that Democrats would only need to flip a small number of seats to gain control. The margin is one of the narrowest in House history, with Republicans losing their majority if just five members defect on any vote[1].

While midterm elections typically result in losses for the president's party, Democrats performed better than expected in 2022, limiting their losses to just seven seats[1]. This suggests potential Democratic strength heading into 2024, particularly with Vice President Harris as the likely Democratic nominee following President Biden's withdrawal from the race[1].

For the presidential race, polling shows an extremely close contest, with neither party having a clear advantage. The presidential outcome could influence down-ballot races through coattail effects, but given the polarized nature of American politics, split-ticket voting (voting for different parties for different offices) has become less common.

The status quo currently features divided government, with Republicans controlling the House and Democrats holding the presidency. Historical patterns show that divided government is relatively common in American politics, occurring in 42 of the last 78 years.

Considering these factors, and placing weight on the status quo and structural advantages, I believe there's a slightly higher chance that different parties will control the White House and House of Representatives after the 2024 elections.

Probability: 60%
