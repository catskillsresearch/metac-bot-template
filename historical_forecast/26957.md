(a) Time left until outcome is known: 26 days (from August 6, 2024 to September 1, 2024)

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: No deadly attack within Israel's borders attributed to Iran causing 5+ deaths in a 24-hour period.

(c) Scenario resulting in a No outcome: Iran chooses a calibrated response that falls short of the criteria, such as launching a symbolic missile attack with minimal casualties, directing proxy forces to attack Israeli interests outside Israel's borders, or delaying its response beyond September 1st while maintaining diplomatic pressure.

(d) Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome: Iran launches a coordinated missile and drone attack directly targeting Israeli population centers or critical infrastructure, overwhelming Israel's air defenses and causing at least 5 fatalities within Israel's borders in a 24-hour period, and explicitly takes credit for the operation.

Based on the search results and my analysis of the situation between Iran and Israel, I believe there is a significant probability that Iran will carry out a deadly attack within Israel before September 1, 2024.

The assassination of Hamas Political Bureau Chairman Ismail Haniyeh on Iranian soil represents an extraordinary escalation in the ongoing conflict. Iranian authorities have already begun preparing for retaliation, as evidenced by the notices to airmen (NOTAM) issued for parts of Iran, warning of likely disruption to GPS and navigational signals[1]. This mirrors actions taken before Iran's April 2024 attack on Israel[1].

Western intelligence sources suggest an imminent attack, with the Biden Administration reportedly telling Congress that an Iranian strike may occur as soon as August 5 or 6, 2024[1]. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken separately informed G7 counterparts that Iran might begin its attack within days[1]. These warnings from multiple intelligence sources strongly indicate Iran's intent to retaliate quickly.

Iranian armed forces have published a list of potential civilian and military targets in Israel[1], suggesting serious preparation for a substantial attack. Additionally, senior Iranian security officials, including Armed Forces General Staff Chief Major General Mohammad Bagheri and Supreme National Security Council Secretary Ali Akbar Ahmadian, have indicated that both Iran and its allies (the "Axis of Resistance") will retaliate against Israel[2].

However, there are important factors that might limit the deadliness of any Iranian attack:

1. Historical precedent suggests Iran calibrates its responses. The April 2024 attack, while large in scale, caused minimal casualties, suggesting Iran may prefer demonstrative rather than maximally destructive attacks.

2. Both Israel and Iran appear to want to avoid full-scale war. As noted by experts, "neither Israel nor Iran is seeking a full-scale war, which could be orders of magnitude deadlier than Israel's current war in Gaza against Hamas"[3].

3. Iran may choose to operate through proxies rather than direct attacks, which could make attribution more difficult or shift the attack locations outside Israel's defined borders.

The killing of Haniyeh on Iranian soil represents a more significant provocation than previous incidents. Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has reportedly ordered Iran to strike Israel directly in response to Haniyeh's killing[3], which elevates the likelihood of a direct attack rather than proxy action.

Based on the intelligence reports indicating an imminent attack, Iran's public preparations, and the severity of the provocation, I assess there is a higher than even probability that Iran will conduct a deadly attack meeting the stated criteria before September 1, 2024. However, Iran's historical preference for calibrated responses that avoid triggering all-out war somewhat moderates this assessment.

Probability: 65%
