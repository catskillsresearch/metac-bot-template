(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  
The flash estimate of Euro Area consumer confidence for March 2025 is scheduled for release on March 21, 2025. Today is March 17, 2025, so there are 4 days remaining until the outcome is published[2].

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
The most recent flash estimate, for February 2025, was -13.6 for the Euro Area, an improvement of 0.6 points from January[2]. Over the past year, values have hovered in the -14 to -13 range, with small monthly fluctuations. If nothing changed and recent trends continued, the March reading would likely fall around -13.6, possibly within a narrow band of -13.8 to -13.4.

(c) **Scenario for an unexpected outcome:**  
A surprise—such as a sudden escalation in geopolitical tensions, an unexpected economic data release, or a sharp change in financial markets—could disrupt sentiment. For example, if global trade tensions rapidly intensified or there was a sharp increase in energy prices, consumers might quickly turn more pessimistic, dropping the index 1–2 points or more into the -15s or lower. Conversely, a major positive policy announcement, unexpected economic stimulus, or sudden decline in inflation expectations could boost sentiment above recent levels.

## Rationale

The world tends to change slowly, and consumer confidence in the Euro Area has been stable, with modest, incremental improvements in early 2025. The February reading of -13.6 continued the trend, but the big picture is still one of subdued confidence, well below long-term averages[2][5].

Recent macroeconomic news has been mixed:
- The ECB’s March projections trimmed GDP growth for 2025 (0.9%, down from prior forecasts) and slightly increased inflation projections (2.3% for HICP)[1]. 
- The OECD revised its eurozone 2025 growth forecast down to 1.0%, citing weak investment and persistent uncertainty, particularly from trade and geopolitical tensions[5].
- The OECD also notes that both business and consumer sentiment have weakened in some countries[4].

These suggest downside risks to confidence, but the prevailing pattern is of slow, marginal change rather than sudden swings.

**Weight of Evidence:**  
- The baseline is for a value close to February's -13.6, possibly modestly better or worse.
- Small probability remains for a move into the -15s or even lower, if downside risks materialize or negative news emerges in the interim.
- A surprise improvement is also possible but less likely given the recent economic downgrades and ongoing issues.
