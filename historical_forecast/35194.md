(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  
Approximately 6 weeks remain until April 1, 2025, when the FDA's status of semaglutide injections will determine the resolution of this question.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
As of February 2025, semaglutide has been removed from the FDA's drug shortage list, with all forms labeled as "available" for several months. If this remains unchanged, the status on April 1, 2025, will be *not* in shortage[4].

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
If the current trends continue, with no significant supply chain disruptions, increased demand, or manufacturing issues, semaglutide will remain off the FDA shortage list, and the answer will be "No"—it is *not* in shortage on April 1, 2025[4].

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
If unexpected events occur—such as a surge in demand, new manufacturing problems, regulatory actions, or supply chain disruptions—that reduce available supply below demand, the FDA could relist semaglutide as "currently in shortage" before April 1, 2025, resulting in a "Yes" outcome[2][5].

## Rationale

The FDA’s removal of semaglutide from the shortage list indicates official confidence in stable supply and adequately met demand. This change follows a typical lag after all dose forms are listed as "available"—usually within two months, as reflected in comparable cases like tirzepatide[4][1]. Currently, all indicators—supplier reports, FDA database updates, and industry analysis—support that the shortage is resolved and that semaglutide will not be returned to the shortage list unless a significant, unexpected disruption arises.

The status quo is likely to persist, as sudden, severe supply chain shocks after resolution are rare. It is possible, but not probable, that extraordinary events could reverse the resolved status within the next six weeks, especially given the FDA’s history of caution and the recency of semaglutide’s removal from the shortage list.

**Probability: 90%**  
It is highly likely (though not absolutely certain) that semaglutide injections will *not* be listed as "currently in shortage" according to the FDA on April 1, 2025[4].
