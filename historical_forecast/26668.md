Before I provide my forecast, let me analyze this situation carefully:

(a) Time left until the outcome is known: 63 days (from today, July 29, 2024, to September 30, 2024)

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: J.D. Vance remains the Republican vice presidential nominee

(c) Scenario resulting in a No outcome: A major scandal or health crisis forces Vance to withdraw from the ticket, similar to Thomas Eagleton in 1972. The Republican party would then need to select a replacement through their established procedures.

(d) Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome: No major disqualifying events occur, and despite controversies and low favorability ratings, the Trump campaign maintains confidence in Vance as their running mate through September 30.

J.D. Vance was officially nominated as the Republican vice presidential candidate on July 15, 2024, at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee. As a first-term senator from Ohio, Marine Corps veteran, Yale Law School graduate, and author of "Hillbilly Elegy," Vance brings certain credentials to the ticket despite being relatively new to politics.

The historical precedent for replacing a vice presidential nominee after formal nomination is extremely rare. The only modern example is Thomas Eagleton in 1972, who withdrew due to revelations about his mental health treatment history. Such replacements typically require extraordinary circumstances - major scandals or serious health issues.

While Vance does face challenges - particularly his low favorability ratings (a -16% net favorability in the Midwest and -5% nationally) and controversial comments about "childless cat ladies" that referenced Kamala Harris - these issues were known before or shortly after his nomination. The Trump campaign selected him despite awareness of potential controversies, suggesting they see strategic value in his candidacy.

The Republican party has formally nominated Vance through their established procedures, and replacing him would create significant disruption to campaign messaging and strategy with just two months remaining before the election. Political parties are generally reluctant to make such dramatic changes unless absolutely necessary.

As of July 29, 2024, there have been no credible reports suggesting Vance will be replaced or has withdrawn from the ticket. While his controversies and low favorability could theoretically increase pressure, the status quo strongly favors his continued candidacy.

Unexpected events could still occur in the next 63 days - a major scandal, health crisis, or other disqualifying event - but without specific evidence pointing to such possibilities, the overwhelming probability favors the status quo.

Probability: 95%
