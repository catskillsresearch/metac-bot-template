(a) Time left until outcome: About 1 month. The outcome will be known after December 31, 2024, when all temperature data for December 2024 has been recorded.

(b) Status quo outcome: Based on historical data, it's typical for Chicago to remain below 60°F in December, but recent years (2022, 2023) have shown isolated days approaching or reaching this threshold.

(c) Scenario for No outcome: An unusually warm weather pattern or heat wave affects the Midwest in December 2024, causing at least one day to reach or exceed 60°F at Chicago Midway Airport, similar to what happened in December 2023.

(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: Normal winter conditions prevail throughout December 2024, with no anomalous warm spells, keeping all daily high temperatures below 60°F at Chicago Midway Airport.

December in Chicago is typically a cold winter month, with temperatures well below the 60°F threshold being the norm. Historical data shows that the average maximum temperature for December in Chicago hovers around 36.3°F, making it quite cold overall[4]. The normal pattern involves temperatures decreasing throughout the month, starting from about 43°F at the beginning and dropping to around 34°F by the end of December.

However, recent years have shown some anomalies. In December 2022, the highest temperature recorded was 57°F, and in December 2023, it reached 60°F. These examples demonstrate that while uncommon, temperatures approaching or reaching 60°F can occur during this winter month. These are outliers from the typical pattern but represent a real possibility that cannot be dismissed.

Climate patterns show that December temperatures in Chicago are consistently cold. The average temperature for the month is approximately 31.1°F, with average highs of 36.3°F and average lows of 27.2°F[4]. This indicates that most days in December fall well below the 60°F threshold.

When considering recent trends, it's worth noting that we've seen two consecutive Decembers (2022 and 2023) with high temperatures approaching or hitting the 60°F mark. This could suggest a warming trend in winter temperatures or simply represent normal variability with occasional warm days.

Weather is inherently unpredictable beyond short-term forecasts, especially when dealing with specific thresholds like 60°F for an entire month. While climate models might provide general guidance, they cannot reliably predict whether a single anomalous warm day will occur in December 2024.

The status quo suggests that most December days will remain below 60°F, but recent history shows that exceeding this threshold on at least one day is certainly possible. Given the observed pattern of occasional warm days in December over the past two years, and the general unpredictability of weather, there remains a significant chance that at least one day in December 2024 could reach or exceed 60°F.

Balancing the historical norms against recent observations and acknowledging the inherent uncertainty in long-range forecasting, I believe there is approximately a 70% chance that at least one day in December 2024 will reach 60°F or higher, meaning a 30% chance that all days will remain below 60°F.

Probability: 30%
