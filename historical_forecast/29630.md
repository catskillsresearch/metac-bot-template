(a) Time left until outcome is known: 7 months, 25 days (from May 6, 2025 until December 31, 2025)

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: Based on current information, there would be only 2 states with Waymo's rider-only service available to the general public (Arizona and California).

(c) Scenario for a No outcome: Waymo maintains service only in Arizona and California through 2025, while the planned Austin (Texas) and Atlanta (Georgia) expansions face regulatory delays or technical challenges, pushing their launch beyond December 31, 2025. Or, Waymo launches in 3 states or 5+ states instead of exactly 4.

(d) Scenario for a Yes outcome: Waymo successfully launches the already-announced expansions to Austin (Texas) and Atlanta (Georgia) in early 2025 as planned, bringing the total to exactly 4 states by December 31, 2025, with no further state expansions before year-end.

Based on the search results and the current state of Waymo's operations, I can provide a comprehensive forecast for this question.

As of May 2025, Waymo's rider-only ride-hailing service is publicly available in two U.S. states: Arizona (Phoenix metro area) and California (San Francisco and Los Angeles)[1][3][5]. The service has been steadily expanding within these existing markets, as evidenced by the addition of 90 square miles to their Phoenix territory in June 2024, bringing it to 315 square miles[1].

Looking at planned expansions, in September 2024, Uber and Waymo announced a partnership to bring autonomous ride-hailing to Austin, Texas and Atlanta, Georgia "beginning in early 2025"[4]. This announcement specifically states that these services would be available "only on the Uber app" and would grow to "hundreds [of vehicles] over time." The explicit timeframe of "early 2025" strongly suggests these expansions are planned to occur well before the December 31, 2025 resolution date.

## Considerations for the forecast

**Evidence for exactly 4 states:**
- Waymo has explicitly announced expansions to Texas (Austin) and Georgia (Atlanta) for "early 2025"[4]
- These expansions appear well-planned with specific operational details (e.g., fleet management by Uber, using Waymo's Jaguar I-PACE vehicles)
- Waymo has demonstrated ability to execute on expansion plans, as shown by their successful launch in Los Angeles after San Francisco

**Arguments against exactly 4 states:**
- Regulatory challenges could delay launches, as suggested by the California legislation mentioned in search result [3]
- Waymo might accelerate expansion to additional cities/states beyond the four currently known
- Technical or operational challenges might delay the planned Austin or Atlanta launches

## Historical expansion rate

Waymo has been methodical in their expansion. After operating in Phoenix for several years, they expanded to San Francisco, and then to Los Angeles. This suggests a careful, measured approach rather than rapid deployment across many markets simultaneously.

## Status quo bias consideration

Given Waymo's careful expansion strategy and the explicit announcements for Austin and Atlanta in early 2025, the most likely outcome is that Waymo will successfully launch in these two new states while maintaining operations in Arizona and California. The specificity of the timeline ("early 2025") provides reasonable confidence that these expansions will occur well before December 31, 2025.

There is no indication in the search results of plans for expansion to any fifth state before the end of 2025. While this could change, the status quo trajectory points to exactly 4 states by the resolution date.

Regulatory challenges represent the biggest risk to this forecast, as legislation could potentially slow Waymo's expansion plans[3]. However, the Uber partnership suggests a strategic approach to navigating potential obstacles.

Probability: 75%
