(a) Time left until outcome: 12 days (from May 6, 2025, looking back at April 1, 2025).

(b) Status quo outcome: Yes - according to the search results, the CDC had already reported six human H5N1 cases detected through national flu surveillance as of February 26, 2025[2], which exceeds the threshold of 4 cases.

(c) Scenario for No outcome: The CDC tracker page becomes unavailable by April 1, 2025, or the CDC revises its case count downward due to reclassification of previously confirmed cases. Another possibility is that the specific tracker referenced in the question shows different data than what's reported in the general situation summaries cited in the search results.

(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: The CDC continues to report the six cases already identified as of February 2025, with the possibility of additional cases being confirmed between February 26 and April 1, 2025, given the mention of an Ohio case in March 2025[1].

As a professional forecaster, I need to evaluate the likelihood that the CDC's H5N1 tracker showed more than 4 cases for 2025 on April 1, 2025.

## Analysis of Available Information

The search results provide several key pieces of evidence:

1. As of February 26, 2025, the CDC had reported six human cases of H5N1 detected through national flu surveillance[2]. This already exceeds the threshold of 4 cases.

2. The CDC sequenced the virus from the "most recent Ohio human case" as of March 19, 2025[1], indicating ongoing case detection and reporting.

3. An external source indicates that as of April 24, 2025, the CDC was reporting 70 confirmed human cases of H5 in the United States[5]. While this source may be using different criteria or aggregating data differently than the official CDC tracker, it suggests a substantial number of cases.

## Considering the Status Quo

The status quo strongly favors a "Yes" resolution. With six cases already reported by February 26, 2025, the CDC would need to have revised its case count downward substantially or the specific tracker would need to be using different criteria than the general situation summaries for the outcome to be "No."

Given the temporal proximity between February 26 and April 1 (just over a month), and the evidence of continued case detection in March 2025, it is highly unlikely that the number of cases would drop below 4 by April 1, 2025.

## Potential Complications

There are a few factors that could complicate this forecast:

1. The question specifically refers to a particular CDC tracker page that might display data differently than the general situation summaries cited in the search results.

2. The resolution criteria state that if the tracker page is no longer available, the question resolves as "No." However, there's no indication in the search results that the tracker was discontinued.

3. There could be retrospective reclassifications of cases, though this would be unusual for such a significant reduction.

## Weighing the Evidence

Looking at the available evidence, I see a very strong case for "Yes":
- Six cases were already reported as of February 26, 2025[2]
- Additional case(s) were detected in March 2025[1]
- External sources suggest even higher case counts by April 24[5]

The only substantial risk to a "Yes" outcome would be if the specific tracker referenced in the question was discontinued or showed substantially different numbers than the general situation summaries. However, given the CDC's ongoing monitoring and reporting efforts described in the search results, this seems unlikely.

Probability: 95%
