I'll analyze whether Denver's temperature will remain below 70°F for the entire month of December 2024.

(a) Time until outcome is known: The outcome will be known after December 31, 2024, which is about 7 months from now (May 2025).

(b) Status quo outcome: Based on historical data, Denver temperatures typically remain below 70°F in December. The average daily high temperature in December ranges from 45°F to 49°F, well below the threshold.

(c) Scenario for No outcome: An unusually warm weather pattern develops over Colorado in December 2024, similar to what happened in December 2023 when the temperature reached 71°F. A strong ridge of high pressure could settle over the region, bringing abnormally warm temperatures that exceed 70°F on at least one day of the month.

(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: Denver experiences a typical or cooler-than-normal December with no extreme temperature spikes. Weather patterns remain consistent with historical norms, keeping all daily high temperatures below 70°F throughout the month.

Denver's December weather typically features highs well below 70°F, with the average daily maximum temperature around 7°C (45°F). Looking at historical patterns, December in Denver is generally quite snowy with an average of 11 snowy days and average temperatures around 52°F at the beginning of the month.

The warmest Christmas Day on record in Denver was 69°F in 2005, which suggests that even on extreme occasions, temperatures have historically stayed below 70°F. However, climate trends indicate warming winters in Colorado over time. The average winter temperature in Denver has increased by about 1.4°F over the past 54 years, suggesting a gradual warming trend.

December 2023 saw an unusual spike to 71°F, breaking the pattern of previous years when temperatures remained below 70°F. This recent anomaly is particularly significant as it demonstrates that exceeding 70°F in December is now within the realm of possibility for Denver.

While most December days will almost certainly remain below 70°F, the question hinges on whether there will be even a single day that reaches or exceeds this threshold. Given that we've seen this threshold exceeded recently (December 2023), and considering the ongoing warming trend, there's a meaningful chance we could see at least one day above 70°F in December 2024.

However, such warm days are still rare exceptions rather than the rule. The vast majority of December days in Denver remain well below this threshold, and most Decembers pass without approaching 70°F at all. The 2023 occurrence may have been an outlier rather than the beginning of a consistent pattern.

Probability: 75%
