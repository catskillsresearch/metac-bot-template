(a) **Time left until the outcome is known**  
As of July 25, 2024, there are 67 days remaining until September 30, 2024, after which the outcome (whether the 2024 North Atlantic daily mean sea surface temperature exceeds 2023’s record of 25.4°C before October 1) will be known.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed**  
If current trends continue, the daily mean SST in the North Atlantic has been tracking above 2023 for the same periods and remains well above the historical average[4][5]. The status quo outcome, therefore, is that the 2024 temperature would likely surpass the 2023 peak before October 1, as the North Atlantic is entering its seasonal warming peak, and no immediate, sustained cooling events are in evidence[4][5].

(c) **Scenario for a No outcome**  
For "No" to resolve, the North Atlantic’s daily mean SST would need to fail to reach or exceed 25.4°C before October 1, 2024. This would occur if:
- Unusual weather patterns or persistent storms increased ocean mixing and surface cooling, preventing further warming.
- The warming trend plateaued or even reversed due to atmospheric changes (e.g., increased Saharan dust, upwelling, or a sudden AMOC strengthening).
- The record-warm start to the year was followed by a relatively cool (compared to 2023) late summer, an unexpected development given the current high baseline[3][4].

(d) **Scenario for a Yes outcome**  
For "Yes" to resolve, the 2024 daily mean SST simply needs to rise above 25.4°C for at least one day before October 1. This would follow if:
- The current anomalously high ocean heat content persists through the late summer, as indicated by the steep rise and consistently record (or near-record) temperatures through the first half of 2024[4][5].
- Seasonal warming continues as usual or accelerates due to continued climate anomalies or reduced cooling events.
- The Atlantic hurricane season is active but does not repeatedly induce enough cooling to offset the broad warming trend[2][3][4].

## Rationale

Historically, the North Atlantic’s SST peaks around late August or early September, so the most likely window for breaking the 2023 record is still ahead. The current year has already seen daily mean SSTs running consistently higher than 2023, and there is substantial evidence that ocean heat content remains high as of June and July 2024[4][5]. Although there was a brief end to the record streak in late April, the broader context is one of persistent, anomalous warmth throughout the Atlantic basin, with experts and multiple sources highlighting this as a driver of both climate and extreme weather anomalies[3][4][5].

Forecasters must place extra weight on the status quo, especially when all recent data point to a continuation of the trend. The main risk to this forecast is the possibility of unforeseen, persistent cooling events (such as a barrage of powerful storms, unusually sustained cloud cover, or changes in oceanic circulation) that outpace the underlying warming. However, the climatological inertia of the system and the position on the calendar (still two months from climatological peak) make this a low-probability risk.

Given all this, and the fact that even a brief, single-day spike is sufficient, the chance that 2024 will surpass the 25.4°C record set in 2023 before October 1 is high.

**Probability: 85%**
