I'll address this forecasting question about when Governor DeSantis will name Marco Rubio's Senate replacement.

(a) Time left until outcome: Approximately 7 weeks (from now, May 6, 2025, until January 1, 2025)

Wait - I need to clarify the timeline here. The current date is May 6, 2025, and we're evaluating whether an event did or did not occur before January 1, 2025, which was over 4 months ago. Since January 1, 2025 has already passed, the outcome to this question should already be known.

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: Based on the search results which only go up to November 2024, DeSantis had indicated he would likely name a replacement "by the beginning of January." The status quo trajectory at that time pointed to a decision very close to January 1, 2025, but not definitively before.

(c) Scenario for No outcome: DeSantis accelerated his vetting process due to political pressure, completed interviews ahead of schedule, and announced the replacement in late December 2024, possibly to align with holiday news cycles or to position the new appointee ahead of the new administration.

(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: DeSantis maintained his stated timeline of "by the beginning of January," conducted thorough vetting through December, and made the announcement on or shortly after January 1, 2025, possibly timing it with Rubio's formal resignation plan or the new Congress convening.

My rationale:

The search results indicate that as of November 18, 2024, Governor DeSantis had stated he expected to name Senator Rubio's replacement "by the beginning of January"[3][5]. This language suggests a timeline that aligns with or slightly follows January 1, rather than precedes it. 

Several factors support this interpretation:
- DeSantis explicitly mentioned that his administration was still in the preliminary vetting phase as of mid-November[3]
- He indicated that "more extensive vetting" would begin after the initial phase[3]
- Rubio would not actually resign until around January 20, 2025, when the Trump administration would take office[3]
- The appointment process had political complexities, including possible consideration of DeSantis's own future political aspirations[2]

Looking at historical patterns, political appointments often take longer than initially projected, especially when multiple candidates are being considered and when the actual vacancy hasn't yet occurred. The "beginning of January" language provides DeSantis flexibility and doesn't commit him to a pre-January 1 timeline.

While there was always a possibility DeSantis could have expedited his decision, the status quo trajectory based on his public statements and the normal pace of such political processes made it more likely that the appointment would occur at or after the beginning of January 2025, rather than before.

Probability: 75%
