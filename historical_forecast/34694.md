(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
The January 2025 CPI growth rate for Canada is typically released in mid-to-late February 2025. As of today (May 6, 2025), the outcome is already known and publicly available.

(b) **Outcome if nothing changed:**  
If the underlying price trends from late 2024 remained constant and assuming no policy shocks, the CPI growth rate would have hovered around 2.0%, matching recent headline rates and the Bank of Canada’s target[1][3].

(c) **Outcome if the current trend continued:**  
Heading into January 2025, CPI inflation had already cooled to 1.8% annually, aided by a GST/HST holiday, with forecasters expecting this figure to hold for January due to the full-month impact of the tax holiday on select goods (10-12% of the CPI basket)[5]. Core inflation also showed a gradual downward trend.

(d) **Expectations of experts and markets:**  
Desjardins and other major forecasters projected January 2025’s CPI growth rate at approximately **1.8%**, citing the temporary tax holiday as the key downward driver[5]. The Bank of Canada’s outlook, as of late January, was for inflation to remain near its 2% target, but with a temporary dip below due to the policy intervention[1][5]. Markets priced in continued measured rate cuts, showing expectations for slightly below-target inflation in early 2025.

(e) **Unexpected scenario resulting in a low outcome:**  
If the GST/HST holiday caused a larger-than-expected reduction in prices—due to more savings being passed through to consumers, or a sudden price drop in another major CPI component—CPI growth could have fallen closer to 1.5%.

(f) **Unexpected scenario resulting in a high outcome:**  
Conversely, if the impact of the tax holiday was muted (retailers not fully passing on the savings), or if a sharp increase in shelter or food prices offset the policy’s disinflationary effects, CPI could have stayed above 2% for January.
