(a) **Time Until Outcome Known**:  
As of November 21, 2024, there are about 41 days left until January 1, 2025, when we will definitively know whether President Joe Biden has completed his term up to that date.

(b) **Status Quo Outcome if Nothing Changes**:  
Joe Biden remains President until at least January 1, 2025. He has withdrawn from the 2024 presidential race but continues to serve as the 46th President. There is currently no active resignation, medical incapacity, or completed impeachment process removing him from office, so the default is that he will remain in office through the end of the year[2][4].

(c) **Scenario Resulting in a No Outcome**:  
Biden stays in office without resignation, death, or removal. No successful impeachment and removal occurs, and no extraordinary constitutional event forces him out before January 1, 2025. This is the default, status quo scenario, consistent with both historical precedent and current developments[2][3][4].

(d) **Scenario Resulting in a Yes Outcome**:  
A “yes” requires Biden’s term to end before January 1, 2025. This could happen if:
- He dies or is incapacitated and formally replaced.
- He resigns from office prior to that date.
- He is impeached by the House and convicted/removed by a two-thirds vote in the Senate before January 1, 2025 (highly unlikely given the Senate’s makeup and the faltering House impeachment effort[2][3][4]).
- A rare, extraordinary constitutional or legal development determines his term ends early.

## Rationale

The default outcome—and the strong base rate for modern presidents—is to finish their term if they have not been removed or resigned by this late stage. Historically:
- Only one president (Richard Nixon) has resigned, and that came under immense, bipartisan pressure after clear evidence of grave wrongdoing.
- No U.S. president has ever been removed by impeachment and Senate conviction.
- The House GOP’s impeachment effort “spluttered” and did not result in even a House vote, let alone removal, with leadership signaling no plans to advance it before the end of 2024[2][3][4]. While some GOP members produced reports alleging misconduct[5], these did not translate into actionable steps toward removal.
- As of late November 2024, Biden remains alive, has not indicated any intent to resign, and there’s no credible reporting on imminent health crises necessitating early departure.
- Stepping aside from the 2024 campaign does not affect his current constitutional authority as president, nor has it triggered formal efforts to replace him in office.

Given these facts, the overwhelming weight of evidence and precedent is on Biden remaining in office until January 1, 2025.

**Probability: 98%**  
The chance of Joe Biden *no longer* being president before January 1, 2025 is exceedingly low, barring unpredictable health or extraordinary legal circumstances.
