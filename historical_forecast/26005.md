(a) Time left until outcome: 6 days (July 15, 2024)
(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: No (Trump's lead is currently 2.4 points as of July 5, which is below the 3-point threshold)
(c) Scenario for No outcome: Trump's lead stabilizes or grows more slowly than expected, remaining below 3 points or exceeding 4 points by July 15
(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: Trump's lead continues to grow at the current pace, reaching between 3.1 and 4.0 points by July 15

The question asks whether Trump's lead over Biden will be greater than 3 and less than or equal to 4 percentage points in FiveThirtyEight's national polling average on July 15, 2024.

Looking at the available data, Trump's lead has been steadily increasing following the June 27 debate. The lead expanded from 0.2 percentage points on the day of the debate to 2.4 percentage points by July 5[1][5]. This represents a growth of 2.2 percentage points over approximately 8 days, or roughly 0.275 percentage points per day.

If this exact rate of increase were to continue from July 5 to July 15, Trump's lead would grow by an additional 2.75 percentage points (0.275 Ã— 10 days), reaching approximately 5.15 percentage points by July 15. This would exceed the upper bound of the question (4 points).

However, polling trends rarely maintain a constant rate of change. Several factors suggest the growth rate is likely to moderate:

1. Initial post-debate reactions tend to be the most dramatic, with polling shifts typically becoming less pronounced as time passes from the event.

2. The Biden campaign has acknowledged they need to turn perceptions around quickly and are actively working to counter negative impressions from the debate[5].

3. Polling averages like FiveThirtyEight's incorporate methodology that smooths out extreme fluctuations, giving more weight to recent polls but still accounting for a range of data points.

Looking at FiveThirtyEight's data as of July 9 (the most recent available in the search results), we don't have the exact current number, but we know the trend has been increasing[1][2]. The polling average from Nevada shows Trump leading Biden by 7 points according to FiveThirtyEight[5], suggesting strong momentum for Trump in swing states, though this doesn't directly tell us about the national average.

A deceleration in Trump's polling gains seems likely but not guaranteed. If the rate of increase slows to approximately half its post-debate pace (around 0.14 points per day), Trump's lead would grow by about 0.84 points from July 9 to July 15, potentially putting it in the 3-4 point range.

However, I must consider other possibilities:
- Trump's momentum might continue unabated, pushing his lead above 4 points
- Biden could see some recovery as Democrat voters "come home" to their party's candidate as the election becomes more salient[5]
- The polling trend could plateau earlier than expected

Weighing these factors, and considering that status quo tends to have strong inertia, I believe there's a moderate probability that Trump's lead will fall within the 3-4 point range by July 15. The most likely scenarios are either that Trump's lead will continue growing but at a decelerating rate, putting it just within the specified range, or that it will grow slightly faster, exceeding the 4-point threshold.

Probability: 45%
