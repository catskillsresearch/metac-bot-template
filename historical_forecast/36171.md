(a) Time left until outcome is known: About 26 days (from May 6, 2025 until before April 1, 2025)

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: The question is asking about a past time period that has already concluded, as we are now in May 2025 and the question asks about the period before April 1, 2025.

(c) Scenario for No outcome: Miami International Airport did not record any temperature readings of 90°F or higher between the question launch and April 1, 2025.

(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: Miami International Airport recorded at least one day with a temperature of 90°F or higher between the question launch and April 1, 2025.

I notice there's a significant misalignment in the timing of this question. Today is May 6, 2025, and the question asks about a prediction for a period that has already passed (before April 1, 2025). This means we're not making a forecast about the future but rather examining if a historical condition was met.

Based on the search results provided, I can analyze what likely happened during March 2025:

The AccuWeather forecast for Miami in March 2025 showed the highest temperatures would reach 86°F on March 25 and March 31[1]. While these temperatures approached 90°F, they did not reach the threshold specified in the question.

Looking at historical patterns, Miami temperatures in March typically range between 69°F and 77°F on average[3], though daily highs can exceed these averages. The data from AccuWeather shows several days in the mid-to-high 80s for Miami proper during March 2025[1].

It's worth noting that the search results do not provide actual recorded temperatures from the Iowa Environmental Mesonet for Miami International Airport (station MIA) for March 2025, which would be needed to definitively answer this question. The forecast data showed temperatures approaching but not reaching 90°F, suggesting that the temperature likely did not reach 90°F before April 1, 2025.

Since we're now in May 2025, this question is asking about historical data rather than making a forecast. Without access to the official Iowa Environmental Mesonet records for Miami International Airport during the specified period, I must rely on the forecast data provided, which suggests temperatures did not reach 90°F.

Probability: 10%
