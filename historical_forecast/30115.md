(a) Time until outcome is known: About 1.5 months (from November 15, 2024 to January 1, 2025)
(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: No (no confirmed reports of North Korean troops on Ukrainian soil)
(c) Scenario for No outcome: North Korean troops remain stationed only in Russia's Kursk region, focusing on defensive operations on Russian territory without crossing into Ukraine before January 1st.
(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: Russia decides to use North Korean troops in offensive operations, deploying at least 100 of them across the border into Ukrainian territory as part of a winter offensive before January 1st.

Thank you for this forecasting question. I'll analyze the available evidence to provide my probability assessment on whether North Korean troops will deploy to Ukraine before January 1, 2025.

Based on the search results and the current situation as of mid-November 2024, there are several key factors to consider:

As of early November 2024, approximately 10,000 North Korean troops are already in Russia, with up to 8,000 of them positioned in the Kursk region[1][2]. This represents a significant deployment of foreign military personnel to support Russia's war effort. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken stated on November 7, 2024 that these troops are expected to deploy into combat against Ukrainian forces "in the coming days"[1].

However, it's important to distinguish between:
1. North Korean troops engaging in combat (which seems imminent)
2. North Korean troops physically entering Ukrainian soil (which is the specific criterion for this question)

The current evidence indicates that North Korean troops are positioned in Russia's Kursk Oblast[2][5], part of which is currently occupied by Ukrainian forces following Ukraine's cross-border incursion earlier in 2024. The primary mission of these North Korean troops appears to be helping Russia reclaim this territory[5].

Several factors suggest these troops might not enter Ukrainian territory before January 1st:

1. Their immediate focus appears to be operations in Kursk Oblast, which is Russian territory
2. The timeframe is relatively short (approximately 6 weeks from mid-November to January 1st)
3. There is no confirmation that North Korean troops have even engaged in combat yet, let alone crossed into Ukraine proper

On the other hand, factors supporting possible deployment to Ukrainian territory include:

1. The large number of troops (10,000) suggests a significant commitment that could extend beyond just Kursk operations
2. U.S. officials have explicitly warned that North Korean troops will become military targets if they enter the battlefield[1], indicating they view this as a real possibility
3. The Pentagon has acknowledged these troops as "legitimate targets" for Ukrainian soldiers[2], suggesting potential direct confrontation

Giving extra weight to the status quo, I must recognize that as of mid-November 2024, there are no confirmed reports of North Korean troops on Ukrainian soil. The deployment appears focused on Russian territory in Kursk Oblast. While U.S. officials expect North Korean troops to engage in combat "in the coming days," this doesn't necessarily mean they will enter Ukrainian territory before January 1st.

The most likely scenario is that North Korean troops will initially focus on operations in Kursk Oblast, possibly engaging Ukrainian forces there without crossing into Ukraine proper before the January 1st deadline. However, given the fluid nature of the conflict and the substantial North Korean troop presence so close to the border, there remains a significant possibility they could enter Ukrainian territory as part of wider operations.

Probability: 35%
