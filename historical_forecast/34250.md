(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
There are just under two months remaining until the market cap rankings as of Friday, March 28, 2025, which will determine the outcome for March 29, 2025.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
Apple is currently ranked as the world's most valuable company by market capitalization, with a lead over Nvidia of approximately $500 billion as of January 2025[1][5]. If current growth rates and market sentiment persist, Apple would retain the top spot.

(c) **Scenario for an unexpected outcome:**  
A scenario where Nvidia overtakes Apple would involve Nvidia sustaining its extraordinary momentum from 2024 and early 2025, propelled by continued surging demand for AI infrastructure and next-generation chips. If Apple experiences stagnating sales or a correction, while Nvidia continues to deliver strong earnings beats and product launches, Nvidia could surpass Apple. An even more unexpected scenario would be Microsoft reclaiming the top spot, potentially through a major strategic acquisition or breakthrough in AI, cloud, or another core segment, but current growth rates make this a long shot. Another possibility, albeit highly unlikely, would be a major regulatory or geopolitical event causing a sharp downturn for the current leaders and elevating a different company (“someone else”).

## Rationale

- **Recent Performance and Trends:**  
  From December 2023 to April 25, 2025, Nvidia's market cap grew by 121.4% (up $1.49 trillion), outpacing all Magnificent Seven peers. Over the same period, Apple grew just 5% ($150 billion). As of late April 2025, Nvidia is closing the gap rapidly[5].

- **Momentum and Market Sentiment:**  
  Nvidia is riding a wave of massive AI-related demand. The company has consistently beaten analyst expectations, and there is widespread bullishness on its prospects into 2025. Apple, despite its dominant size, is experiencing slower growth and some warnings about valuation sustainability.

- **Absolute Market Cap Lead:**  
  Even with Nvidia’s surge, Apple held about a $500 billion lead at the end of January 2025. If the last four months’ momentum continues, Nvidia would likely overtake Apple by late March or early April 2025.

- **Microsoft and Others:**  
  Microsoft’s growth has lagged, with market cap up just 4.2% over the same recent period. Alphabet, Amazon, and other “Magnificent Seven” members are even further behind in terms of market cap growth and scale, making it highly improbable they will overtake both Apple and Nvidia before March 29, 2025[5].

- **Outlier Scenarios:**  
  Extreme events (e.g., a regulatory shock, global crisis, or a major acquisition) could disrupt the expected order, but there are no current indications of such developments.

## Final Probabilities

Apple: 53%  
Nvidia: 43%  
Microsoft: 2%  
Alphabet: 1%  
Amazon: 0.5%  
Someone else: 0.5%

Apple retains a slight edge due to its sheer current lead and history of stability, but Nvidia's powerful and accelerating growth makes it a strong contender to surpass Apple by the resolution date, with genuine two-way risk. Other contenders are highly unlikely given growth disparities and relative market cap sizes[1][5].
