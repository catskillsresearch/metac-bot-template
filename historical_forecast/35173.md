(a) **Time left until resolution:**  
As of today, May 6, 2025, there are approximately 8 weeks (about 54 days) until March 31, 2025, when the lawsuit count will be determined by the Just Security tracker.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changes:**  
The Just Security tracker for legal challenges against the Trump Administration was launched and began regular updates at the end of January 2025[2][3]. The tracker’s methodology is conservative: multiple similar lawsuits are often counted as a single case; appeals are not counted as new cases; and only cases where the Trump Administration is a defendant are included[2][3]. As of the latest public information (early February 2025), there is no exact published count, but the timing and the methodology suggest the count is likely to still be in the earlier double digits.

Given that only around six weeks elapsed from the tracker’s launch to now, and large, rapid increases are unlikely due to the methodology, it is reasonable to expect the count at the end of March to be modest—likely corresponding to the lower-numbered bins such as '29-35' or '36-40', unless a significant surge of executive actions and resulting lawsuits occurs.

(c) **Scenario for an unexpected outcome:**  
An unexpected outcome might occur if the Trump Administration issues a burst of highly controversial executive actions in February or March 2025, rapidly triggering numerous legal challenges across multiple domains (immigration, environment, education, etc.), and these are counted as distinct cases by the tracker. Alternatively, a procedural or methodological change at Just Security could cause the tracker to parse related lawsuits more granularly, resulting in a sudden jump in the published count—potentially pushing the total into much higher bins like '51-70' or even 'Greater than 70'.

## Final Probabilities

Based on the methodology’s conservatism, recent history, and the incremental changes typically observed, most probability is placed on the two lowest bins, with a moderate tail to allow for unforeseen legal or methodological developments:

- '29-35': 38%
- '36-40': 32%
- '41-50': 17%
- '51-70': 8%
- 'Greater than 70': 5%
