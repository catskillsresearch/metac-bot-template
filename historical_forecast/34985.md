To address this forecasting question effectively, I'll analyze the likelihood of China launching an antitrust investigation into Intel before April 2025.

(a) Time left until outcome: Approximately 10.5 months (from May 6, 2025 until April 1, 2025 - which is actually in the past from our current date)

(b) Status quo outcome: As of early February 2025, China is considering but has not yet officially launched an antitrust investigation into Intel.

(c) No outcome scenario: China decides against launching the formal investigation due to improved US-China trade relations, strategic prioritization of other targets, or behind-the-scenes negotiations with Intel resulting in concessions that make the investigation unnecessary.

(d) Yes outcome scenario: China officially announces an antitrust investigation into Intel through the State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) as part of its escalating retaliation against US tariffs, following the pattern established with Google and Nvidia.

Looking at the evidence available, several factors point toward an increased likelihood of China launching an antitrust investigation into Intel before April 2025:

## Current Indications

According to reporting from early February 2025, China's State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) is actively considering an antitrust probe into Intel[1][2]. This consideration appears to be part of China's broader response to recently imposed US tariffs on Chinese goods. While no official investigation has been announced yet, multiple credible sources including the Financial Times have reported this development[1][5].

## Strategic Context and Precedent

China has already demonstrated its willingness to use antitrust investigations as a retaliatory measure against US technology companies:

- Chinese regulators reopened a dormant antitrust probe into Google in December 2024, before Trump's inauguration[1]
- The Google investigation was officially revived on February 4, 2025[4]
- An antitrust investigation into Nvidia was launched in December 2024, examining potential violations related to its 2019 acquisition of Mellanox Technologies[2]

This pattern suggests that Intel could reasonably be next in line, particularly given the escalating trade tensions between the US and China.

## Intel's Vulnerability

Intel presents a particularly attractive target for Chinese regulatory action due to its significant exposure to the Chinese market:

- China is Intel's largest market, accounting for 29% of its global revenue (approximately $15.5 billion) last year[1]
- The company maintains testing and assembly facilities in China[1]

This substantial market presence gives Chinese regulators significant leverage over Intel and increases the potential impact of any antitrust action.

## Diplomatic Considerations

Sources indicate that the decision to proceed with an investigation may depend on the state of US-China relations in the coming weeks and months[2]. Chinese President Xi Jinping is expected to engage in discussions with US officials regarding trade and economic policies, which could influence the timing and approach to any potential investigation.

## Status Quo Considerations

While the evidence suggests an increased likelihood of an investigation, we must consider that:

1. No official investigation has been announced yet
2. The decision appears contingent on diplomatic developments
3. China may be using the threat of investigation as leverage without necessarily proceeding

Historically, not all considered regulatory actions materialize into formal investigations, and the status quo often persists longer than anticipated.

## Timing Assessment

Given that the reports of China considering this investigation emerged in early February 2025, and similar investigations against Google and Nvidia have already been launched, there appears to be a reasonable timeframe for China to formalize an investigation before April 2025 if they choose to proceed.

Considering all these factors, while acknowledging the inherent uncertainty and the tendency for the status quo to persist, I assess that there is a significant but not overwhelming probability that China will launch an antitrust investigation into Intel before April 2025.

Probability: 65%
