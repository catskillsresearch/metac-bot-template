(a) Time until outcome: 9 days (from December 11, 2024 to December 20, 2024)

(b) Status quo outcome: Grouse Mountain is currently open for the 2024/25 winter season, having opened on November 23, 2024.

(c) Scenario for No outcome: Unseasonably warm weather or rain causes significant snow melt, forcing Grouse Mountain to completely close operations before December 20, 2024.

(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: Grouse Mountain continues its current operations with at least limited terrain open, maintaining its "Open" status on On the Snow's report through December 20, 2024.

Based on the available information, I believe Grouse Mountain will very likely be listed as "Open" on On the Snow's Ski Report on December 20, 2024. Here's my rationale:

Grouse Mountain officially opened for the 2024/25 winter season on November 23, 2024, at 9 am[5]. This opening included Paradise and Paradise Jib Park, accessible via the Greenway Chair, as well as Heaven's Sake and Peak via the Peak Chair[5]. The resort is currently operational, though with limited terrain.

Historical patterns strongly favor continued operation through December 20:

1. **Established opening pattern**: Grouse Mountain has already opened for the season, and resorts typically remain open once they've initiated operations unless faced with extreme circumstances[5].

2. **Weather outlook**: The 2024/25 season is predicted to experience La Ni√±a conditions, which typically bring below-average temperatures and above-average precipitation - favorable conditions for maintaining snow coverage[5].

3. **Reporting practices**: On the Snow's reports tend to classify resorts as "Open" even with limited terrain availability, as long as some ski operations are maintained[4].

4. **Historical timing**: Grouse Mountain rarely closes during December once opened. The resort had opened for the 2023/24 season on December 8, 2023[3], and for the 2024/25 season, they opened even earlier in November[5].

5. **Snowmaking capabilities**: Even with variable natural snowfall, Grouse Mountain's snowmaking team has demonstrated the ability to maintain at least limited operations[5].

The primary risk factors that could lead to closure include:

- Extreme weather event causing unsafe conditions
- Mechanical failure affecting critical infrastructure
- Unseasonably warm temperatures causing rapid snowmelt

However, these represent low-probability events that would disrupt the status quo. Given that Grouse Mountain is currently open, has established winter operations, and has snowmaking capabilities to supplement natural snowfall, the most likely outcome is continued operation through December 20, 2024.

While terrain may remain limited depending on snowfall between now and December 20, On the Snow's reporting would still classify the resort as "Open" as long as some ski operations are maintained.

Probability: 92%
