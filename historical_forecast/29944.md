(a) The time left until the outcome is known: 
Based on the search results, we know that voting for most categories in the 2024 Golden Joystick Awards ended around November 8, 2024[3]. Since today is May 6, 2025, the actual awards ceremony has already taken place, though the search results don't provide the exact date of the ceremony or the winners.

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed:
The status quo outcome would be "No" - Helldivers 2 does not win in any of the specified categories (Best Multiplayer Game, Console Game of the Year, or Best Game Trailer).

(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome:
Helldivers 2 loses the Best Multiplayer Game category to one of its strong competitors like Tekken 8 or The Finals. It isn't nominated for Console Game of the Year or Best Game Trailer, so it has no chance to win in those categories.

(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome:
Helldivers 2 wins the Best Multiplayer Game category, beating out competitors like Abiotic Factor, EA Sports College Football 25, Sons Of The Forest, Tekken 8, and The Finals thanks to strong player support and positive reception.

## Forecast Rationale

Looking at the available evidence, I need to assess the likelihood of Helldivers 2 winning in at least one of the specified categories at the 2024 Golden Joystick Awards.

First, examining the nominations, Helldivers 2 is only nominated in one of the three categories mentioned in the criteria - Best Multiplayer Game[1]. There's no evidence from the search results that it's nominated for Console Game of the Year or Best Game Trailer. This immediately limits its chances to one category rather than three.

In the Best Multiplayer Game category, Helldivers 2 faces competition from five other games: Abiotic Factor, EA Sports College Football 25, Sons Of The Forest, Tekken 8, and The Finals[1]. This means it has approximately a 1 in 6 chance if all games were equally likely to win, but we need to consider other factors.

Helldivers 2 was a major success in 2024, which could boost its chances. The search results show that Helldivers 2 is mentioned among the leading games for nominations alongside Astro Bot and Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth[1]. This suggests it had significant industry recognition.

However, we need to consider that the Golden Joystick Awards are public-voted awards, meaning popularity and recent sentiment matter greatly. According to search result [3], one content director mentioned "a record 10 million+ votes" for the 2024 awards, indicating high public engagement.

For Ultimate Game of the Year (a separate category), Helldivers 2 was nominated alongside 11 other games[3], showing it maintained relevance throughout the year.

The status quo assumption is important here - without specific information about the winners, I should lean toward assuming Helldivers 2 did not win. Competition was strong, and while Helldivers 2 was popular, many of the other nominees were high-profile releases as well.

Based on the limited information available and considering the competition in the Best Multiplayer Game category, I estimate that Helldivers 2 had a moderate chance of winning this award, but it's prudent to lean toward the status quo without evidence of a win.

Probability: 35%
