(a) Time left until outcome: 46 days (February 14, 2025 to April 1, 2025)

(b) Status quo outcome: No new tariffs on Colombia as the previously threatened tariffs have been paused following an agreement between the U.S. and Colombia in January 2025.

(c) No outcome scenario: Colombia continues to honor its agreement with the U.S. regarding accepting deported individuals. The U.S. maintains the current pause on tariffs through April 1, 2025, with no new tariff announcements or implementations.

(d) Yes outcome scenario: Colombia fails to uphold its commitments regarding accepting deported individuals, prompting the Trump administration to implement the previously "held in reserve" tariffs before April 1, 2025. Alternatively, new trade disputes emerge, leading to fresh tariff announcements and implementation.

Based on the available information, I assess the probability that the United States will impose new tariffs on Colombia before April 1, 2025, is relatively low. Here's my analysis:

In late January 2025, President Trump had announced plans to impose a 25% tariff on all Colombian imports, with an escalation to 50% within a week[3][5]. This action was in response to Colombian President Gustavo Petro's refusal to allow U.S. military flights carrying deported Colombian nationals to enter the country[3].

However, the situation was quickly resolved when Colombia agreed to President Trump's terms, including "the unrestricted acceptance of all illegal aliens from Colombia returned from the United States, including on U.S. military aircraft, without limitation or delay"[4]. Following this agreement, the White House announced that the "fully drafted IEEPA tariffs and sanctions will be held in reserve, and not signed, unless Colombia fails to honor this agreement"[4].

This resolution indicates that the immediate threat of tariffs has subsided, though it remains conditional on Colombia's continued compliance with the agreement. The White House statement clearly indicates that these measures are being "held in reserve" rather than canceled entirely[4].

Several factors suggest tariffs are unlikely to be imposed before April 1:

1. The agreement reached in late January 2025 appears to have addressed the specific issue that triggered the tariff threat - Colombia's acceptance of deported individuals[1][4].

2. Colombian Foreign Minister Luis Gilberto Murillo confirmed that Colombia had "overcome the impasse" and that the country's presidential plane was "ready to facilitate the return of Colombians"[4], suggesting genuine commitment to the agreement.

3. The relatively short timeframe until April 1, 2025 (about 46 days from the current date) provides limited opportunity for new disputes to emerge and escalate to the point of tariff implementation.

However, factors that could lead to tariffs include:

1. Colombia failing to honor its agreement regarding deported individuals, which would trigger the implementation of the "held in reserve" tariffs[4].

2. New trade disputes emerging between the countries, unrelated to the immigration issue.

3. President Trump has shown willingness to use tariffs as a policy tool, as evidenced by recent tariff impositions on Canada, Mexico, and China in February 2025[2].

The status quo strongly favors the "No" outcome, as both countries have reached an agreement that explicitly pauses tariff implementation. For tariffs to be imposed, there would need to be a significant change in the current situation, such as Colombia reneging on its commitments or a new dispute emerging.
