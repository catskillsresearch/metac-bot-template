(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
As of November 6, 2024, there are 56 days left until January 1, 2025. The outcome will be definitively known immediately after either Mike Tyson has a public boxing match or January 1, 2025 passes without one.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
If nothing changes from the current scheduling and health status, the outcome will be "Yes": Mike Tyson will have a public boxing match on November 15, 2024, when he is scheduled to fight Jake Paul in a highly publicized, officially sanctioned event[4][5].

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
A "No" outcome would occur if the scheduled Tyson vs. Paul fight is postponed or canceled again—most likely due to health issues or regulatory interventions—and no other public boxing match involving Tyson is arranged and takes place before January 1, 2025.

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
A "Yes" outcome occurs if Tyson competes in any public boxing match (including the scheduled Jake Paul bout) before January 1, 2025, as verified by credible reports. The most direct scenario is the scheduled fight on November 15, 2024, taking place as planned[4][5].

## Rationale

The world tends to change slowly, and event postponements are uncommon unless triggered by specific, often known, risks. The match between Mike Tyson and Jake Paul is officially sanctioned, widely promoted, and has ongoing media momentum as of late October 2024[4][5]. Both fighters and sponsors have reaffirmed the event, which is set to be streamed live and is a significant draw for Netflix as its first high-profile live boxing broadcast.

However, Tyson’s prior postponement due to a health issue demonstrates a non-negligible risk of another delay or cancellation. Tyson’s age and recent health concerns increase the risk, and boxing regulators could intervene if any new concerns arise. Still, absent new public health developments or regulatory action, it is more likely the fight will proceed as planned.

Given the event is less than two weeks away, with no new postponements announced and active promotion ongoing, the status quo strongly favors a "Yes" resolution.

**Probability: 85%**
