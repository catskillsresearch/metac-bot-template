(a) **Time left until resolution:**  
As of August 26, 2024, there are approximately 5 weeks (35 days) until October 1, 2024, when the outcome will be known.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
No confirmed Clade I mpox infections in Japan. As of late August 2024, there have been no reports of Clade I cases in Japan[3][5]. Japan’s previous mpox cases (2022–2023) were caused by Clade II, not Clade I[5].

(c) **Scenario for a No outcome:**  
Clade I mpox does not enter Japan’s borders before October 1, 2024, or any imported/locally acquired cases remain undetected or unconfirmed during this period. Japan’s vigilance, travel alerts, and public health measures prevent or delay introduction and/or detection of Clade I mpox[3].

(d) **Scenario for a Yes outcome:**  
An imported case (or, far less likely, a locally acquired case via secondary transmission from an imported case) is identified in Japan and laboratory confirmed as Clade I mpox before October 1, 2024. This could occur via a traveler from a country with emerging outbreaks, in light of Clade I's recent appearance outside Africa (e.g., Sweden)[1][3]. Japan’s robust surveillance detects and reports the infection.

## Rationale

- **Status Quo:**  
Japan has *not* yet reported any Clade I (Central African) mpox infections as of August 26, 2024[3][5]. All prior mpox cases in Japan were Clade II and linked to travel or global outbreaks unrelated to Clade I[5]. There is currently no evidence of Clade I circulating in Japan. Even amid heightened global concern, most countries outside Africa, with the exception of Sweden (the first Clade I case detected outside Africa), have not reported such cases[1][3].

- **Current Trends:**  
Clade I mpox, specifically the new subclade Ib, is causing large-scale outbreaks in the DRC and has spread to neighboring African countries and, most recently, Sweden[1][3]. The confirmation in Sweden demonstrates international spread is possible, but this is a single case and not evidence of broad global dissemination yet[1].  
Japan is actively monitoring the situation, raising traveler alerts, preparing response systems, and reviewing surveillance based on WHO recommendations[3]. Its health authorities are on alert, but as of now, there are no reports of Clade I cases.

- **Mechanisms for Importation:**  
With Japan's international travel volume, especially returning travelers and connecting flights from various continents, there is a conceivable risk of importation. The incubation period (about 10 days) gives the virus some latitude for undetected travel[1]. However, the historical pattern of slower, less efficient transmission for Clade I compared to Clade II (which fueled the global outbreak in 2022) and the current lack of cases in Asian countries other than Africa’s neighbors support a lower baseline risk.

- **Surveillance and Response:**  
Japan’s public health infrastructure is strong and well-practiced in outbreak detection[3]. However, imported mpox cases from Clade II in 2022–2023 remained rare, with only a handful detected over more than a year[5]. If a Clade I case does arrive, it is likely to be detected and reported. But the overall frequency of such events is low given historical patterns.

- **Tempo of Spread:**  
Only one Clade I case has been confirmed outside Africa (in Sweden), as of mid-August 2024[1]. The progression from outbreaks in Central Africa to neighboring countries and now to Europe suggests international seeding is possible but still rare. The window to October 1 is short, and the expansion appears only just beginning.

- **Uncertainties:**  
Underreporting is possible, and Clade I’s recent adaptation to sexual transmission may accelerate its spread in some contexts[1]. If the virus establishes larger outbreaks outside Africa in the coming weeks, the risk to Japan could rise sharply. At present, however, there is no evidence such clusters exist outside specific African countries and Sweden.

## Probability Estimate

Weighing the status quo (no imported or confirmed Clade I cases in Japan), the rarity of such introductions elsewhere, Japan's high vigilance, and the short time window remaining, the most likely scenario is **No**—Japan will not confirm a Clade I mpox case before October 1, 2024. The risk is higher than it was a month ago, given Sweden's recent case, but the base rate remains low. The situation is evolving, and a single imported case could alter the outcome, but at this moment, the probability is still much closer to the status quo than to an imminent first case.

**Probability: 15%**
