(a) **Time remaining**: 50 days (November 12, 2024, to January 1, 2025)  
(b) **Status quo outcome**: Yes (stock remains below $79.38)  
(c) **No outcome scenario**: A sudden surge in retail investor activity driven by political developments (e.g., polling shifts favoring Trump), combined with short covering and speculative trading around election certification timelines.  
(d) **Yes outcome scenario**: Continued insider selling pressure, valuation concerns (PS ratio >1,100 as of May 2024[2]), and limited revenue growth from Truth Social sustain the downward trend through December.  

### Rationale  
Trump Media & Technology Group (DJT) exhibited extreme volatility in 2024, peaking at $79.38 on its March 26 debut before losing 80% by September[1]. As of November 12, 2024, no fundamental catalysts (e.g., revenue growth, platform adoption) appear in available data to justify a 400%+ rally required to break its all-time high. The combination of:  
1. **Valuation disconnect**: A price-to-sales ratio of 1,192.97[2] (vs. typical social media peers at 5-10x)  
2. **Insider pressure**: Historical concerns about executive share sales[1]  
3. **Political linkage**: Stock performance tied to Trump's campaign volatility, which typically introduces asymmetric downside risk  
suggests the status quo of depressed pricing is more probable than a record-breaking reversal. While election-related speculation could temporarily boost trading volume, sustained gains above $79.38 would require unprecedented retail coordination or institutional participationâ€”neither evidenced in the pre-November 12 data.  

Probability: **85%** (Yes)
