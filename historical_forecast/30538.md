(a) **Time until the outcome is known:**  
The outcome will become known in early January 2025, as soon as Metaculus Admins access the official temperature records for December 2024 from the specified weather stations.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
Historically, Chicago tends to record lower absolute minimum temperatures during December than Anchorage. For example, in December 2017, Chicago’s lowest temperature was -3°F while Anchorage’s was 5°F. However, there are years, such as December 2022, when Anchorage did record a lower minimum (-12°F compared to Chicago’s -9°F)[1]. The status quo is that Chicago is more likely to have the lower December minimum.

(c) **Scenario that results in a No outcome:**  
If Chicago experiences a significant Arctic outbreak or cold snap, which is not matched by an equivalent extreme event in Anchorage, Chicago will record a lower minimum temperature. For example, if Anchorage’s coldest December temperature is around 0°F to -5°F and Chicago sees a cold snap driving temperatures to -10°F or lower, the result will be No.

(d) **Scenario that results in a Yes outcome:**  
If Anchorage experiences an unusually cold December with temperatures plunging well below zero (for example, -10°F or lower), while Chicago has a relatively mild December with lows only reaching the single digits or just below zero (e.g., -3°F), then Anchorage will record the lower minimum and the answer will be Yes.

## Rationale

- Anchorage’s Ted Stevens Airport saw lows of -21°F during the January-February 2024 cold snap, showing it is capable of very cold extremes under the right conditions[1][2].
- However, those extremes often do not occur in December, but later in winter (January-February), and Anchorage’s December minimums in recent years have often been higher than Chicago’s, except during rare strong cold air events in Alaska.
- Chicago, being continental, is prone to dramatic cold snaps if Arctic air plunges south, and even in relatively mild years, can see lows in the -5°F to -10°F range or lower in December.
- The variability is significant: in some years Anchorage records a lower minimum, but the more frequent outcome is for Chicago’s minimum to be lower.
- There is no reported forecast or climate signal currently suggesting December 2024 will be an outlier for either city.

Given these factors, the base rate (status quo) slightly favors Chicago having the lower minimum, but with a real (non-trivial) chance that an Anchorage cold snap could produce a Yes outcome.
