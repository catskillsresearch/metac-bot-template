I'll analyze this forecasting question about potential Amazon layoffs reported by TechCrunch before October 1, 2024.

(a) Time left until outcome: 26 days (from May 6, 2025 to October 1, 2024 - this appears to be a past date relative to the current date)

(b) Status quo outcome: No - TechCrunch has not reported new Amazon layoffs in their tracker since the early 2024 events mentioned in January and February.

(c) No outcome scenario: Amazon maintains its current workforce or conducts restructuring that doesn't involve significant layoffs through September 2024. TechCrunch doesn't report any new Amazon layoffs in their comprehensive tracker for August or September 2024.

(d) Yes outcome scenario: Amazon announces new layoffs due to continued cost-cutting measures, changing economic conditions, or strategic realignment before October 1, 2024, and TechCrunch includes this event in their comprehensive tracker under August or September 2024.

## Analysis of Available Information

According to the search results, Amazon has already conducted layoffs in early 2024, specifically in January and February[5]. The tech industry as a whole has experienced significant layoffs in recent years, with over 260,000 tech workers losing their jobs in 2023 and more than 80,000 already laid off in 2024 as of the most recent data available[2].

The layoffs.fyi tracker indicates that as of May 6, 2025, 52,340 tech employees have been laid off across 123 tech companies in 2025[3]. However, this doesn't provide specific information about Amazon's layoffs after February 2024, which is the critical timeframe for this forecast.

## Historical Patterns and Context

Amazon has shown a pattern of periodic workforce reductions since 2023. The search results mention that Amazon laid off employees in early 2024, with specific details about the departments affected: 37.4% from HR and talent sourcing, 28.8% from software engineering, 5.8% from program management, and 3.1% from quality assurance[5].

This pattern suggests that Amazon has been actively managing its workforce size through layoffs, which increases the likelihood of additional layoffs before October 1, 2024.

## Considering the Status Quo

The search results don't provide any information about Amazon announcing or planning layoffs between March and September 2024. While absence of evidence isn't evidence of absence, we must give significant weight to the status quo - that no new Amazon layoffs have been reported by TechCrunch after February 2024 in the available information.

The resolution criteria specifically state that TechCrunch's comprehensive list will be the sole source used for resolution, regardless of information from other sources. If TechCrunch doesn't report Amazon layoffs for August or September 2024, the question resolves as No.

## Economic and Industry Context

The tech industry appears to still be in a period of workforce adjustment, with layoffs continuing into 2024 and 2025. However, the rate of layoffs seems to have decreased from the peak in early 2023, when January alone saw 84,714 employees laid off across the tech industry[1].

## Weighting the Status Quo

As a professional forecaster, I recognize that the status quo typically has strong inertia. While Amazon has conducted layoffs in early 2024, there's no concrete evidence in the search results to suggest they planned additional layoffs specifically targeting August or September 2024.

Considering the resolution date is less than a month away and no indication of imminent Amazon layoffs appears in the search results, I must give substantial weight to the status quo outcome of "No."

Probability: 30%
