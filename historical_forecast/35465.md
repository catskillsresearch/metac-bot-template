(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known: About 1 month (from May 6, 2025 to April 1, 2025 - which has already passed)

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed: No announcement of presidential elections by Ukraine

(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome: Ukraine maintains martial law due to the ongoing war with Russia, and follows through on its parliamentary resolution from February 2025 stating that elections cannot be held until after martial law is lifted.

(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome: A sudden breakthrough in peace negotiations leads to a ceasefire or peace agreement, allowing Ukraine to lift martial law and announce elections before April 1, 2025.

Given that today is May 6, 2025, and the deadline for this question was April 1, 2025, the outcome is already determined. Based on the search results, there was no indication that Ukraine announced a presidential election before April 1, 2025.

The evidence strongly pointed toward a "No" outcome for several key reasons:

First, on February 26, 2025, Ukraine's parliament (Verkhovna Rada) passed a resolution explicitly reaffirming that elections should not be held during martial law and pledging to hold presidential elections only after the conclusion of the war[2][3]. This official parliamentary action directly addressed the question at hand, indicating Ukraine's formal position just over a month before the April 1 deadline.

Second, Ukraine's constitution explicitly prohibits holding elections during martial law[3]. Since the Russian invasion in 2022, Ukraine has been under martial law, which legally prevents the announcement of elections. Article 19 of the Ukrainian constitution specifically bans presidential, parliamentary, and local elections during this period[3].

Third, President Zelenskyy consistently maintained that elections would only be announced after the "hot phase" of the war ended and martial law was lifted[1]. His position remained unchanged throughout early 2025, even as his original term (which expired in May 2024) extended further.

Fourth, there was broad consensus among Ukrainians, including opposition parties, that holding elections during wartime would be impractical and potentially dangerous[2]. With millions of citizens abroad as refugees and hundreds of thousands fighting, the conditions for a legitimate election did not exist.

The only potential path to a "Yes" outcome would have required a dramatic and rapid end to hostilities between February 26 (when the parliamentary resolution was passed) and April 1, 2025. Given the entrenched nature of the conflict and absence of any major peace breakthrough in the search results, this scenario was extremely unlikely.

As a forecaster, I would have assigned significant weight to the status quo (no election announcement), particularly given the formal parliamentary resolution explicitly rejecting elections during wartime. The constitutional prohibition, practical challenges, and consistent messaging from Ukrainian officials all pointed in the same direction.
