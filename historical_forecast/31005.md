(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  
The U.S. International Investment Position (IIP) for Q3 2024 will be released by the BEA on December 27, 2024. As of today's date (December 18, 2024), there are **9 days remaining** until the outcome is known.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
If Q3 2024 values were unchanged from Q2 2024, the net IIP would remain at **-22.52 trillion dollars**. Assets would be $36.00 trillion, and liabilities $58.52 trillion.

(c) **Outcome if current trend continued:**  
Over the most recent quarters, the U.S. net IIP has been steadily becoming more negative. For context, it was -$19.77 trillion in Q2 2023, -$18.04 trillion in Q1 2023, and -$22.52 trillion in Q2 2024. The chart and historical data indicate a persistent downward trend, likely to continue barring a major reversal. Q3 2024 saw both exports and imports rise sharply, but imports outpaced exports (imports up 10.7%, exports up 9.6%), further widening the trade deficit[4]. Historically, quarters with sharp increases in the trade deficit have led to more negative IIP readings. Thus, a continuation of the current trend would place the Q3 2024 IIP at approximately **-23.0 to -23.2 trillion dollars**.

(d) **Expectations of experts and markets:**  
Expert forecasts do not provide a direct IIP figure, but related macroeconomic forecasts show modest GDP growth and continued strong investment[2][5]. However, macroeconomic commentary for Q3 2024 highlights a notable expansion in the trade deficit due to higher import growth relative to exports, and ongoing strong financial markets[2][4]. This, combined with ongoing U.S. attractiveness to international investors (rising liabilities), points to a further widening of the negative IIP, but not at a dramatically accelerated pace. Professional forecasters and economists generally expect a gradual increase in the negative net IIP, possibly reaching **-23.0 to -23.5 trillion dollars** for Q3 2024.

(e) **Unexpected low outcome scenario:**  
A less negative IIP than expected (e.g., -22.0 trillion dollars or less negative) could occur if there were a sudden, favorable revaluation of U.S. assets abroad (e.g., due to a sharp depreciation in the dollar increasing the value of foreign holdings, or a stock market surge abroad), or a large one-time asset sale to U.S. investors, or an unexpected surge in U.S. exports relative to imports.

(f) **Unexpected high outcome scenario:**  
A much more negative IIP (e.g., approaching -24.0 trillion dollars or worse) could result from a severe U.S. market correction reducing the value of U.S. holdings abroad, another sharp increase in the trade deficit beyond expectations, or dramatic dollar appreciation (reducing the dollar value of U.S.-held foreign assets).
