(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
The Agency Efficiency Leaderboard will be checked on or after April 1, 2025. Today is May 6, 2025, so the outcome should already be determinable based on the current data.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
As of the most recent update (May 3, 2025), the Agency Efficiency Leaderboard at doge.gov/savings lists agency rankings for "Least Total Savings." If the Department of State remains at the top of this category (i.e., has the least total savings), it would resolve "Yes." However, the actual leaderboard on the public site only displays "HHS (Department of Health and Human Services)" as the current #1 in Least Savings as of May 3, 2025[1].

(c) **Scenario that results in a No outcome:**  
If another agency, such as HHS, Commerce, Energy, or any department other than State has less total savings as of April 1, 2025, then the Department of State will not be ranked highest in Least Total Savings. For example, if HHS is currently leading "Least Savings" as visible on the leaderboard, and this was also true on April 1, 2025, the outcome will be "No"[1].

(d) **Scenario that results in a Yes outcome:**  
If the Department of State is ranked #1 in "Least Total Savings" on the Agency Efficiency Leaderboard at doge.gov/savings as of April 1, 2025, meaning no other federal agency has fewer total savings, then the answer will resolve "Yes."

## Rationale

Historically, as of late February 2025, the Department of State was indeed leading the "Least Total Savings" category[2][4]. However, the most recent leaderboard snapshot from May 3, 2025, shows HHS (Department of Health and Human Services) now holding the top spot for "Least Savings"[1]. Since DOGE's data is updated weekly, and there are acknowledged delays of up to a month in some contract reporting[1], it's possible that the rankings shifted prior to April 1, 2025.

There is no evidence from available sources that State retained the #1 "Least Savings" spot through April 1, 2025â€”rather, the current leaderboard indicates HHS is now ranked highest. Given DOGE's conservative methodology and frequent updates, and the trend of other agencies catching up or overtaking in least savings, the most likely outcome is that the Department of State was overtaken before April 1.

Good forecasting practice puts extra weight on the most current, high-confidence data: As of the latest publication, State is no longer #1 in "Least Total Savings"[1]. Assuming no unreported late data revisions for the April 1 checkpoint, the probability that State was ranked highest in Least Total Savings on that date is low.

**Probability: 10%**
