(a) **Time Left Until Outcome is Known:**  
The Paris 2024 Olympics will be held from July 26 to August 11, 2024. Therefore, at the information cutoff of July 12, there were approximately two weeks until the Games began, and nearly a month until they finished and the final medal tally is published.

(b) **Status Quo Outcome if Nothing Changed:**  
Given the information about the drastically reduced number of eligible Individual Neutral Athletes (AINs)—only 32 from Russia and Belarus combined[3]—and historical gold medal averages for Russia (19) and Belarus (1.7) being based on much larger delegations, the status quo outcome would be that AINs do not win 15 or more gold medals at Paris 2024.

(c) **Scenario Resulting in a No Outcome:**  
If the 32 AINs compete as anticipated, with no major rule changes or sudden influx of new eligible competitors, it is extremely unlikely that nearly half of them (15+) will each win a gold medal. Most will face high-caliber, full national teams, and some may not be favorites in their events. This scenario is overwhelmingly likely to result in fewer than 15 golds.

(d) **Scenario Resulting in a Yes Outcome:**  
For AINs to win 15 or more gold medals, a series of unlikely events would be required: either a significant expansion of the AIN roster after July 12 (e.g., due to sudden IOC policy changes), or almost unprecedented dominance by the existing 32 AINs. Historically, even top Olympic nations accomplish gold medal hauls with much larger delegations, and it is rare for a small group of athletes to achieve such success unless concentrated in a handful of sports with multiple medal opportunities each (like swimming or gymnastics), for which there is no supporting evidence here.

## Rationale

- The field of AINs is severely restricted: only 32 athletes are permitted, compared to previous Russian and Belarusian delegations that numbered in the hundreds[3][4].
- Achieving 15 gold medals would require an unprecedented medal conversion rate (nearly half of all AINs would need to win gold).
- Team events—where medal counts can sometimes be inflated—are off-limits to AINs in Paris 2024: only individuals may compete[4].
- Top Russian and Belarusian medal hopes are not universally eligible, further limiting gold opportunities[1][4].
- Status quo in Olympic history and participation policy suggests a slow-moving system where exceptional, late-breaking deviations are rare.
- There are no indications of possible policy reversals or participant expansions before the Games.
- Good forecasting practice gives significant weight to the current state of affairs, especially when major changes are unlikely.

## Final Forecast

**Probability: 0%**

Given the size and scope of the AIN contingent and the strict IOC limits, there is no plausible pathway for Individual Neutral Athletes to win 15 or more gold medals at Paris 2024. All indicators and historical precedent support a "No" outcome[3][4].
