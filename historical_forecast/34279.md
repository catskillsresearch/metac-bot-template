Based on the data available up to May 6, 2025, I can provide a professional forecast analysis for Lake Kariba's water level on March 24, 2025. Since we're now in May 2025, I can analyze what actually happened rather than predicting a future event.

(a) The outcome to the question is already known, as March 24, 2025 has passed (we're now in May 2025).

(b) The status quo outcome from the earliest 2025 data point was 475.87 meters (January 6, 2025).

(c) Looking at the trend from December 2024 to May 2025, we can see the water level increased from 476.02 meters in December 2024 to 477.68 meters by May 5, 2025.

(d) Experts from the Zambezi River Authority (ZRA) had anticipated water levels would gradually rise between January and March 2025, with a formal review planned at the end of Q1 2025. They had expressed optimism based on normal-to-above-normal rainfall forecasts.

(e) A lower-than-expected outcome would have occurred if the predicted rainfall failed to materialize in the catchment area, or if water release for power generation exceeded inflows due to energy demands.

(f) A higher-than-expected outcome would have resulted from exceptionally heavy rainfall in the catchment area or reduced power generation demands allowing faster accumulation.

Based on the available data showing the progression of Lake Kariba's water level, we can see that by early May 2025, the level had reached 477.68 meters with 15.15% usable storage, compared to 477.42 meters (13.31% usable storage) from the same period in 2024[1]. This confirms that the anticipated rise did occur, although the lake is still operating at relatively low capacity.

The most recent data from May 5, 2025 shows the lake level is steadily increasing due to corresponding increases in inflows on the mainstream Zambezi River[1]. Looking at the trend from late April to early May 2025, there's a consistent upward trajectory, with the level rising from 477.51 meters on April 29 to 477.68 meters on May 5[1].

Given these observed trends and the fact that March 24, 2025 has already passed, we can determine that the water level was likely between 476.5 and 477.5 meters on March 24, 2025, representing the continued recovery from the critically low levels seen in late 2024.
