(a) **The time left until the outcome is known:**  
There are exactly 61 days (about two months) between July 30, 2024, and September 29, 2024.

(b) **The status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
As of July 25, 2024, the total cryptocurrency market capitalization was $2.35 trillion. If the market cap remains at this level or decreases only slightly—but not below $1.5 trillion—the answer would be Yes, the cap will be more than $1.5 trillion.

(c) **A scenario that results in a No outcome:**  
For the answer to be No, the total crypto market cap would have to fall by more than 36% from its current level—dropping from $2.35 trillion to $1.5 trillion or less—within the next two months. This scenario would likely require a major negative catalyst, such as:

- A severe global financial crisis leading to mass liquidations of risk assets
- A wave of highly restrictive regulations or outright bans from major economies
- Major security breaches or failures of leading crypto protocols or exchanges
- Loss of confidence in stablecoins or in the integrity of key blockchain systems

(d) **A scenario that results in a Yes outcome:**  
The market cap remains above $1.5 trillion if:

- The recent positive momentum (ETFs, institutional adoption, post-halving strength) continues or even moderates slightly[3][2].
- No exceptional negative shocks materialize, and investor confidence is maintained.
- Macroeconomic conditions remain relatively stable or crypto is seen as a hedge against global uncertainty.

## Rationale

The current market cap ($2.35T) is well above the $1.5T threshold, implying that it would take a dramatic and sustained negative event—a drop of over one-third in value—to resolve this question as No. This is a larger fall than has occurred in most recent two-month periods except during acute market panics.

Recent trends have been strongly positive or stable:
- The first quarter of 2024 saw a 60% increase in total market cap, catalyzed by ETF approvals and institutional investment[3].
- Major institutions are now active in the space, and regulatory clarity has generally improved[3][2].
- Bitcoin and leading coins are trading well above post-halving predictions, showing overall market resilience[1].

While crypto markets are volatile, sharp drawdowns of over 35% in two months are rare unless triggered by exceptional events. Most scenarios would see the market cap remain above $1.5T, and forecasters should assign extra weight to the status quo, as dramatic regime changes are infrequent.

## Final Forecast

**Probability: 90%**

(The probability that the total market cap of all cryptocurrencies will be more than $1.5 trillion on September 29, 2024, is very high, barring an extraordinary negative shock.)
