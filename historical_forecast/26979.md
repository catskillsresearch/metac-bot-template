(a) Time left until outcome is known: 2 months and 1 day (from May 6, 2025 to October 7, 2024, which is in the past)

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: Based on the historical patterns and the strong forecasts for the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season, the status quo suggests ACE would exceed 100 by October 7, 2024.

(c) Scenario for No outcome: A sudden atmospheric pattern change could inhibit cyclone formation or intensity despite favorable conditions. If several potential storms fail to develop or remain weak, or if a strong wind shear unexpectedly develops across the Atlantic basin, ACE accumulation could slow significantly, keeping the total below 100 by October 7.

(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: The forecasted above-normal hurricane season materializes with multiple strong, long-lasting hurricanes forming between August and early October. With record-warm Atlantic waters and La Niña conditions developing, several major hurricanes could contribute substantially to ACE, easily pushing the total above 100 by early October.

The forecasts for the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season are exceptionally strong in predicting above-normal activity. NOAA has issued a prediction with an 85-90% chance of an above-normal season, forecasting 17-24 named storms, 8-13 hurricanes, and 4-7 major hurricanes. These ranges significantly exceed the 1991-2020 averages of 14 named storms, 7 hurricanes, and 3 major hurricanes.

Colorado State University's forecast is particularly notable, predicting hurricane activity at approximately 170% of the average season from 1991-2020. This is their highest prediction for hurricanes ever issued in an April outlook, indicating exceptional confidence in an active season.

The primary drivers for this forecast include extremely warm Atlantic sea surface temperatures and the likely development of La Niña conditions, both of which favor hurricane development and intensification. The confidence level in these predictions is unusually high for seasonal outlooks.

For context on ACE values, NOAA classifies a hurricane season as "above-normal" when ACE exceeds 126.1 (130% of the median) and "extremely active" when it exceeds 159.6 (165% of the median). With forecasts suggesting 150-245% of median ACE for the full season, and considering that by early October most of the season's ACE has typically accumulated, there is a strong likelihood that the ACE value will exceed 100 by October 7.

While acknowledging that unexpected atmospheric conditions could still develop to inhibit storm formation or intensity, the overwhelming evidence points toward an exceptionally active hurricane season. The strong consensus among major forecasting agencies, combined with already favorable conditions, makes it highly probable that ACE will exceed 100 by the specified date.
