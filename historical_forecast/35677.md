(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  
The outcome—total Bay Wheels trips for February 2025—will be published after February closes. Since today is May 6, 2025, and the BTS data is typically updated with a lag, the number is now likely available or will be within days.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
If ridership stayed at its February 2024 level (preliminary, as current detailed monthly numbers were not in the search results but inferred from trends), the number of trips would be slightly lower than February 2025's likely outcome, since ridership has increased year-over-year[3].

(c) **Outcome if current trend continued:**  
Ridership across the first nine months of 2024 set all-time highs compared to the same period in prior years[3]. E-bike growth and network expansion continue to boost usage, so if this trend persists, February 2025 should reach or slightly surpass the February 2024 figure. Given that every month since mid-2023 has equaled or exceeded its 2019 level, and February is a strong month historically, the best estimate is a continued, modest increase[3].

(d) **Expectations of experts and markets:**  
Experts expect further growth, anchored by e-bike popularity, ongoing expansion, and urban recovery post-pandemic[3]. However, the historical February peak in 2020 has likely not been exceeded every year since, so growth is strong but not exponential.

(e) **Unexpected scenario for a low outcome:**  
A rare winter storm, protracted heavy rain, or technical issues that remove a high number of e-bikes from service—especially as e-bikes now account for nearly all growth—could reduce trip numbers.

(f) **Unexpected scenario for a high outcome:**  
Unseasonably mild, dry weather, a successful Bay Wheels promotional campaign, or a major sporting or cultural event driving demand could push February ridership to a new record.
