(a) Time left until the outcome is known: Approximately 10 months and 25 days (from May 6, 2025 to April 1, 2025). However, since we're already in May 2025, this question's resolution period has already passed.

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: Since the question asked about impeachment before April 1, 2025, and we're now in May 2025, the status quo would be whatever actually happened by April 1, 2025.

(c) Scenario resulting in a No outcome: No federal judge was formally impeached by the House of Representatives by April 1, 2025. The impeachment proceedings against Judge Paul Engelmayer that began with H.Res.143 in February 2025 either stalled in committee, failed to receive a majority vote in the House, or were not completed before the April 1 deadline.

(d) Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome: The House of Representatives completed its impeachment process and formally voted to impeach Judge Paul Engelmayer (or another federal judge) before April 1, 2025, passing articles of impeachment with a majority vote.

Based on the search results provided, I can see that a formal impeachment resolution (H.Res.143) was introduced in the House of Representatives on February 18, 2025, against Judge Paul Engelmayer of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York[2]. The resolution states that he "is impeached for high crimes and misdemeanors."

However, this information only tells us that impeachment proceedings were initiated, not that the House completed the full impeachment process. For a judge to be considered impeached, the House must vote by a simple majority to approve articles of impeachment[5]. Following this vote, the case would then move to the Senate for trial, though as noted in the question, Senate conviction is not necessary for this question to resolve as "Yes."

The impeachment process for federal judges involves several steps:

1. Initiation by a House member or committee[4]
2. Committee investigation of the allegations[4]
3. Drafting of formal articles of impeachment if wrongdoing is determined[4]
4. A majority vote by the full House of Representatives[4][5]
5. If passed, a trial in the Senate (not relevant for this question)[4][5]

Based on the search results, we know step 1 occurred with the introduction of H.Res.143 on February 18, 2025[2]. However, there is no information in the provided search results about whether the subsequent steps were completed before April 1, 2025.

Historically, the impeachment process can move at varying speeds. Once formal proceedings begin, they can sometimes conclude relatively quickly. However, committee investigations can also be lengthy, and political factors often influence the timeline.

Given that we are now past April 1, 2025 (according to the current date provided), and no definitive information is available about whether Judge Engelmayer was formally impeached by the House through a majority vote before April 1, I cannot make a confident determination about the outcome of this question based solely on the search results provided.

Probability: This question requires information about what actually happened between February 18, 2025 (when the resolution was introduced) and April 1, 2025, which is not provided in the search results. Without that information, I cannot provide a meaningful probability estimate.
