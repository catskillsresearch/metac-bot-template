(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
The outcome is already known as of November 15, 2024, since the question is resolved based on publicly available information before January 1, 2025.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
The status quo is that the ICC has officially issued an arrest warrant for Benjamin Netanyahu. This was publicly announced and is confirmed by the ICC’s own records and multiple reputable sources[3][4].

(c) **Scenario that results in a No outcome:**  
A No outcome would require that, before January 1, 2025, the ICC did *not* issue an arrest warrant for Netanyahu, or that any purported arrest warrant was either unannounced, unconfirmed, or only publicly revealed after that date. This did not occur—the warrant was officially and publicly disclosed on November 21, 2024[3][4].

(d) **Scenario that results in a Yes outcome:**  
A Yes outcome would occur if, before January 1, 2025, the ICC publicly and officially issued an arrest warrant for Benjamin Netanyahu, with credible documentation or announcement. This scenario is exactly what happened: The ICC Prosecutor’s request was acted upon and the Pre-Trial Chamber issued the warrant on November 21, 2024, publicly and officially[3][4].

## Rationale

On May 20, 2024, the ICC Prosecutor filed applications for arrest warrants against several individuals, including Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, over alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in Gaza[1][2]. Following months of international scrutiny and lobbying efforts, the ICC officially and publicly issued an arrest warrant for Netanyahu on November 21, 2024. This is documented by the ICC’s defendant registry, press releases, and analysis from independent institutions, unambiguously meeting the outcome criteria for this forecasting question[3][4].

Given that the criteria specify the warrant must be public and officially disclosed by a credible source before January 1, 2025—which it was—there is no remaining uncertainty about the resolution.
