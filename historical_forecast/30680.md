(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
As of December 3, 2024, there are 28 days remaining until December 31, 2024, when the status will be determined.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
Currently, OpenAI’s parent entity, OpenAI, Inc., is a tax-exempt, nonprofit company organized in Delaware as of its 2015 incorporation, and is likely listed as "Exempt" on the Delaware Division of Corporations registry[4][5]. If no legal or structural changes are filed and processed before December 31, 2024, OpenAI will remain listed as "Exempt" on that date.

(c) **Scenario that results in a No outcome:**  
For a "No" outcome, OpenAI’s legal status in Delaware would have to change from "Exempt" to a non-exempt classification (such as converting to a for-profit benefit corporation) and this change would need to be processed and reflected on the Division of Corporations website by December 31, 2024. This would require completing the legal steps for conversion—which typically include regulatory review, potential scrutiny from the Delaware Attorney General, and paying fair market value for transferred charitable assets[1][2]. No evidence indicates that such a change has been finalized or filed as of early December 2024.

(d) **Scenario that results in a Yes outcome:**  
A "Yes" outcome occurs if OpenAI remains listed as "Exempt" on December 31, 2024. This would result from either no restructuring being completed (the status quo), or if any restructuring is announced but not yet legally enacted and processed through the Delaware Division of Corporations by the end of the year.

## Rationale

- OpenAI has clearly signaled its intention to move away from nonprofit control, including converting to a for-profit or public benefit corporation structure[1][3]. However, all credible reports and public statements—including from OpenAI’s own leadership—indicate that the implementation of this restructure is planned for 2025, not before the end of 2024[1][3].
- The Delaware Attorney General is already scrutinizing the proposed conversion. If OpenAI seeks to change its status, the AG’s letter signals a regulatory review that could delay the process[1][2].
- OpenAI’s current Delaware certificate of incorporation and tax-exempt status remain in effect as of early December 2024, with no public filings or announcements indicating finalization of a conversion[4][5].
- The restructuring is complex and involves legal, regulatory, and financial hurdles. Historical precedent and expert assessments suggest these changes take months, if not years, especially with potential challenges from stakeholders and legal authorities[2][5].
- There is no indication that the required conversion or asset transfer process—mandated by tax law for such transitions—has been completed or even formally initiated in the Delaware registry as of December 3, 2024[2].

## Final Forecast

Given the slow pace of large-scale corporate restructurings, the explicit 2025 timeline mentioned by OpenAI leadership, the regulatory scrutiny underway, and no evidence of filings executed in Delaware, the most likely outcome is that OpenAI will still be listed as "Exempt" by the Division of Corporations on December 31, 2024.

**Probability: 90%**
