Based on the available data, I need to forecast the domestic opening weekend gross for the film "Last Breath" (2025). I'll analyze what we know and provide a reasoned forecast with appropriate uncertainty.

(a) Time left until the outcome is known:
The film "Last Breath" appears to have already been released, as it shows cumulative domestic earnings of around $21 million according to search result [3]. However, we don't have specific opening weekend data. Since the question refers to data that should have been reported already (by Box Office Mojo), we're essentially waiting for data that should be accessible but isn't clearly provided in our search results.

(b) The outcome if nothing changed:
From search result [3], we see "Last Breath" has cumulative domestic earnings of $21,051,180. From result [4], we see a weekly gross of $175,465 in its 5th week. However, we don't have its opening weekend figure specifically.

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued:
Without opening weekend data, we can't establish a clear trend. However, looking at the film's total gross and typical box office patterns, opening weekends often represent 25-40% of total domestic gross for mainstream releases.

(d) The expectations of experts and markets:
No direct expert predictions are provided in the search results. The film has achieved moderate success with over $21 million domestic and appears on worldwide charts (result [2]), suggesting it had some commercial viability.

(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome:
If "Last Breath" was a limited release that expanded gradually (indicated by the 437 theaters in week 5 from result [4]), it may have had a very small opening weekend below $3 million. Limited releases often build momentum rather than opening wide.

(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome:
If "Last Breath" followed the pattern of horror/thriller films with strong front-loaded performance, it could have earned 40-50% of its total gross on opening weekend, potentially reaching $8-10 million.

Given the total domestic gross of approximately $21 million, and applying typical opening weekend to total gross ratios for various release strategies, I can estimate the opening weekend. However, there's significant uncertainty due to missing specific data and unclear release pattern.
