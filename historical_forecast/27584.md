(a) Time left until outcome: 38 days (August 23, 2024 to October 1, 2024)

(b) Status quo outcome: No confirmed Clade I mpox infections in Angola as of August 23, 2024.

(c) No outcome scenario: Angola implements effective border screening measures with DRC, and public health surveillance detects and isolates any potential cases before community transmission occurs. Limited cross-border movement between affected regions of DRC and Angola slows potential spread, and the outbreak remains contained to currently affected countries.

(d) Yes outcome scenario: Given Angola's long border with DRC (the epicenter of the outbreak) and the rapid spread to other neighboring countries, Clade I mpox spreads to Angola through cross-border movement. With the pattern of transmission already established to multiple neighboring countries, Angola's surveillance system detects and confirms at least one case before October 1.

The mpox Clade I outbreak in Africa represents a significant public health emergency that has been expanding rapidly across the continent. As a forecaster, I need to analyze the current trajectory of this outbreak and assess the likelihood of Angola confirming a case within the next 38 days.

## Current Outbreak Status

The mpox situation in Africa is concerning, with Clade I (particularly subclade Ib) showing unprecedented spread. As of mid-August 2024, Africa has reported 18,837 mpox cases in 2024 alone, including 3,101 confirmed cases and 541 deaths across 12 African Union Member States[5]. This represents a significant increase from previous years, with suspected cases surging past 17,000 compared to 7,146 cases in 2022 and 14,957 cases in 2023[3].

The epicenter of the Clade I outbreak is the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), but the virus has demonstrated clear capacity for cross-border spread:

- Four neighboring countries that had never previously reported mpox (Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, and Uganda) have confirmed over 100 laboratory-confirmed cases of Clade Ib in just one month prior to mid-August[1][5]
- Gabon reported a suspected Clade Ib case on August 22, 2024, in a person with travel history to Uganda[5]
- The first cases outside Africa have now been detected in Sweden and Thailand, both with travel history to Africa[5]

## Geographic Spread Analysis

The geographic pattern of spread is particularly relevant to this forecast. Angola shares a long border with the DRC, which increases the risk of cross-border transmission. The virus has already demonstrated its ability to spread to multiple countries that border the DRC, following a pattern of geographic proximity.

As of August 19, 2024, a total of 53 confirmed Clade I cases have been reported across multiple countries[5]. The recent confirmation in Burundi is noteworthy, as these are "the first confirmed mpox cases ever identified in Burundi"[1]. This pattern of first-time detection in neighboring countries suggests the outbreak is reaching new territories.

## Factors Affecting Spread to Angola

Several factors increase the likelihood of Angola confirming a case:

1. **Geographic proximity**: Angola's extensive border with DRC creates numerous potential transmission paths
2. **Demonstrated pattern of spread**: The virus has already reached multiple countries bordering DRC
3. **Rapid expansion**: The outbreak is growing quickly, with cases doubling in some regions
4. **Surveillance limitations**: Africa CDC has acknowledged weaknesses in surveillance and testing, suggesting cases may already be present but undetected

However, other factors decrease the likelihood:

1. **Status quo persistence**: Angola has not yet reported any Clade I cases despite the outbreak being underway for months
2. **Time constraint**: Only 38 days remain until October 1, which may be insufficient for both transmission and confirmation
3. **Variability in transmission pathways**: The specific migration patterns and cross-border activity between Angola and affected regions of DRC may differ from other borders

## Probability Assessment

As a forecaster, I must give substantial weight to the status quo. Despite the concerning pattern of spread, Angola has not confirmed any cases yet. However, the rapid geographic expansion of the outbreak and Angola's proximity to the epicenter cannot be ignored.

The evidence shows that Clade I mpox has consistently spread to new countries bordering DRC over the past few months. In just August 2024, we've seen confirmation of the first cases in Burundi and suspected cases in Gabon, plus the first cases outside Africa in Sweden and Thailand.

Given the demonstrated cross-border transmission capability, the declaration of a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by WHO, and Angola's geographic vulnerability, there is a substantial chance Angola will confirm a case before October 1. However, the short timeframe (38 days) and the status quo (no cases yet) moderate this assessment.

Probability: 65%
