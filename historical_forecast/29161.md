(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  
There are 7 days until October 31, 2024, when VoteHub’s Early Voting Tracker will be checked for this metric.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
Based on past cycles, Democrats have historically dominated Pennsylvania’s mail and absentee ballot returns, regularly exceeding two-thirds (66.7%) of the total, especially as seen in 2020[2][4]. No substantial shifts in law or partisan behavior have been reported for 2024 that would greatly reduce this advantage. Therefore, the status quo is that Democrats would likely still make up a very large majority of such returns.

(c) **Scenario for a No outcome:**  
A No outcome would occur if, by October 31, 2024, the Democratic share of returned mail and absentee ballots in Pennsylvania as reported by VoteHub falls below 66.7%. This could happen if:
- Republican voters significantly increase their adoption of mail voting relative to prior cycles.
- Democratic turnout by mail is unexpectedly weak, perhaps due to improved in-person options, strategic shifting to election day voting, or messaging changes.
- Third-party or unaffiliated voters make up an unusually high proportion of mail returns.

(d) **Scenario for a Yes outcome:**  
A Yes outcome would occur if, by October 31, 2024, VoteHub’s Pennsylvania tracker shows 66.7% or more of mail and absentee ballot returns from Democrats. This would be a continuation of the patterns observed in 2020, where Democrats greatly outnumbered Republicans in mail voting due to partisan preferences and organizational emphasis[2][4]. If both parties’ strategies and voter preferences remain largely unchanged, this scenario is likely.

## Rationale

Historically, Pennsylvania’s mail and absentee ballot returns have been dominated by Democratic registered voters, particularly since the COVID-19 pandemic shifted Democratic strategy toward strong encouragement of mail voting[2][4]. There is no evidence in 2024 of a large-scale, party-wide shift in these voting behaviors, and both party behavior and election law have remained stable since 2020, when the Democratic share exceeded the two-thirds threshold[2]. While there has been some narrowing nationally, Pennsylvania’s partisan mail voting habits are persistent, and no indication exists of a large Republican surge through mail ballot returns[5].

Given that only a week remains until the outcome is observable and with ballots already being returned, the window for a dramatic change is closing. The most likely result—barring unexpected developments—is for Democrats to maintain their dominance above the 66.7% share by the VoteHub reporting date.
