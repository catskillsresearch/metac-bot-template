(a) **Time left until resolution:**  
Approximately 1.5 months remain until April 1, 2025.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changes:**  
As of mid-February 2025, the United States has not publicly accused Venezuela of invading Guyana by sending ground forces into Guyanese territory without Georgetown’s consent[1][5]. This is the default scenario.

(c) **Scenario for a No outcome:**  
Venezuela continues its current strategy of political escalation, legal maneuvers, and symbolic provocations—such as building infrastructure, appointing local officials, and declaring the Essequibo region as Venezuelan—without actually deploying its ground forces across the border. The US maintains strong rhetorical and material support for Guyana but stops short of formally accusing Venezuela of invasion, especially in the absence of clear, large-scale military incursion[1][3][4].

(d) **Scenario for a Yes outcome:**  
Venezuelan ground forces enter and occupy part of the Essequibo region without the consent of Guyana’s government, likely after a sudden breakdown in diplomatic efforts or as a calculated pre-election move by Maduro. The US, in response to direct and verifiable military occupation, issues an official accusation that Venezuela has invaded Guyana, fulfilling the resolution criteria[1][4][5].

## Rationale

- **Escalation to Full Invasion is Unlikely in the Short Term:**  
Despite increased Venezuelan provocations—including referenda, infrastructure projects, and heightened rhetoric—analysts largely view a sudden, large-scale military invasion as improbable before April 2025. Observers note that Maduro’s actions so far have focused on domestic political gains, symbolic gestures, and gradual encroachment rather than direct military confrontation[4]. The long-term timeline Venezuela has set for “incorporation” of the Essequibo and continued (however fragile) diplomatic dialogue support this view[1][5].

- **US Pattern of Response:**  
The US has demonstrated robust diplomatic and military support for Guyana, including joint exercises and strong statements recognizing Guyana’s sovereignty[1][2]. However, even amid provocative Venezuelan actions, the US has not escalated its language to the level of formally accusing Venezuela of invasion. This pattern suggests continued caution and reliance on deterrence, unless a clear, undeniable crossing of red lines occurs.

- **No Evidence of Imminent Ground Force Invasion (as of February 2025):**  
There are credible reports of Venezuelan troop build-ups and military posturing near the border[1][3], but no verified incidents of ground forces entering Guyana-controlled territory in a manner that would clearly meet US criteria for an “invasion.” International mediators have helped reduce tensions, and both sides have signed agreements to refrain from force, though these are fragile and could unravel[5].

- **Status Quo Bias:**  
Most international crises do not suddenly escalate to full-scale invasion, especially with heavy international scrutiny and explicit US deterrence. Unless credible new intelligence emerges showing imminent military plans or a sudden breakdown of diplomatic restraints, the likeliest path is continued tension without invasion or US formal accusation before the deadline.
