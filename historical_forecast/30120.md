(a) **Time until outcome known:**  
Pantone's official 2025 Color of the Year is scheduled for announcement on December 5, 2024. As of the knowledge cutoff on November 15, 2024, this is about three weeks away.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
Based on current credible leaks and industry reporting, the Pantone Color of the Year for 2025 is expected to be "Mocha Mousse," a warm brown. This means the answer is "No"—blue will not be the closest color to the 2025 Pantone Color of the Year[3].

(c) **Scenario for a No outcome:**  
Pantone announces "Mocha Mousse," or any other warm brown, red, orange, or similar non-blue hue as the 2025 Color of the Year. Since these hues do not fall into the HSV range for blue (165–255), the question resolves "No" as planned[2][3].

(d) **Scenario for a Yes outcome:**  
Pantone unexpectedly announces a color with a hue between 165 and 255—essentially a blue, blue-green, or blue-violet—as the 2025 Color of the Year. Only this scenario, such as the selection of a color like “Deja Vu Blue,” would result in a "Yes" outcome[4]. There is currently no credible reporting or evidence supporting this shift.

## Rationale

The status quo should be weighed most heavily, as Pantone's Color of the Year announcements are typically foreshadowed by trends in fashion, interior design, and industry leaks. This year, multiple reputable sources independently report "Mocha Mousse," a warm, muted brown, as the chosen shade for 2025[3]. This aligns with broader industry color trends, which emphasize earthy, comforting browns and neutrals instead of cooler blues or blue-adjacent hues[2][3].

While in previous years there has been some alternation between cool and warm shades, the reporting consensus and lack of significant blue presence in major 2025 trend palettes both point away from blue being selected this cycle[1][2][3]. Even speculative sources that mention blue ("Deja Vu Blue") or green ("White Grape") do so as long-shot predictions and have been overridden by specific leaks naming "Mocha Mousse"[4].

All available evidence as of mid-November 2024 overwhelmingly supports a "No" resolution to the question unless Pantone makes an extremely unlikely last-minute change.

Probability: **5%**

The probability that "Blue" will be the closest color to the 2025 Pantone Color of the Year is approximately 5%. This leaves a small margin for last-minute surprises, but the overwhelming status quo evidence points to a warm brown outcome[3].
