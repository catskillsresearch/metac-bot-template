(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  
Today is May 6, 2025. The outcome is determined by the number of confirmed roles as of the beginning of April 2025, specifically when the Washington Post’s Political Appointee Tracker is accessed on or after April 1, 2025. Thus, the outcome should already be knowable as of this date—slightly over a month has passed since the outcome point.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
As of the last available reporting (March 11, 2025), confirmations of "critical" executive branch positions were ongoing, with individual appointments such as Jamieson Greer being confirmed as late as March 4, 2025[4]. The total number of these roles is 818, but the exact confirmed count as of April 1, 2025, is not specified in the sources up to March 11, 2025[1][2]. Historically, the confirmation pace is steady but not rapid, and there are usually several unfilled or acting roles at any given time[1][2]. If there are no shocks or changes in the rate, the number of confirmed positions would inch up gradually.

(c) **Scenario resulting in an unexpected outcome:**  
An unexpected outcome might result from a dramatic acceleration or stall in the Senate confirmation process. For instance, if a significant crisis (domestic or international) prompted the Senate to rapidly confirm a large cohort of appointees, the confirmed tally could jump higher than expected. Conversely, a scandal or political showdown could freeze confirmations, leaving the confirmed count stagnant or even reduced if some confirmed appointees resign.

## Rationale

- The process is highly path-dependent and affected by the Senate's political priorities, procedural bottlenecks, and unexpected events.
- The status quo—steady but slow confirmations—historically dominates. Only a small fraction of the 818 roles are vacant at any one time after several years of an administration, but full confirmation is exceedingly rare due to turnover, resignations, and vacancies.
- Historical context and recent reporting suggest the number of unfilled or unconformed positions is moderate, not extreme[1][2]. There is no evidence of a dramatic acceleration or stall as of early March 2025.

## Probabilities

Given that almost all roles are filled by a combination of confirmed, acting, and unfilled statuses, and knowing that complete confirmation of all 818 roles is virtually unprecedented, most outcomes will cluster at the higher end of the scale (i.e., well over 70 confirmed roles).

- ‘0-24’: 0.1%
- ‘25-30’: 0.2%
- ‘31-49’: 0.2%
- ‘50-70’: 0.5%
- ‘>70’: 99%

This reflects:
- The overwhelming likelihood that more than 70 critical leadership roles will be Senate-confirmed by April 2025, given the size of the executive branch and historical precedent[1][2].
- A small but nonzero chance of an extremely low outcome due to extraordinary, unforeseen events.
