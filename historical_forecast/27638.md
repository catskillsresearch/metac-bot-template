(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
The resolution will take place on October 1, 2024. As of August 27, 2024, there are a little over **one month** (approximately 34 days) remaining until the outcome is known.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
If no additional layoffs at Meta, Facebook, or Instagram are reported and explicitly listed in Tech Crunch’s layoff tracker for August or September 2024, the question resolves as **No**[1]. As of now, there are no such listings and no current public signals indicating imminent layoffs.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
- Tech Crunch continues updating its tracker regularly, but no layoffs at Meta, Facebook, or Instagram are announced or included for August or September 2024.
- Even if layoffs occur at subsidiaries, unless Meta, Facebook, or Instagram are *explicitly named* by Tech Crunch, these do not count.
- If the tracker stops updating after the launch of the question (August 27, 2024), it also resolves as No, regardless of external news.

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
- Meta, Facebook, or Instagram announce new layoffs before October 1, 2024, and Tech Crunch explicitly lists these layoffs under August or September 2024 in its “comprehensive list of 2024 tech layoffs.”

## Rationale

Meta/Facebook/Instagram have not had major layoff events reported since early 2023, with only a minor round (Instagram, 60 roles) in January 2024 already reflected in the Tech Crunch tracker and outside the relevant window[1][5].  
Recent coverage as of August 2024 shows no indication of imminent layoffs. In fact, Meta has publicly stated plans to **increase headcount** through 2024, especially to support AI growth[2]. The May 2024 closure of the Workplace platform did not result in any listed layoffs for Meta on Tech Crunch as of the cutoff[3].  
Historically, large layoffs at major tech firms like Meta generate substantial pre-announcement buzz, leaks, or analyst predictions—none are presently evident. The labor market in big tech, while still cautious, is not seeing the sweeping cuts of 2022–2023.  
Given the short forecast window (<5 weeks), the organizational stability, the absence of industry rumors, and the explicit requirement for an entry in the Tech Crunch tracker, the **status quo scenario is heavily favored**.

## Final Answer

**Probability: 10%**

(There is always a small chance of an unexpected corporate event or last-minute restructuring, but based on all available evidence, the likelihood that Tech Crunch will report new layoffs at Meta, Facebook, or Instagram before October 1, 2024, is low.)
