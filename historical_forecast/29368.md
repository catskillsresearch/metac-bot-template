(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  
As of October 30, 2024, there are approximately two months (about 62 days) remaining until the January 1, 2025 deadline for this question to resolve.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
To date, SpaceX has not re-used a Starship Super Heavy booster. All Starship test flights have used new boosters, and there is no public information or announced schedule indicating that a re-used booster launch is imminent before the deadline[2][3][5]. If nothing changes, the outcome will be **No**.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
SpaceX continues with development and testing but does not refurbish or fly a previously used Super Heavy booster before January 1, 2025. Possible reasons include the need for additional analysis, technical upgrades, or regulatory/operational delays following the first successful booster catch and recovery[2][3][5].

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
SpaceX swiftly refurbishes the Super Heavy booster successfully caught on October 13, 2024[2][3]. They complete all necessary technical evaluations, secure regulatory approvals, and execute a successful Starship launch using the previously flown booster—defined by both stages leaving the pad under their own power and proper booster separation—before January 1, 2025.

## Rationale

SpaceX has a proven record of rapid iteration and milestone achievement, recently becoming routine in re-using Falcon 9 boosters[4][5]. However, Starship’s Super Heavy booster is a new and much larger system, and, as of late October 2024, re-use has not occurred despite the successful catch milestone on the fifth test flight[2][3][5].

The status quo—no re-use yet, with no public schedule for immediate re-flight—deserves extra weight due to:
- The inherent complexity and potential for unexpected issues during the first refurbishment cycle of such a large, new vehicle[5].
- Historical precedence: Even with Falcon 9, months passed between first recovery and re-flight of a booster[5].
- Regulatory friction: SpaceX has voiced frustration with the pace of FAA approvals, which could add delays[3].
- No public indication from SpaceX or industry reporters that a re-flight is targeted before the deadline[2][3].

Possible accelerators for a "Yes" resolution include SpaceX's aggressive timelines and demonstrated intent to pursue rapid reusability. However, the combination of technical, logistical, and regulatory hurdles, combined with historical pacing of similar developments, suggests the most likely scenario is **no Starship booster re-use before January 1, 2025**.
