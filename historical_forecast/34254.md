(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
As of January 28, 2025, there are roughly two months (until April 1, 2025) before the resolution date for whether any of the listed companies will be dropped from the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA).

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
Currently, all companies in your provided list remain in the DJIA. The most recent changes to the index occurred in November 2024, when NVIDIA and Sherwin-Williams joined, replacing Intel and Dow Inc. Barring any new announcements, the status quo is that all current components will remain in the DJIA up to April 1, 2025[2][3].

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
No companies are dropped from the DJIA between now and April 1, 2025. There is no official announcement or credible reporting of any company being removed from the index during this period. The committee overseeing the DJIA makes no changes, and the current lineup persists through April 1, 2025[2][3].

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
The DJIA committee announces, before April 1, 2025, that any company from your list will no longer be part of the index, effective immediately or at a future date. This would require a press release, a credible news report, or official confirmation of such a change.

## Rationale

Removals from the DJIA are rare and typically occur to better align the index with sector representation or to reflect major changes in corporate structure or performance. The last changes (November 2024) were significant and followed multiple years with minimal adjustments[2][3]. Historically, the DJIA committee does not make frequent back-to-back changes within short time frames unless extraordinary market events or major corporate actions (mergers, bankruptcies, etc.) occur.

Current market forecasts for 2025 anticipate relative stability and moderate growth, without expectiation of major shocks that could force immediate index changes[1][5]. No news or rumors suggest impending removals of any companies from your list as of the latest available date.

Given these factors, the most probable scenario is that no additional changes will be announced before April 1, 2025. However, because such decisions can be made rapidly in response to unforeseen events, there is always some baseline risk. The fact that recent changes were just made in November 2024 further reduces the likelihood of another imminent shakeup.
