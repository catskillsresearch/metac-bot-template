(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  
About one month. The question resolves after the close of trading on the final trading day of December 2024.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
As of late October 2024, Nancy Pelosi's portfolio is strongly up for the year, reportedly making over $23 million through strategic investments, particularly in technology and AI stocks like Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon[2][5]. The S&P 500 is also having a strong, tech-led year, but Pelosi had a clear lead through October. If all holdings and market conditions remained unchanged through December, Pelosi’s portfolio would likely outperform the S&P 500 for the full year, as it did in 2023[1][3][5].

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
A "No" outcome would occur if, during December, Pelosi's concentrated tech-heavy portfolio underperformed due to a sharp correction or rotation out of high-growth technology stocks, while the broader S&P 500, with its diversified holdings, either held steady or declined less. For example, a sudden year-end selloff in AI or semiconductor stocks (such as Nvidia or Broadcom) could erode Pelosi’s gains enough for the S&P 500 to catch up or surpass her portfolio's 12-month return.

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
A "Yes" outcome would result if current trends persist and Pelosi’s portfolio, buoyed by large exposures to outperforming tech stocks, continues to outpace the S&P 500 through year-end. Even moderate gains or stability in her key holdings, with no major reversal in tech sector leadership, would likely maintain her lead and secure outperformance over the S&P 500 for 2024[2][5].

## Rationale

Nancy Pelosi’s portfolio outperformed the S&P 500 by a wide margin in 2023 and has continued to deliver strong gains throughout 2024, especially through her heavy allocation to high-growth technology stocks, most notably Nvidia, which had gained nearly 96% as of March 2024 and remained a large portion of her holdings[2][5]. Through October, Pelosi’s portfolio had generated more than $23 million in gains, driven by both well-timed buys and exits in the volatile tech sector[2][5].

Tech stocks also led the S&P 500’s gains in 2024, but Pelosi’s more concentrated bets on the sector gave her a performance edge for much of the year[3][5]. However, the margin over the S&P 500 may have narrowed compared to 2023, and late-year volatility—especially in tech—could alter the outcome. Still, good forecasters tend to favor the status quo, and historically, Pelosi's portfolio has been agile and well-positioned in sectors driving the market[3].

Given there’s only one month until resolution, and with Pelosi’s significant lead heading into December, the base case is that her portfolio will beat the S&P 500 for 2024 unless there is a notable market rotation or sharp decline in her top holdings at year-end.
