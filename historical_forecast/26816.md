(a) Time left until outcome: The outcome will be known by October 1, 2024, which is approximately 5 months from the current date (May 6, 2025).

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: No handshake between Trump and Harris during their debate(s).

(c) Scenario for No outcome: Trump and Harris maintain the antagonistic relationship indicated in search results, following the recent Biden-Trump debate precedent where no handshake occurred. The candidates remain physically distant throughout the debate with no gesture of civility exchanged.

(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: Despite their contentious relationship, Trump and Harris observe traditional debate protocol with a brief handshake at the beginning of their debate, similar to Trump's behavior with Hillary Clinton in two of their three 2016 debates.

Based on the search results and the current political climate, I'll provide my forecast on whether Donald Trump and Kamala Harris will shake hands in any of their debates before October 1, 2024.

The most recent precedent we have is the June 27, 2024 CNN debate between Biden and Trump, where the candidates did not shake hands during their 90-minute encounter[2][4]. This departure from traditional debate protocol suggests a new normal in presidential debates characterized by heightened antagonism.

Looking at historical patterns, Trump did shake hands with Hillary Clinton in two of their three debates in 2016, indicating he's capable of observing debate traditions when the political climate permits. However, both Trump and Harris refrained from handshakes with their respective opponents in the 2020 debates, though this was primarily attributed to COVID-19 precautions.

The personal relationship between Trump and Harris appears particularly contentious. Trump has reportedly labeled Harris as "pathetic" and used strong language to describe her negatively[3]. Similarly, Harris has compared Trump to "predators," "fraudsters," and "cheaters" in her campaign rhetoric. This level of mutual antagonism suggests little incentive for either candidate to engage in cordial gestures like a handshake.

There's also uncertainty about whether a debate between Trump and Harris will occur at all. As of late July 2024, Trump was already showing reluctance about participating in the scheduled ABC News debate on September 10, calling the network "not worthy of holding a Debate"[3]. If no formal, live debates are held between Trump and Harris, the question would be annulled according to the resolution criteria.

The political calculation for both candidates also weighs against a handshake. Trump's base may view a handshake as unnecessarily conciliatory to an opponent he's attempting to delegitimize. Harris, meanwhile, might want to maintain physical distance to emphasize her criticism of Trump's character and avoid imagery that suggests any level of endorsement or acceptance.

Given the recent Biden-Trump debate precedent, the highly antagonistic relationship between the candidates, and the current political climate that rewards partisan differentiation rather than civility, I assess it's more likely than not that Trump and Harris will not shake hands if they debate.

Probability: 75%
