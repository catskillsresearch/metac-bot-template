(a) Time left until outcome: 5 days from today (October 31, 2024) until November 5, 2024.

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: Kalshi is not currently #1 in the Apple App Store free apps section.

(c) No outcome scenario: Kalshi gains some popularity due to election interest but fails to overcome established apps like social media platforms, games, or other election-related apps that might surge in downloads during this period.

(d) Yes outcome scenario: The U.S. presidential election drives massive interest in prediction markets, causing an unprecedented surge in Kalshi downloads that propels it to #1, especially if the platform offers unique election-related prediction markets.

Based on the available information and current trends, I'll analyze whether Kalshi will reach the #1 position in the Apple App Store on November 5, 2024.

The U.S. presidential election taking place on November 5, 2024, creates a unique opportunity for prediction market platforms like Kalshi to experience significant user growth and engagement. As "the only legal and largest prediction market in the U.S.," Kalshi has positioned itself well to capitalize on election-related interest[1].

## Current Market Position

Kalshi launched in July 2021 and has built a user base of over 1 million people who trade across more than 300 markets including finance, politics, economics, climate, and culture[1]. The app is available in all 50 states, which gives it a nationwide reach unlike many sports betting platforms that face state restrictions[2]. On Google Play, it has a 4.4-star rating based on 821 reviews and has been downloaded more than 100,000 times[1].

However, the search results provide no specific information about Kalshi's current ranking in the Apple App Store, which is crucial baseline information for this forecast. Without knowing its starting position, it's difficult to assess how much growth would be needed to reach #1.

## Competitive Landscape

The prediction market space has other significant players. Polymarket is described as "the largest '2024 US Election Prediction Market'" with users having collectively placed nearly 1.5 billion dollars in bets as of October 2024[5]. Polymarket reached 90,000 monthly active users in September, with consistent daily active users above 10,000 and approximately 15 million website visits that month[5].

In the broader landscape of downloadable apps, Kalshi would need to outperform not just other prediction markets but all free apps in the store, including social media giants, popular games, and other election-related applications that might see surges during this period.

## Election Impact Factor

The timing of the question—November 5, 2024 (Election Day)—is particularly significant. Presidential elections drive enormous public interest, and it's reasonable to expect that prediction markets would see increased activity as users look to place bets on election outcomes.

However, other types of apps also see increased downloads during major political events:

- News apps from major outlets
- Social media platforms where people discuss election results
- Election results tracking apps from major networks
- Voter information and polling place locator apps

For Kalshi to reach #1, it would need to outperform all of these categories on one of the highest-traffic news days of the year.

## Historical Precedent

The search results provide no information about whether prediction market apps have previously reached top App Store positions during major elections or other significant events. This type of historical precedent would be valuable for establishing the likelihood of such an occurrence.

Without specific historical data, we must rely on the general observation that the top positions in app stores are typically dominated by well-established social media platforms, games, and utility apps with massive user bases.

## Status Quo Bias

As a forecaster, I recognize that the status quo typically has strong inertia. App store rankings, particularly at the very top, tend to be dominated by established apps with massive user bases. For a specialized financial/prediction app like Kalshi to displace these leaders would require an exceptional and unprecedented surge in downloads.

While the election provides a plausible catalyst for increased interest, there's no evidence in the search results suggesting Kalshi has the marketing reach or brand recognition to drive the volume of downloads needed to reach the #1 position across all free apps.

## Probability Assessment

Considering all factors:

1. Kalshi has a legitimate niche as a regulated prediction market available nationwide
2. The presidential election provides a natural catalyst for increased downloads
3. However, competition for downloads during the election will be intense from news and social media apps
4. The status quo strongly favors established apps remaining at the top
5. No evidence is presented of historical precedent for prediction markets reaching #1 during similar events
6. The search results provide no indication of Kalshi's current ranking or trajectory in the App Store

Given these considerations and weighing heavily toward the status quo outcome, I assess that while Kalshi will likely see increased downloads around Election Day, reaching the #1 overall position in the Apple App Store represents an extremely ambitious target that would require exceptional circumstances.

Probability: 8%
