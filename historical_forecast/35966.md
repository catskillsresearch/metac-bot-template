(a) Time until outcome: Approximately 1 month (from March 12, 2025 to April 7, 2025)

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: PEPFAR funding remains partially frozen, with only critical HIV services receiving waivers while many programs remain suspended.

(c) No outcome scenario: Congressional reauthorization fails to pass by March 25 deadline, and the Trump administration maintains its position on terminated foreign aid awards despite court challenges. The Supreme Court upholds the administration's authority to review and restrict foreign aid, preventing full restoration of PEPFAR funding before April 7.

(d) Yes outcome scenario: Growing international pressure combined with bipartisan congressional support leads to PEPFAR reauthorization before March 25 with at least 50% funding restoration. The administration implements the reauthorization quickly to comply with court orders and mitigate humanitarian concerns.

Based on the available information, I assess the probability that PEPFAR funding will be resumed before April 7, 2025, as follows:

The current situation shows that PEPFAR funding remains significantly impacted by the January 20, 2025 freeze ordered by the Trump administration. While Secretary of State Rubio issued a waiver exempting specific PEPFAR-supported programming from the Executive Order, the implementation has been problematic. Many PEPFAR partners have reported challenges in resuming waived programming, as evidenced by the Christian maternity clinic in Cote D'Ivoire that cannot access the network to procure and distribute antiretroviral medication despite being approved within the waiver[5].

The administration's subsequent actions have further undermined PEPFAR. On February 26, 2025, USAID and the Department of State announced the termination of nearly 10,000 foreign assistance awards, with approximately 90% of USAID-funding terminated â€“ a significant blow considering USAID is responsible for nearly 60% of PEPFAR's bilateral assistance[5].

The March 25, 2025 reauthorization deadline represents a critical juncture for PEPFAR that will occur before the April 7 date in question[4]. However, given the growing opposition to PEPFAR in Congress, particularly from the Republican Party as mentioned in the background information, reauthorization itself faces significant challenges.

Several factors weigh against a full resumption by April 7:

1. The administration's pattern of resistance to court orders regarding foreign aid funding
2. The termination of numerous PEPFAR-supported projects despite previous waivers
3. The short timeframe between the March 25 reauthorization deadline and April 7
4. The significant political shift against foreign aid programs

Factors supporting potential resumption include:

1. The partial waiver already granted for critical HIV services
2. Legal pressure from ongoing court cases
3. Humanitarian concerns and international pressure
4. Bipartisan support for PEPFAR's mission, despite recent erosion

It's important to recognize the status quo has significant inertia. The administration has demonstrated commitment to its foreign aid review despite court challenges, and the termination of 90% of USAID funding would be difficult to reverse quickly.

For PEPFAR funding to resume at 50% or more of pre-pause levels before April 7, we would need to see both congressional reauthorization and executive implementation occur within a compressed timeframe. While not impossible, this faces substantial political and administrative hurdles.

Probability: 30%
