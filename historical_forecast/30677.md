(a) **Time Remaining Until Outcome Is Known**

- The outcome will be known shortly after December 31, 2024, when the Iowa Environmental Mesonet publishes the December 2024 average daily temperature for the Barrow/Port Rogers NWS weather station. As today is December 3, 2024, there are about 28 days left until the final data is available.

(b) **Status Quo Outcome If Nothing Changed**

- The status quo outcome is that the Barrow/Port Rogers December mean temperature matches the 1945-2023 average. In practice, given observed Arctic warming but significant year-to-year variability, the *slightly more probable status quo* is that December 2024 temperatures are similar to recent decades’ values and may be *slightly above* the long-term (1945-2023) average, but not guaranteed to exceed it.

(c) **Scenario for a No Outcome**

- December 2024 in Barrow/Utqiaġvik turns out colder than average due to unusual large-scale weather patterns, such as persistent Arctic air outbreaks, strong polar vortex stability, or increased sea ice extent, suppressing temperatures to levels at or below the 1945-2023 historical mean.

(d) **Scenario for a Yes Outcome**

- December 2024 is characterized by continued or accelerated Arctic warming, with weather patterns favoring warm air advection and reduced sea ice cover near Alaska’s north coast. This produces monthly mean temperatures that exceed the 1945-2023 December average, continuing the recent trend of record or near-record warmth in the Arctic.

## Rationale

- **Arctic warming trend:** The Arctic is warming at roughly three times the global average. This long-term warming increases the likelihood that any given December will exceed the historical 1945-2023 average. Recent years have often been above the long-term mean, though there remains considerable year-to-year variability.
- **Status quo bias:** Good forecasters give extra weight to the status quo. However, when the "status quo" includes recent years with above-average warmth, the probability that December 2024 also exceeds the historical mean goes up. The slow-moving nature of global climate change suggests that, barring an unusual cold event, the probability of a warmer-than-historical December is modestly to strongly favored.
- **Uncertainties:** Monthly means are subject to short-term weather variability, including the influence of the polar vortex, sea ice anomalies, and teleconnections such as ENSO (El Niño/La Niña). Nevertheless, there is no extraordinary indicator in the search results suggesting a dramatic reversal of recent warming trends for December 2024 in Barrow.
- **Information gaps:** The search results do not provide current year-to-date temperature data or specific seasonal forecasts, so my estimate must rely on persistent Arctic warming as the dominant force.

**Probability: 75%**

This reflects the strong, but not absolute, tendency for recent Decembers in Barrow to be warmer than the 1945-2023 average, balanced against the possibility of colder weather due to natural variability.
