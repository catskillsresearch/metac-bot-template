As a professional forecaster, I'll analyze the race for Maine's 2nd Congressional District and provide a probability assessment.

(a) Time until outcome: The election is scheduled for November 5, 2024, which is 6 days from today (May 6, 2025). Waitâ€”there appears to be a discrepancy in the dates. If today is May 6, 2025, then the election has already occurred on November 5, 2024. However, the search results provided are from October 2024, so I'll proceed with analyzing the race as if the election is upcoming.

(b) Status quo outcome: Jared Golden is the three-term Democratic incumbent who has won his previous elections, though by relatively narrow margins. He won by just 1 percentage point in 2018 and by 6 points in each of his last two elections[5]. The status quo would suggest another Golden victory, though likely by a slim margin.

(c) Scenario for a No outcome: Austin Theriault, the Republican challenger and former NASCAR driver, defeats Golden by capitalizing on several factors: 1) The district's clear preference for Trump in presidential elections (having voted for him in 2016 and 2020)[3]; 2) Golden's changed position on gun control alienating Second Amendment supporters in this rural district[3]; 3) Higher Republican turnout driven by Trump being on the ballot again[5]; and 4) National Republican support including endorsements from Trump and House Speaker Mike Johnson providing resources and enthusiasm[5].

(d) Scenario for a Yes outcome: Jared Golden wins re-election by leveraging his established reputation for independence in a district that has shown willingness for split-ticket voting. His background as a Marine veteran continues to resonate with voters[4][5], and his strong constituent service over three terms provides enough goodwill to overcome partisan headwinds. Despite his changed position on assault weapons following the Lewiston shooting, enough voters respect his authentic evolution on the issue. Golden's previous electoral success demonstrates his ability to win in this district even when Trump is on the ballot.

## Rationale

Looking at the data, this race presents as genuinely competitive with significant factors pushing in both directions. A mid-September poll showed Theriault leading Golden by 47% to 44%, but with a 3.5% margin of error, placing them in a statistical tie[2]. National analysts, including the Cook Political Report, categorize this race as a "toss-up"[1].

Several factors favor Theriault:
- The district has consistently voted for Trump while Golden has been in office[3]
- Golden's changed position on gun control following the Lewiston shooting provides a clear attack line for Republicans[3]
- Republicans nationally are investing heavily in this race, seeing it as a key pickup opportunity[1]

However, Golden has important advantages:
- Incumbency provides name recognition and a track record of constituent service
- He has successfully won three previous elections in this district, demonstrating an ability to appeal across party lines
- His background as a Marine veteran and reputation for independence resonates in the district[4][5]

The "guns" issue cuts both ways. While Golden's position change on assault weapons may alienate some voters, the Lewiston tragedy affected many in the district personally, potentially making his evolution on the issue understandable to voters[3].

Putting extra weight on the status quo as a disciplined forecaster should, I note that Golden has demonstrated an ability to win in this district even when Trump is on the ballot, as he did in 2020. His margins have been consistent at 6 points in his last two elections. However, the current polling showing a statistical tie and the broader political environment suggest this race is truly competitive.

Probability: 55%
