(a) Time left until outcome: 13 days (from March 18, 2025 to March 31, 2025)

(b) Status quo outcome: Based on the available data, the All-In podcast appears to be ranked around #55 in cross-platform rankings as of December 2024. It is not mentioned in the top 40 Spotify-specific rankings in recent reports. If nothing changes, it would likely remain in the 41-50 range or lower (≥51).

(c) Unexpected outcome scenario: The All-In podcast hosts could release a particularly viral episode featuring a high-profile guest or discussing a breaking news event that generates significant interest. Alternatively, if one of the hosts becomes involved in a major business deal or controversy that draws public attention, this could drive a sudden surge in listenership, potentially pushing the podcast into the top 30 or even higher on Spotify's charts.

When making my forecast, I need to consider both the available evidence and the possibility of unexpected developments. The search results provide some context but have limitations - the most recent cross-platform ranking (#55) is from December 2024, and we have limited Spotify-specific data.

Looking at the evidence, we know that All-In is hosted by four prominent venture capitalists and focuses on business and technology topics. While it has a dedicated audience, it hasn't appeared in the most recent Spotify top lists according to the search results. The Joe Rogan Experience remains the #1 podcast on Spotify as of May 5, 2025[4], suggesting stability at the top of the charts.

Podcast rankings are influenced by several factors including unique listeners, follower counts, and engagement metrics[3]. All-In has maintained a presence in the top 100 cross-platform, but its Spotify-specific ranking isn't explicitly stated in our data.

As a professional forecaster, I recognize that the status quo often persists - podcast rankings tend to be somewhat stable outside of major events or promotional pushes. However, I must account for potential volatility, especially for shows outside the top positions.

With only 13 days until the resolution date, significant movement is possible but not highly probable without a catalyst. The podcast could benefit from a timely discussion of market events or tech industry developments in March 2025, potentially improving its position.

My final probabilities for the All-In podcast's ranking on Spotify Podcast Charts on March 31, 2025:

1-15: 5%
16-30: 15%
31-40: 25%
41-50: 30%
≥51: 25%
