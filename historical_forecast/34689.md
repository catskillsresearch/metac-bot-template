(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
The BLS typically publishes January data by mid-February. As today is May 6, 2025, the outcome is already known and available.

(b) **Outcome if nothing changed:**  
If the price remained the same as December 2024, the January 2025 value would be **6.776** (USD per pound)[2].

(c) **Outcome if the current trend continued:**  
Recent monthly BLS values:
- November 2024: 6.868
- December 2024: 6.776

The change from November to December was -0.092, about -1.3%. Continuing this (modest declining) trend:
\[
6.776 \times (1 - 0.013) \approx 6.688
\]
However, the FRED and BLS data [2][4] indicate **January 2025: 7.019**, an increase over December.

(d) **Expectations of experts and markets:**  
- Global coffee prices experienced downward pressure entering 2025 due to overproduction and slackening demand, suggesting stabilization or a decrease might have been anticipated[3].
- However, authoritative price reporting from BLS via FRED shows an uptick to 7.019 for January 2025[2][4].
- Thus, expert expectations for a flat or modestly falling price were contradicted by the actual outcome, which saw a reversal and modest price increase.

(e) **Unexpected scenario with a low outcome:**  
A sharp and unexpected price drop (closer to 6.6 or below) could have resulted if there had been an international trade breakthrough, dramatically lessening tariffs or non-tariff barriers, or if a record-setting harvest in Brazil or Vietnam suddenly flooded the market.

(f) **Unexpected scenario with a high outcome:**  
A spike (well above 7.0) could have been driven by renewed supply chain disruptions, severe weather damaging crops in major producing countries, or a surge in US consumer demand due to unexpected economic developments or a sharp weakening of the USD.
