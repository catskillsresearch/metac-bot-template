(a) **Time Left Until Outcome is Known:**  
As of November 20, 2024, there are approximately six weeks until January 1, 2025, when this question will be resolved.

(b) **Status Quo Outcome if Nothing Changed:**  
iHeartMedia, Inc. continues to operate without having filed for bankruptcy. The company is actively implementing a major debt restructuring agreement announced in November 2024 and recent cost-cutting measures. No bankruptcy filing has occurred as of now[4][5].

(c) **Scenario Resulting in a No Outcome:**  
A "No" outcome occurs if iHeartMedia, Inc. files a petition for bankruptcy protection under any chapter of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code before January 1, 2025.

- Example: The company’s debt restructuring negotiations break down, creditors force the issue, or a sudden liquidity crisis arises, leading iHeartMedia to file for bankruptcy before the deadline.

(d) **Scenario Resulting in a Yes Outcome:**  
A "Yes" outcome occurs if iHeartMedia, Inc. does not file for bankruptcy protection before January 1, 2025.

- Example: The ongoing debt restructuring is accepted by creditors, cost reductions help stabilize operations, and iHeartMedia continues to meet its obligations through the end of 2024 without resorting to bankruptcy.

## Rationale

- **Recent Actions and Financial Health:**  
iHeartMedia remains heavily indebted ($5.2 billion) but has not missed payments or defaulted imminently[3]. The company has recently disclosed an agreement with a major creditor group for restructuring $4.1 billion in outstanding debt, a clear signal of proactive management and creditor cooperation[4]. Management has also introduced layoffs aimed at cutting $150 million in costs for 2025, indicating further commitment to shoring up financial health[5].

- **Immediate Bankruptcy Risk:**  
There is no indication as of November 2024 that iHeartMedia, Inc. plans to or is about to file for bankruptcy in the immediate future. The company is working with creditors, not in open conflict, and the announced restructuring is proceeding[4].

- **Timeline for Debt Maturity:**  
Most of iHeartMedia's most pressing maturities are in 2026–2027[2][3], so the key danger window is still more than a year away. The restructuring activity in late 2024 is being done precisely to avoid a forced bankruptcy before those maturities hit.

- **Market and Operational Trends:**  
Operating results in 2024 are showing some improvement, with growing digital and podcast revenues and modest overall revenue growth[1][5]. While interest payments still exceed operating income, there is evidence the company is successfully extending its runway.

- **Weighting Status Quo:**  
Given that bankruptcy filings are rare, especially when management and creditors are actively cooperating, and given about six weeks remain in the year, the most likely outcome is that iHeartMedia will not file for bankruptcy before January 1, 2025.

## Final Assessment

There is no evidence, as of November 2024, to suggest a bankruptcy filing is imminent. The status quo is holding, proactive measures are underway, and the time window is short. However, the risk is not zero due to the company’s stressed financial position and potential for unexpected disruption.

**Probability: 93%** (iHeartMedia will continuously operate through January 1, 2025, without filing for bankruptcy.)
