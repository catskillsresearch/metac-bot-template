(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
Approximately 8 weeks remain until October 1, 2024.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
No public IPO announcement by Anthropic currently exists on its official News section. If no announcement is made in that section before the deadline, the outcome is **No**.

(c) **Brief scenario for a No outcome:**  
Anthropic continues to pursue aggressive private fundraising and partnerships (such as those with Amazon and Google[2][4][5]), but does not formally announce IPO plans on its News section before October 1, 2024. The company remains private and silent regarding public offering intentions, consistent with its communications so far[1][5].

(d) **Brief scenario for a Yes outcome:**  
Anthropic, in response to further capital needs, market dynamics, or pressure from investors, decides to publicly announce its intention to pursue an IPO. This is formally communicated on the News section of its website prior to October 1, 2024.

## Rationale

As of early August 2024, Anthropic is a rapidly growing private company with a recent valuation reported between $15–$18 billion[1][5] and substantial, ongoing private investment—particularly the $4 billion commitment from Amazon and significant backing from Google[2][4][5]. Industry analysts and available sources consistently indicate there is currently no official plan or date for an IPO, and the company seems focused on scaling and private capital rather than initiating an imminent public offering[1][5].

Historical precedent shows that large, late-stage private AI companies frequently remain private as long as significant capital is available from private markets and strategic investors. The current environment matches this pattern: Anthropic is still raising significant funds privately, including a recent $750 million round led by Menlo Ventures[5]. This reduces financial pressure for a near-term IPO.

Market conditions for tech IPOs are improving slowly but remain tentative, and the broader trend for high-profile AI companies has been to delay public offerings until absolutely necessary[3]. There are also no public signals from management or investors indicating a sudden change in this stance.

Given the explicit requirement that the announcement must appear on Anthropic’s official News page—not just in external news reporting—the status quo is heavily favored. If nothing changes, the answer is "No." For the answer to be "Yes," Anthropic would need to make a deliberate, high-profile shift in its public communications and business strategy within the next 8 weeks—a move that has not been foreshadowed by current behavior or public statements[1][5].

Most of the time, the world is stable and companies follow established patterns. Therefore, the base rate for near-term IPO announcements for companies in Anthropic's position is low.
