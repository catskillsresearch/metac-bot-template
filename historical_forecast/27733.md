(a) Time until outcome: 107 days (from May 6, 2025 to September 10, 2024, which is in the past)
(b) Status quo outcome: The debate did occur as scheduled
(c) No outcome scenario: The debate could have been canceled if Trump had followed through on his threats to withdraw due to his criticism of ABC News, or if either candidate had become unable to participate due to unforeseen circumstances
(d) Yes outcome scenario: Both candidates maintained their commitment to debate, final rules were agreed upon, and the debate proceeded as scheduled on September 10, 2024

Since I am answering this question on May 6, 2025, which is after the scheduled debate date of September 10, 2024, I need to assess whether this event actually occurred in the past.

Based on the available information up to August 28, 2024, both candidates had publicly committed to participating in the September 10 debate hosted by ABC News. Trump had initially expressed reluctance but then recommitted to the debate, while Harris consistently expressed her willingness to participate.

Looking at historical patterns, Trump had previously withdrawn from scheduled debates, including one in October 2020 and a primary debate in March 2016. This introduced some uncertainty about whether he would follow through with his commitment. However, as of August 28, 2024, there was no official announcement of cancellation or withdrawal by either candidate.

The debate preparation was clearly in progress, with ABC News having announced that "World News Tonight" anchor David Muir and ABC News Live Prime anchor Linsey Davis would moderate the debate at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia. The only outstanding issues appeared to be finalizing debate rules, with reported disagreements over whether microphones would be muted.

Since I'm being asked about this event from a future perspective (May 2025), and I only have information up to August 28, 2024, I cannot definitively state whether the debate actually occurred. The information I have shows that preparations were underway and both candidates had agreed to participate, but I don't have confirmation that the event actually took place.

Given the strong public commitments from both campaigns, the formal arrangements by ABC News, and the high stakes of the first debate between these candidates in the 2024 election cycle, there was a strong likelihood that the debate would proceed as scheduled. However, Trump's history of withdrawing from debates and his criticisms of ABC News introduced some uncertainty.

Without knowing what happened between August 29, 2024, and September 10, 2024, I must acknowledge that unforeseen events could have led to cancellation or rescheduling.

Probability: 75%
