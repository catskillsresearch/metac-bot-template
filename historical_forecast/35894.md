(a) Time left until outcome: 25 days (from May 6, 2025 to April 1, 2025 - which has already passed)

(b) Status quo outcome: The election has already taken place on April 1, 2025, but the search results don't provide the winner. The status quo before the election was a liberal majority on the Wisconsin Supreme Court following the 2023 election that flipped the court's ideological balance.

(c) An unexpected outcome scenario: A third candidate could have emerged late in the race and won through a split vote between the two main candidates. Alternatively, a major scandal affecting either candidate in the final days before the election could have dramatically shifted voter preferences.

The Wisconsin Supreme Court election that took place on April 1, 2025, was one of the most consequential and expensive judicial races in American history. As a forecaster, I need to analyze the available information to determine the probable winner between Brad Schimel and Susan Crawford.

This election was particularly significant because it determined whether the Wisconsin Supreme Court would maintain its liberal majority achieved in 2023 or shift back to conservative control. The race pitted Waukesha County Judge Brad Schimel, a conservative and former Republican attorney general, against Dane County Judge Susan Crawford, who was endorsed by the state Democratic Party[2][4].

## Campaign Context and Dynamics

The 2025 Wisconsin Supreme Court race broke spending records with more than $33 million poured into the campaign by early March 2025[2]. Notably, groups affiliated with Elon Musk contributed approximately $6 million to the race, indicating substantial national interest in the outcome[2].

This election followed the historically expensive 2023 Wisconsin Supreme Court race that resulted in liberals gaining control of the court for the first time in over a decade[2][4]. The 2025 race offered conservatives an opportunity to regain influence through Justice Brian Hagedorn becoming the pivotal swing vote again[5].

## Geographical and Political Factors

Both candidates had strong regional bases that likely influenced voting patterns:

- Susan Crawford is a Dane County judge, representing the state's liberal stronghold[4][5]
- Brad Schimel is a Waukesha County judge, representing a conservative-leaning area[4][5]
- Crawford received endorsements from the court's four current liberal members[5]
- Schimel, as a former Republican attorney general, likely maintained strong support from the conservative base[2][4]

## Historical Patterns and Turnout Considerations

Wisconsin judicial elections have shown significant volatility in recent years. The 2023 election represented a major shift after a long period of conservative control[2]. Additionally, Justice Brian Hagedorn has demonstrated independence as a swing vote on the court, being in the majority for 50 of the 61 split 4-3 decisions in the four years prior to the liberal majority[5].

Since the 2025 election took place during a non-presidential election year, turnout patterns would likely differ from high-profile general elections. However, the extraordinary spending and national attention from figures like Elon Musk may have boosted voter participation beyond typical judicial races[2][4].

## Probability Assessment

Considering all available information, I must acknowledge substantial uncertainty in this forecast since the search results don't provide post-election information about the winner. Based on historical patterns, campaign dynamics, and the status of Wisconsin politics:

Brad Schimel: 55%
Susan Crawford: 44%
Someone else: 1%

I give a slight edge to Brad Schimel based on the significant financial support from conservative donors including Elon Musk[2][4], historical patterns of conservative success in Wisconsin judicial elections prior to 2023, and the tendency for midterm-type elections to favor the party not in control of the White House. However, Crawford's endorsements from sitting justices and the recent liberal victory in 2023 suggest she had a strong chance as well[5]. I maintain a small probability for "someone else" to account for unforeseen circumstances, though this is highly unlikely in what appears to have been effectively a two-person race.
