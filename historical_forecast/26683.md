(a) Time left until outcome known: Since the 2024 Paris Olympics are currently underway (as of May 6, 2025), the outcome of this question is already known. The Olympics concluded on August 11, 2024, approximately 9 months ago.

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: Based on recent Olympic Games, the status quo would be 3-9 countries winning their first gold medal, with an average of 5 across the last three Summer Olympics.

(c) Scenario for No outcome: Less than 5 countries won their first gold medal at the 2024 Paris Olympics, continuing the pattern seen in London 2012 and Tokyo 2020, where established Olympic powers dominated the gold medal count.

(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: 5 or more countries won their first gold medal at the 2024 Paris Olympics, possibly including emerging sports powers or countries benefiting from new Olympic sports introduced in 2024.

Based on the search results, I can provide a definitive answer since the 2024 Paris Olympics have already concluded. The search results show the final medal table and some information about medal winners, but they don't specifically identify which countries won their first-ever gold medals.

Looking at the medal table from the search results, we can see that the United States topped the medal count with 40 gold medals, followed by China also with 40 golds, and Japan with 20 gold medals[1]. This confirms that established Olympic powers continued their dominance at the Paris Games.

The search results don't provide information about new countries winning their first gold medals. The medal table shows several countries that have won gold medals before, including the USA, China, Japan, Australia, France, Netherlands, Great Britain, Republic of Korea, Italy, Germany, New Zealand, Canada, Uzbekistan, Hungary, Spain, Sweden, Kenya, Norway, Ireland, Brazil, and Iran[1].

The results mention that China won the first gold medal of the Games in shooting (mixed team air rifle) with Huang Yuting and Sheng Lihao[2]. They also won gold in women's synchronized 3m springboard diving with Yani Chang and Yiwen Chen[2]. Meanwhile, Australia won gold in women's cycling with Grace Brown in the road time trial, and the USA won gold in the men's 4x100m freestyle relay[5].

Without specific information about countries winning their first-ever gold medals, I cannot definitively state whether 5 or more countries achieved this milestone. However, based on the medal table shown, most gold medals went to established Olympic powers that have won gold medals in previous Games.

Given the historical pattern (average of 5 first-time gold medal winners across the last three Olympics), and considering that the search results don't indicate any dramatic shift in the distribution of gold medals toward new countries, I would estimate that fewer than 5 countries likely won their first gold medal at the 2024 Paris Olympics.

Probability: 30%
