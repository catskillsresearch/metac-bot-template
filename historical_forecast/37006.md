(a) **Time until outcome is known:**  
The question will be resolved after the 2025 Canadian federal election, which is expected to take place on or before October 20, 2025—so there are approximately 5–6 months remaining.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
Based on current projections and polling, the Bloc Québécois is expected to win more seats in Quebec than the Conservative Party. According to a recent projection, the Bloc is set to win about 19 seats, reflecting a decline from its previous total, but still generally ahead of the Conservatives, whose Quebec presence remains limited[3].

(c) **Scenario for a No outcome:**  
The Conservative Party would need to make significant gains in Quebec—either through a last-minute surge in support, targeted campaigning in key ridings, or if the Bloc's support collapses further. This could happen if the Conservatives rapidly increase their province-wide vote share, or if Bloc voters strategically shift to the Conservatives to oppose Liberals or NDP candidates.

(d) **Scenario for a Yes outcome:**  
The Bloc Québécois maintains its current polling advantage over the Conservatives in Quebec, holding on to more seats despite reduced numbers compared to 2021. The Bloc continues to outperform the Conservatives in key francophone ridings and leverages its established local networks and identity-based appeal.

## Rationale

- **Polling and Projections:**  
Status quo seat projections show the Bloc Québécois at 19 seats, with the Conservative seat share in Quebec expected to remain low, since the Conservatives typically struggle to gain traction beyond a handful of ridings in the province[3][2].

- **Recent Momentum:**  
The Bloc's seat count is projected to decline, primarily due to Liberal gains, not Conservative advances. There is no evidence in current polling or projections that the Conservatives are poised to overtake the Bloc in Quebec seats[3].

- **Past Results:**  
In the last parliament, the Bloc held 33 Quebec seats versus a handful for the Conservatives. While the Bloc is set to lose ground, the gap between its seat count and that of the Conservatives is still significant[3][2].

- **Uncertainties:**  
It is always possible for unexpected events or campaign dynamics to rapidly shift voter intentions, particularly if one party's support collapses, but as of the latest data, no such trend is apparent.

- **Forecaster's Rule:**  
Given the “status quo bias” in political forecasting and the absence of strong evidence for sudden Conservative gains, the most likely outcome is that the Bloc Québécois will win more seats in Quebec than the Conservative Party of Canada.
