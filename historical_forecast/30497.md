(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
Today is November 26, 2024. The resolution will occur after December 31, 2024, when the full month’s data is available. That means just over a month remains until the outcome can be determined by observing the IEM data calendar for Anchorage.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
Historically, Anchorage records multiple days below 0°F every December, and this remains the most common pattern[1][5]. The most recent exception was December 2019, when subzero lows did not occur. The long-term trend is for at least one subzero day each December, so the status quo expectation is “Yes.”

(c) **Scenario for a No outcome:**  
A “No” would result if, like in December 2019, the low temperature never dips below 0°F for the entire month. This could happen if persistent warm air patterns, possibly influenced by ongoing climate change and Pacific weather anomalies, keep nighttime lows above 0°F for all 31 days. Recent warmer trends in Alaska winters make this plausible, though not yet common[3][4].

(d) **Scenario for a Yes outcome:**  
A “Yes” would result if, on any day in December 2024, the observed low temperature for the PANC station falls below 0°F as recorded by the IEM data calendar. This could easily occur during a typical Arctic or polar air outbreak, which remains a regular feature of Alaskan Decembers, even in warmer years[2][4][5].

## Rationale

- **Historical pattern:** Most Decembers in Anchorage feature at least one subzero low. Outliers, such as 2019, are rare over the past decades[1][5].
- **Warming trend:** Alaska—including Anchorage—has seen warmer winters overall, but extreme cold snaps remain possible due to normal Arctic variability[4][5].
- **Forecast and average temperatures:** Forecasts and historical averages show December lows often dip well below 0°F, with some sites forecasting lows around -6°F and average end-of-December lows close to -8.3°F[4][5]. This is consistent with historical norms and suggests the atmospheric setup for subzero lows exists this year.
- **Recent Decembers:** While 2023 and other recent years have been warmer than average, the monthly average remains around 10°F, with brief colder spells still common.

Given these facts, the prudent forecasting approach is to lean toward the historical base rate (“status quo”), slightly discounted for the background warming trend and recognizing the recent exception in 2019.
