(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
There are approximately 26 days until April 1, 2025, the cutoff for this question.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
As of March 6, 2025, Databricks has not announced plans for an IPO nor filed an SEC Form S-1. If this continues and no announcement or filing is made by April 1, the answer will be "No."

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
Databricks continues its current approach: leadership maintains deliberate ambiguity and caution, does not feel compelled by investor or market pressure to announce an IPO, and leverages recent private funding (e.g., its $10B Series J round) to delay going public[1][2][3]. No official IPO plans are announced or S-1 filed before the deadline.

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
Databricks leadership or board determines market conditions are optimal and announces—via a website post or SEC Form S-1—that it is planning an IPO, or makes a public statement or regulatory filing to this effect, before April 1, 2025. This would constitute a clear strategic pivot or a reaction to rapidly changing market or investor circumstances.

## Rationale

- **Status Quo Analysis:** Databricks has consistently signaled its intent to wait for the right market conditions before going public, despite being technically ready for an IPO and under some investor pressure[2][1]. CEO Ali Ghodsi emphasized in late 2024 that it was "dumb to IPO" ahead of the US election and that the company preferred to provide liquidity via private markets in the meantime, rather than rushing to public markets[1]. Databricks' last major funding round in December 2024 was described as a temporary measure instead of a pre-IPO round, further reducing immediate pressure to go public[1].

- **Recent Statements:** As of early 2025, Databricks still had not committed to a concrete IPO timeline[5], and industry analysts generally expect an IPO in the second half of 2025 or later[2][4]. While there is always a nonzero chance of a rapid pivot—especially for large tech companies if market conditions dramatically improve—the company's public posture remains deliberate and patient.

- **Market Dynamics:** The company has ample private funding ($10B Series J, $62B valuation)[1][3] and liquidity options, allowing it to bide its time and reducing the incentive to announce an IPO hastily. An announcement within the remaining 26 days would require a significant and unexpected change in leadership strategy or market environment, for which there is no current signal.

- **Weight of Evidence:** Good forecasting practice gives extra weight to the status quo, as major strategic shifts in high-profile companies are rare and typically signaled in advance. No such signals have been seen in the most recent statements or actions from Databricks' leadership[1][2][3][5].

## Final Assessment

Probability: **10%**

This reflects a small but nonzero chance that unforeseen developments could prompt Databricks to announce an IPO before April 1, 2025, but all available evidence strongly supports a "No" outcome at this time.
