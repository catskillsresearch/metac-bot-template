(a) Time left until outcome: 239 days (from May 6, 2025 to December 31, 2024 - note this is impossible as we're already in 2025, but I'll proceed as if we're forecasting from a point in 2024)

(b) Status quo outcome: Currently, Kalshi is highly ranked in the Apple App Store due to election-related betting, having reached #1 overall in free apps during the November 2024 election. However, based on the search results, Coinbase appears to typically maintain a higher ranking in the finance category during non-election periods.

(c) Scenario for No outcome: After the election excitement fades, Kalshi experiences a significant drop in new users and engagement as the primary driver of its popularity (election betting) concludes. Meanwhile, Coinbase maintains steady usage driven by cryptocurrency trading and investment activity through year-end, reclaiming and maintaining its higher position in the finance app rankings.

(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: Kalshi successfully leverages its election-period popularity to retain users and introduce them to its other prediction markets (weather, sports, economics, etc.), maintaining strong engagement. The platform launches compelling new markets for year-end events, while simultaneously Coinbase experiences reduced activity due to cryptocurrency market conditions or other factors.

As a professional forecaster, I need to evaluate the likelihood of Kalshi outranking Coinbase in Apple's free Finance apps category by December 31, 2024. Let me analyze the available information systematically.

The search results show that as of November 5, 2024 (Election Day in the US), Kalshi had risen to the #1 position in the Apple App Store's free apps category[1]. This remarkable surge was clearly driven by interest in betting on the 2024 US presidential election, which Kalshi had been legally permitted to offer after securing a federal appeals court victory in September 2024[1].

What's particularly notable is that Kalshi is described as "the only prediction market operating in the U.S. that's regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC)"[1]. This gives it a unique regulatory advantage in the US market for prediction markets.

However, there are several factors that suggest this high ranking might be temporary:

1. **Election-Driven Popularity**: The search results explicitly tie Kalshi's surge to the 2024 presidential election. With the election concluding on November 5, 2024, the primary driver of downloads and engagement would likely diminish.

2. **Historical Precedent**: The query mentions that on October 11, 2024, Kalshi's CEO tweeted about surpassing Coinbase, but by the next day, Coinbase had regained its lead. This suggests that Kalshi's ability to maintain a top position over Coinbase has been tenuous, even during the election period.

3. **Seasonal Factors**: The period between the election (November) and December 31 includes major holidays and year-end financial activities, which might favor established financial platforms like Coinbase over prediction markets.

The current surge for Kalshi is exceptional rather than typical. While Kalshi claims over 1 million users trading across 300+ markets[2], this user base is likely still smaller than Coinbase's established cryptocurrency customer base. Cryptocurrency trading tends to have consistent activity regardless of election cycles.

Looking at the App Store rankings provided in search result [3], I don't see either Kalshi or Coinbase listed among the top Finance apps, though this data may not be current or complete. The typical leaders appear to be apps like Credit Karma, Cash App, and PayPal.

For Kalshi to maintain its lead over Coinbase through December 31, it would need to:
- Successfully convert election bettors into regular users of other prediction markets
- Launch compelling new markets that drive continued engagement
- Maintain download momentum well after the election excitement fades

While Kalshi offers a variety of markets beyond politics (finance, weather, culture)[2], the question is whether these will be compelling enough to maintain the app's ranking after the main election-related activity concludes.

The status quo in app rankings typically favors stability, with established apps maintaining their relative positions absent major events or disruptions. The US presidential election represents exactly such a major event, but its effect is likely to be temporary.

Probability: 25%
