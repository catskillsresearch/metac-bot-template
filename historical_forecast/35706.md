(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  
There are approximately 3 weeks remaining until April 1, 2025.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
As of March 7, 2025, Donald Trump has not visited China during his second term, and there is no publicly confirmed plan or scheduled date for such a visit before April 1, 2025. The status quo is therefore a “No” outcome.

(c) **Scenario that results in a No outcome:**  
Trump does not travel to China before April 1, 2025, due either to lack of scheduling, ongoing diplomatic preparations, or heightened tensions over newly imposed tariffs and ongoing trade disputes.

(d) **Scenario that results in a Yes outcome:**  
Trump and his administration expedite diplomatic arrangements, possibly bypassing traditional protocol due to political urgency or mutual interest, and he travels to China before April 1, 2025, despite the compressed planning timeline and recent trade tensions.

## Rationale

Donald Trump has expressed an intent to visit China early in his second term, reportedly aiming to do so within 100 days of his January 20, 2025 inauguration[2]. However, this 100-day window stretches into late April, which is after the April 1 deadline specified in the question.

Diplomatic experts note that state visits generally require six months or more of planning, although expedited arrangements are possible if both sides are motivated and willing to forgo some usual protocol[2]. Still, even “as soon as possible” under normal circumstances would make a pre-April visit challenging.

The recent escalation in trade tensions adds further headwinds. In February and March 2025, the Trump administration imposed significant new tariffs on Chinese imports, raising the baseline tariff rate to 20%[3][4][5]. China has retaliated with its own set of tariffs and trade measures, some specifically targeting sensitive U.S. products[2][4]. These developments, just weeks before the April 1 deadline, suggest a diplomatic environment that is not conducive to hastily arranging a presidential visit.

No public reports or official announcements as of March 7, 2025, indicate a state visit to China has been scheduled before April 1, 2025. The most recent information from both U.S. and Chinese sources focuses on trade disputes and retaliatory actions, rather than high-level diplomatic travel plans[2][3][4][5].

Given all the above, the default prediction—a strong tendency for the status quo to persist—should be weighted heavily. The possibility of a last-minute, rapidly arranged visit remains, but would be unprecedented and would require quick, extraordinary coordination between two governments currently engaged in escalating trade disputes.
