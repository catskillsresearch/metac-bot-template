(a) **Time remaining**: 48 days (from November 14, 2024, to January 1, 2025).  
(b) **Status quo outcome**: OpenAIâ€™s commercial operations remain governed by its nonprofit board of directors.  
(c) **No outcome**: No formal restructuring occurs before January 1, 2025, as negotiations, legal processes, or implementation delays push governance changes into 2025.  
(d) **Yes outcome**: OpenAI finalizes a restructuring (e.g., removes profit caps, transitions to a public benefit corporation, or transfers assets to a non-nonprofit-controlled entity) before the deadline.

### Rationale  
1. **Status quo bias**: Governance changes of this magnitude typically involve prolonged negotiations, legal reviews, and operational adjustments. The lack of finalized plans as of late September 2024[3][5], combined with a likely 2025 timeline for restructuring[4][5], strongly favors continuity.  
2. **Investor timeline**: Reports note that funding agreements allow **up to two years** for governance changes[4], with no indication of acceleration.  
3. **No precedent for abrupt action**: While staff departures or legal triggers could force early changes, no credible evidence of such events exists as of November 14, 2024[3][5].  

**Probability: 15%**  
*Low likelihood due to institutional inertia, unresolved negotiations, and explicit 2025 timelines in credible reports[3][4][5].*
