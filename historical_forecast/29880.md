(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
As of November 11, 2024, there are approximately seven weeks (about 50 days) until December 31, 2024, when Forbes will determine the year-end billionaire rankings.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
On October 8, 2024, George Soros was ranked 424th on the Forbes Real-Time Billionaires List. If his net worth and those of his immediate peers remain stable, Soros would finish outside the top 400 and the outcome would be **No**.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
Soros's net worth either stays the same or decreases due to ongoing philanthropic giving, market underperformance, or substantial donations from his Open Society Foundations. Meanwhile, others above him also maintain or grow their fortunes, keeping Soros out of the top 400.

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
Soros’s net worth increases at a faster pace than at least 24 individuals currently ranked above him—either due to a sudden rally in his investment portfolio or significant declines in the net worth of those just above him (e.g., due to stock market volatility or major asset corrections impacting others).

## Rationale

- **Momentum and Patterns:** Soros has a long and ongoing history of large-scale giving that systematically reduces his net worth over time[2][4][5]. In 2024 alone, his wealth decreased, reportedly from $7.17 billion to $6.7–7.2 billion[4][5], and he gives away about $1.5 billion per year via the Open Society Foundations[4]. This pattern of reductions, rather than accumulation, suggests further movement up the list is statistically unlikely unless countervailing factors suddenly arise.
- **Relative Movement:** For Soros to move from #424 into the top 400, his net worth must surpass at least 24 peers. Given the competitive and growing nature of the billionaire class—fueled by tech, finance, and emerging markets—most individuals at the lower edge of the top 400 are unlikely to see dramatic declines absent a major global downturn.
- **Market Volatility and Exceptional Events:** While end-of-year market swings or a specific downturn affecting a cluster of billionaires could theoretically allow Soros to climb the ranks, there is no specific evidence suggesting such an event will occur or benefit him directly. Most of Soros's wealth is now in diversified, lower-volatility holdings rather than high-growth speculative bets[3].
- **Status Quo Bias:** Wealth rankings, particularly outside the very top tiers, tend to move slowly unless disrupted by extraordinary events or structural market changes. Soros’s advanced age, lack of direct investment management, and ongoing philanthropic activities further reinforce the likelihood of continued gradual net worth decline or stasis relative to peers[2][5].

## Final Answer

Probability: 10%  

This reflects strong status quo bias and the ongoing pattern of Soros's declining relative net worth, with a small chance left for substantial late-year market volatility impacting his ranking or other unforeseen events.
