(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
As of February 17, 2025, the outcome will be known in **26 days** (the period runs from February 15 to March 15, 2025).

(b) **Outcome if nothing changed:**  
If February and early March 2025 continue at the pace observed in the recent "new normal" months, the monthly incursion number will likely remain between **200 and 280**. For January 2025, 255 aircraft incursions were recorded[3][5]. If the rate holds steady, the 29-day period (Feb 15–Mar 15) would see approximately **255 incursions** as the default outcome[3].

(c) **Outcome if the current trend continued:**  
Since May 2024, every month has seen over 200 incursions, peaking at 280 around the inauguration and averaging roughly 255 since[3][5]. Thus, if this trend continues, the outcome for the period would likely be **between 230 and 280 incursions**[3][5].

(d) **Expectations of experts and markets:**  
Analysts have widely noted that the PRC has normalized this elevated level of ADIZ violations as a deliberate pressure campaign[3][5]. Experts do not expect a major increase or decrease unless a significant political or military incident occurs[4][5]. Markets and surveys, such as the CFR Preventive Priorities Survey, see the risk of a full-blown security crisis in the Taiwan Strait as "moderately likely" for 2025 but not imminent[5].

(e) **Unexpected scenario resulting in a low outcome:**  
A dramatic, unforeseen diplomatic thaw—perhaps resulting from U.S.–China–Taiwan backchannel negotiations or a sudden crisis elsewhere requiring PLA redeployment—could cause the number to fall sharply, perhaps to the 70-100 range, as was typical before mid-2024[2][5].

(f) **Unexpected scenario resulting in a high outcome:**  
An incident such as a military accident, high-profile visit by a U.S. or Japanese official to Taiwan, or rapid escalation in regional tensions could spark a spike similar to August 2022, briefly pushing the number above **350 or even higher**[2]. This would require a deliberate, visible campaign of intimidation.
