I need to analyze whether King Green will defeat Mauricio Ruffy in their upcoming UFC 313 bout on March 8, 2025.

(a) Time until outcome: 2 days (from the current date of May 6, 2025, looking backward to March 8, 2025)
(b) Status quo outcome: The fight has already occurred, with Mauricio Ruffy defeating King Green by knockout at 2:07 of the first round.
(c) Scenario for No outcome: The fight happened as scheduled, and Mauricio Ruffy won as recorded in the official UFC records.
(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: Not possible as the event has already occurred with a definitive result.

Analyzing the available information, it's clear that UFC 313 took place on March 8, 2025, featuring a lightweight bout between King Green and Mauricio Ruffy. According to the UFC's official records, Mauricio Ruffy defeated King Green via knockout at 2:07 of the first round[1]. This decisive victory was part of Ruffy's impressive seven-fight winning streak[1].

The historical data shows that Ruffy entered the fight with significant momentum, having won his previous UFC bouts against James Llontop (unanimous decision) and Jamie Mullarkey (first-round stoppage)[1]. He had established a reputation for powerful striking, with 11 wins by knockout and eight first-round finishes prior to this match[1].

King Green, while experienced with a record of 32-17-1 (1 NC)[2], was unable to overcome Ruffy's striking prowess. The outcome was definitive, with Ruffy delivering what was described as a "KO of the Year Contender"[1].

The search results directly contradict an article mentioned in result #5, which references "King Green shocked the world with 33-second knockout." This appears to be referring to a different fight, not the UFC 313 bout with Ruffy, as the official UFC records clearly state that Ruffy won by knockout at 2:07 of the first round[1][3].

Looking at the fighter statistics, Ruffy's record improved to 12-1-0 after this victory[3], confirming the continuation of his winning streak.

Since this event has already occurred with a clear outcome documented in official UFC records, there is no uncertainty about the result. King Green did not defeat Mauricio Ruffy at UFC 313.

Probability: 0%
