(a) Time left until the outcome is known: 26 days (from May 6, 2025 until April 1, 2025, when Metaculus will access the leaderboard)
(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: No, as the search results indicate DeepSeek-V3-0324 is currently at the top of the Chatbot Arena leaderboard with an Elo of 1372.
(c) Scenario for No outcome: Gemini models continue to trail behind DeepSeek, Qwen, or other competitors as these companies continue to release improved versions of their models that maintain performance advantages over Gemini.
(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: Google releases a new, significantly improved Gemini model before the end of Q1 2025 that surpasses the current leader DeepSeek-V3-0324 in performance, reclaiming the top spot on the leaderboard.

Based on the search results provided, I need to assess whether a Gemini model will be ranked #1 on the Chatbot Arena Leaderboard at the end of Q1 2025.

Looking at the current leaderboard data from the search results, DeepSeek-V3-0324 currently holds the top position with an Elo rating of 1372[1]. The Gemini-3 models are not in first place - Gemma-3-27B-it has an Elo of 1341 and Gemma-3-12B-it has an Elo of 1321[1]. These models are currently ranked 4th and 5th respectively on the leaderboard.

The leaderboard is dynamic and highly competitive. We can see from the search results that there's significant competition at the top, with DeepSeek-R1 at 1358 Elo and Qwen3-235B-A22B at 1342 Elo[1]. The difference between top models is relatively small, suggesting that rankings can change with incremental improvements.

The search results don't contain any specific information about scheduled releases from Google that would indicate a new Gemini model is coming before the end of Q1 2025. While the question background mentions that as of December 25, 2024, Gemini models were tied for first place, the more recent leaderboard information shows they have since been surpassed.

Without specific information about upcoming Gemini releases, I need to put significant weight on the status quo - which is that Gemini models are not currently at the top of the leaderboard. Given that Q1 2025 ends on March 31, 2025, and Metaculus will check the leaderboard on or after April 1, 2025, there isn't much time left for Google to release and establish a new top-ranking Gemini model.

I also note that the AI landscape is highly competitive, with companies like Alibaba (Qwen) and DeepSeek showing strong performance[2]. The search results mention that "Alibaba's Qwen2.5-Max has recently made significant strides, surpassing established models like DeepSeek's V3"[2], which suggests the leaderboard continues to be dynamic.

Given the current rankings showing Gemini models not in first place, the lack of information about imminent Gemini releases that would change this situation, and the short timeframe remaining until the end of Q1 2025, I assess that it's unlikely a Gemini model will be ranked #1 overall on the Chatbot Arena Leaderboard at the end of Q1 2025.

Probability: 25%
