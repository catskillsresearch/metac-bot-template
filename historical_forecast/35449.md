(a) Time left until the outcome is known: 7 days (from February 25, 2025 to March 4, 2025)

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: No - Trump does not mention "AOC" or "Pelosi" during his address to Congress.

(c) Scenario resulting in a No outcome: Trump focuses entirely on his "America First" agenda and legislative priorities for his second term, addressing issues like border security, energy policy, and tax reform without mentioning opposition figures as he seeks to project unity and forward momentum in the early days of his presidency.

(d) Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome: Trump deviates from his prepared remarks to criticize opposition to his agenda, specifically mentioning Nancy Pelosi or AOC as representatives of resistance to his policies, particularly if there have been recent public disagreements or criticisms from either figure in the days leading up to the speech.

Based on the available information, I need to forecast the probability that Donald Trump will mention "AOC" or "Pelosi" during his joint address to Congress on March 4, 2025. Here's my analysis:

First, it's important to note that the joint session has been formally scheduled. Speaker Mike Johnson invited President Trump to address a joint session of Congress on March 4, 2025[1][2][3][4]. While the White House had not formally accepted as of the last available information, Trump was expected to confirm his March 4 address[2].

The content of presidential addresses to Congress typically focuses on policy achievements, future legislative goals, and broad national themes. The invitation from Speaker Johnson specifically mentioned sharing Trump's "America First vision for our legislative future"[1][3]. The current political focus appears to be on the administration's legislative agenda including border security, energy and taxes[4].

In assessing whether Trump will mention "AOC" or "Pelosi," I need to consider several factors:

1. **Historical precedent**: Presidents sometimes reference opposition figures in major addresses, though typically this isn't common in initial addresses to Congress which tend to be more focused on setting an agenda rather than criticizing opponents.

2. **Current relevance**: As of February 2025, there's no indication that either Pelosi or AOC are central to ongoing legislative disputes or controversies that would make them natural targets in this address.

3. **Trump's rhetorical style**: Trump has previously been known to go off-script and reference political opponents, which increases the likelihood compared to other presidents.

4. **Political climate**: The invitation letter suggests a triumphant tone with phrases like "America's Golden Age has begun" and mentions of "patriotism, unity, and hope"[1][3], potentially indicating a forward-looking speech rather than one focused on past opponents.

5. **Status quo bias**: Most presidential addresses to Congress, especially early in an administration, focus on policy proposals rather than calling out specific opposition figures.

Given that this is Trump's first address to Congress in his second term, he's more likely to focus on setting his agenda and vision for the next four years. The Republican control of both House and Senate also reduces the need to directly confront Democratic opposition figures.

While Trump's unpredictable speaking style and willingness to deviate from prepared remarks increases the possibility he might mention these figures, the formal nature of a joint address to Congress, the apparent focus on his legislative agenda, and the early timing in his administration all suggest he's more likely to focus on his own vision rather than specific opponents.

Probability: 20%
