Based on the available data, I'll analyze whether US airline passenger volume for the Tuesday and Wednesday before Thanksgiving 2024 will be up year over year according to TSA.

(a) Time until outcome is known: Approximately three weeks. Thanksgiving 2024 falls on November 28, so the Tuesday and Wednesday before would be November 26 and 27, 2024. The TSA typically updates passenger volumes by 9 am the following day.

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: The combined passenger volume would remain at or below the 2023 level of 5,389,071 passengers (from November 21-22, 2023).

(c) Scenario resulting in a No outcome: An unexpected economic downturn, major airline operational issues, severe weather events across multiple regions, or a sudden public health concern could suppress travel demand. Additionally, if airlines haven't increased capacity sufficiently to handle higher demand, this could limit the total number of passengers.

(d) Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome: Continued strong travel demand, increased airline capacity, and the ongoing trend of record-breaking passenger volumes seen throughout 2024 would lead to exceeding last year's numbers. If the 7% year-over-year increase in passenger volume observed in the first half of 2024 continues through the holiday season, we would expect to exceed the 2023 numbers.

Looking at the evidence, several factors suggest passenger volumes will increase for Thanksgiving 2024:

First, TSA data shows a significant upward trend in 2024 passenger volumes. During the second quarter of 2024, TSA officers screened more than 236 million passengers, compared to 221 million in the second quarter of 2023, representing a nearly 7% increase[2]. This growth trend has continued throughout the year.

Second, TSA Administrator David Pekoske explicitly stated they "expect this summer to be our busiest ever" and noted that "the traveling public is on the move, which is a sign of a healthy economy."[2] This indicates continued strong travel demand that would likely extend into the holiday season.

Third, Denver International Airport (a major hub) is forecasting a 7.5% increase for the Thanksgiving holiday period (November 22 through December 2, 2024) compared to 2023[5]. If this forecast is representative of national trends, it strongly suggests higher passenger volumes nationally.

Fourth, TSA reported that during 2023, they had "already seen seven of the top 10 busiest travel days in TSA's history,"[3] and 2024 has continued to break records, suggesting the upward trajectory remains strong.

The strong year-over-year growth trend throughout 2024, specific forecasts for increased Thanksgiving travel, and statements from TSA officials all point to higher passenger volumes. While unexpected events could disrupt travel, the consistent pattern of increasing passenger numbers makes this less likely to affect the overall trend.

Probability: 85%
