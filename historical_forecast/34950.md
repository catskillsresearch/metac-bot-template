(a) **Time until outcome is known:**  
As of May 6, 2025, the official NOAA global temperature anomaly for February 2025 should have been published, but the outcome details are only available after the monthly report is released (typically by mid-March for February data)[1][3]. Currently, there’s a high likelihood the result is already public or imminent.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
The most recent trend shows:
- January 2025: 1.33°C above the 20th-century average, the warmest January on record[5].
- March 2025: 1.31°C anomaly[1].
- 2024 annual: 1.29°C, highest ever[2].
These figures suggest a “new normal” of global monthly anomalies between about 1.29°C and 1.34°C, despite La Niña beginning to develop in early 2025[5]. The exceptional warmth continues to defy historical cooling typically associated with La Niña. Thus, the most likely status quo outcome for February 2025 is an anomaly between 1.30°C and 1.40°C.

(c) **Scenario for an unexpected outcome:**  
An unexpected outcome would arise if:
- The developing La Niña rapidly intensified in February, causing a sharp, widespread global cooling.
- Unforeseen large-scale volcanic activity or aerosol injections produced a notable cooling effect.
- Major data revisions or corrections adjusted recent temperature anomalies downward.
Such a scenario could push the anomaly closer to or even below 1.20°C, which would be a significant deviation from the status quo.

## Rationale

Most recent months (late 2024 and early 2025) have consistently recorded anomalies in the 1.29–1.34°C range[1][2][5]. Although a developing La Niña usually cools global temperatures, recent expert analysis and January 2025 Copernicus commentary highlight that ocean heat and persistent climatic drivers continue to maintain record or near-record warmth, despite the onset of La Niña[5]. The March anomaly (1.31°C) suggests little immediate drop[1].

Good forecasting practice puts higher weight on the status quo—especially since global climate trends change slowly and persistent warmth has overridden weaker cyclical cooling for several years. However, climate variability and the unpredictability of La Niña effects call for some probability on lower anomalies, particularly in the 1.20–1.30°C range, and a small chance of even cooler values. A very high anomaly (≥1.40°C) seems unlikely given the slight drop from January to March, but not impossible if February was anomalously warm.

## Final probabilities

- '≤1.10': 1%
- '>1.10 and <1.20': 4%
- '≥1.20 and ≤1.30': 18%
- '>1.30 and <1.40': 68%
- '≥1.40': 9%
