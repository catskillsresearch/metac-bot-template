(a) **Time left until outcome known:**  
About 20 days remain until the final TSA numbers for December 25–31, 2024, are published and the outcome is known.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
In December 2023, TSA screened approximately 17.3 million passengers during December 25–31. The most recent growth trend for holiday travel in 2024 is around 6% year-over-year (YOY), as seen during Thanksgiving[3][4]. Projecting this growth rate forward to the same seven-day period in 2024 would result in an estimated passenger total just above 18 million.

(c) **Scenario that results in a No outcome:**  
If travel demand stagnates or declines, or if external shocks occur (such as severe winter storms, significant flight disruptions, or a sudden economic shock), the growth rate could fall short of the expected 6%, keeping the total below 18 million. Conversely, if travel demand exceeds expectations with growth far exceeding 6%, the period total could surpass 19 million, also resulting in a No outcome.

(d) **Scenario that results in a Yes outcome:**  
If the 6% YOY growth trend observed during Thanksgiving persists for the Christmas–New Year’s week, total TSA screenings will fall between 18 million and 19 million[3][4]. For reference, 17.3 million passengers in 2023 × 1.06 ≈ 18.3 million in 2024. This matches TSA’s projection of record highs and AAA’s forecast of a new air travel record for the broader holiday period[2][3].

## Rationale

Historical data shows the December 25–31, 2023, total was about 17.3 million. With 2024 trending toward a 6% YOY increase (confirmed by both TSA and independent analyses of Thanksgiving data), the base case is a holiday week total near 18.3 million[3][4].  

TSA has publicly projected record year-end volumes and a strong air travel market[3]. AAA also reports expectations of record-setting air travel during the holiday period[2]. There is no evidence as of December 13, 2024, of significant disruptive events that could sharply reduce demand below projections.

It remains possible that extraordinary circumstances (e.g., major weather events, security incidents) could impact the numbers meaningfully, or that demand further accelerates beyond projections, but neither is currently evident. Given most years see incremental changes rather than large, sudden shifts, the prudent forecaster assigns extra weight to the most likely outcome absent major new shocks.
