(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
Today is July 10, 2024. The outcome concerns July 30, 2024, at 12:00 CET—exactly 20 days from now.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
Prime Minister Gabriel Attal, from President Macron’s centrist alliance (Ensemble), currently leads a minority government[4]. If there were no changes and the government remained as is, the Prime Minister would not be from the New Popular Front, so the status quo outcome is **No**.

(c) **Brief No Scenario:**  
The presidential camp (Ensemble) or even the far-right National Rally secures enough seats or forms a coalition to dominate the new National Assembly, or there is no agreement between opposition blocs. President Macron, exercising his constitutional power, either re-appoints a centrist (possibly Gabriel Attal or another figure from his camp) or leaves the post vacant in case of political deadlock, resulting in no New Popular Front Prime Minister[1][2][4].

(d) **Brief Yes Scenario:**  
The New Popular Front wins a clear majority or is central to a coalition holding the balance of power after the second round. Macron, acknowledging parliamentary reality and to avoid immediate gridlock or a no-confidence crisis, appoints a Prime Minister from the New Popular Front, reflecting a “cohabitation” arrangement much like the one with Socialist Lionel Jospin in 1997[3]. In this case, the Prime Minister’s party would be officially recognized as part of the New Popular Front on July 30, 2024.

## Rationale

French political transitions typically do not move swiftly unless a clear majority emerges. The President holds the power to appoint the Prime Minister, but the choice must be compatible with the new parliamentary configuration to avoid a no-confidence vote[1][2][3]. In the past, when the parliamentary majority opposed the President, “cohabitation” occurred, leading to the appointment of a Prime Minister from the opposition majority[3]. However, the situation can remain unresolved if no bloc secures a majority or coalition negotiations stall.

Given the unprecedented number of three-way and even four-way runoffs, it is uncertain which bloc will emerge on top. The strategic withdrawals to block the far right increase the chances of some form of centrist-left cooperation but do not guarantee a clean New Popular Front majority. Even if the New Popular Front emerges as the largest group, Macron could delay appointing one of their own as Prime Minister, attempt to install a technocratic or compromise choice, or there could be protracted coalition talks.

Without fresh post-runoff numbers, the **status quo outcome** (No New Popular Front PM) is the most likely if the political environment remains indecisive, especially considering the President’s powers and traditions of negotiation and delay in French politics[1][2]. However, if the New Popular Front coalition manages to secure a workable majority and unites around a candidate, the likelihood of a Yes rapidly increases.
