(a) Time left until outcome is known: Approximately 56 days (from May 6, 2025 to January 1, 2025)

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: No announcement of IPO plans on Stripe's newsroom page by January 1, 2025, resulting in a "No" outcome

(c) Scenario for No outcome: Stripe continues to operate successfully as a private company, with the Collison brothers maintaining their preference for private control as suggested by recent statements. The company sees no urgent need for public funding as it remains profitable and well-capitalized.

(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: Market conditions improve significantly in late 2024, and Stripe decides to capitalize on favorable investor sentiment. The company formally announces IPO plans on its newsroom page before January 1, 2025, perhaps after completing internal preparations that began earlier in the year.

Based on the search results provided, I need to determine the probability that Stripe will announce plans for an IPO on its newsroom website before January 1, 2025. Let me analyze the available evidence systematically.

## Current Status and Indications

Stripe remains one of the most valuable private companies in the United States, with a reported valuation of $65 billion as of recent information[5]. The company has shown significant growth, with John Collison noting at an April 2024 event that the company has surpassed $1 trillion in processed payments for 2023[5]. This demonstrates continued business success without immediate need for public funding.

There is no indication in the provided search results that Stripe has made any formal announcement about IPO plans on its newsroom page. The most recent corporate announcement mentioned is from October 9, 2024, regarding "expanded interoperability, major upgrades to Stripe Billing, new partnerships with NVIDIA and Pepsi"[1]. This suggests the company is focused on product development and partnerships rather than preparing for an IPO announcement.

## Leadership Positioning

The Collison brothers appear to be deliberately maintaining Stripe's private status. According to search result [5], they are "keeping it private for long-term business strategy and to use it as a base for philanthropic goals." This strategic direction makes an imminent IPO announcement less likely.

At their April 2024 keynote presentation, neither Patrick nor John Collison made any references to IPO plans[3]. Instead, they focused on the company's technological developments, global payment capabilities, and AI integration, suggesting their attention is directed toward product innovation rather than public market preparation.

## Market Context

The search results indicate that 2025 (not 2024) is expected to see more IPO activity, with companies like Stripe "growing their valuations and waiting out market volatility"[4]. This suggests that market observers do not anticipate Stripe going public in 2024, which would make an announcement before January 1, 2025, less probable.

## Time Constraints

With only about 56 days remaining until the January 1, 2025 deadline (calculating from the current date provided), there is limited time for Stripe to prepare and announce an IPO. Such significant corporate decisions typically involve substantial preparation, including regulatory filings and investor roadshows, which would usually be preceded by preliminary announcements or hints.

## Status Quo Persistence

The status quo strongly favors a "No" outcome. Stripe has operated successfully as a private company for over a decade, and recent statements from leadership suggest no immediate plans to change this status. The company appears to have ample funding and profitability, removing any urgent need for public capital.

Taking all these factors into account, and giving substantial weight to the status quo as recommended for good forecasting, I see very little evidence pointing toward an IPO announcement in the next 56 days.

Probability: 15%
