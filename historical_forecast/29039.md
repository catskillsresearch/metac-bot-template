(a) **Time until outcome:**  
The Botswana general election will be held on October 30, 2024. From the reference date (2024-10-22), the outcome will be known in 8 days.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
The Botswana Democratic Party (BDP) wins at least 31 of the 61 elected seats, maintaining its uninterrupted rule since independence[1][2][3].

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
The opposition—primarily the Umbrella for Democratic Change (UDC), possibly joined by breakaways like the Botswana Congress Party (BCP) or Botswana Patriotic Front (BPF)—overcomes its fragmentation, effectively coordinates candidacies, and secures a combined majority of the 61 elected seats, unseating the BDP.

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
The BDP retains its established electoral machinery and core support while the opposition remains divided, causing anti-BDP votes to be split among several parties. The BDP capitalizes on the first-past-the-post system to win pluralities in enough constituencies, securing a majority of at least 31 seats[1][2][3].

## Rationale

Botswana’s history is one of extraordinary electoral continuity for the BDP. Since independence, the party has never failed to secure a parliamentary majority. The BDP experienced a dip in support in the 2014 election but rebounded to 52% of the popular vote in 2019[3]. Its domination has been magnified by the first-past-the-post voting system, which turns even moderate pluralities into secure majorities.

Heading into the 2024 election, this trend seems poised to continue, not due to a groundswell of BDP popularity, but primarily because of opposition fragmentation. The main challenger, the UDC, has lost two of its key components, the BCP (which won the most UDC seats in 2019) and the BPF, both of which now plan to contest independently[1][2]. This splintering ensures opposition votes are distributed across several parties, reducing the odds that any one opposition group can capture enough constituencies to surpass the BDP. This dynamic is confirmed by Fitch Solutions/BMI, which explicitly forecasts a BDP win based on the divided opposition and Botswana’s entrenched political stability[1][2].

While opinion polling from 2022 (Afrobarometer) suggested waning BDP support (just 22.3% of respondents), these figures are dated and may not reflect realities in the run-up to the vote. Furthermore, even at low levels of national support, first-past-the-post systems can yield seat majorities for a party if opposition votes are split efficiently. There is no credible public forecast or new polling suggesting a dramatic shift toward opposition unity or an anti-BDP majority.

The only plausible route to an upset would be for opposition parties to announce an alliance or strategic withdrawal of candidates in constituencies to maximize the anti-BDP vote. No such development is reported in the latest analysis, making it highly unlikely in the 8-day window before the election[1][2][3].

**Given the continuity of Botswana's political system, the proven advantages of the BDP under the current electoral system, and explicit forecasts by leading analysts, the status quo outcome of a BDP win remains strongly probable.**

Probability: 85%
