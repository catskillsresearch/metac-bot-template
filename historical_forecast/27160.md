(a) Time left until the outcome is known:  
There are about 1.5 months remaining until September 30, 2024.

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed:  
As of August 14, 2024, no diplomats have been expelled or recalled between the Philippines and China despite high tensions and public calls for expulsions[1][3][4]. If this stalemate continues, the question will resolve as No.

(c) Brief scenario resulting in a No outcome:  
Despite ongoing maritime confrontations and fiery rhetoric, both governments refrain from formally expelling or recalling diplomats to avoid a full diplomatic rupture, preferring instead to manage disputes through public condemnation, diplomatic protests, tightened visa restrictions, or even other forms of retaliation short of official expulsions or recalls.

(d) Brief scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:  
A further escalation—such as another major leak, a severe incident at sea involving casualties, or irrefutable evidence of illegal diplomatic activity—triggers public or political pressure that leads either the Philippines to officially expel Chinese diplomats or China to retaliate by expelling or recalling Philippine diplomats. An official announcement or credible report confirms the action before September 30, 2024.

## Rationale

- The deterioration in China-Philippines relations is significant, with public calls for expulsions from senior Philippine officials, particularly after the controversial leak and allegations of wiretapping by Chinese diplomats[1][3][4].
- However, as of mid-August 2024, no expulsion or recall has taken place, and there are signs of internal divisions within the Philippine government, with some officials still prioritizing diplomatic engagement[4].
- Historically, both sides have preferred to escalate tensions through public rhetoric, “gray zone” tactics at sea, and informal economic/cultural measures rather than outright expulsions or diplomatic recalls[4].
- The return to status quo (no expulsions or recalls) is common even amid severe tensions, barring a major new crisis.
- The window for action (six weeks) covers the height of typhoon season in the South China Sea, when military activity sometimes slows, but political maneuvering could continue.

Given that diplomatic expulsions or recalls are relatively rare, disruptive acts, and that top officials have publicly floated but not implemented them for several months, the most likely outcome remains No. However, the risk is non-negligible due to the highly volatile relationship, history of surprise escalations, and clear willingness to escalate verbally and politically[4].

## Final Answer

Probability: 30%  
(A diplomatic expulsion or recall between the Philippines and China before September 30, 2024 is possible, but the status quo—no such action—is still the more likely scenario.)
