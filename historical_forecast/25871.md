(a) Time until outcome: 9 days (from July 8, 2024 to July 17, 2024)

(b) Status quo outcome: Based on the most recent data from the search results, Nvidia is the world's 3rd most valuable company with a market cap of $2.770 trillion as of May 2025, which presumably means this data is incorrect and should refer to 2024. If the current rankings hold, Nvidia would not have a larger market cap than Apple on July 17, 2024.

(c) Scenario for No outcome: Nvidia experiences a market correction due to concerns about its valuation sustainability. Meanwhile, Apple announces positive product news or strong quarterly results, maintaining or increasing its market capitalization lead over Nvidia.

(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: Nvidia continues its rapid growth trajectory fueled by AI chip demand, while Apple faces challenges or market pressures. Given that Nvidia became the world's most valuable company on June 18, 2024, with a market cap of $3.34 trillion (surpassing both Microsoft and Apple), this trend could continue through July 17.

## Forecast Rationale

Looking at the available information, there are several key factors to consider when forecasting Nvidia's market capitalization relative to Apple's by July 17, 2024.

**Recent Trajectory**

The search results indicate that Nvidia has experienced extraordinary growth in its market capitalization over the past year. On June 18, 2024, Nvidia became the world's most valuable company with a market cap of $3.34 trillion, surpassing both Microsoft and Apple[5]. This suggests that as of mid-June 2024, Nvidia had already achieved a larger market cap than Apple.

This represents an incredible ascent for Nvidia. Looking back, we can see that in May 2023, Nvidia's market cap was around $750 billion[4]. By June 2023, it had reached $1 trillion, by March 2024 it surpassed $2 trillion, and by June 2024 it exceeded $3 trillion[4]. This represents one of the most remarkable stock market rallies in recent memory.

**Current Market Position**

There's some conflicting information in the search results about Nvidia's current position. While one source indicates Nvidia is the 3rd most valuable company with a market cap of $2.770 trillion "as of May 2025"[2] (which is clearly a future date error), another more recent source states that as of June 18, 2024, Nvidia had become the world's most valuable company with a $3.34 trillion market cap[5].

Given the chronology of the sources, I would place more weight on the June 18, 2024 data point, which indicates Nvidia had already surpassed Apple in market capitalization.

**Momentum Factors**

Several factors support continued strong performance for Nvidia:
- Dominance in AI chip market driving extraordinary demand
- Impressive Q1 financial results announced on May 22, 2024
- 10:1 stock split and increased dividend announced simultaneously[5]
- The ongoing AI boom creating sustained demand for Nvidia's products

**Status Quo Consideration**

While good forecasting typically places extra weight on the status quo, the status quo in this case appears to be that Nvidia has already surpassed Apple in market capitalization. The most recent data point from June 18, 2024, indicates Nvidia was the world's most valuable company[5].

For Nvidia to lose this position by July 17, there would need to be a significant market correction for Nvidia or a substantial rally for Apple. While market volatility is always possible, the momentum appears to be strongly in Nvidia's favor.

**Time Horizon**

With only 9 days between the current date (July 8, 2024) and the resolution date (July 17, 2024), there is limited time for major market shifts. The shorter the time horizon, the more weight should be placed on the current situation continuing, absent any specific catalysts for change.

**Uncertainties**

The main uncertainties include:
- Potential market correction if investors become concerned about Nvidia's valuation
- Macroeconomic factors affecting the broader market
- Company-specific news or earnings announcements
- Geopolitical events impacting the tech sector

Given that Nvidia appears to have already achieved a higher market cap than Apple as of June 18, 2024, and considering the strong momentum behind Nvidia's growth, I believe there is a high probability that Nvidia's market capitalization will be larger than Apple's on July 17, 2024.

Probability: 85%
