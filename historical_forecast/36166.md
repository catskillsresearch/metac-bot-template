Given the current date of May 6, 2025, I need to analyze whether Canada's petition to revoke Elon Musk's citizenship reached 1 million signatures before April 1, 2025. Since we're now past that deadline, I can provide a retrospective analysis.

Looking at the search results, I can see that Petition e-5353 was opened on February 20, 2025, with a closing date of June 20, 2025[1]. As of the most recent data available in the search results, the petition had gathered 376,994 validated signatures[1].

The petition showed significant growth in its early days:
- By February 26-27, 2025, it had garnered around 283,301 to 296,383 signatures[2][3]
- By the time of the most recent data in the search results, it had reached 376,994 signatures[1]

The petition was initiated in response to concerns about Elon Musk's actions that allegedly go against Canada's national interests, including his influence on Canadian elections and his role in a foreign government[1][3]. The petition received significant media attention, particularly after Musk reportedly posted (and later deleted) a comment stating "Canada is not a real country"[2].

Based on the signature growth pattern shown in the search results, the petition was gaining approximately:
- Around 13,000-15,000 signatures per day in the early period
- This rate appears to have slowed somewhat as time progressed

The petition needed to reach 1 million signatures by April 1, 2025, to satisfy the criteria. Given that it had 376,994 signatures and would have needed to gain an additional 623,006 signatures, the petition would have required a sustained daily growth rate of approximately 20,000-25,000 signatures from late February to April 1.

Based on the slowing growth rate evident in the data and the absence of any information indicating a sudden surge in signatures, it appears highly unlikely that the petition reached the 1 million threshold by April 1, 2025. The search results show no indication of the petition reaching this milestone, and given its trajectory, it would have been a significant departure from the observed pattern if it had succeeded.

Probability: 2%
