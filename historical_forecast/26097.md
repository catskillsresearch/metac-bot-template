(a) **Time until outcome is known:**  
There are 9 days left until the market close on Friday, July 19, 2024, which will serve as the effective closing value for "July 21, 2024," since July 21 is a Sunday and markets will not be open.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
As of July 3, 2024, the BSE SENSEX closed at 79,986.80—almost 80,000 and well above the 76,000–77,000 range[4]. Recent trends are bullish, with strong support from key market sectors, positive corporate earnings, continued foreign investment, and an absence of major negative policy or macroeconomic shocks[2][4]. If this momentum continues, the SENSEX will remain above 77,000 by July 19.

(c) **Scenario for a No outcome (SENSEX not between 76,000 and 77,000):**  
- The SENSEX closes above 77,000, which is most likely if current bullish trends persist and no major negative shocks occur in domestic or global markets.  
- The SENSEX falls sharply, below 76,000, due to an unforeseen event such as a geopolitical shock, major negative economic data, or sudden policy changes. This is less likely given present stability and absence of such indicators.

(d) **Scenario for a Yes outcome (SENSEX between 76,000 and 77,000):**  
- The SENSEX would need to decline by roughly 3,000–4,000 points (~4–5%) from its current levels in a short period, landing specifically in the narrow 76,000–77,000 band by market close on July 19.
- This could only occur with a sudden, significant market correction, perhaps due to a sharp reversal in foreign investor sentiment, a major global market selloff, or unexpected negative political or macroeconomic developments. As of July 12, 2024, there are no signs of such drivers.

## Rationale

Historical patterns and current sentiment indicate that status quo expectations should be weighted most heavily. The recent rally, supported by stable political outcomes, strong earnings, positive government policy signals, and robust FII inflows, suggests continued market strength[2][4]. 

A move into the 76,000–77,000 zone would require an unexpected reversal or significant correction, for which there is no visible catalyst as of now. While short-term volatility is always possible, such a decline over a span of less than two weeks is uncommon absent a major negative development.

**Probability: 3%**

It is highly unlikely, but not impossible, that the SENSEX will close between 76,000 and 77,000 on the last trading day before July 21, 2024. The overwhelming probability is that the closing value will remain above 77,000[2][4].
