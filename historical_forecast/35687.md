I'll analyze this forecasting question about the JFK Library's operational status on March 31, 2025.

(a) Time left until outcome: The outcome will be known in about 26 days (from today, May 6, 2025).

(b) Status quo outcome: Based on the current information, the JFK Library is open. It reopened on February 19, 2025, following a brief closure due to federal layoffs.

(c) Scenario for No outcome: The library could close again if there are additional federal staffing cuts, budget issues, facility problems, or another executive order affecting National Archives facilities. An unforeseen emergency or maintenance issue could also force a temporary closure.

(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: The library continues its normal operations as it has since reopening in February. No new federal directives disrupt operations, and the library maintains its standard 7-day weekly schedule.

## Current Operational Status

The John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum experienced a brief closure on February 18, 2025, after five federal employees were suddenly terminated as part of the Trump administration's directive to cut probationary employees nationwide[2]. However, the library promptly reopened the following day on February 19, 2025[1][2]. According to the most recent information, the library has remained open since then.

The museum's standard operating hours are 7 days a week from 10:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., with last admissions at 3:30 p.m[3]. This suggests that under normal circumstances, the library would be open on March 31, 2025, which is a Monday.

## Factors Supporting Continued Operations

Several factors suggest the library will remain open:

1. **Quick Recovery from Previous Closure**: The library demonstrated resilience by reopening just one day after the February staff cuts[2]. Management implemented adaptive measures, including temporarily waiving admission fees until staff could be cross-trained on the ticketing system.

2. **Current Operating Status**: As of early March 2025, the JFK Library was confirmed to be back open, according to reporting dated March 7, 2025[5]. There have been no subsequent reports of closure.

3. **Standard Operating Schedule**: The library maintains a consistent 7-day operating schedule[3], suggesting that Monday, March 31, 2025, would be a regular operating day.

## Risk Factors for Potential Closure

Despite the current open status, some risk factors could lead to closure:

1. **Vulnerability to Federal Directives**: As a facility managed by the National Archives, the library remains susceptible to federal staffing decisions and executive orders[2]. The February closure demonstrated how quickly operations can be disrupted.

2. **Staffing Challenges**: The library was forced to operate with free admission after the February layoffs due to staffing shortages at the ticket counter[2]. Any further reduction in staffing could potentially impact operations.

3. **Seasonal Closures**: The library has announced closures for weather events in the past, as evidenced by the closure on February 16 due to a winter storm[4]. However, weather-related closures are less likely by late March.

## Status Quo Bias Analysis

Applying status quo bias to this forecast is appropriate. The JFK Library reopened in February 2025 and has maintained operations since then. There are no announced plans for closure on March 31, 2025, and the most recent evidence indicates normal operations. While the previous closure demonstrates vulnerability to federal decisions, the quick reopening suggests a strong institutional commitment to maintaining public access.

Considering the library's demonstrated pattern of operation, the absence of any announced closures for March 31, and the time elapsed since the February disruption, the status quo of continued operations is the most likely outcome.

Probability: 85%
