(a) Time left until outcome: 62 days (from May 6, 2025 to March 31, 2025 - this is not possible since March 31, 2025 has already passed)

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: Russian forces control part of Chasiv Yar but not the entire town. Based on the most recent information available, Russia has made advances in the area but doesn't fully control the strategic town.

(c) Scenario resulting in a No outcome: Ukrainian forces successfully hold their defensive positions along the canal in eastern Chasiv Yar, preventing further Russian advances. Ukraine receives sufficient Western military aid to strengthen its defenses and potentially launch limited counteroffensives to push Russian forces back from their current positions.

(d) Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome: Russia continues its incremental advances using small assault groups, eventually capturing the brick factory and other key positions. The tactic of using small, dispersed assault groups proves effective against Ukrainian defenses, and Russia secures full control of the town by the end of March 2025.

Looking at the data available to me, I need to assess whether Russia will control the specific coordinates (48°35'13.7"N 37°50'02.1"E) in Chasiv Yar by March 31, 2025.

According to the search results, as of January 2025, the situation in Chasiv Yar shows Russian forces making steady advances but not yet in full control of the town. Russian forces were conducting offensive operations in the Chasiv Yar direction in January 2025, though they did not make any confirmed advances at that time[4]. 

As of January 22, 2025, Ukraine still controlled a former brick factory in Chasiv Yar, although Russian troops were "moving in the direction of the factory"[1]. Russian forces were using "small assault groups of three to eight people," which a Ukrainian military spokesman described as an "effective" tactic because "dispersed small assault groups are harder to deal with"[1].

The search results indicate that approximately 229 civilians remained in Chasiv Yar as of January 22, 2025, primarily elderly people and those with disabilities[1]. Before Russia's full-scale invasion, Chasiv Yar had a population of about 12,000 people, showing the significant depopulation of the area due to the conflict[1].

Earlier information from 2024 suggests that Russian forces had controlled approximately 8% of Chasiv Yar according to the DeepState monitoring website, though there was some confusion about the exact percentage[2]. The front line at that time ran along the canal that divides the city from its eastern neighborhood[2].

The strategic importance of Chasiv Yar is clear - it would be a "major prize for Russia's military because it lies near the larger towns of Kostyantynivka and Kramatorsk, which are also important bases for the Ukrainian military"[1]. This strategic value suggests Russia will continue to prioritize capturing this location.

Given the incremental but persistent Russian advances seen in early 2025, the effective small-group tactics they were employing, and the strategic importance of Chasiv Yar, there is a significant probability that Russia would control the specified coordinates by March 31, 2025. However, Ukrainian forces were still actively defending key positions, and the pace of Russian advances was not rapid.

Considering the status quo and putting extra weight on it (as conditions often change more slowly than expected), while also accounting for the momentum of Russian advances and their tactical approach, I assess:

Probability: 65%
