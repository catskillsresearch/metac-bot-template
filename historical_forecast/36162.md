(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
As of March 18, 2025, there are 12 days until March 30, 2025.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
The most recent concrete reading before the forecast period is from April 12, 2025, which shows Great Lakes ice coverage at 2.93%[2]. However, since this is after March 30, we need to rely on earlier March data: as of March 3, total ice cover was already declining from mid-winter highs[4]. Ice cover typically decreases rapidly throughout March. If we assume nothing changed from the April 12 figure, the outcome would be 2.93%[2].

(c) **Outcome if the current trend continued:**  
Great Lakes ice cover typically peaks in February or early March and then declines sharply through March. This season has been particularly mild, with historic lows and rapid ice loss already observed by March 3, 2025[3][4]. With mild temperatures and accelerated melt, we can expect ice cover to fall further or remain at very low single-digit levels by March 30, 2025. A reasonable extrapolation from existing data suggests ice coverage could be between 1% and 4%.

(d) **Expectations of experts and markets:**  
NOAA GLERL and the U.S. National Ice Center forecast a mild winter and below-normal ice cover for 2025, especially due to dominating warm climate patterns (AMO and PDO)[3]. Ice cover has already been described as "some of the lowest on record," and experts anticipated the season would not see significant new formation in late March[2][3].

(e) **Brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome:**  
A sudden, sustained warm spell with above-average temperatures, high winds, and rain in late March could rapidly destroy any remaining ice across the Great Lakes, driving ice cover down close to zero by March 30.

(f) **Brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome:**  
A late-season cold snap, with an extended period of sub-freezing temperatures across the region and little wind, could allow for temporary refreezing, especially in nearshore and shallow areas. This could boost ice cover higher than expected, potentially pushing it above 8%â€“10%, but such events are historically rare in late March, especially after a very mild winter.
