(a) **Time until outcome known:**  
There are 3 days left until January 30, 2025.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
As of January 21–22, 2025, Chasiv Yar is contested. Russian forces have advanced into central parts of the city, but Ukrainian troops still hold key positions such as a former brick factory. The area at the provided coordinates (48°35'13.7"N 37°50'02.1"E) is not unambiguously under Russian control[1].

(c) **Scenario for a No outcome:**  
The frontline remains mostly static. Ukrainian forces continue to hold out in western and central Chasiv Yar, including the area around the brick factory and possibly near the map’s coordinates. Ongoing Russian assaults do not achieve a decisive breakthrough by January 30, so the ISW map still shows the coordinates as contested or Ukrainian-held.

(d) **Scenario for a Yes outcome:**  
Russian forces capitalize on their current momentum, leveraging effective small-group tactics and heavier troop presence. They manage to overrun remaining Ukrainian positions in central Chasiv Yar before January 30, with the key coordinates falling clearly into Russian-controlled marking on the ISW map.

## Rationale

The most recent reports confirm that Russian forces have made significant advances in central Chasiv Yar and have been making use of effective small assault group tactics, gaining ground and disrupting Ukrainian defensive routines[1]. However, as of January 22, Ukrainians still control vital positions, including the brick factory, with Russians "moving in the direction of the factory"[1]. There is no definitive evidence yet that the coordinates in question are under full Russian control.

Russian momentum is notable, and there is evidence of a substantial commitment of Russian forces and ongoing pressure[1]. However, Ukrainian defenders remain present in key areas, and Russian advances, while significant, have not yet resulted in a complete breakthrough.

With only a few days remaining until the resolution date, it is difficult for either side to achieve a fundamental shift in control barring an abrupt collapse or breakthrough. Given the historical tendency for frontlines in urban environments like Chasiv Yar to change slowly and the lack of reporting of a major breakthrough as of January 22, the status quo—positions remaining contested—remains the most probable outcome.

## Forecast

While a sudden Russian breakthrough cannot be ruled out, the base rate for rapid, total changes in control within heavily contested urban areas in the Donbas is low without clear evidence of collapse on one side. The situation is fluid but, as of now, favors a modestly higher likelihood that the coordinates will not be marked as Russian-controlled on the ISW map by January 30.

**Probability: 65% (No)**  
**Probability that Russia will NOT have control of Chasiv Yar at the specified coordinates on January 30, 2025: 65%**[1][4].
