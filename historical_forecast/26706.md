(a) Time left until outcome: From today (May 6, 2025) to October 1, 2024 - This question's outcome is already known as October 1, 2024 has passed. The question asked about a prediction before October 1, 2024, and we are now in May 2025.

(b) Status quo outcome: The status quo would be "No" - no announcement of an IPO on Stripe's news section before October 1, 2024.

(c) Scenario resulting in No outcome: Stripe continues to operate as a private company, providing liquidity to employees through tender offers rather than an IPO, as they did in March 2023 when they raised $6.5 billion at a $50 billion valuation specifically to provide liquidity to current and former employees[5].

(d) Scenario resulting in Yes outcome: Stripe could have decided to announce an IPO before October 1, 2024, possibly due to favorable market conditions or strategic business decisions, posting the announcement on their news section.

Based on the available search results, I can provide the following assessment:

The search results do not show any indication that Stripe announced plans for an IPO on the news section of its website before October 1, 2024. The most recent news mentioned in the search results is from October 9, 2024, regarding "expanded interoperability, major upgrades to Stripe Billing, new partnerships with NVIDIA and Pepsi"[1], but there is no mention of an IPO announcement.

Looking at Stripe's history, the company has demonstrated a pattern of remaining private. In March 2023, Stripe raised over $6.5 billion specifically to provide liquidity to current and former employees and address employee withholding tax obligations related to equity awards[5]. At that time, John Collison, co-founder and president of Stripe, stated, "For us, it's now back to work," suggesting a focus on continuing operations rather than preparing for an IPO[5].

Furthermore, according to search result [4] from April
 2024, Stripe was described as staying private for long-term business strategy. The article characterizes Stripe as "one of the world's most valuable software unicorns" whose "founders are keeping it private for long-term business strategy"[4].

The search results indicate that Stripe has been able to operate successfully as a private company, processing over $1 trillion in payments in 2023[4] and having "One hundred businesses now handle more than $1 billion on Stripe every year"[5].

Given the company's history of providing liquidity to employees through means other than an IPO, the explicit statements about staying private for strategic reasons, and the absence of any IPO announcement in the search results, it appears that Stripe did not announce plans for an IPO on its website before October 1, 2024.

Probability: 0%
