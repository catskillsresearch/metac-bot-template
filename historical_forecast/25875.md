(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
Approximately 23 days remain until 00:00 Eastern on July 31, 2024, when this question will resolve.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changes:**  
Joe Biden has firmly and repeatedly stated he will remain in the race and accept the Democratic nomination. His latest letter, dated July 8, 2024, is an unequivocal declaration of his intent to stay in the race[1]. If current trends and statements hold, the status quo outcome is that Biden will not announce a withdrawal.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
Biden continues to reiterate his commitment to the race and does not issue any public, official, and definitive statement before July 31, 2024, indicating he will not accept the nomination.

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
Biden or his campaign issues an unambiguous and conclusive public announcement before July 31, 2024, stating he will not seek and will not accept the Democratic nomination for president. This would likely be triggered by a new and severe political or health crisis, a dramatic shift in party leadership stance, or overwhelming loss of confidence from Democratic voters and donors. Such a scenario would need to overcome major procedural and political barriers given Biden's dominance in the primaries and the party's nomination rules[1][3].

## Rationale

Historically, the status quo in U.S. presidential campaigns—particularly incumbent presidents seeking reelection—is very stable. Major-party nominees almost never withdraw after securing the vast majority of delegates and beginning the formal nomination process. In Biden’s case, he has over 14 million votes and nearly 3,900 delegates (87% of the total), and the DNC’s rules make it nearly impossible to change nominees unless the candidate themselves withdraws[1][3].

Crucially, Biden’s July 8 letter is a forceful and public rejection of calls that he step aside, emphasizing both principle ("the voters alone decide the nominee") and personal resolve ("I feel a deep obligation to the faith and the trust the voters... have placed in me to run this year")[1]. This is his strongest and latest public statement, and there are no credible reports indicating a change is imminent.

While party pressure has increased since the June 27 debate, there is no indication from Biden or his campaign that he is reconsidering his position. His campaign and White House spokespeople continue to publicly dismiss any suggestion of withdrawal[3]. Procedurally, unless Biden voluntarily steps aside, there is no formal mechanism for party leaders, delegates, or donors to force his replacement before the convention.

Extraordinary, late-stage withdrawals are exceedingly rare in U.S. political history. For such a dramatic change to occur in the next three weeks, there would likely need to be a new and extraordinary event—far beyond current dissatisfaction or media pressure.

## Final Probability Estimate

Weighing the status quo heavily, as is best forecasting practice, and accounting for the lack of any credible signal from Biden or his campaign that a reversal is under consideration—and given the immense procedural and political barriers to change—this scenario points to a very high probability that Biden will *not* announce he will decline the nomination before July 31, 2024.

**Probability: 7%**
