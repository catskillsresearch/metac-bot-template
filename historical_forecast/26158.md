(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
The outcome will be determined using retrospective Kp data from July 17 through July 28, 2024. Today is July 15, 2024, so the period of interest starts in 2 days and ends in 13 days. The official result will be available shortly after July 28, likely within a day or two as the Kp history is published.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
In the absence of new major flares or CMEs from Earth-facing active regions, the Kp index would most likely remain below storm levels (Kp ≤4), with occasional short-lived upticks possibly reaching 5 if minor disturbances occur. Statistically, true Kp values sitting narrowly in the (>4, ≤5) range for the strongest storm in a two-week period is not common, especially in the absence of major predicted events.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
If there are no significant Earth-directed CMEs or strong solar flares from July 17–28, 2024, or if any geomagnetic activity during this window is subdued (Kp readings at or below 4), or if the strongest event exceeds Kp 5 (for example, a repeat of May’s extreme storms), the answer would be No. This would also occur if, by chance, Kp skips the (>4, ≤5) range entirely—staying either at or below 4, or jumping above 5 for its maximum.

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
If during July 17–28, 2024, there is one or more moderate geomagnetic disturbances—likely due to a weak to moderate CME or high-speed solar wind stream—that pushes the Kp index above 4, but not above 5 (e.g., registering exactly 4.33̅, 4.66̅, 5.00), and no higher Kp is recorded, the outcome is Yes. Importantly, the maximum Kp in this period must not exceed 5.

## Rationale

- AR3697 (previously AR3664) demonstrated a capacity for extremely strong activity in May 2024, causing “the strongest geomagnetic storm since 2003,” with Kp well above 5[1][2][5]. However, its subsequent returns in June and July showed less frequent and generally less intense activity, as indicated by lower sunspot complexity and primarily C-class flares observed in late June[3].
- The sun rotates roughly every 27 days, so AR3697 or its remnants are again approaching a central Earth-facing position for the July 17–28 window, theoretically permitting renewed solar activity. However, after multiple solar rotations, active regions often decay or lose complexity, reducing the probability of large CMEs or X/M-class flares.
- Current observations from early to mid-July indicate the dominant sunspot regions have “simple magnetic complexity” and have been producing only C-class (low) flares, with solar activity labeled as “low”[3]. There are no signals of imminent, intense geomagnetic disturbances.
- Forecasts and models have limited skill more than a few days ahead; there are no specific NOAA or global alerts for storms in the (>4, ≤5) Kp range for July 17–28 as of July 15[1]. Most significant events are predicted within 1–3 days of their occurrence.
- Statistically, minor geomagnetic storms (Kp 5) do occur with some frequency near solar maximum, but the most common outcome in a random two-week interval—even near solar max—is for the Kp to reach 4 or 5 briefly, with no guarantee the peak will stay in the (>4, ≤5) band.

## Weighting the Status Quo

Experienced forecasters favor the status quo—the most likely scenario given no major changes—especially in the absence of clear triggers for major space weather. Although the presence of AR3697 increases the background probability of activity, there is no concrete sign as of July 15 that a “moderate” (Kp just above 4 but not exceeding 5) event is imminent.

## Final Assessment

- There is a modest chance (minor high-speed stream, weak CME) that could push Kp into the target range for a short period.
- Given recent low solar activity, no major forecasted events, and the historical rarity of “just Kp 5” storms when active regions are not strongly flaring, the most likely outcome is either no storm (Kp ≤4), or, less likely, a storm exceeding Kp 5 if a strong solar event occurs.
