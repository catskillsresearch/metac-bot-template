(a) **Time Until Outcome is Known**  
As of the background date (September 13, 2024), there are 8 days until the September 21, 2024 Edo State gubernatorial election. Official results are usually announced within several days after voting concludes, so the outcome should be known by late September or, at the latest, by October 1, 2024.

(b) **Status Quo Outcome if Nothing Changed**  
The status quo outcome is that Kennedy Iyere does **not** win the governorship. Historically, Edo State's governorship is consistently won by one of the two major parties: the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) or the All Progressives Congress (APC). The Accord Party has no seats in Nigeria’s National Assembly and has not demonstrated significant electoral strength in Edo or nationally. There is no credible evidence of a sudden, large-scale shift in political support or a breakdown in the established party system in the state[2][3][4][5].

(c) **Scenario for a No Outcome**  
Iyere runs as the Accord Party candidate, but the PDP and APC deploy their superior organizational resources, voter mobilization networks, and traditional support bases. As a result, the election becomes a contest between the two major parties, with Iyere and Accord receiving only a small fraction of the vote, in line with past performance for third-party candidates in Edo State.

(d) **Scenario for a Yes Outcome**  
Iyere successfully engineers a dramatic realignment in Edo politics, perhaps by forming an effective coalition, attracting broad-based endorsements, or capitalizing on an unforeseen scandal or collapse within both the PDP and APC. This scenario would require an unprecedented surge in support, culminating in an Accord victory confirmed by INEC and reported by major media outlets. As of now, there is no evidence such a movement or coalition has materialized or is gaining the momentum necessary for victory[5].

## Rationale

Historical precedent in Edo State—and throughout most of Nigeria—shows a near-total dominance of gubernatorial contests by the PDP and APC. Third-party candidates, especially those from parties with no national legislative presence and limited infrastructure, have not won such contests. While Kennedy Iyere is officially recognized as Accord’s candidate and has publicly expressed confidence, there is no reliable polling, no major endorsements, and no signs of the political upheaval required for a third-party candidate to break through[4][5].

Given the power of inertia in Nigerian subnational politics, the status quo outcome carries significant weight. Absent dramatic and independently verifiable changes in the electoral environment, it is overwhelmingly likely that the next governor will come from either PDP or APC, not Accord. Iyere remains a long-shot candidate unless new, game-changing developments emerge prior to the vote.

**Probability: 1%**
