(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known: Approximately 54 days (from May 6, 2025, to April 1, 2025 - which has already passed)

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed: No visit occurred before April 1, 2025

(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome: President Trump prioritized domestic issues and implementation of immigration agreements remotely, without needing to personally visit El Salvador before April 1.

(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome: The deepening alliance with El Salvador and the significant immigration agreements prompted President Trump to make a diplomatic visit to El Salvador to cement the relationship and showcase the partnership before April 1.

Based on the search results and the current date (May 6, 2025), I need to determine whether President Trump visited El Salvador between February 12, 2025 (when this question was posed) and April 1, 2025 (the resolution deadline).

The diplomatic relationship between the Trump administration and El Salvador was clearly strengthening in early 2025. President Trump held a call with President Bukele on January 23, 2025, discussing cooperation on immigration and transnational gangs[2]. By February 4, 2025, they had announced a significant deal allowing the U.S. to send migrants and prisoners to El Salvador[1].

Secretary of State Marco Rubio visited El Salvador in early February 2025, praising Bukele as "an incredible friend" during his visit[3]. This high-level diplomatic engagement showed the importance of the relationship, but does not indicate a presidential visit occurred.

The search results also mention the administration developing a "Safe Third Country" agreement with El Salvador, which would allow deportation of non-Salvadoran migrants to El Salvador[4]. This reflected a major policy priority for the Trump administration.

There were personal connections as well, with Donald Trump Jr., Tucker Carlson, and Matt Gaetz reportedly attending Bukele's second inauguration[3], suggesting established relationships between Trump's circle and the Salvadoran government.

However, none of the search results contain any information about President Trump actually visiting El Salvador between February and April 2025. Given that we're now past the resolution date (May 6, 2025), if such a visit had occurred, it would likely have been widely reported and included in the search results.

The status quo is powerful in forecasting. While there was certainly diplomatic momentum that could have led to a visit, without specific evidence that a visit occurred, I must conclude it did not happen. The search results provide detailed information about diplomatic relations but no mention of an actual visit by President Trump.

Probability: 1%
