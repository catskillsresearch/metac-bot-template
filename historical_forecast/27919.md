(a) Time left until outcome: 26 days (from today, September 4, 2024, until October 1, 2024)

(b) Status quo outcome: Edmundo González remains in hiding, evading arrest despite the warrant issued against him.

(c) No outcome scenario: González successfully remains in hiding with support from opposition networks. The Maduro government fails to locate him due to international pressure and potential U.S. sanctions targeting officials involved in his arrest. González may also secure protection at a foreign embassy or secretly leave the country.

(d) Yes outcome scenario: Venezuelan security forces locate González's hiding place and execute the arrest warrant. The Maduro regime, feeling threatened by González's continued challenge to electoral legitimacy, prioritizes his capture despite international criticism. He is placed under house arrest given his age of 75.

Based on the available information, I need to assess the probability that Edmundo González will be deprived of liberty before October 1, 2024. Let me analyze the key factors influencing this outcome.

The Venezuelan Prosecutor's Office has issued an arrest warrant for González, accusing him of five crimes related to the publication of voting records that challenge Maduro's electoral victory[2]. This warrant was signed on Monday (September 2, 2024) and has been sent to a court specializing in terrorism charges[2]. The legal machinery for his arrest is now in place.

González has already failed to respond to three summonses to testify about the opposition website that published detailed election results[3]. The government clearly views his actions as a serious threat to Maduro's authority, with officials accusing the opposition of stoking violence[3]. This suggests a strong motivation to apprehend him.

However, several factors reduce the likelihood of González being arrested:

1. He is currently in hiding, making his capture logistically challenging.

2. According to reports, González is not seeking asylum despite the arrest risk, according to his lawyer[1]. This suggests he may have effective security measures or protection in place.

3. The international community is watching this situation closely. The U.S. has drafted potential sanctions against about 60 Venezuelan government officials and family members[3], which could deter aggressive action against González.

4. María Corina Machado, another opposition figurehead, has indicated that threatening the "president-elect" will only increase support for González both domestically and internationally[2], potentially raising the political cost of arresting him.

The Maduro regime has demonstrated its willingness to use force against opposition, with at least 27 deaths reported in protests since the disputed election[3]. However, arresting a 75-year-old presidential candidate who many believe legitimately won the election would likely trigger significant international backlash.

Given the status quo bias (González is currently free), the short timeframe (26 days), the logistical challenges of finding someone in hiding, and the potential international consequences of his arrest, I assess that while the risk is substantial, it's more likely than not that González will remain at liberty until October 1.

Probability: 40%
