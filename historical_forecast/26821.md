(a) **Time Left Until Outcome is Known**  
There are approximately two months until October 1, 2024â€”the resolution date for whether a live debate between the Republican and Democratic vice presidential nominees will occur.

(b) **Status Quo Outcome if Nothing Changed**  
As of now, a vice presidential debate is officially scheduled for September 25, 2024, at Lafayette College by the Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD)[1][2][3][5]. If nothing changes and both parties' nominees attend, the outcome would be "Yes." However, actual participation is always subject to late withdrawal or strategic decisions.

(c) **Scenario Resulting in a No Outcome**  
No formal debate between the Republican and Democratic vice presidential nominees takes place before October 1, 2024, if:
- One or both campaigns decline participation, withdraw, or otherwise boycott the CPD-sanctioned debate.
- Last-minute disruptions (e.g., political developments, campaign strategies, health issues, or security concerns) cause the event to be canceled or proceed without both major party nominees present.

(d) **Scenario Resulting in a Yes Outcome**  
A formal, live debate between the Republican and Democratic vice presidential nominees is held before October 1, 2024, if:
- Both JD Vance (the Republican nominee) and the yet-to-be-named Democratic nominee participate in the CPD-sanctioned debate at Lafayette College on September 25, 2024[1][3][5].
- Alternatively, if another structured, live, moderated debate is arranged and both major-party VP nominees participate before the deadline.

## Rationale

The scheduled CPD vice presidential debate on September 25, 2024, at Lafayette College is the single official VP debate currently on the calendar before October 1, 2024[1][2][3][5]. This means the **status quo** heavily favors a "Yes" outcome. However, recent cycles have seen major candidates decline CPD debates, and party decisions or campaign strategy could still intervene.

No alternative officially scheduled debates are currently confirmed to occur before October 1 apart from the CPD event[5]. The uncertainty is compounded because the Democratic nominee has yet to be named, and post-Biden developments may affect strategy and debate commitments.

Nonetheless, barring an unforeseen boycott or withdrawal by one or both parties, precedent and current scheduling suggest both major-party nominees are very likely to appear for this highly anticipated, national event.

**Probability: 85%**
