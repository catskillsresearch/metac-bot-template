(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  
As of December 3, 2024, there are 24 days until December 27, 2024, when the FiveThirtyEight net favorability rating for Trump will be evaluated.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
Trump's net favorability rating as of November 21, 2024, is -6, which is his highest score in four years. Recent data suggests this is a high-water mark, bolstered by a post-election “honeymoon” effect and an increase in his favorability to 54% as of late November. If the current trend holds or even plateaus, the net favorability would remain at or above -6.

(c) **Scenario for a No outcome (net favorability ≥ -6):**  
A No outcome occurs if Trump’s net favorability remains at -6 or improves. This could happen if the post-election boost persists, Trump’s cabinet appointments are received positively, and there are no major scandals or negative news cycles before year-end. The holiday period, which tends to dampen news impact and freeze public opinion, could further help sustain the elevated rating.

(d) **Scenario for a Yes outcome (net favorability < -6):**  
A Yes outcome requires Trump’s net favorability to drop below -6. Such a decline could result from a significant negative event—such as controversial cabinet choices, unexpected transition blunders, damaging news cycles, legal developments, or unpopular policy signals. Additionally, as the “honeymoon” effect wanes, there could be a natural reversion to Trump’s historically lower favorability baseline.

## Rationale

The status quo is that Trump’s net favorability is at -6 after a post-election upward surge, marking a four-year high. Historically, public opinion during transition periods tends to stabilize or improve for president-elects, unless interrupted by major negative developments. Trump's profile is polarizing, but recent trends suggest that, absent a significant scandal or misstep, his favorability is likely to remain stable or perhaps even improve slightly through the end of December.

Given the short time horizon (less than a month), the inertia of public opinion—especially during a typically slow holiday news period—makes a sharp decline less likely unless prompted by a significant event. Therefore, as a forecaster, extra weight must be assigned to the status quo, especially as abrupt drops in net favorability are rare outside of major political shocks[5]. Small day-to-day fluctuations are possible, but a move below -6 would likely require a clear, negative catalyst.

**Probability: 30%**

This reflects a moderate but less likely chance that Trump's net favorability will drop below -6 by December 27, 2024. The status quo and recent positive trend weigh against a substantial negative move in the absence of a significant, unforeseen event.
