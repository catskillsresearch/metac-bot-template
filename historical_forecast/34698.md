(a) Time until outcome known:  
About 8 weeks remain until April 1, 2025.  

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed:  
The most recent UNHCR reports show approximately 815,000 registered Syrian refugees in Lebanon[4][5]. If the situation remains unchanged, this figure would remain at 815,000.

(c) Outcome if current trend continued:  
Since Lebanon halted new registrations in 2015, the number of registered refugees has remained very stable, only slowly declining due to voluntary returns or departures. UNHCR and Lebanese government figures have pointed to a registered refugee population of around 815,000 for multiple years, and UNHCR’s multi-year plan references over 818,000 total registered refugees of all nationalities in Lebanon, with the Syrian share at roughly 815,000[4][5]. Unless there is a policy change or mass deregistration, the figure is likely to remain between 810,000 and 818,000 by April 1, 2025, with a slow drift downward due to verified departures.

(d) Expectations of experts and markets:  
Experts expect little change barring a dramatic policy shift. UNHCR’s own documents anticipate a steady figure for registered Syrians, as new registrations are still frozen and the only reductions come from departures, which have not accelerated at a rate to create sharp declines[4][5]. Market commentators and humanitarian analysts view the figure as stable and “effectively frozen.”

(e) Unexpected scenario resulting in a low outcome:  
A sudden acceleration in forced returns, mass deregistration, or a government crackdown could rapidly reduce the registered figure—potentially dropping it below 800,000 if thousands were removed from UNHCR’s rolls within a matter of weeks. Such a scenario could occur if geopolitical tensions spike or Lebanon forcibly expels a significant number of refugees.

(f) Unexpected scenario resulting in a high outcome:  
A reversal of Lebanon’s 2015 policy, allowing new registrations or re-registration of previously unregistered Syrians, could spike the official UNHCR number. For example, if political deals or international pressure prompt Lebanon to regularize more refugees, the count could jump well above 820,000.
