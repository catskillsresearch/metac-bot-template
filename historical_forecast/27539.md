(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
As of August 22, 2024, there are approximately 40 days remaining until October 1, 2024.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
No non-test nuclear weapon has detonated outside of a controlled test environment since the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945. Despite numerous close calls, accidents, and moments of heightened international tension, robust safeguards and international norms have prevented any such detonation for nearly 80 years[2][5]. If current trends and policies continue without significant disruption, the status quo would yield a "No" outcome.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
Major nuclear-armed states continue established policies of deterrence, and no actor—state or non-state—initiates the deliberate use, accidental launch, or unauthorized detonation of a nuclear weapon. Safety protocols, command-and-control systems, and international monitoring continue to function as intended, preventing both accidental and intentional non-test detonations. No terrorist group succeeds in acquiring or detonating a nuclear device. As a result, no nuclear weapon is detonated outside of testing by October 1, 2024[1][2][5].

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
A non-test nuclear detonation could occur due to a deliberate attack (such as a tactical or strategic nuclear strike in conflict), an accidental launch caused by technical or human error, an unintended detonation due to mishandling or flawed safety mechanisms, or an act of nuclear terrorism. Such an event would likely produce immediate, widespread reporting and international response due to the scale and gravity of nuclear detonations. However, there have been no credible indicators of such a scenario materializing imminently as of August 2024[2][5].

## Rationale

The use of nuclear weapons in war has occurred only twice, both in 1945. Since then, while there have been numerous accidents and close calls, none have resulted in the detonation of a nuclear weapon outside of a controlled test environment. The continued absence of such events is maintained by a complex web of technical safeguards, command structures, international treaties, and strong political norms among nuclear-armed states[2][3][5]. The world’s experience since 1945 and the lack of any recent credible indicators pointing toward imminent nuclear use by states or non-state groups suggest that the probability remains low in the next 40 days.

Good forecasters give substantial weight to the status quo, especially in cases where historically rare and catastrophic events are in question. While it is never possible to rule out unforeseen developments—particularly with nuclear weapons, where risk is ever-present—the lack of current crises, combined with robust global monitoring and the severe deterrent against nuclear use, make a non-test nuclear detonation by October 1, 2024, an unlikely outcome[2][5].
