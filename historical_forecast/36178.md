(a) Time left until the outcome is known: 11 days (March 20 to March 31, 2025)

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: Based on current price trends, WTI crude oil appears to be trading in the range between $67 and $70.50 through March 2025, which would result in a "Yes" outcome.

(c) Scenario resulting in a "No" outcome: A sudden geopolitical crisis (such as an escalation in Middle East tensions) or a major supply disruption could push prices above $70. Alternatively, an unexpected economic downturn or recession fears could drive prices below $60 per barrel.

(d) Scenario resulting in a "Yes" outcome: Continuation of the current market equilibrium where supply slightly outpaces demand, with OPEC+ maintaining production cuts while non-OPEC production increases moderately, keeping prices stable within the $60-$70 range.

Looking at the available evidence, I believe WTI crude oil prices are likely to remain within the $60-$70 range through the end of March 2025 for several reasons:

First, the technical analysis for March 2025 specifically forecasts WTI crude oil to trade in a range between $67 and $70.50[4]. This indicates that market analysts expect prices to remain within the target range based on current trading patterns and momentum.

Second, multiple forecasting organizations project average 2025 prices that align with this range. The annual average WTI price forecast for 2025 is $70.62[1], while the EIA forecasts Brent crude (which typically trades slightly higher than WTI) at $74 per barrel for 2025[3]. Since WTI generally trades at a discount to Brent, this supports the likelihood of WTI remaining below $70.

Third, fundamental market dynamics suggest downward pressure on prices. The EIA and IEA both indicate that global oil supply is expected to outpace demand growth in 2025[2][3]. This supply-demand imbalance naturally constrains upward price movement.

However, I must account for the inherent volatility of oil markets. While current forecasts point to stability within our target range, oil prices can move dramatically in response to unexpected events. With just 11 days remaining in March, the risk window is relatively short, but not insignificant.

The fact that prices have already remained within this range for the early part of March 2025 increases confidence in the status quo persisting. Weekly crude oil prices have largely stayed below $75 per barrel in the first few weeks of 2025[1], suggesting stability at levels that favor our forecast.

Weighing all factors—current price trends, technical analysis, fundamental supply-demand balance, and the short timeframe remaining—I believe there is a high probability that WTI crude oil will remain between $60 and $70 through the end of March 2025.

Probability: 85%
