(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
There is no time left; the outcome is already determined as of November 1, 2024.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
Gukesh Dommaraju is the 2024 World Chess Champion, having defeated Ding Liren. The outcome is "Yes" under the specified criteria[2][3][5].

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
A "No" outcome would have occurred if Ding Liren had retained his title by defeating Gukesh in the 2024 World Chess Championship match, or if Gukesh had forfeited the match. There is no evidence such scenarios occurred[2][5].

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
A "Yes" outcome occurs if Gukesh Dommaraju wins the 2024 World Chess Championship by official FIDE announcement or if Ding Liren forfeits and FIDE declares Gukesh the champion. This is the reality as of November 1, 2024, with multiple sources confirming Gukesh’s victory by a score of 7.5–6.5 in Singapore, making him the 18th undisputed Chess Champion of the World[2][3][5].

## Rationale

The status quo strongly favors a "Yes" outcome, as Gukesh Dommaraju has officially won the 2024 World Chess Championship match against Ding Liren. This result has been recognized and announced by FIDE and leading chess organizations. There are no reports of forfeiture, annulment, or appeal that might affect the outcome. Because world events, particularly in international chess, usually move slowly and reversals after results are announced are extremely rare, forecasters should put significant weight on the present, officially recognized result.
