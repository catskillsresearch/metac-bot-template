(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
From September 9, 2024, there are 22 days until October 1, 2024.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
As of the latest known data (September 8, 2024), the Freddie Mac 30-year fixed mortgage rate was 6.35%. If nothing changes, the rate on October 1 will be **exactly 6.35%**, and the question would resolve as **No** (since the rate must be above 6.35% for a Yes resolution).

(c) **Scenario for a No outcome:**  
A typical "No" scenario would see current rates stabilizing or continuing their recent downward trend, possibly due to signs of cooling inflation, a steady Federal Reserve policy, or negative economic data leading to lower yields. If these conditions persist, the Freddie Mac rate could remain at or below 6.35% on October 1, 2024. Recent momentum supports this: as of September 6, the rate had fallen to 6.17%—the lowest since April 2023—indicating a notable downward shift in rates[2][1].

(d) **Scenario for a Yes outcome:**  
A "Yes" outcome would most likely require a reversal of the recent downtrend. This could happen if new inflation data comes in unexpectedly high, financial markets reprice the odds of Federal Reserve rate cuts, or there is a shock that pushes up long-term Treasury yields. Also, mortgage rates are influenced by additional factors (such as mortgage-backed securities spreads and investor sentiment) that could push the rate back above 6.35% despite recent declines[2][4]. However, with the rate at 6.17% as of September 6 and the downtrend in place, it would require a noticeable market shift for the rate to jump back above the 6.35% threshold in just over three weeks.

## Rationale

- The most recent Freddie Mac rate (6.17% on September 6) is already well below 6.35% and is the lowest since April 2023[2].  
- The trend since mid-summer 2024 is decisively downward, with the rate declining from over 7% in July[2].  
- Economic forecasts in early 2024 had predicted stubbornly high rates in the 6.7%-7% range for late 2024[4], but these have been outpaced by a more rapid fall in rates—likely due to improved inflation readings and expectations of Fed easing[2][3].
- Major institutions, such as Fannie Mae, have projected continued easing, with some forecasts suggesting rates could dip below 6% before the end of 2024[3][4].
- JP Morgan and other analysts see room for rates to drop further by year-end as the Fed is expected to start cutting rates and mortgage-backed security spreads could compress[2].
- No major shock (such as a rapid jump in inflation or a hawkish Fed surprise) is currently on the horizon that would strongly argue for a sharp reversal up in the coming three weeks. While unexpected events can happen, the probability must heavily weight the downward momentum and inertia.

Given the current level (6.17%), the direction of movement, and the short time until resolution, the status quo outcome (below or at 6.35%) deserves extra weight.

**Probability: 15%**  
This reflects a roughly one-in-seven chance that some shock or market reversal lifts rates above 6.35% by October 1, but the base case favors the recent downtrend continuing or holding steady just below the threshold[2][4][1].
