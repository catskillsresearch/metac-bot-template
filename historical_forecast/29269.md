(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
The ranking will be resolved in early January 2025, so as of October 28, 2024, there are about 2 months remaining before the outcome is set.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
As of the last available data, the top Gemini model ("Gemini-1.5-Pro-Exp-0827") was tied for fourth place on the LMSYS Chatbot Arena Leaderboard as of September 30, 2024. The leading models were GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet, both of which have consistently held higher positions than Gemini models throughout mid to late 2024[3]. If these trends persist and no major disruptive update occurs, Gemini will not be ranked #1.

(c) **Scenario that results in a No outcome:**  
GPT-4o and/or Claude 3.5 Sonnet maintain their leaderboard positions through the end of 2024, with Gemini models unable to surpass them in ranking due to either lack of significant model improvements, insufficient user preference changes, or the absence of a highly competitive update from Google. The leaderboard closes Q4 with no "gemini" model listed as #1 overall[3][4].  

(d) **Scenario that results in a Yes outcome:**  
Google releases a significantly improved Gemini model during Q4 2024—either a new major version or a dramatically enhanced variant—which quickly rises in Elo rating, garnering enough high placements in randomized user battles to tie for or take sole possession of the #1 rank on the Chatbot Arena leaderboard as accessed in January 2025. Such a scenario would require a rapid uptick in both technical capability and user preference for the Gemini model, displacing GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet from the top[4][5].

## Rationale

LMSYS Chatbot Arena ratings have proven moderately stable at the top, with major leaderboard changes typically following the release of disruptive new models, such as GPT-4o, which was able to claim #1 shortly after launch due to a clear performance jump and effective sampling[3][5]. While Google has introduced new Gemini variants (e.g., "Gemini-1.5-Pro-Exp-0827"), as of late September 2024, their performance has not been sufficient to overtake OpenAI or Anthropic’s strongest offerings[3].

No evidence suggests a transformative Gemini update is imminent before year's end, and voting trends on the platform—which now exceeds one million total votes—point to a relatively mature and stable evaluation base[4][5]. The methodology does allow for rapid rating gains if a new model is significantly better, but this has historically required both a clear technical leap and strong user reception.

Given the status quo and the tendency for the world to change slowly, top leaderboard positions are unlikely to be disrupted without substantial new evidence. Therefore, the most probable outcome remains that a Gemini model will not be ranked #1 overall at the end of Q4 2024.
