I'll approach this forecasting interview question systematically by analyzing the available information about Julian Assange's potential pardon.

(a) Time left until outcome is known: 330 days (May 6, 2025 to April 1, 2025)

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: No pardon for Julian Assange before April 1, 2025

(c) Scenario resulting in No outcome: President Biden declines to pardon Assange before leaving office in January 2025, and if Trump wins the election, he either decides against a pardon or delays it beyond April 1, 2025.

(d) Scenario resulting in Yes outcome: Trump wins the 2024 election, takes office in January 2025, and quickly issues a pardon for Assange as part of his early presidential actions.

The current situation regarding Julian Assange and the possibility of a presidential pardon shows significant advocacy but uncertain political will. As of May 2025, several key factors influence this forecast.

## Current Status

Julian Assange, the WikiLeaks founder, has faced legal challenges related to his publication of classified information. Based on the search results, rights organizations have been actively campaigning for his pardon. In January 2025, a coalition of press freedom and civil liberties organizations formally urged President Biden to pardon Assange to address concerns about press freedom implications of his prosecution[1].

This indicates ongoing advocacy, but no concrete action from the Biden administration toward a pardon as of the time of these reports.

## Political Landscape

The pardon would need to come from the sitting U.S. president. According to the resolution criteria, only a pardon from Donald J. Trump before April 1, 2025 would result in a "Yes" outcome. This implies Trump would need to:

1. Win the November 2024 election
2. Take office in January 2025
3. Issue a pardon within approximately 2.5 months of taking office

The Telegraph article referenced in the question background suggests Trump may "consider" a pardon if elected, but consideration does not guarantee action, especially within the narrow timeframe specified.

## Arguments For and Against Pardon

Organizations like Reporters Without Borders and Defending Rights & Dissent have presented strong arguments for pardoning Assange, citing press freedom concerns[1]. However, opposing views, such as those expressed by The Heritage Foundation, argue that Assange "deserves to face the full legal consequences of his actions"[2].

This polarization makes the decision politically complex for any president, potentially slowing the process even if there is interest in pursuing a pardon.

## Historical Precedent

Presidential pardons, especially controversial ones, often occur either at the very beginning of a presidential term (as policy statements) or near the end of a term (when political consequences are minimized). The April 1, 2025 deadline falls within the early period of a potential Trump term, making it possible but not guaranteed that action would be taken within this window.

## Status Quo Bias

As a professional forecaster, I must give significant weight to the status quo. The default outcome is "No" - that Assange will not receive a pardon before April 1, 2025. For this to change, several contingent events must occur:

1. Trump must win the election
2. Trump must follow through on considering a pardon
3. Trump must decide favorably on the pardon
4. The pardon must be executed before April 1, 2025

Each of these steps introduces uncertainty, with the combined probability decreasing with each contingent event.

## Final Assessment

Given the contingent nature of the events required, the political complexity of such a pardon, and giving appropriate weight to the status quo, I assess there is a less than even chance that Julian Assange will receive a pardon from Donald Trump before April 1, 2025. While advocacy for a pardon exists and Trump has indicated consideration, the multiple contingencies and tight timeline reduce the likelihood significantly.

Probability: 25%
