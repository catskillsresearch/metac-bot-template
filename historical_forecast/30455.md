(a) Time until outcome is known: 37 days (from today, November 25, 2024, until January 1, 2025)

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: Brazil continues to allow the 6x1 work schedule with no ban in place.

(c) Scenario for No outcome: The PEC (Proposed Constitutional Amendment) continues through normal legislative processes without being fast-tracked, requiring multiple congressional votes and committee reviews that extend beyond January 1, 2025. Opposition from business interests slows progress, and the holiday season further delays legislative action.

(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: Public pressure and political momentum around the PEC increases dramatically, leading to expedited processing and approval before the end of 2024. The amendment specifically targets the 6x1 schedule, replacing it with a 4x3 schedule, and gains strong cross-party support enabling quick passage.

Based on the search results, there is significant activity around a potential change to Brazil's work schedule structure. A PEC (Proposed Constitutional Amendment) that addresses the 6x1 work schedule has been signed and is under consideration[1][3]. The 6x1 schedule refers to working six consecutive days followed by one day off, which some politicians and advocates argue "overburdens workers, harms mental health, and reduces family time"[3].

The search results indicate that the PEC proposes a 4x3 regime as an alternative[3], suggesting four working days followed by three days off. This represents a significant labor reform that would fundamentally change working patterns in Brazil.

However, several factors suggest this change will not be fully implemented before January 1, 2025:

1. **Legislative Timeline**: Constitutional amendments in Brazil typically require approval in two rounds of voting in both the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate, each requiring a three-fifths majority. This process usually takes months or even years to complete.

2. **Recent Timing**: The search results from December 7, 2024, and November 2024 indicate this is a relatively recent political initiative[1][2][3][4]. The most recent information shows politicians stating positions and the proposal being signed, but not yet passed into law.

3. **Complexity of Implementation**: Even if passed, such a fundamental change to labor law would likely require a transition period for businesses to adapt.

4. **Holiday Period**: The end of December is traditionally a slow period for legislative activity in most countries due to holiday recesses.

While there appears to be some political support for ending the 6x1 schedule, with politicians publicly stating their positions against it[3], there's no indication in the search results of an imminent implementation before January 1, 2025. The fact that social media discussions about this topic were still framing it as a proposal in November and December 2024[2][4] suggests the change is not imminent.

The status quo in Brazil has long allowed flexible work schedules, including the 6x1 arrangement. While change might be coming, the timeline for implementing such a significant labor reform would likely extend beyond the first of January 2025, especially considering the legislative processes required for constitutional amendments in Brazil.
