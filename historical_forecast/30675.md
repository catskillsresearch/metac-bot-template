(a) **Time until outcome known:**  
There are 24 days left until December 27, 2024.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
On November 21, 2024, Donald Trump's net favorability rating on FiveThirtyEight was -6, the highest it had been in four years. If the current level holds and no significant change occurs, the outcome would be **Yes**, as -6 falls within the [-6, -4] range.

(c) **Scenario for a No outcome:**  
A "No" would result if Trump's net favorability drops below -6 or rises above -4 by December 27. This could occur if there is renewed controversy, a negative news cycle, or an unexpected adverse event during the presidential transition. It could also result from a reversion after the post-election "honeymoon" effect fades, pushing his numbers below -6 once again.

(d) **Scenario for a Yes outcome:**  
A "Yes" outcome would occur if Trump's net favorability remains stable or improves modestly from the -6 level, staying between -6 and -4. This could be supported by positive media coverage during the transition, successful cabinet announcements, or if the holiday season dampens partisan hostilities and maintains his improved favorability.

## Rationale

Recent data shows Trump's net favorability improved sharply after winning the election, moving from -8.6 on November 4 to -6 on November 21â€”a gain of 2.6 points in just 17 days. This places him at the very bottom of the target range for this question. 

Historically, post-election bounces ("honeymoon periods") can raise favorability, but they often plateau or fade as the new administration gets closer to inauguration. There is a plausible argument for some additional improvement if the positive momentum continues, but there's also substantial risk it could stall or partially revert, especially given that Trump's numbers have been historically volatile and heavily negative for much of the last several years.

FiveThirtyEight's methodology means their aggregate can be slow to react to outlier polls, so small, gradual shifts are more likely than dramatic swings unless there is a major event.

Given the status quo is at the very bottom of the target range (-6), and history suggests large movements are unusual without significant news, putting extra weight on the status quo is prudent. There is a fair chance for slight improvement up to -5 (which would also be a Yes), but also a significant risk of minor reversion to -7 or lower (a No outcome).

Given these considerations, the highest-probability scenario is that Trump's net favorability remains just inside or very near the [-6, -4] range by December 27. However, the margin is slim, and random polling variation or a modest decline could easily push it just outside, particularly below -6.

**Probability: 60%**
