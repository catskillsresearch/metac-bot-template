(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 39 days (from today, May 6, 2025, until April 1, 2025).

Wait, I need to correct myself. The deadline of April 1, 2025, has already passed as of today (May 6, 2025). This means the outcome of this question should already be determined based on whether OpenAI announced an IPO before April 1, 2025.

(b) The status quo outcome would be "No" since there's no evidence in the search results indicating that OpenAI announced plans for an IPO or filed an SEC Form S-1 before April 1, 2025.

(c) A scenario resulting in a No outcome: OpenAI continued to focus on its private funding rounds and development of AI technology without making a formal IPO announcement. Despite speculation and being listed among anticipated IPOs of 2025, the company chose to remain private past April 1, 2025, possibly due to its unique capped-profit structure or ongoing strategic considerations.

(d) A scenario resulting in a Yes outcome: OpenAI could have made an official announcement on its News section or filed an SEC Form S-1 before April 1, 2025, following through on the expectations indicated by financial analysts. This could have been motivated by the need for greater capital to fund ambitious growth projects in the rapidly expanding AI sector, especially with its projected $11.6 billion in revenue for 2025.

Based on the search results provided, there is no evidence that OpenAI announced plans for an IPO or filed an SEC Form S-1 before April 1, 2025. While there was significant speculation about OpenAI potentially going public in 2025, with reports from January and February 2025 listing it as one of the most anticipated IPOs, none of the search results indicate that an official announcement was made by the April 1 deadline.

The search results show that as of early 2025, OpenAI was valued at approximately $157 billion after a $6.6 billion fundraising round by Thrive Capital[3]. There were projections of $11.6 billion in sales for 2025 despite anticipated losses[3]. OpenAI backer Brad Gerstner had expressed hope that "the next step for OpenAI would be to go public"[3]. However, these were all speculations and expressions of interest rather than official announcements.

The most recent relevant information from OpenAI in the search results is from January 21, 2025, announcing "The Stargate Project," a new company intended to invest $500 billion over four years in building new AI infrastructure for OpenAI[4]. This announcement does not mention IPO plans.

Given the absence of any confirmed announcement about an IPO in the provided search results, and considering that the deadline of April 1, 2025, has already passed, the status quo outcome of "No" appears to be the correct resolution for this question.

Probability: 0%
