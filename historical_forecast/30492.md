(a) Time left until outcome: 7 months and 24 days from now (May 6, 2025 to December 30, 2024) - this is a negative timeframe, meaning the outcome date has already passed.

(b) Status quo outcome: Based on the search results, Wilmore and Williams were scheduled to remain on the ISS as part of Expedition 71/72 through February 2025, which would include December 30, 2024.

(c) Scenario for No outcome: If their SpaceX Dragon return flight was expedited due to unexpected circumstances such as health concerns or mission requirement changes, they could have returned to Earth before December 30, 2024.

(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: If NASA maintained its announced plan to keep them aboard the ISS until February 2025, they would definitely be in space on December 30, 2024.

Given today's date of May 6, 2025, the outcome of this question is already determined, as December 30, 2024, has passed. Based on the search results, I can provide a fact-based response rather than a forecast.

According to NASA's official announcement made on August 24, 2024, astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams were scheduled to "continue their work formally as part of the Expedition 71/72 crew through February 2025"[1]. They were to fly home aboard a Dragon spacecraft with two other crew members assigned to NASA's SpaceX Crew-9 mission[1].

This timeline clearly indicated that both astronauts would still be in space on December 30, 2024, as their return was not planned until February 2025. The decision to keep them aboard the International Space Station came after NASA determined that Boeing's Starliner spacecraft, which transported them to the ISS in June 2024, would return to Earth without them due to safety concerns[1].

The astronauts had already experienced a significant extension of their originally planned mission. More than two months after they were initially supposed to return to Earth, they remained on the ISS due to numerous technical issues with the Starliner spacecraft[3]. NASA Administrator Bill Nelson emphasized that this decision prioritized safety above all else[1].

Unless there was an emergency evacuation or a dramatic change in NASA's plans after August 2024 that is not reflected in the search results, the evidence strongly suggests that Wilmore and Williams were indeed still in space on December 30, 2024.

Probability: 99%
