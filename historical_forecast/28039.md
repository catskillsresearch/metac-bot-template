Based on the information available, I will analyze the question about whether exactly 2 major Atlantic hurricanes will occur in September 2024.

(a) Time until outcome is known: 4 months and 24 days from today (May 6, 2025), as the outcome will be determined based on NHC data as of October 1, 2024.

(b) Status quo outcome: The current status is uncertain as we're still months away from September 2024, but forecasts suggest an above-average hurricane season overall.

(c) No outcome scenario: Either fewer than 2 or more than 2 major hurricanes occur in September 2024. This could happen if atmospheric conditions like wind shear or Saharan dust suppress hurricane formation, resulting in only 0-1 major hurricanes. Alternatively, the extremely favorable conditions predicted (warm ocean temperatures during La Niña transition) could produce 3 or more major hurricanes in September.

(d) Yes outcome scenario: Exactly 2 major hurricanes reach Category 3+ status during September 2024. This could occur if the transition to La Niña proceeds as expected, creating favorable hurricane conditions, but other factors like timing of weather patterns or transient wind shear limit the number to precisely 2.

As a professional forecaster, I need to analyze the available data and historical patterns to provide an informed probability estimate.

The 2024 Atlantic hurricane season is forecast to be significantly above normal, with NOAA predicting 17-25 named storms and 8-13 hurricanes for the entire season[1]. Tropical Storm Risk (TSR) specifically forecasts 4 major hurricanes for the 2024 season[3]. 

September is typically one of the most active months for Atlantic hurricanes, often accounting for a substantial portion of major hurricane activity. The transition from El Niño to La Niña conditions expected this year typically enhances hurricane formation by reducing wind shear[3]. The long-range forecasts describe 2024 as potentially a "hurricane season from hell" with activity potentially 30% above near-term norms and 50% above long-term norms[3].

However, predicting the exact number of major hurricanes in a specific month is challenging. While the season overall is expected to be very active, the precise timing of when major hurricanes form depends on numerous factors including:

1. The exact timing of the El Niño to La Niña transition
2. Sea surface temperature patterns
3. African easterly waves
4. Atmospheric conditions including wind shear and Saharan dust

Looking at the total season forecast of 4 major hurricanes by TSR[3], and considering that September is typically one of the most active months, there's a reasonable chance that 2 major hurricanes could occur in September. However, the variability is high, and the number could easily be 0-1 or 3+.

Given the above-normal season forecast, the likelihood of having at least some major hurricane activity in September is fairly high. However, the precision of "exactly 2" makes this a more difficult prediction. Based on the seasonal forecasts and typical September hurricane patterns, I would estimate there's approximately a 30% chance of seeing exactly 2 major hurricanes in September 2024, with a higher probability that we'll see either fewer or more than 2.

Probability: 30%
