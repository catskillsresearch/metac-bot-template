(a) Time left until the outcome is known: As of February 14, 2025, there are 28 days until the current continuing resolution funding expires on March 14, 2025, which is the critical deadline by which Congress must act to prevent a government shutdown.

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changes: If Congress does not pass a full fiscal year 2025 appropriations bill or extend the continuing resolution beyond March 14, 2025, the US federal government will enter a shutdown furlough status starting immediately after midnight on March 14.

(c) Scenario resulting in a No outcome: Congress reaches an agreement on a full FY 2025 budget or passes another continuing resolution before the March 14 deadline, which the President signs into law, thereby averting a shutdown before April 1, 2025. This could happen either through bipartisan negotiation or last-minute deals, following the historical pattern of avoiding shutdowns at the eleventh hour.

(d) Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome: Congressional negotiations fail to produce either appropriations or a continuing resolution by midnight on March 14, 2025, triggering an immediate government shutdown, as announced by the Office of Personnel Management with furloughs announced for affected federal employees.

### Rationale

The federal government is currently funded through March 14, 2025 by a continuing resolution passed in December 2024, which averted an imminent shutdown at that time[1][5]. Historically, Congress has often passed short-term continuing resolutions or last-minute spending bills to prevent shutdowns, despite political disagreements.

However, as of February 2025, negotiations toward a final appropriations package have been difficult. Disruptions caused by executive actions and deteriorating trust between negotiators have complicated the path to agreement[5]. Disagreements over topline spending levels persist[4]. Given the narrow window of time remaining and the strained political environment, the risk of a shutdown is non-trivial.

Nevertheless, the Senate passed a continuing resolution on March 14, 2025, to extend government funding through the end of the fiscal year, which was signed into law on March 15, 2025. This action successfully averted a shutdown at the deadline[2]. This is consistent with the frequent pattern of last-minute agreements to keep the government funded.

Therefore, despite the challenges, the status quo and historical tendency to avoid shutdowns through last-minute deals strongly suggest that a shutdown before April 1, 2025, was averted.

### Final answer:
