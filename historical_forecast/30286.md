(a) **Time until outcome:** The Golden Joystick Awards ceremony is scheduled for November 21, 2024. As of November 19, 2024, there are 2 days remaining until the winner is announced[3].

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:** No winner has been announced yet, so the current status is unresolved[3]. If trends hold and no unforeseen events occur, one of the leading nominees—Astro Bot or Final Fantasy VII Rebirth—remains a strong possibility, but there is no default winner.

(c) **Scenario for a No outcome:** A "No" outcome will occur if neither Astro Bot nor Final Fantasy VII Rebirth win Console Game of the Year. Instead, one of the other nominees—Helldivers 2, Dragon’s Dogma 2, Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, or The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom—would need to win[3].

(d) **Scenario for a Yes outcome:** A "Yes" outcome will occur if either Astro Bot or Final Fantasy VII Rebirth wins Console Game of the Year. Both lead the nominees with five nominations each, signaling strong critical and community support, and both have large, engaged fanbases, which can be particularly influential in public-voted awards like the Golden Joysticks[3][4].

## Forecast Rationale

Astro Bot and Final Fantasy VII Rebirth are the most nominated games at the 2024 Golden Joystick Awards, each with five nominations, which typically signals strong recognition among both critics and the public[3]. At the same time, public voting introduces unpredictability, and strong contenders like The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom and Helldivers 2 have their own significant fanbases that could rally for an upset[3].

Historically, games with the most nominations or strong fan engagement perform well, but there are notable exceptions, especially if there is a surge in support for underdog titles. The lack of real-time voting data or polls increases uncertainty.

Given these factors, the best-available evidence suggests Astro Bot and Final Fantasy VII Rebirth are likelier than any single competitor, but not a lock, especially given the presence of beloved franchises like Zelda.

Probability: 60%
