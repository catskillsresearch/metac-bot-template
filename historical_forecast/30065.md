(a) Time left until outcome: 47 days (from November 14, 2024 to January 1, 2025)

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: No - Lara Trump remains in her RNC co-chair position without being offered a paid White House position.

(c) Scenario resulting in No outcome: The Trump transition team focuses on appointing experienced political operatives like Susie Wiles (already named chief of staff) and Brooke Rollins to key White House positions, while Lara Trump continues her work at the RNC to prepare for the 2026 midterms and 2028 presidential election cycle.

(d) Scenario resulting in Yes outcome: Donald Trump decides to bring Lara Trump into the White House in a paid advisory role focused on communications or outreach, similar to how he appointed other family members in his first administration, announcing this appointment in late November or December as part of a wave of staffing decisions.

Based on the available information, I assess that Lara Trump is unlikely to be chosen for a paid position within the Trump White House before January 1, 2025. Several factors inform this assessment:

First, Lara Trump already occupies a significant and influential role as the co-chair of the Republican National Committee (RNC), a position she assumed in March 2024[3]. This represents Donald Trump's clear endorsement of her political role, having personally selected her for this position. The RNC co-chair role gives her substantial influence within the Republican Party apparatus while keeping her outside the formal government structure.

Second, the current reporting on Trump's transition and key appointments does not include Lara Trump among those being considered for White House positions[2]. The Trump team has already begun announcing some key appointments, including Susie Wiles as chief of staff, and reports mention other longtime associates like Brooke Rollins as potential administration hires[2]. Lara Trump's absence from these early discussions is notable.

Third, while Donald Trump has previously appointed family members to White House positions during his first term, there may be strategic reasons to keep Lara in her RNC role rather than bringing her into the administration. Having a trusted family member leading the party organization could be more valuable than adding another family member to the White House staff.

Fourth, the status quo strongly suggests that no such appointment is imminent. As of November 14, 2024, there have been no leaks, trial balloons, or hints in reporting that Lara Trump is being considered for a White House role[1][2][3]. Given the intense media scrutiny on Trump's transition plans, it seems likely that any serious consideration of appointing her would have generated some reporting.

Finally, the timeframe is relatively short. With less than 50 days until January 1, 2025, and many critical cabinet and senior staff positions to fill, the Trump transition team may be focused on other priorities than creating a White House role for someone who is already effectively positioned in the RNC.

However, I must acknowledge some possibility of a Yes outcome. Donald Trump has demonstrated a preference for appointing family members to key positions, and he might decide that having Lara Trump in the White House would be valuable. Additionally, new circumstances might emerge that make such an appointment more likely.

Probability: 15%
