(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
As of April 21, 2025 (the date of determining evidence), there are 10 days remaining until the May 1, 2025 deadline.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
The status quo, as of April 21, 2025, is that Haley Stevens has already announced her candidacy for U.S. Senator from Michigan. If nothing changes, the outcome remains locked as “Yes.”

(c) **A scenario that results in a No outcome:**  
A No outcome would require that, contrary to current evidence, Haley Stevens had not announced her candidacy before May 1, 2025. This could only happen if the reports of her announcement were retracted, shown to be erroneous, or never occurred—none of which is indicated by current authoritative sources.

(d) **A scenario that results in a Yes outcome:**  
A Yes outcome occurs if Haley Stevens publicly announces her candidacy for U.S. Senator from Michigan before May 1, 2025—and this has already happened, with major news outlets and campaign materials confirming her official announcement as of April 21, 2025[2].

## Rationale

Good forecasters emphasize the status quo and require strong evidence to anticipate reversals. In this case, the status quo is extremely clear: multiple reputable news outlets confirm that, as of April 21, 2025, Haley Stevens has officially and publicly launched her Senate campaign[2]. There is no credible reporting suggesting confusion, ambiguity, or possible reversal. The only plausible path to a No would be a highly unusual and very public retraction; this is not only unprecedented but is also undocumented in the available sources.

## Final Answer

Probability: 100%
