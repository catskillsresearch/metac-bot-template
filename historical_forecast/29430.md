(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 6 days, as the 2024 US presidential election is scheduled for November 5, 2024.

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be that Donald Trump does not sweep all 7 battleground states, as current polling shows a mixed picture with Harris leading in some states and the races being extremely close in others.

(c) A scenario resulting in a No outcome: Harris maintains her polling leads in Pennsylvania and Michigan while winning at least one of the toss-up states like Wisconsin, Georgia, or Nevada where she currently holds a slight edge or is tied.

(d) A scenario resulting in a Yes outcome: Late-breaking momentum shifts toward Trump, enabling him to overcome Harris's leads in Pennsylvania and Michigan while solidifying his narrow advantages in Arizona and North Carolina, and flipping Georgia, Nevada, and Wisconsin to his column.

Based on the available polling data, the question of whether Donald Trump will sweep all seven battleground states in the 2024 election requires careful analysis of current trends and historical context.

The most recent polling data presents a competitive electoral landscape across these critical states. As of late October 2024, the polling indicates a mixed picture rather than a clean sweep for either candidate. In Michigan, Harris maintains a slight lead over Trump (50% to 45% in mid-September, narrowing to 49% to 46% in late October polls)[5][3]. Wisconsin shows an essentially tied race, with the candidates deadlocked at 48% each according to the most recent polling[3]. In Pennsylvania, Harris holds a more substantial lead of 6 points (51% to 45%), suggesting this state would be particularly challenging for Trump to flip[5].

Looking at the remaining battleground states, the races remain extremely tight. Trump holds a narrow 3-point lead in Arizona (50% to 47%) and a single-point edge in North Carolina (49% to 48%)[2]. Meanwhile, Harris maintains slight advantages in Georgia (49% to 48%) and Nevada (49% to 48%)[2]. All of these margins fall within typical polling error ranges, classifying these states as genuine toss-ups.

The historical context is also important to consider. No presidential candidate in recent elections has managed to sweep all seven of these battleground states. In 2020, Biden won six of these states (Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Arizona, and Nevada) while Trump carried North Carolina. For Trump to sweep all seven would require him to flip six states, which represents a significant electoral shift.

Gender dynamics appear to be playing a crucial role in these battleground states. Polling shows substantial differences in voting preferences between men and women, with these divides helping to maintain the competitive nature of these races[3].

When evaluating the probability of a Trump sweep, I must consider both the current polling averages and the potential for late shifts. While some individual polls and projections have shown momentum for Trump, the overall data does not support a high probability of him winning all seven states. Pennsylvania and Michigan in particular stand out as states where Harris maintains leads outside or at the edge of the margin of error[5].

Additionally, the presence of third-party candidates like Jill Stein, who is polling at 1-2% in several states, could impact the final results in these extremely tight races[5].

Given that most of these races remain within the margin of error, there is certainly a path for Trump to win all seven states, but it would require a systematic polling error in his favor across multiple states or a significant late shift in voter sentiment. Such an outcome, while possible, would represent a substantial deviation from the current polling averages.

The status quo, based on current polling, suggests a mixed outcome rather than a sweep. As a professional forecaster, I recognize that dramatic changes from the status quo are possible but generally less likely than outcomes that align more closely with existing data.
