(a) Time until outcome: 10 months and 2 days (from May 6, 2025 to March 8, 2025) - this is actually in the past since today's date is May 6, 2025.

(b) Status quo outcome: Based on the latest available data, Nottingham Forest is currently in 6th place in the Premier League with 61 points after 35 games played.

(c) Unexpected outcome scenario: A scenario where Nottingham Forest could have jumped to 4th place would have required both Newcastle United and Chelsea to suffer a significant drop in form, while Forest maintained consistent winning results against tough opponents like Manchester City and Arsenal.

Looking at the Premier League table as of May 2025, I can provide an accurate assessment of where Nottingham Forest stood on March 8, 2025, rather than a forecast since that date is now in the past.

Based on the search results, Nottingham Forest is currently sitting in 6th place in the Premier League with 61 points after 35 games played[2]. This puts them in a Europa League league phase qualification position, which is an impressive achievement for the club. They are currently one point behind Chelsea who are in 5th place with 63 points, and two points behind Newcastle United who are in 4th place with 63 points (separated by goal difference)[2].

The search results show that by May 2025, Forest has maintained a strong position in the table, sitting above Aston Villa who are in 7th place with 60 points[2]. This suggests that Forest has been performing consistently well throughout the season.

Looking at Forest's results in the months leading up to March 8, we can see they had several challenging fixtures in February 2025, including matches against Brighton & Hove Albion, Fulham, Newcastle United, and Arsenal[5]. While specific results for all these matches aren't provided in the search results, we do know that Forest has maintained a competitive position in the table.

Additionally, the club has shown strong cup form, advancing in the FA Cup with penalty shootout wins against Exeter City, Ipswich Town, and Brighton & Hove Albion in the February-March period[5].

Given that Forest is currently in 6th place after 35 games, and considering the competitive nature of the teams above them (Newcastle, Chelsea) and below them (Aston Villa), it's reasonable to conclude that on March 8, 2025, Nottingham Forest was likely situated in the 5th-7th position range.

The search results indicate that Forest has managed to secure a European competition qualification spot, which represents a significant achievement for a club that has experienced periods of relegation in recent decades.
