(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
As of November 4, 2024, there are less than two months until the January 1, 2025, deadline for a successful demonstration of lab-grown complex vital organs being used in humans according to the defined criteria.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changes:**  
No lab-grown heart, lung, liver (or substantial part), or kidney has been successfully implanted in a human with the recipient living at least 100 days off life support and with substantial health benefit, as per the criteria. No such procedure has yet been documented or reported in the public domain, and the leading clinical trials are still in early phases or involve partial, not full, organ replacements[2][4].

(c) **Scenario for a No outcome:**  
Clinical progress remains steady but incremental: current trials—such as the LyGenesis ectopic liver tissue therapy—complete their monitoring without achieving the full criteria, or results do not get reported/validated before the deadline. No reports surface of a human living at least 100 days after receiving a lab-grown heart, lung, liver, or kidney, free from life support and with clear clinical benefit[2][4].

(d) **Scenario for a Yes outcome:**  
A breakthrough occurs in one of the ongoing clinical trials where a patient receives a fully lab-grown complex organ (heart, lung, liver, or kidney) and survives at least 100 days, off life support, with medical professionals confirming substantial health improvement relative to not receiving the transplant. This would require not only the transplant itself but also the passing of the 100-day survival threshold, data validation, and timely public reporting within the next two months—none of which have been indicated as imminent in current literature or press releases[2][4].

## Rationale

Current developments show significant progress in:
- Creating organoids and mini-organs for research and limited regenerative therapies.
- Beginning early-phase trials for approaches like regenerating liver tissue in lymph nodes (LyGenesis)[2] and small-molecule–induced endogenous regeneration for the lung[3].
- Advancing bioengineering platforms (organ-on-a-chip, 3D bioprinting), though most success to date is with skin and non-vital tissues[4].

However, none of these efforts have yet resulted in the full transplantation of a lab-grown vital organ into a human, meeting the required survival and health criteria. The most advanced trials are in Phase 1 or 2 and will not report full outcomes until well after the deadline[2][3][4]. The field continues to face challenges with vascularization, immune rejection, and regulatory hurdles, all slowing the pace of translation from bench to bedside[4].

Given the short time remaining and the slow, iterative nature of biomedical translation, the status quo outcome—no successful, criteria-meeting lab-grown vital organ transplants in humans before 2025—remains heavily favored. Good forecasting practice recognizes that medical revolutions almost always progress more slowly than headlines suggest due to the need for safety, efficacy, and regulatory review.
