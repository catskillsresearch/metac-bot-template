(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known: 7 days (October 29, 2024 to November 5, 2024)

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed: Joe Rogan has not yet endorsed Donald Trump for the 2024 election.

(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome: Rogan maintains his previous endorsement of RFK Jr. or chooses to remain neutral without making any formal endorsement of Trump, despite having hosted him on his podcast.

(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome: Following their recent three-hour podcast conversation, Rogan publicly declares his support for Trump, either on his podcast, social media, or through another public medium before Election Day.

Based on the available information, I need to assess the likelihood of Joe Rogan endorsing Donald Trump before November 5, 2024. Let me analyze the evidence systematically.

Donald Trump appeared on Joe Rogan's podcast on October 25, 2024, for a lengthy three-hour interview[2][3]. This represents a significant platform and time commitment from both parties, suggesting at least a cordial relationship. During the podcast, Trump directly asked Rogan for an endorsement, saying "you should do the same thing Joe because you cannot be voting for Kamala"[1]. This direct solicitation indicates Trump's desire for Rogan's endorsement and his belief that Rogan is not aligned with Kamala Harris.

The search results show that during the interview, Rogan appeared sympathetic to Trump, noting how Trump has faced systematic attacks from the media. Rogan stated, "There's probably no one in history that I've ever seen that's been attacked the way you've been attacked and the way they've done it so coordinated and systematically." This suggests Rogan has some level of sympathy toward Trump's treatment by the media.

However, several factors weigh against an endorsement. First, Rogan previously endorsed RFK Jr., which complicates a potential Trump endorsement. While the search results indicate that Trump committed to bringing RFK Jr. into his administration during the Rogan interview[3], this doesn't guarantee that Rogan would shift his endorsement from RFK Jr. to Trump.

The timing is also important to consider. With only 7 days between today (October 29, 2024) and Election Day (November 5, 2024), the window for Rogan to make an endorsement is relatively narrow. While not impossible, the status quo typically has inertia - if Rogan hasn't endorsed Trump yet despite their podcast conversation, there's a reasonable chance he won't do so in the remaining time.

Rogan has historically maintained a degree of political independence, hosting figures from across the political spectrum without necessarily endorsing them. His podcast format allows for extended conversations with controversial figures without requiring him to take personal political positions.

Finally, since the podcast aired on October 26, 2024, and there's no indication in the search results (as of October 29) that Rogan has already endorsed Trump, this suggests that an immediate endorsement following the interview did not occur.

Weighing these factors:
- Evidence for potential endorsement: Direct ask from Trump during podcast; sympathetic interview; Trump's commitment to RFK Jr. (whom Rogan previously endorsed)
- Evidence against endorsement: Previous endorsement of RFK Jr.; Rogan's history of political independence; lack of immediate endorsement following the podcast; limited time remaining before election

Given the status quo bias and the relatively short timeframe remaining, I believe there's a moderate but not high probability of Rogan endorsing Trump before Election Day.

Probability: 35%
