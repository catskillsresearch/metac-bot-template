(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
The September FOMC meeting is scheduled for September 17-18, 2024, roughly four weeks from the current date (August 22, 2024).

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
The most likely outcome based on recent Fed communications and market consensus is a 25 or 50 bps (0.25 or 0.50 percentage point) rate cut at the September meeting, but not a cut exceeding 50 bps[1][3][4].

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
If economic data between now and mid-September shows continued moderation of inflation, gradual weakening of the labor market, but no signs of a sudden or severe recession, the Fed will likely make a cautious first rate cut of 25 or 50 bps. This is consistent with their historical approach, stated preference for "measured" cuts, and their messaging as of late July and early August 2024[1][3][4].

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
For the Fed to cut by more than 50 bps at the September meeting, there would likely need to be a major negative surprise such as a sharp deterioration in jobs data, a significant rise in unemployment, or a financial stability event. Only a sudden, broad-based signal of imminent recession or systemic risk would prompt the Fed to deviate from its incremental approach and enact a larger (e.g., 75 bps or more) cut at a single meeting. This is not the base case in current economic projections[1][3][4].

## Rationale

The Federal Reserve has signaled increasing readiness to begin cutting interest rates, with multiple Wall Street analysts and markets expecting a September start to rate reductions[3]. However, both Fed Chair Powell and official statements have emphasized the central bank's data dependency and caution regarding the pace and size of cuts, explicitly avoiding commitments to outsized, front-loaded moves[3].

Historically, the Fed has almost never cut by more than 50 bps at a single scheduled meeting, except in response to acute crises (e.g., the 2020 market panic triggered by COVID-19 or the 2008 financial crisis). While the July jobs report was weak and unemployment is rising, the data so far suggest a slowing economy, not an acute crisis demanding extremely aggressive easing[3][4].

Market forecasts currently center around a 25 or 50 bps cut in September, with additional cuts expected at subsequent meetings[1][3][4]. Even optimistic scenarios for doves on the FOMC and Wall Street rarely project more than a 50 bps move at the September meeting. The CME FedWatch tool anticipates approximately 100 bps in total cuts by the end of 2024, but this cumulative view does not translate to a single, large September move.

The main risk to this outlook would be a sharp, negative shock in the next few weeksâ€”a sudden financial market selloff, a massive spike in unemployment, or some sign of systemic crisis. Unless such a shock materializes, the Fed is very likely to stick to its measured, historically consistent approach.
