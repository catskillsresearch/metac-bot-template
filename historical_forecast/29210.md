(a) **Time until outcome is known:**  
About 2 months and 1 week remain until Metaculus will check the Wikipedia page for resolution around January 1, 2025.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changes:**  
Wikipedia currently lists Venezuela as "currently" blocking Twitter/X due to a government ban announced in August 2024 and subsequently extended indefinitely[3]. There have been no credible reports or official statements reversing the ban as of late October 2024[2][3][5]. If nothing changes, Wikipedia will likely continue to list Venezuela as blocking Twitter/X at the resolution date.

(c) **Scenario for a No outcome:**  
A No outcome could occur if, before January 1, 2025, the Venezuelan government officially lifts the ban on Twitter/X and credible news outlets widely report on access being restored. Subsequently, Wikipedia editors would update the "Censorship of Twitter" page to remove Venezuela from the list of countries currently blocking Twitter/X. This would likely require verifiable evidence of policy change and accessibility, as Wikipedia typically updates such information in response to reputable sources.

(d) **Scenario for a Yes outcome:**  
A Yes outcome will happen if there is no official change in government policy or no widespread reporting of restored access to Twitter/X in Venezuela. In that scenario, Wikipedia will continue to list Venezuela as "currently" blocking Twitter/X, matching the present status[3]. This remains the default path barring significant, publicized developments.

## Rationale

The ban on Twitter/X in Venezuela, imposed in early August 2024, was explicitly extended for an indefinite period by government authorities[2][3][5]. Multiple news outlets have confirmed both the imposition and the indefinite nature of the ban, and as of late October 2024, there is no evidence of reversal. Reports from Venezuelan users and the presence of Venezuela in Wikipedia's "currently" blocked list corroborate the continuing restriction[1][2][3].

Wikipedia's process for these pages relies on secondary sources. Unless there is a notable and verifiable change—such as a policy reversal publicly announced by the Venezuelan government and reported by major media outlets—editors are unlikely to remove Venezuela from the list. Historically, repressive information policies in Venezuela have tended to be long-lasting unless prompted by significant regime change or dramatic shifts in international relations, neither of which appears probable within the next two months[4].

Given the short time remaining, the absence of any indication of an imminent policy change, and the entrenched history of social media blocking in Venezuela during periods of unrest, the base rate strongly favors continuity (status quo bias). A change substantial enough to alter Wikipedia's listing would require both a clear governmental announcement and quick action by Wikipedia editors, all supported by several independent, reliable sources.

## Final Answer

Probability: **92%**

It is highly probable that Wikipedia will still list Venezuela as "currently" blocking access to Twitter/X at the end of 2024, barring a significant, widely reported policy change and subsequent Wikipedia update in the next two months[2][3][5].
