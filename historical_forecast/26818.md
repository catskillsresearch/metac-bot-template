(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  
As of July 31, 2024, there are exactly 61 days until September 30, 2024, when the outcome will be observed.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
Donald Trump’s primary TikTok account (@realdonaldtrump) already has 15.1 million followers as of July 31, 2024[1]. If nothing significant changes—if the account remains up and follower numbers neither decline nor fluctuate dramatically—he will still have more than 15 million followers on September 30, 2024, resulting in a "Yes" outcome.

(c) **Scenario for a No outcome:**  
The only realistic scenario for a "No" outcome is if Trump’s official TikTok account (@realdonaldtrump) is removed, suspended, or otherwise ceases to exist before September 30, 2024. Alternatively, if an extraordinary drop (due to a massive follower purge or major event) reduced his followers below 15 million, it would also produce a "No," but this is highly unlikely given current trends and recent growth[1].

(d) **Scenario for a Yes outcome:**  
Any scenario in which Trump’s official TikTok account (@realdonaldtrump) remains active and publicly accessible, and its follower count does not dip below 15 million by September 30, 2024, results in a "Yes." Given he is currently at 15.1 million followers and TikTok’s general upward follower trends, even with some minor fluctuations or purges, his count will almost certainly stay above the threshold[1].

## Rationale

When forecasting, it is critical to focus on the status quo since most things in the world tend to remain relatively stable over short timeframes unless impacted by significant events. In this case, Trump’s TikTok following has demonstrated very rapid growth—from 3.2 million at launch (June 2) to 5 million within four days, 9.3 million as of July 28, and 15.1 million by July 31[1][2]. This growth rate, along with the engagement seen around the U.S. presidential campaign, suggests further increases or at least stability.

There are no indications of imminent risks such as suspension or removal of his account as of July 31, and his continued campaign activity makes it highly likely his presence will be maintained. The only plausible threats would be an unexpected TikTok account suspension (e.g., due to platform policy enforcement or a wider ban), which there is no evidence for at present.

Given this, and the fact he already exceeds the threshold, the probability of the answer being "Yes" is extremely high.
