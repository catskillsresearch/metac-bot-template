(a) **Time Until Outcome Known:**  
There are 33 days until September 18, 2024, when Keir Starmer's approval rating will be checked for this question's resolution.

(b) **Status Quo Outcome if Nothing Changed:**  
As of early August 2024, Keir Starmer's approval/favourability ratings have returned to, or slightly under, 40% after a brief post-election bounce. YouGov recorded a drop from 44% (early July, right after the election) to 40% (early August)[2]. Ipsos puts his "doing a good job" approval at 36% in mid-July[5]. In the absence of significant positive developments, the trend is downward or stagnating, with the status quo suggesting his rating will be at or just below 40% on September 18[1][2][5].

(c) **Scenario for a No Outcome (Approval ≥ 40):**  
A "No" outcome would require Starmer's approval to be 40 or higher. This could be driven by:
- A strong positive government performance, such as rapid, visible progress on key pledges or an economic boost.
- Major policy announcements widely received as successful or popular.
- External events (e.g., international crises) that rally the public behind the Prime Minister.
- The opposition performing poorly or negative news coverage focusing on other parties, shifting public support back to the government.

(d) **Scenario for a Yes Outcome (Approval < 40):**  
A "Yes" outcome needs Starmer's approval to be below 40. This could result from:
- Continued lack of major, positive developments from the new government.
- Policy missteps, scandals, or public/professional criticism.
- Ongoing or increased public discontent with cost of living, public services, or the perception that Labour's mandate is weak due to low turnout and fragmented support[2].
- Reform UK or other opposition parties gaining momentum, eroding Labour's public standing.

## Rationale

After a brief post-election "honeymoon," Starmer's favourability/approval ratings have rapidly declined to the 40% mark, with both YouGov and Ipsos showing this threshold as a ceiling or recent peak[1][2][5]. The pre-election trend was lower (YouGov: net -18), and the return to pre-election levels suggests limited residual goodwill, despite Labour's large parliamentary majority. The lack of major new positive developments, combined with a challenging political context and a fragmented mandate, limits the probability of a significant recovery over the next month[2]. 

Approval ratings can shift quickly, especially in response to significant events; however, absent a specific positive shock, established political science research indicates that approval ratings, especially after a "honeymoon" period, tend to drift downward or stagnate as public scrutiny increases and government actions encounter criticism.

Given that the status quo is just at 40% or slightly below, and the trend is negative or flat, the probability that Starmer's approval will be less than 40% by September 18—measured by the Politico Poll of Polls "Smooth" figure—is moderately high. There is an outside chance of a rebound, but no evidence in the current context to suggest this is likely in the next 33 days.

**Probability: 75%**
