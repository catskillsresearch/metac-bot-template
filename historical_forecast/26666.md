(a) Time left until outcome: 147 days (from May 6, 2025 to September 30, 2024, which is in the past)

(b) Status quo outcome: The question has already resolved as "No" since September 30, 2024 is in the past relative to the current date (May 6, 2025).

(c) Scenario for No outcome: Tether maintained its peg near $1 throughout the specified period, with no significant deviations below $0.50 on major exchanges, and trading continued normally without extended suspensions.

(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: This is no longer possible as the deadline has passed. A Yes outcome would have required Tether to trade below $0.50 for more than 7 continuous days on at least two major exchanges, or have its trading suspended for more than 7 days on those exchanges before September 30, 2024.

Looking at the historical data from the current vantage point of May 2025, I can confidently analyze whether Tether collapsed according to the specified criteria before September 30, 2024.

Based on the available search results, there is no indication that Tether collapsed or experienced any significant deviation from its $1 peg during the period in question. In fact, Tether price predictions from various sources consistently show USDT maintaining values very close to $1 throughout 2024 and into 2025.

According to the search results, Tether started May 2025 at $1[4], indicating it had not collapsed prior to that date. The historical price data shows Tether has consistently maintained its value near $1 with only minor fluctuations, never approaching the $0.50 threshold specified in the criteria[5]. The historical ROI performance from 2017 through 2023 shows only minor percentage changes each year, with the largest being just 1.54% in 2018[5].

Multiple price prediction sources forecast Tether would maintain its stability around the $1 mark throughout 2024 and into 2025, with some predicting minor fluctuations but nothing close to a collapse scenario[1][2][4]. Even the most volatile predictions for 2025 show minimum values of around $0.85, which is well above the $0.50 collapse threshold[4].

There is also no evidence in the search results of any extended trading suspensions on major exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, or Uniswap during the relevant period.

Tether's fundamental design as a stablecoin aims to maintain a 1:1 peg with the US dollar. While there have been historical concerns about its reserves and transparency, the data shows it successfully maintained its peg through the period in question.

Probability: 0%
