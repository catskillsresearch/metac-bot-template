(a) Time left until the outcome is known:  
As of January 31, 2025, there are 59 days remaining until April 1, 2025, when the question’s outcome will be determined.

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed:  
North Korea has not invaded South Korea by sending ground forces into South Korean territory without consent. Its recent provocations remain symbolic or indirect, and no US public accusation of invasion has been made. Military tensions persist but have not escalated to direct ground invasion or war declaration. The US continues to reaffirm its defense commitment but no invasion-related accusation has occurred.

(c) Scenario that results in a No outcome:  
North Korea maintains its current posture of military restraint toward South Korea, continuing symbolic provocations such as propaganda balloons or statements without crossing the threshold of sending ground troops into South Korea. South Korea’s government, despite internal political struggles, manages to avoid actions provoking open conflict. The US maintains a defensive posture but does not accuse North Korea of an invasion because no such invasion occurs.

(d) Scenario that results in a Yes outcome:  
North Korea unexpectedly launches a direct ground invasion by deploying troops into South Korean territory without Seoul’s consent, potentially targeting border areas or a South Korean island. This military action is unambiguously recognized by the South Korean government and the US. Prompted by this aggression, the US publicly accuses North Korea of invasion before April 1, 2025.

**Rationale**

North Korea’s history since the Korean War shows prolonged periods of tension with regular symbolic provocations; however, a direct ground invasion has not happened for decades. Recently, North Korea abandoned the peaceful reunification stance but has not engaged in an outright military invasion, instead focusing on economic policies and military support for Russia’s conflict in Ukraine. While North Korea’s military cooperation with Russia has provided battlefield experience, North Korea remains restrained regarding South Korea despite escalating rhetoric and symbolic acts[2][3].

South Korea’s internal political turmoil and the US political landscape add uncertainties, but no direct invasion or indication thereof has emerged by January 31, 2025. The US has not publicly accused North Korea of invasion up to this point, and the threshold events—such as North Korean ground forces crossing into South Korea—have not taken place[1][3][4].

Given the slow-moving nature of state-level military conflicts and the severe consequences of direct invasion, the status quo is heavily favored. Sudden invasions are possible but rare and would require significant and visible military actions, which have not occurred or been reported so far.
