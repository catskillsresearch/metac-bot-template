(a) **Time Left Until Outcome Known**  
There are about six weeks (approximately 42 days) remaining until December 31, 2024, when the ranking between Kalshi and Robinhood in the App Store's Finance category will be determined.

(b) **Status Quo Outcome if Nothing Changed**  
As of the latest available information in October and early November 2024, Robinhood is generally ranked higher than Kalshi among Finance apps. Robinhood sits at #22 with periods of increased momentum following its election contracts launch, while Kalshi has surged during the election cycle but is not consistently ahead of Robinhood. If current trends persist, Robinhood is likely to remain ahead[3][4][5].

(c) **Scenario Leading to a No Outcome (Robinhood outranks Kalshi)**  
After the intense interest of the presidential election subsides (election is in early November), engagement with event-based trading apps like Kalshi typically drops as the core event that drove their download spike is over. Robinhood, with its broader suite of financial services (stocks, crypto, banking, options trading), larger user base, and recent addition of prediction markets, retains steady inflows and higher baseline retention. As a result, by December 31, 2024, Robinhood remains higher in the Finance app rankings than Kalshi[2][3][5].

(d) **Scenario Leading to a Yes Outcome (Kalshi outranks Robinhood)**  
Kalshi manages to maintain or even accelerate its momentum post-election—either through aggressive user acquisition, viral marketing campaigns, the introduction of compelling new contracts, or continued public and media attention. Simultaneously, Robinhood sees relatively less growth in new downloads following the immediate election spike, allowing Kalshi to overtake and hold a higher App Store ranking by December 31, 2024[1][4].

## Rationale

Historical patterns in App Store rankings show strong election-related apps surging before and during major events, but often declining afterward as public attention moves on. Robinhood, by contrast, benefits from a diversified product suite and established brand loyalty, which cushions its post-event drop-off and tends to support a higher sustained ranking[2][5].

While Kalshi had a breakout moment, surpassing even Coinbase at one point when election markets opened[4], its appeal is closely tied to election-specific interest. There is little evidence this surge can be maintained well into late December, especially two months after the election ends. Robinhood’s entrance into prediction markets generated enormous volume—over 100 million contracts traded in under a week, reinforcing its top-tier app status among U.S. finance users[5].

Given both the momentum and stickiness of Robinhood’s user base, and the typical post-event ranking fallback for niche event-based apps like Kalshi, the status quo (Robinhood remains ahead) is the more likely outcome. However, the rapidly evolving landscape and Kalshi’s demonstrated ability to break through with the right catalyst mean a change in rank cannot be entirely ruled out.

## Final Answer

Probability: 25%  
(Robinhood remains ahead is the strong base case; Kalshi upsets are possible but less likely barring another major catalyst.)
