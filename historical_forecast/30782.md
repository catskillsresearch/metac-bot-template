(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known: 26 days (from December 5, 2024, to December 31, 2024).

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed: Emmanuel Macron remains the President of France through December 31, 2024.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome: Macron could resign due to overwhelming political pressure from the chaotic parliamentary situation, especially if he's unable to form a functional government following Michel Barnier's resignation as Prime Minister.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome: Macron continues to fulfill his stated commitment to remain in office until the end of his term in 2027, appointing a new Prime Minister and weathering the current political crisis.

## Rationale for My Forecast

Based on the available information, there are several strong indicators that Emmanuel Macron will remain President of France on December 31, 2024:

First and foremost, Macron has explicitly vowed to stay in office until the end of his second term in May 2027[2][5]. This public commitment was recently reinforced on December 5, 2024, following the resignation of Prime Minister Michel Barnier after a historic no-confidence vote[5]. Even during this significant political crisis, Macron firmly stated that he "won't shoulder other people's irresponsibility" and plans to name a new Prime Minister within days[5].

The status quo strongly favors Macron remaining in office. Under the French Fifth Republic's structure, presidential terms are fixed, and there are limited constitutional mechanisms to remove a sitting president outside of extraordinary circumstances. Macron won his second term legitimately, and despite parliamentary challenges, his presidential position itself isn't directly threatened by the parliamentary composition.

While Macron has faced significant political setbacks, including losing his parliamentary majority in June 2022[4] and the more recent collapse of his government in December 2024[5], these challenges affect his ability to implement policy rather than his legal right to hold office. The French political system allows for "cohabitation," where the president and prime minister come from different political parties, which is a more likely outcome than presidential resignation.

Historical precedent also supports this forecast. The French political system is designed to provide stability at the presidential level, even during parliamentary turmoil. No French president in the Fifth Republic has resigned due to parliamentary defeats or no-confidence votes against their governments.

Even though France is experiencing political gridlock with a hung parliament[1], and Macron's authority and leadership capacity have been limited[1], these factors don't directly threaten his constitutional position as president.

The most significant risk factor would be if Macron himself decided to resign, but he has explicitly rejected this option, stating he intends to serve his full term[2][5]. While his political effectiveness may be diminished, there's little evidence suggesting he would abandon his position entirely with just months remaining in 2024.

Considering all these factors, and giving appropriate weight to the status quo which indicates Macron will remain president, I believe there is a very high probability he will still be President of France on December 31, 2024.

Probability: 95%
