(a) **Time until outcome is known:**  
The outcome will be known as of September 1, 2024. From the current date (August 5, 2024), this is 27 days away.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
As of July 30, 2024, Donald Trump’s net favorability according to 538 is -8.7[1][3]. If nothing changes, his rating would remain below -8, resulting in a **No** outcome.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
Trump’s net favorability remains at or below -8, meaning any minor polling shifts are either negative or insufficiently positive to move the number above the threshold. This could happen if the national mood remains stable, no major news changes public opinion, or if only typical week-to-week polling noise occurs[1][3][4].

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
Trump’s net favorability rises to better than -8 (for example, -7.5, -7, or higher). This could result from a series of favorable news cycles, a strong performance at a major campaign event, or continued erosion in Harris's or the Democrats’ ratings that causes some marginal voters to view Trump in a slightly better light. A move of +0.8 points in net favorability (from -8.7 to above -8) is plausible with minor but positive polling trends over the next month, but would still require some modest improvement in public perception[1][3][5].

## Rationale

Historically, Trump's national favorability ratings have been quite stable, with only modest and short-lived fluctuations even during periods of intense news coverage or political change[3][4]. The current net favorability is -8.7, just 0.7 points below the threshold in question, indicating that a relatively minor shift in polling could change the outcome[1][3]. However, there are no signs in current polling or political news suggesting a substantial improvement in Trump’s public image is forthcoming, and 538’s methodology (a weighted average of national polls) typically smooths out short-term swings, emphasizing the stability of the “status quo” scenario[1][3].

While it is possible for late-summer campaign events to marginally improve Trump’s favorability, especially in light of Biden’s withdrawal and Harris being a new opponent, such gains have historically been difficult for Trump to sustain[1][3][5]. The most likely scenario is continued minor fluctuations around the current number, with any movement across the -8 threshold happening by a narrow margin and likely driven by ordinary polling volatility rather than significant changes in public sentiment[3][4][5].

Given the above, a modest probability should be assigned to a Yes outcome (Trump at better than -8), with a greater likelihood that the current state persists or moves only slightly.

## Final Answer

Probability: **38%**
