(a) **Time until the outcome is known:**  
The 2025 German federal election was scheduled for February 23, 2025. As of today (May 6, 2025), the official results should have been published, so the outcome is likely already known to the relevant authorities, even if not reflected in all public sources.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
Based on the latest reliable polling and provisional results leading up to the election, the most likely configuration is that **six parties** will be represented in the next Bundestag:
- CDU (Christian Democratic Union)
- CSU (Christian Social Union; counted separately)
- SPD (Social Democratic Party)
- AfD (Alternative for Germany)
- Greens (Alliance 90/The Greens)
- Die Linke (The Left)

The main uncertainty centered on whether Die Linke and the new left-populist BSW (Bündnis Sahra Wagenknecht) would both surpass the 5% threshold or secure at least three direct mandates, and whether the FDP (Free Democratic Party) would clear the threshold. As of the final polling and MRP projections:
- FDP was generally *below* the 5% threshold and not projected to win enough direct mandates, making it likely they will not be in parliament[1].
- BSW was right around or just under the 5% mark, with some forecasts suggesting they might fall short, but others showing them just scraping in[1].
- Die Linke was at or slightly above 5% in some polls, with YouGov’s latest MRP model noting they are now likely to remain in parliament[5].

Provisional tallies give approximate second vote shares of:
- CDU/CSU: 28.5%
- AfD: 20.8%
- SPD: 16.4%
- Greens: 11.6%
- Die Linke: 8.8%
- BSW: 5.0%
- FDP: 4.3%  
This implies **six parties** are on track to win seats, with FDP below threshold and BSW just clearing it (though possibly rounded up in reporting)[1].

(c) **Scenario for an unexpected outcome:**  
An unexpected outcome would require a significant last-minute shift or a technical result:
- If BSW or Die Linke *just* miss the 5% threshold and don’t win three direct mandates, either could be excluded, reducing the number of parties to five.
- Alternatively, if FDP or another small party manages to win enough direct mandates despite a weak overall performance, or if BSW falls just short and fails to secure enough direct wins, the party count could drop back to five.
- Conversely, if both BSW and Die Linke clear the 5% threshold and FDP squeaks over as well, or a very small party wins three unexpected direct mandates, the party count could rise to **seven**.

## Final Probabilities

Based on recent polling, MRP projections, and the German electoral rules, here are the probabilities for each outcome:

| Option                | Probability |
|-----------------------|-------------|
| 5 or fewer            | 22%         |
| 6                     | 62%         |
| 7                     | 15%         |
| 8                     | 1%          |
| 9 or more             | <1%         |

**Rationale:**  
The most likely outcome is six parties, reflecting the best current evidence and the inertia of the party system[1][5]. Allowing for the uncertainties around party thresholds and direct mandates, the scenario with five parties is also plausible, especially if BSW or Die Linke narrowly miss the threshold. Seven parties is less likely but still possible if both BSW and Die Linke make it and FDP surprises by clearing 5% or winning mandates. The odds for eight or more are very low based on current polling and Germany's electoral barriers.
