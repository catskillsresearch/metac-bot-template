(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
As of February 28, 2025, there are just over 1 month (specifically, 32 days) until April 1, 2025, the deadline for the Fram2 launch to count as "Yes" under this question's criteria.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
The most recent public schedules list Fram2 as "NET (No Earlier Than) spring 2025," and no explicit launch date within March 2025 is published. SpaceX's own launch calendar, as of late February, does not show Fram2 scheduled for March; only Starlink missions occupy the March 31 slot[1]. Barring further updates, the status quo suggests the launch will occur after April 1, 2025[1].

(c) **A scenario that results in a No outcome:**  
SpaceX continues with its current manifest, prioritizing scheduled Starlink and commercial missions. Fram2 preparations, including human rating, crew training, and vehicle checkout, require additional time or encounter minor delays. As a result, Fram2 launches in April or later, after the question's cutoff[1].

(d) **A scenario that results in a Yes outcome:**  
SpaceX finalizes preparations and training more quickly than anticipated, secures range availability, and elects to schedule Fram2 in the narrow window between March 20 and March 31, 2025 (after spring begins, before April). The mission launches as planned and achieves powered flight to orbit, satisfying the launch criteria.

## Rationale

- **Status quo heavily favors a "No" outcome.** No official sources or launch manifests as of late February show Fram2 launching before April 1, 2025; published schedules do not even list Fram2 as the next human mission[1]. SpaceX’s current cadence is robust but focused on Starlink and other commercial launches[1][5].
- **"NET spring 2025"** is imprecise and, by convention, usually signals that the launch is at best on the threshold of the spring window (starting March 20). With only an 11-day window (March 20–March 31) before April 1, this makes the probability of a pre-April 1 launch low unless there is a rapid, public schedule update.
- **SpaceX’s track record** for high-complexity, crewed missions is good but usually exhibits at least minor schedule slips, especially for first-of-its-kind missions like Fram2’s planned polar orbit. No evidence points to an acceleration in the timeline.

Given the above, while a last-minute schedule update is not impossible, expert forecasting practice puts heavier weight on the documented status quo. Therefore:

Probability: 15%
