(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  
Less than two months remain until January 1, 2025, when the question will resolve.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
NO: As of November 5, 2024, there is no public evidence that three or more Frontier AI Labs have issued a joint statement explicitly committing to constrain their AI's general capabilities, as narrowly defined by the resolution criteria[3][5].

(c) **Scenario that results in a NO outcome:**  
If, by January 1, 2025, no joint statement is made by at least three Frontier AI Labs (such as OpenAI, Google DeepMind, and Anthropic) that explicitly commits to constraints on the general capabilities of their AIs—such as compute caps or not deploying models before verifying safeguards against recursive self-improvement—the outcome will be NO. This could also occur if only risk management, safety research, or responsible scaling commitments are made, without explicit, enforceable constraints on model capabilities[3][5].

(d) **Scenario that results in a YES outcome:**  
If, before January 1, 2025, at least three Frontier AI Labs jointly release a clear, public statement wherein they explicitly commit to constrain the general capabilities of their AIs—for example, agreeing to not train models above a certain compute threshold, or to pause deployment until verifiable benchmarks are met—then the outcome will be YES.

## Rationale

- There has been significant progress toward collaborative AI safety (e.g., the formation of the Frontier Model Forum and the May 2024 "Frontier AI Safety Commitments"), with participation from all major Frontier AI Labs[1][3][5]. However, these agreements and statements have focused on responsible scaling, red-teaming, evaluation standards, and general safety practices—not on binding, explicit commitments to constrain general AI capabilities as narrowly defined in the question[3][5].
- Frontier Labs continue to express openness toward future collective action, and upcoming regulatory deadlines (such as the promise to publish responsible scaling policies by February 2025) could incentivize further joint commitments. However, historic patterns show that rapid, public, and binding self-restriction by major technology competitors is rare, especially given commercial, competitive, and reputational pressures[3].
- No evidence as of November 2024 indicates imminent release of such a narrowly defined joint commitment, and no public reporting suggests that one is imminent.

Given the short time remaining and the lack of any public movement toward the specific form of joint constraint required by the criteria, it is prudent to heavily weight the status quo.
