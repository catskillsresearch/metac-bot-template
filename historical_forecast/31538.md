**(a)** The outcome will be determined within **17 days** (from January 12 to January 28, 2025), when the Bulletin announces the new setting.  

**(b)** **Status quo**: If no material changes occur, the Clock remains at **90 seconds to midnight**, matching the 2023-2024 setting[3][4].  

**(c)** **Unexpected scenario**: A sudden breakthrough in nuclear arms control (e.g., U.S.-Russia negotiations) or a major climate agreement could move the Clock backward. Conversely, escalating conflicts (e.g., NATO-Russia direct confrontation) or a catastrophic biosecurity failure could push it closer to midnight.

### Rationale  
1. **Status quo bias**: The Clock rarely changes direction abruptly. Since 2020, adjustments have been incremental (100s â†’ 90s), and the 2024 statement emphasized unresolved risks[3][4].  
2. **Recent trends**:  
   - **Nuclear risks**: Ukraine war persists, NATO-Russia tensions remain elevated[4].  
   - **Climate**: Limited progress on emissions post-COP28.  
   - **Disruptive tech**: AI governance lags behind development[1].  
3. **Unexpected outcomes**:  
   - **Deterioration**: A nuclear test/weapon use would likely trigger a move (e.g., 60-79s).  
   - **Improvement**: A binding U.S.-China climate pact or START revival could justify 91-100s.

### Probabilities  
| Option                        | Probability |  
|-------------------------------|-------------|  
| 59 or fewer                   | 5%          |  
| 60 to 79                      | 10%         |  
| 80 to 89                      | 15%         |  
| **90 seconds (unchanged)**    | **55%**     |  
| 91 to 100                     | 10%         |  
| 101 to 120                    | 3%          |  
| 121 or more                   | 2%          |  

*Basis*: Current geopolitical inertia favors maintaining 90s[3][4], but rising tech/climate risks add downward pressure[1]. Extreme outcomes (e.g., <60s) require black-swan events absent from current indicators.
