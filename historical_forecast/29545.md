(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
The 2024 presidential election in the United States is scheduled for November 5, 2024. As of today (November 4, 2024, per the scenario), there is just one day before results begin to be reported, though full certified results may take slightly longer.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
If the current polling averages and historical voting patterns hold, Donald Trump is projected to lose the New York State popular vote by a margin *well above* 6.0 points. The most recent credible polls show the Democratic candidate (currently Kamala Harris) leading by double digits—ranging from 14 to 19 points in late October[4][5]. Other reputable polls show Harris ahead by 14 to 19 points; one Cygnal poll found Harris with a 57% to 39% lead, and a Siena poll on October 22 placed her at 58% to Trump’s 39%[4][5]. A recent head-to-head Biden vs. Trump poll in May had Biden leading Trump by 7 points, which would still be a "No" outcome[1].

(c) **Scenario that results in a No outcome:**  
Most plausible scenario. The Democratic nominee maintains a double-digit lead and wins New York State by a margin substantially greater than 6.0 points, consistent with both current polling and the state's long history as a Democratic stronghold[4][5]. Even significant shifts among undecided or third-party voters are unlikely to close such a large gap in a single day.

(d) **Scenario that results in a Yes outcome:**  
This would require an unprecedented last-minute surge toward Trump—such as a dramatic collapse for the Democratic nominee, a consolidation of nearly all undecided and third-party votes to Trump, or a massive polling error distorting the actual electorate. No credible evidence currently suggests such a shift is underway. Even the narrowest poll margins available (e.g., in May, Biden +7; Harris +14 or more in October) leave Trump at least 7 points behind[1][4][5].

## Rationale

- New York has a consistent, decades-long record of strong Democratic performance in presidential elections.
- The most recent polls show the Democratic nominee with leads well into double digits, much larger than the 6-point threshold for this question[4][5].
- While Trump has improved somewhat over past cycles (e.g., better numbers than 2016 or 2020 in recent polls), bridging the gap to under 6 points would require a dramatic and historically unprecedented shift in less than 24 hours, for which there is no current evidence.
- Professional forecasts place extra weight on the status quo, especially in the absence of signals for rapid political realignment.

**Probability: 2%**  
It is extraordinarily unlikely that Donald Trump will lose New York State by less than 6.0 points in the 2024 presidential election, given all current polling and historic trends[4][5].
