(a) Time until outcome is known: Approximately 4 months. The outcome will be determined after August 31, 2024, with an additional delay of about 4 weeks for data revisions, so by early October 2024.

(b) Status quo outcome: According to the most recent data available, the current COVID-19 hospitalization rate is around 2.9 per 100,000 population, which is below the 3.5 threshold.

(c) Scenario for No outcome: The KP.2 variant and other FLiRT variants continue to spread but don't cause significantly more severe disease than previous variants. Summer weather leads to more outdoor activities and better ventilation, limiting transmission. Existing immunity from prior infections and vaccinations continues to protect against severe disease, keeping hospitalization rates below 3.5 per 100,000.

(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: The KP.2 variant and other FLiRT variants prove to be more transmissible and potentially more virulent, leading to a summer surge. Waning immunity from previous vaccinations and infections, combined with relaxed mitigation measures, allows for increased spread. As warned by some health experts, this results in a significant summer COVID surge with hospitalization rates exceeding 3.5 per 100,000.

Based on the available data, several factors inform my forecast:

The current hospitalization rate of 2.9 per 100,000 provides a baseline, showing we're starting below the threshold of 3.5 per 100,000[2]. Historical data shows that COVID-19 hospitalization rates have varied significantly over time, with monthly rates reaching as high as 183.7 per 100,000 during peak periods (December 2020)[4]. However, this was before widespread vaccination and immunity from prior infections.

The emergence of the KP.2 variant (at 28.2% of sequenced variants as of May 11, 2024) and other FLiRT variants does present a potential risk factor for increased transmission. Some health experts have warned about a possible summer surge due to these variants. However, while variants can increase transmissibility, they don't necessarily lead to higher hospitalization rates if population immunity remains robust.

The CDC's tracking system, RESP-NET, continues to monitor COVID-19 hospitalizations, though there have been changes in reporting requirements since May 3, 2024, as hospitals are no longer required to report COVID-19 hospital data[3]. This may affect data quality but shouldn't impact the resolution of this question since it specifically relies on CDC's RESP-NET data.

Summer seasons typically see lower rates of respiratory virus transmission compared to fall and winter, which would suggest lower hospitalization rates. However, COVID-19 has previously shown summer surges, particularly with new variant emergence.

Placing appropriate weight on the status quo is important - the current rate of 2.9 is 17% below the threshold, and while new variants are emerging, there would need to be a significant change in hospitalization dynamics to cross the 3.5 threshold. The most recent trend mentioned showed a 14.4% decrease in hospitalizations, suggesting a downward rather than upward trajectory.

Given these considerations, while a summer surge is possible with the new variants, it would require a substantial change from current trends to exceed the 3.5 per 100,000 threshold. The status quo and seasonal patterns suggest we'll likely stay below the threshold, but the unpredictability of new variants introduces significant uncertainty.
