As a professional forecaster, I'll approach this question methodically:

(a) Time left until outcome is known: 25 days (March 7 - April 1, 2025)

(b) Status quo outcome: No visit. President Trump has not announced any plans to visit Mexico, and US-Mexico relations appear strained due to recently imposed tariffs.

(c) Scenario for No outcome: The tariff tensions between the US and Mexico remain unresolved, with both countries maintaining their adversarial stance. The Trump administration continues to delegate border matters to Vice President Vance and other officials rather than engaging in direct presidential diplomacy.

(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: The tariff negotiations mentioned by Commerce Secretary Lutnick lead to a breakthrough agreement, creating a diplomatic climate conducive to a presidential visit. Trump decides a personal visit would strengthen the new agreement and showcase his direct negotiation skills.

## Analysis of Current Situation

The Trump administration implemented 25% tariffs against Canada and Mexico effective March 4, 2025, citing national emergencies at both borders under the International Economic Emergency Powers Act (IEEPA)[1]. These tariffs were originally ordered to go into effect on February 4 but were delayed following agreements by both countries to address fentanyl trafficking[3].

The implementation of these tariffs indicates strained diplomatic relations between the US and Mexico, which would typically make a presidential visit less likely in the immediate term. However, there are signs that the situation may be evolving rapidly.

## Potential for Diplomatic Breakthrough

US Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick indicated on March 4, 2025, that President Trump might announce a compromise with Canada and Mexico as soon as March 5, 2025[1]. According to Lutnick, Canadian and Mexican officials were in active discussions with President Trump, seeking to address US concerns[1].

Vice President JD Vance visited the US-Mexico border on March 5, 2025, accompanied by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard[5]. During this visit, Trump's commerce secretary suggested that a deal to reduce the tariffs was in development and could be announced soon[5].

## Barriers to a Visit

Several factors make a visit within this short timeframe unlikely:

1. The recent implementation of tariffs has created diplomatic tension
2. The short timeframe (25 days) provides limited opportunity to arrange a high-level visit
3. The administration has delegated border issues to Vice President Vance rather than the President directly
4. There is no reporting of any scheduled or planned presidential visit to Mexico

## Historical Precedent

While not mentioned in the search results, presidential visits typically require significant advance planning for security and diplomatic arrangements. Impromptu visits to neighboring countries are rare, especially when relations are strained by tariff disputes.

## Status Quo Considerations

As a forecaster, I recognize that the status quo tends to persist unless there are strong signals of change. In this case, the status quo is that no visit is planned. While there are ongoing negotiations that could potentially lead to improved relations, the timeline is very tight for organizing a presidential visit before April 1.

The most logical sequence would be: tariff negotiations → successful resolution → improved relations → planned visit. Given we're only at the early negotiation stage with just 25 days to go, completing this sequence seems unlikely.

Probability: 15%
