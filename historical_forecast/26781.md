(a) Time left until outcome is known: Approximately 2 months (from current information cutoff on August 1, 2024, to the resolution date of October 1, 2024)

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: William Ruto remains President of Kenya through October 1, 2024

(c) Scenario resulting in a No outcome: Despite ongoing protests, Ruto successfully navigates the political crisis by making cabinet concessions, addressing public concerns about corruption and the economy, and maintaining enough political support to remain in office.

(d) Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome: Protests intensify beyond government control, leading to either Ruto's resignation under overwhelming public pressure, a successful impeachment process, or a military intervention that removes him from power before October 1, 2024.

As a professional forecaster, I need to carefully analyze the available information to determine the likelihood of President William Ruto ceasing to be Kenya's president before October 1, 2024.

## Current Situation Assessment

William Ruto currently remains the official President of Kenya as of the latest information available (August 1, 2024). His presidency has been under significant pressure due to nationwide protests that began over proposed tax hikes but evolved into broader demands for his resignation[5]. The situation has been severe enough that Ruto was reportedly barricaded in his presidential compound during intense protests.

The crisis prompted Ruto to take several significant actions:
- He declined to sign the contentious Finance Bill 2024 that sparked the initial protests[3]
- He dismissed almost his entire cabinet on July 11, 2024
- He later reinstated some cabinet members and appointed opposition figures to his government
- The police chief resigned amid accusations of excessive force against protesters

Despite these concessions, Ruto continues to function as Kenya's president, chairing cabinet meetings and making public statements[4].

## Historical Context and Precedents

Political instability in Kenya has historically been resolved through various mechanisms, including elections, negotiations, and occasionally through extra-constitutional means. However, the bar for removing a sitting president mid-term is typically high. The constitutional mechanisms for removal (impeachment, medical incapacity) require formal processes that have not been initiated as of the information cutoff date.

## Key Factors to Consider

1. **Intensity and sustainability of protests**: While protests have been significant, they would need to maintain or increase their momentum to force a resignation.

2. **Elite/military support**: There is no indication in the available information that Ruto has lost the support of the military or key political elites necessary to remain in power.

3. **International recognition**: Ruto continues to be recognized internationally as Kenya's president, including a state visit to the US in May 2024[2][5].

4. **Cabinet reshuffle as a stabilizing factor**: Ruto's decision to include opposition members in his cabinet could potentially reduce political pressure.

5. **Timeline constraints**: With approximately 2 months remaining until the resolution date, any process to remove Ruto would need to occur relatively quickly.

## Probability Assessment

The status quo strongly favors Ruto remaining in office. While the protests have been significant, Ruto has demonstrated a willingness to make concessions to reduce public pressure. His international standing remains intact, as evidenced by his May 2024 state visit to the US[2][5].

The most plausible path to Ruto's removal would be resignation under overwhelming public pressure or a military intervention, but neither appears imminent based on available information. Formal impeachment procedures would likely take longer than the remaining time until October 1.

Given that the status quo typically has strong inertia in political systems, and considering Ruto's recent attempts to stabilize his government through cabinet reshuffling and policy concessions, I assess that he is more likely than not to remain in office through October 1, 2024.

However, the situation in Kenya remains volatile, with significant unrest that could potentially escalate. The fact that protesters have explicitly called for Ruto's resignation and that deadly force has been used against them indicates a severe crisis that could potentially lead to a change in leadership.

Probability: 75%
