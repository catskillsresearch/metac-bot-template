(a) **Time Left Until Outcome**:  
The resolution criteria will be known on November 5, 2024. As of October 23, 2024, that leaves approximately two weeks until the outcome is determined.

(b) **Status Quo Outcome if Nothing Changed**:  
As of now, there is no widely cited or definitive evidence (per the Wikipedia page or credible reporting) that 50 Cent has formally endorsed Donald Trump for 2024. If there is no new information or development, the status quo outcome is **No**—he does not endorse Trump before Election Day.

(c) **Scenario Resulting in a No Outcome**:  
50 Cent continues to make ambiguous or supportive gestures (such as referencing Trump or discussing political issues) but does not make an explicit public endorsement of Donald Trump for president, nor is he listed on the Wikipedia endorsements page or verified by major media before November 5.

(d) **Scenario Resulting in a Yes Outcome**:  
50 Cent makes a clear, explicit, and public endorsement of Donald Trump for the 2024 presidential election, either in a widely covered public statement, on social media, in an interview, or through verified reporting that is reflected on Wikipedia or by credible news outlets prior to November 5, 2024.

## Rationale

50 Cent’s political endorsements have fluctuated in past cycles: he initially endorsed Trump in 2020, but then quickly walked back that endorsement, eventually supporting Biden instead. In 2024, his public gestures include featuring Trump’s face on his album art after the assassination attempt, which signals sympathy but not a political endorsement[3]. He has discussed Trump and political issues in interviews, indicating ongoing engagement[1]. However, as of late October 2024, there have been no verified reports or Wikipedia updates confirming a formal endorsement.

There is one video from Firstpost (published after November 5)[4] that claims 50 Cent “backs Trump,” but since the criterion is resolution before November 5 and the reporting postdates the deadline, it cannot be used for this forecast.

Given the status quo, historical context, and the absence of any definitive statement or listing as of late October, the weight of evidence and inertia favors a “No” outcome. However, given 50 Cent’s demonstrated unpredictability in the past, a last-minute endorsement cannot be entirely ruled out, although the window is rapidly closing.

## Final Probability Forecast

Probability: 15%  
(The likelihood of 50 Cent issuing a formal, public endorsement of Donald Trump before November 5, 2024, is low, but not zero, given his history of high-profile, late shifts. The most likely outcome is that he does not make a qualifying endorsement before the election.)
