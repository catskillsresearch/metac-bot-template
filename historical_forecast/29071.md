(a) **Time until outcome is known:**  
From October 22, 2024 until December 31, 2024 is approximately 10 weeks (about 70 days).

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changes:**  
As of the latest available data (late October 2024), the recall remains *Active*. If no further action occurs or the recall process is not completed, the default outcome would be **No**—the recall will not be closed before December 31, 2024.

(c) **Scenario for a No outcome:**  
The closure of the recall is delayed due to ongoing identification of distribution points (as evidenced by the expansion in October to Oklahoma)[2][5]. If Pork Dynasty Inc. or the USDA FSIS encounter delays in confirming removal of all affected products, verifying corrective actions, or if further issues are found (such as additional undeclared allergens or compliance problems), the recall could remain open past the deadline.

(d) **Scenario for a Yes outcome:**  
If Pork Dynasty Inc. promptly completes all required steps—removing the affected products from all locations, updating labeling, submitting necessary documentation, and passing FSIS verification—the recall could be closed within weeks. The relatively small scale (469 pounds) and the routine nature of undeclared-allergen recalls support the possibility of a rapid resolution, provided no new issues emerge and all affected product is quickly accounted for[2][5].

## Rationale

Most allergen/misbranding USDA recalls, particularly small ones, resolve within a few months provided the recall scope is well understood and the company acts efficiently. However, this recall was initially announced in late September 2024 and was expanded in October, indicating the scope was not fully known from the start[2][5]. This can signal possible continued complications or incomplete market withdrawal, which would tend to prolong the recall.

There are roughly 10 weeks left for the recall to move from *Active* to *Closed*. As of late October, there is no public indication that all required steps have already been completed. Given that recall expansions often lead to further verification steps and that the FSIS must confirm both product removal and appropriate corrective actions, a conservative approach is warranted.

Historically, similar-size allergen recalls often resolve in 1-3 months if straightforward, but delays are common when additional distribution or compliance gaps are found. Without evidence of unusually prompt progress or public updates suggesting imminent closure, the status quo—recall remaining active—is a nontrivial possibility.

Given the limited affected product, and if no new expansions or complications arise, there is a reasonable path to closure before December 31, 2024. However, because the recall was recently expanded and key closure steps must still be validated by FSIS, the odds must be weighted toward persistence of the current *Active* status, but not overwhelmingly so.

Probability: **60%**  
*(There is a modestly higher-than-even chance the recall remains *Active* as of December 31, 2024, reflecting the status quo bias and recent expansion, but with reasonable probability of timely closure if no further issues arise.)*
