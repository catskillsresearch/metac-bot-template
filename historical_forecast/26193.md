I'll analyze the question about the September 10, 2024 presidential debate as a professional forecaster.

(a) Time left until outcome is known: 56 days (from July 16, 2024 to September 10, 2024)

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: The debate occurs as scheduled on September 10, 2024, hosted by ABC News with both major party nominees participating.

(c) Scenario resulting in No: Following President Biden's poor performance in the first debate, he withdraws from the race or declines to participate in the second debate. Alternatively, there could be a significant event (national emergency, candidate health issue) that forces a cancellation or rescheduling to a different date.

(d) Scenario resulting in Yes: Both candidates maintain their commitment to debate, no major disrupting events occur, and the debate proceeds as scheduled on September 10, 2024.

## Analysis of Current Situation

The second presidential debate between President Biden and former President Trump is officially scheduled for September 10, 2024, to be hosted by ABC News[3]. This arrangement came together after both campaigns agreed to a debate schedule that includes this September event[3]. Both candidates have formally accepted invitations to participate in this debate.

The format includes "World News Tonight" anchor David Muir and ABC News Live Prime anchor Linsey Davis as moderators[3]. This debate represents the second of two planned debates between the presumptive nominees, with the first having already taken place on June 27, 2024, hosted by CNN[1][2].

## Historical Precedent and Status Quo Inertia

Historically, scheduled presidential debates typically proceed as planned unless extraordinary circumstances arise. The institutional momentum behind such events is substantial, with networks, candidates, and the public all having expectations set. Television networks invest significant resources in debate preparation, creating a strong incentive for the event to proceed.

The debate infrastructure is already established, with:
- Formal acceptance from both campaigns
- Named moderators
- A hosting network committed to the event
- A specific date and time

## Risk Factors for Cancellation

Despite the established plans, several factors could potentially derail the September 10 debate:

**Biden's First Debate Performance**: The search results mention that the first debate was "widely considered a debacle for Biden." This poor performance could potentially lead to strategic reconsideration by Biden's campaign about participating in a second debate.

**Candidate Substitution**: If either party were to replace their presumptive nominee before their convention, this could disrupt debate plans. However, this would be unprecedented in modern presidential politics.

**External Events**: Unforeseen national emergencies, health crises affecting candidates, or other major disruptions could force rescheduling.

**Strategic Withdrawal**: Either campaign might decide that participating in the debate doesn't serve their electoral strategy, though this would carry significant political costs.

## Probability Assessment

Given the information available, I must weigh several factors:

1. The debate is formally scheduled with commitments from both sides[3].
2. Both candidates have already participated in one debate together[1][2].
3. There's significant institutional and public expectation for the debate to occur.
4. The debate is still approximately two months away, allowing time for circumstances to change.
5. Biden's poor performance in the first debate creates some uncertainty about whether his campaign will maintain the commitment.

While the status quo strongly favors the debate occurring as scheduled, the significant time remaining until September 10th and the potential strategic reconsiderations following the first debate introduce meaningful uncertainty.

Probability: 75%
