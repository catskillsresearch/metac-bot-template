(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
There are 29 days until September 4, 2024. The definitive outcome will be known on or just after that date.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
If nothing changes, there will NOT be a formal, live debate between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump on September 4, 2024. Harris’s campaign has explicitly declined to agree to that debate, and there is no mutual confirmation or official announcement from Fox News or either campaign that such a debate will occur[2][3].

(c) **Scenario that results in a No outcome:**  
Harris continues to reject Trump’s proposed September 4 Fox News debate, and no mutual agreement or official announcement materializes. On September 4, 2024, no formal, live debate between Harris and Trump takes place[1][2][3].

(d) **Scenario that results in a Yes outcome:**  
Within the next month, the Harris campaign agrees to Trump’s proposed September 4 Fox News debate, and both campaigns, along with Fox News, officially announce a structured, live, moderated presidential debate between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump for that date. Both candidates participate live as required.

## Rationale

All public statements as of August 6, 2024, indicate that only Trump has agreed to a September 4 Fox News debate, while Harris and her campaign have explicitly declined. Harris has reaffirmed her commitment to the September 10 ABC News debate—the only date and format she has publicly accepted[2][3]. There is no official announcement or mutual agreement confirming a September 4 debate[1][2].

Historically, presidential debates have only occurred when both campaigns reach consensus on the date, network, and format, which is subsequently formalized and announced. Unilateral proposals have not led to debates without the opposing candidate’s acceptance and official scheduling. At present, all relevant evidence and historical precedent strongly favor the status quo: **there will not be a formal, live Harris-Trump debate on September 4, 2024**[1][2][3].

It is possible, though unlikely given the current dynamics, that Harris and her campaign could reverse course, reach an agreement with Trump, and arrange a September 4 debate on Fox News. However, such a reversal would require rapid negotiation and announcement in the coming weeks, with no indications this is forthcoming.

Given the time left, the clear public positions of the campaigns, and the absence of any mutual or official confirmation, the probability of such a debate occurring on September 4 is very low.

**Probability: 5%**
