(a) Time left until outcome: About 7 months and 25 days (from May 6, 2025 to January 1, 2025 - note this is in the past from our current date)

(b) Status quo outcome: If nothing changed from the most recent data available, the difference between Elon Musk's net worth and the next richest person would be less than $70 billion, resulting in a "No" outcome.

(c) Scenario for No outcome: Tesla stock experiences moderate fluctuations but doesn't dramatically outperform the market, while Amazon or LVMH performs reasonably well, keeping the gap between Musk and the second-richest person below $70 billion or above $100 billion.

(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: Tesla stock surges significantly in late 2024 due to strong earnings or new product announcements, while Amazon or LVMH stock simultaneously experiences a moderate decline, creating a gap between $70-100 billion between Musk and the next richest person.

Based on the available information, I need to assess the likelihood of Elon Musk's net worth differing from the next richest person by $70-100 billion on January 1, 2025.

According to the search results, Elon Musk's net worth has shown significant variability over recent years. As of March 2025, his net worth was estimated at $345 billion by Forbes[1]. In January 2024, his net worth was estimated at $251.3 billion[2], and more recently, his net worth reached the $300 billion mark[3].

The net worth of billionaires, particularly Musk, is heavily dependent on the stock performance of their largest holdings. For Musk, about two-thirds of his fortune is tied to Tesla[2]. His net worth peaked at $320 billion in November 2021 but has experienced significant fluctuations since then[2].

Looking at historical patterns, Musk's wealth has been highly volatile. He lost his position as the world's richest person in December 2022 due to a drop in Tesla's share price, only to regain it in June 2023[2]. These fluctuations demonstrate that substantial changes in wealth rankings can occur within relatively short timeframes.

To reach the specified gap of $70-100 billion between Musk and the second-richest person, either Musk's wealth would need to increase significantly while others remain stable, or their wealth would need to decrease while his remains stable, or some combination of both.

Given that the data from early 2024 showed Musk with a net worth of $251.3 billion and that by March 2025 it had increased to $345 billion[1][2], there is evidence of substantial growth in his net worth. However, without knowing the net worth of the second-richest person at those times, it's difficult to determine if the gap fell within the $70-100 billion range.

The question also requires that we consider the status quo and recognize that the world typically changes slowly. While Musk's wealth has shown the potential for rapid increases, the specific requirement of a $70-100 billion gap (not less, not more) makes this a relatively narrow target.

Considering the volatility of stock markets, the significant portion of Musk's wealth tied to Tesla, and the historical fluctuations in billionaire rankings, there is a meaningful chance that the gap could fall within the specified range. However, the narrow window and the unpredictability of stock performance make it more likely that the gap will fall outside this range.

Probability: 30%
