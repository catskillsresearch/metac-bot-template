(a) Time left until outcome: About 36 days (from August 26, 2024 until October 1, 2024)

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: No confirmed Clade I mpox infections in Russia

(c) Scenario resulting in No outcome: Russia maintains limited testing and surveillance for mpox, focusing on other public health priorities. Officials continue to downplay the risk based on "traditional values" rhetoric. Limited international travel from affected regions combined with Russia's relative isolation prevents Clade I from reaching or being detected within Russian borders before October 1.

(d) Scenario resulting in Yes outcome: The rapid spread of Clade I mpox continues beyond Sweden into more European countries, eventually reaching Russia through international travelers. Despite official rhetoric, Russian health authorities detect and confirm at least one case through routine surveillance or targeted testing of symptomatic individuals, possibly in a major city with international connections.

As a professional forecaster, I need to evaluate the likelihood that Russia will confirm a Clade I mpox infection before October 1, 2024. This requires analyzing the current situation, transmission patterns, and Russia's public health response.

## Current Mpox Situation

Russia has reported only three monkeypox cases in total "over the entire past period" according to officials[1]. These cases likely belong to Clade II, which has been circulating globally since 2022. The current concern is about Clade I (particularly subclade Ib), which is considered more severe and has recently spread beyond Africa.

On August 15, 2024, Sweden confirmed the first case of mpox Clade I outside the African continent[3][4]. This represents a significant development in the global spread of this virus strain. European health authorities are now working to contain this more severe strain[4], but the detection in Sweden demonstrates that international spread has already occurred.

## Russia's Official Position

Russia's stance on mpox is notably dismissive. On August 19, 2024, Anna Popova, head of Russia's consumer protection watchdog Rospotrebnadzor, stated there is "no risk of mpox spreading in Russia" due to the country's "traditional values"[5]. She specifically referenced the mode of transmission, implying that since the disease has disproportionately affected men who have sex with men, Russia's conservative social policies would prevent similar spread[5].

This dismissive attitude suggests that Russia may not be implementing robust surveillance or prevention measures specifically for mpox, which could decrease the likelihood of detecting cases even if they do occur.

## Key Factors to Consider

Several factors affect the probability of Russia confirming Clade I mpox before October 1:

**Time Frame**: With only 36 days remaining until October 1, this is a relatively short window for international spread, infection, symptom development, testing, and confirmation.

**Status Quo Bias**: The default position should be that Russia will not detect Clade I mpox in this timeframe, given the recency of international spread (first case outside Africa detected just 11 days ago) and Russia's limited reporting of mpox cases to date.

**Global Spread Patterns**: The WHO reported 934 new laboratory-confirmed mpox cases globally in June 2024[2], with continuing transmission across multiple regions. However, Clade I has only recently been detected outside Africa.

**Russia's Surveillance Capacity**: Russia's dismissive official stance might translate to limited testing and surveillance, reducing the probability of detecting cases even if present.

**International Connections**: Russia maintains international travel connections, including with European countries, creating potential transmission pathways. However, Russia's relative international isolation compared to pre-2022 might reduce this risk.

## Probability Assessment

Given these factors, I need to assign a probability that balances the status quo (no confirmed cases) with the realistic possibility of spread:

- The very recent detection of Clade I in Europe (Sweden) means international spread has just begun
- Russia's official dismissal of mpox risk suggests limited surveillance
- The short timeframe (36 days) provides limited opportunity for spread, detection, and confirmation
- Russia has reported only three mpox cases total historically, indicating either limited spread or limited detection
- The status quo strongly favors a "No" outcome

While it's possible that Clade I mpox could reach and be detected in Russia before October 1, the combination of the short timeframe, Russia's limited historical case detection, and the very recent international spread beyond Africa makes this relatively unlikely.

Probability: 15%
