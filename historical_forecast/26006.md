(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
The outcome will be known on July 17, 2024, when Metaculus checks FiveThirtyEight’s national polling average for the value on July 15. As of July 9, there are 6 days remaining until July 15.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
On July 5, 2024, Trump led Biden by +2.4 percentage points in the FiveThirtyEight national polling average[1]. If the trend holds and there are no major changes, Trump’s lead on July 15 would likely fall within the 2 to 4 point range specified in the question.

(c) **Scenario for a No outcome:**  
- **Trump’s lead is below 2:** This could occur if Biden quickly recovers in national polling, perhaps due to effective post-debate damage control, successful media appearances, or a major misstep by Trump.
- **Trump’s lead is above 4:** If the post-debate momentum against Biden intensifies, if prominent Democrats increase pressure for him to step aside, or new negative stories emerge, the polling shift could accelerate and Trump’s lead could surpass 4 points by July 15.

(d) **Scenario for a Yes outcome:**  
Trump’s lead stabilizes, with no major new events shifting momentum further. The media cycle and party discussion continue at their current intensity, keeping the race in roughly its present configuration. Polling averages reflect only modest day-to-day movements, resulting in a Trump lead that sits between 2 and 4 points on July 15.

**Rationale:**

Good forecasters emphasize the inertia of polling trends, especially absent new disruptive events. Post-debate, Trump’s lead increased by more than 2 points in about a week (from +0.2 to +2.4)[1], but polling responses to shocks like debates often see an initial spike followed by a leveling off. As the immediate reaction subsides, further dramatic increases become less likely unless reinforced by new information or developments.

Biden’s team is actively working to stabilize perceptions and minimize further slippage, but the short timeframe (one week) limits the potential for dramatic recovery. Unless Biden’s campaign produces an especially effective intervention or new, negative Biden stories emerge, it is likely that Trump’s lead will not accelerate at the same pace as it did in the first week post-debate.

The FiveThirtyEight average aggregates a wide set of polls and typically moves gradually after a major event, not continuously at the same rate. Therefore, with Trump’s lead at +2.4 on July 5, a modest further increase would still keep him within the 2 to 4 point range by July 15, assuming typical polling lag and the reversion effects observed in past cycles[1][5].

However, there is some risk that negative headlines for Biden continue to pile up, or if more prominent Democrats call for him to withdraw, that could further damage his standing and push Trump’s lead above the 4-point mark. Conversely, a strong Biden counter-campaign or a Trump controversy could close the gap.

Given the current trajectory, the status quo—the most likely scenario—is that Trump’s lead on July 15 will land between 2 and 4 points, but the risk of overshooting above 4 is non-trivial if negative feedback loops continue.

**Probability: 65%**
