(a) **Time until outcome is known:**  
The 2024 Speed Chess Championship is scheduled for September 6–8, 2024. Today is August 30, 2024, leaving about one week until the official outcome is determined.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changes:**  
Magnus Carlsen is already listed as the 2024 Speed Chess Championship winner by credible sources such as Chess.com, which reports that he defeated Tuan Minh Le, Arjun Erigaisi, Hans Niemann, and Alireza Firouzja by a combined score of 73.5–32.5, including a record-setting 23.5–7.5 over Firouzja. This indicates that, as of now, the status quo is that Carlsen has won[2].

(c) **Scenario for a No outcome:**  
A "No" outcome would occur if new authoritative information emerges showing that the September 2024 Speed Chess Championship either did not conclude with Carlsen as champion (for example, if the event is canceled, postponed beyond October 1, 2024, or if Carlsen’s results are overturned), or if it is somehow established that the reported results are for a different event.

(d) **Scenario for a Yes outcome:**  
A "Yes" outcome results if the event takes place as scheduled and Magnus Carlsen is confirmed the winner according to the official Chess.com results or other credible sources. As of now, all available sources report that Carlsen has already won the 2024 Speed Chess Championship[2].

## Rationale

Magnus Carlsen is the top-rated chess player in the world and has demonstrated continued dominance in both rapid and blitz chess throughout 2024, with numerous tournament victories[2][3][4]. Official records at Chess.com clearly state Carlsen earned his second straight Speed Chess Championship in September 2024 by defeating a field that included all other current finalists (Niemann, Firouzja, and likely Nakamura), with specific match scores also reported[2].

There are currently no reports of this event being canceled, postponed, or Carlsen's results being overturned. All authoritative sources indicate Carlsen has already won, matching the expected format, opponents, and schedule of the 2024 Speed Chess Championship[2]. The only conceivable way the outcome would change is a highly unlikely scenario of a major reporting error or unforeseen disruption to the event’s official status before October 1, 2024. Given the strong status quo and lack of evidence for uncertainty, the best forecast heavily favors a "Yes" resolution.
