(a) **Time left until the outcome is known**: Approximately 47 days until December 31, 2024.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed**: As of early November, Kalshi was at the top of the finance app category on the Apple App Store, while the Wells Fargo Mobile App was ranked lower. However, given that Kalshi's success is event-driven and tied to election betting, it's uncertain whether it can maintain this position.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome**: If the interest in Kalshi declines significantly after the U.S. presidential election, the app may not sustain its current high rankings. This could happen if users lose interest in other available betting markets or if the company fails to introduce new compelling event-driven markets that maintain user engagement. Meanwhile, the Wells Fargo app, with its stable user base, could potentially maintain or improve its ranking relative to Kalshi.

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome**: If Kalshi successfully retains user interest beyond the election through innovative new betting markets, increased marketing efforts, or by leveraging its recent growth momentum, it might continue to outrank the Wells Fargo Mobile App. Additionally, if the interest in prediction markets remains strong and Kalshi introduces other attractive features or events, it could maintain a high level of engagement and remain atop the rankings.

Given these considerations and the emphasis that good forecasters place on the status quo outcome, it seems likely that Kalshi will face challenges sustaining its current position without a new event-driven catalyst. However, recent trends suggest that Kalshi does have potential for sustained success with the right strategies.
