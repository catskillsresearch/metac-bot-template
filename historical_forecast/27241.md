(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
As of August 16, 2024, there are just over four weeks until September 18, 2024, when Keir Starmer’s approval rating will be assessed for this forecast.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
Polling from major sources such as YouGov and Ipsos shows Starmer’s approval/favourability rating peaked around 44% immediately post-election and quickly returned to pre-election levels of 36–40% by early August[1][2][5]. There is no evidence of his approval rating ever approaching 60% since becoming Prime Minister. If current trends persist, the outcome will almost certainly be **Yes**—his approval rating will be less than 60.

(c) **Scenario for a No outcome (approval hits 60 or above):**  
A “No” outcome would require Starmer’s approval to surge by at least 20 percentage points in a single month. This could theoretically happen if his government achieved a widely praised and visible breakthrough—such as a major economic rebound, successful resolution of a crisis, or a unifying national event that dramatically improved public sentiment. Such rapid, large jumps in UK PM approval ratings are extremely rare outside periods of war or major national unity (e.g., Tony Blair’s post-election honeymoon in 1997, which saw approval hit 65%, but there is no evidence Starmer’s “honeymoon” is comparable[2]).

(d) **Scenario for a Yes outcome (approval remains below 60):**
Starmer’s rating continues its current trajectory, hovering in the high 30s to low 40s, reflecting public skepticism and the fragmented, low-turnout political climate. Unless there is a substantial, positive shock, the fractured electorate and presence of strong opposition parties make it highly unlikely for approval to sharply increase[1][2][5].

## Rationale

- Starmer’s early “honeymoon” bounce faded rapidly, and his approval/favourability has already returned to the mid-high 30s by August, with no sign of momentum towards 60%[1][2][5].
- The post-election environment is characterized by low turnout, a fractured nation, and considerable anti-establishment sentiment, all diminishing the likelihood of a dramatic, sustained approval rally[1][2].
- The threshold (60%) is historically high for UK PM approval ratings outside extraordinary, unifying circumstances. Starmer’s own peak thus far (44%) is well short, and there’s no sign of change.
- No major polling organization has found Starmer’s approval near 60% since he took office—current major pollsters show 36–44%[1][2][5].
- The status quo is extremely sticky: British public opinion moves slowly, especially in the absence of a clear national crisis or singular event that could boost approval.

## Final Assessment

**Probability: 98%**

Keir Starmer’s approval rating as Prime Minister, as reported by the Politico Poll of Polls “Smooth” version on September 18, 2024, will be less than 60. The probability of a sudden, massive positive shift is exceedingly low given the available data and recent historical trends[1][2][5].
