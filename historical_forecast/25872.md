I'll analyze the likelihood of seeing 4 or more goals in the Euro 2024 semi-final matches.

(a) Time until outcome: The outcome will be known after the second semi-final concludes on July 10, 2024. From today's date (May 6, 2025), this is a past event, but I'll analyze based on the information available as of July 8, 2024.

(b) Status quo outcome: Based on the Euro 2020 and 2016 tournaments, both had exactly 4 goals scored across the two semi-finals. This suggests that 4 goals is a common benchmark, making the answer to "4 or more" a Yes.

(c) Scenario for No outcome (fewer than 4 goals): France employs their strong defensive approach against Spain, resulting in a low-scoring 0-0 or 1-0 match. The Netherlands-England match also becomes a tactical, cautious affair with both teams afraid to commit forward, ending in a 1-0 or 1-1 scoreline. Total: 2-3 goals.

(d) Scenario for Yes outcome (4 or more goals): Spain continues their prolific scoring form against France, winning 2-1 or 3-1. The Netherlands-England match features at least one team taking risks, especially if trailing late, resulting in a 2-1 or 2-2 scoreline. Total: 5-7 goals.

## Analysis of Goal-Scoring Potential

The semi-final matchups are set with Spain facing France on July 9 in Munich, and Netherlands taking on England on July 10 in Dortmund[1][2]. Both matches kick off at 21:00 CEST (20:00 UK, 15:00 ET).

### Historical Patterns

Recent European Championship semi-finals have consistently produced around 4 goals total:
- Euro 2020: 4 goals (1-1, 2-1)
- Euro 2016: 4 goals (2-0, 2-0)

Going back further shows more variation:
- Euro 2012: 7 goals (4-2, 2-1)
- Euro 2008: 7 goals (3-0, 3-1)

This suggests that while 4 goals is common, there's historical precedent for significantly higher totals in these high-stakes matches.

### Team-Specific Analysis

**Spain vs France**:
Spain has been the tournament's most prolific attacking team, scoring 4 against Georgia and 2 against Germany in knockout rounds. Their offensive prowess makes them likely to score at least once, even against France's strong defense.

France has been defensively solid but less effective in attack, with a 0-0 draw against Portugal (winning on penalties) and a 1-0 win over Belgium. This suggests they may focus on containment rather than attacking football.

**Netherlands vs England**:
Both teams have shown mixed scoring records in the tournament. England has often been involved in tighter, lower-scoring matches while the Netherlands has demonstrated more attacking intent in some games. The tactical approach of both sides will be crucial in determining the goal count.

### Contextual Factors

Semi-finals traditionally see more cautious play than earlier rounds due to the high stakes. Teams are often more concerned with avoiding mistakes than taking risks, which can suppress goal scoring.

However, with attacking talent like Spain's in the mix, and the need to score if a team falls behind, we could see goals forced by necessity, especially late in matches.

## Probabilistic Assessment

Given the historical patterns and the specific dynamics of the teams involved:

- There's a strong likelihood of reaching at least 4 goals based on the last two tournaments both having exactly 4 goals.
- Spain's attacking form suggests they could contribute significantly to the goal tally.
- France's defensive approach could limit scoring in their match.
- The England-Netherlands match has potential for goals depending on how cautious the teams decide to be.

Weighing these factors, and giving extra weight to the status quo of recent tournaments, I assess that there's a moderately high probability of seeing 4 or more goals across the two semi-finals.

Probability: 65%
