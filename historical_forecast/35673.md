(a) **Time until the outcome is known:**  
The second-to-last episode of Severance season 2 (episode 9) is scheduled to air on March 14, 2025. Today is May 6, 2025, so the episode has already aired and the IMDb rating should be available[2]. However, since the original forecaster's framework referred to ratings as of or after March 18, 2025, we are within the window where ratings are being finalized.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
Historically, Severance episodes are rated between 8.0 and 9.5 on IMDb, with most episodes in season 1 and 2 receiving ratings above 8.0[2]. Notably, season 1’s penultimate and finale episodes both drew especially high ratings, with the season 1 finale reaching 9.7[2]. For season 2 so far, episodes have clustered around 8.0–9.2, with significant spikes for climactic episodes (such as 9.2 for episode 7, and 9.5 for the finale)[2]. Both user lists and aggregate season ratings suggest season 2 is seen as consistent with or just slightly below season 1, with a typical episode receiving around 8.5 to 9.0[3][5]. The status quo, if current trends hold, would put episode 9’s rating just above 9.0.

(c) **Scenario for an unexpected outcome:**  
- *Lower-than-expected rating (<7.5 or 7.5–8.5):* This could occur if episode 9 diverged sharply from the established narrative in a way that disappointed or alienated the fanbase—for example, introducing an unpopular plot twist, technical issues, or pacing problems that disrupted the buildup to the finale.
- *Unusually high rating (above 9.5):* If episode 9 delivered an especially shocking twist, an emotionally powerful narrative, or resolved major series mysteries in a way that exceeded already-high fan expectations, it could receive a surge of positive ratings, nudging it above the 9.5 threshold. However, such ratings are typically reserved for finales or landmark television events[2].

## Rationale

- **Historical episode ratings:** Season 1’s penultimate episode received 8.9, and the finale 9.7[2]. Season 2’s recent episodes trend high, with the penultimate episode of season 2 (episode 9) very likely to serve a climactic, tension-building role.
- **Recent season 2 pattern:** Most episodes score 8.0–8.5, with spikes for standout or important plot episodes (one at 9.2, another at 9.5)[2][5]. Season 2’s general reception has not significantly declined, confirmed by consistent 8.5–9.0 ratings in episode-level reviews and season aggregates[3][5].
- **Audience anticipation and show momentum:** Penultimate episodes often get a rating bump compared to filler or mid-season chapters, as they build towards the finale and resolve important arcs.
- **Room for variance:** While unexpected developments in the plot or production could influence ratings, there is little sign of controversy or a dip in quality this season.

Given these considerations, the most probable band is “>8.5 and <9.0” or “≥9.0 and ≤9.5”, with some chance allotted to the next lower band, and slim odds for extreme outcomes.
