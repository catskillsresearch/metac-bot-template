(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
As of the last information cutoff (April 21, 2025), there were 9 days remaining before April 30, 2025. However, today is May 6, 2025, so the outcome is now in the past and would be known at this point.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
The state of emergency (SOE) was officially declared for the island of Upolu on March 31, 2025, set for 30 days and scheduled to expire on April 29, 2025[1][3][4]. As of April 21, 2025, there were no credible reports or government announcements indicating an extension of the SOE beyond this date[1][3]. Therefore, under the status quo, there *would not* be a state of emergency in effect on April 30, 2025.

(c) **Scenario that results in a No outcome:**  
No new Proclamation of Emergency is issued, and the SOE declared on March 31, 2025, expires as scheduled on April 29, 2025. No extensions or additional orders are announced by the Samoan government. As a result, Samoa is not under an SOE on April 30, 2025[1][3][4].

(d) **Scenario that results in a Yes outcome:**  
The government of Samoa, either due to ongoing electricity issues, new power infrastructure setbacks, or continued humanitarian/economic impact, officially extends the current SOE or declares a new SOE before or on April 30, 2025. This would be communicated through official channels or credible news sources, resulting in a state of emergency being in effect on April 30, 2025.

## Rationale

The most reliable information up to April 21, 2025, points toward the SOE expiring on April 29, 2025, with no public indication of an extension or plans for a new emergency declaration[1][3]. Temporary generators were expected to arrive before the end of April, which suggests government confidence in their short-term solution for the power crisis[1]. Official statements implied an intention to restore stability and end emergency measures as soon as possible[1][2][4]. 

From a forecasting perspective, the *status quo bias* applies: absent strong indications of a change, the best prediction is that the currently scheduled expiration will hold. However, the situation's fluidity means there is always uncertaintyâ€”a last-minute extension could have been issued if problems persisted or solutions failed.

Given there were no signs of such an extension as of the last credible reporting, and the SOE was limited in scope and duration, the probability that an SOE was in effect on April 30, 2025, is low, though not strictly zero.
