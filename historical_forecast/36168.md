(a) **Time until outcome is known:**  
The March 2025 arrival data from the UNHCR Mediterranean Refugees/Migrants Data Portal is typically published in the first week of April 2025. Given today is May 6, 2025, the data should already be available, but as of March 19, 2025 (the scenario date), about two to three weeks remained until official figures would be published[1].

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changes:**  
In Januaryâ€“February 2025, there were a total of nearly 25,000 irregular border crossings into the EU, averaging about 12,500 per month[1][5]. The Central Mediterranean route continues to see higher arrivals, while other routes are experiencing declines. March arrivals typically increase with spring weather, but the policy environment remains restrictive. If current patterns persist without major shocks, the likely number of Mediterranean arrivals (sea and land) for March 2025 would be in the **12,000 to 14,000** range[1][5].

(c) **Scenario leading to an unexpected outcome:**  
Unexpected outcomes could arise if, for example:

- A sudden escalation of conflict (such as renewed violence in Syria or Libya) triggers a mass movement of refugees, significantly boosting arrivals beyond expectations.
- Severe weather or intensified enforcement temporarily blocks crossings, resulting in an abrupt drop (below 10,000) for the month.
- A major policy agreement or intervention on key routes abruptly reduces flows, or, conversely, a sudden border opening elsewhere diverts or increases flows unpredictably.

**Rationale:**  
Historical trends indicate that most months cluster around gradual shifts, with the status quo persisting due to the inertia of policy, weather, and structural factors. Forecasters give the highest probability to the continuation of current levels, with moderate upgrades for seasonal increases in spring. However, migration is highly sensitive to geopolitical events, enforcement variations, and weather, so a non-trivial probability must be assigned to both higher and lower outlier outcomes, reflecting the inherent uncertainty.
