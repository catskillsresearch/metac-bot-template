(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
About 3-4 weeks. The youth unemployment rate for November 2024 is expected to be released by China’s National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) and reported by Trading Economics in mid-December 2024.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
The most recent official figure for China’s youth unemployment rate (16-24, excluding students) is 17.6% in September 2024[3]. If the rate did not change from September through November, it would remain above 17.0%, resulting in a "No" outcome.

(c) **Scenario for a No outcome:**  
The unemployment rate remains stable or decreases only marginally—falling by less than 0.6 percentage points by November from September’s 17.6%. Economic headwinds such as weak domestic demand, business caution, and slow recovery in private sector hiring persist. No extraordinary stimulus is implemented, and seasonal effects do not substantially boost youth employment. The rate for November is above 17.0%.

(d) **Scenario for a Yes outcome:**  
The downward trend observed from August (18.8%) to September (17.6%)—a decrease of 1.2 percentage points in one month—continues, even if at a somewhat slower pace. Government interventions, seasonal hiring, or renewed economic momentum drive further improvements, bringing the youth unemployment rate to 17.0% or lower by November[3][4].

## Rationale

China’s youth unemployment rate rose sharply in mid-2024, peaking at 18.8% in August under the new calculation method (excluding students). September data shows a notable decrease to 17.6%, a 1.2 percentage point drop in one month[3]. If this rapid pace of improvement continued, the rate could dip below 17.0% by November.

However, the status quo is sticky. Historically, China’s youth unemployment rate tends to move gradually, except when calculation methods shift or exceptional policy interventions occur. After the methodology changed in December 2023, volatility increased, but absent persistent monthly shocks, such rapid improvement is rare—especially as youth unemployment remains "relatively high" and the country faces ongoing structural and macroeconomic challenges: weak domestic demand, a sluggish property sector, an aging workforce, and declining business confidence[4][5].

While the September drop is encouraging, it could partially reflect seasonal patterns, government data smoothing, or efforts to encourage hiring around graduation season. As the year-end approaches, such favorable seasonal effects may fade, and structural drag could resume dominance.

**Good forecasting practice weights the latest actual result most heavily unless there is clear evidence that the recent trend will persist.** Given the September rate is 17.6%, to reach 17.0% in two months would require further, sustained and significant improvement, which is plausible but not the base case.

## Probability Estimate

- The rate could fall below or reach 17.0% if the September–October pace continues, or government interventions take stronger effect.
- However, the default is inertia around the current level, with modest month-to-month change, and persistent headwinds likely slowing the rapid recent improvement.

**Probability: 40%**  
(The evidence slightly favors a rate above 17.0% in November 2024, given recent history and underlying economic challenges, but there is a meaningful chance that targeted measures or continued momentum could bring the rate down to or below 17.0%.)
