(a) Time until outcome is known: Approximately 5 months (from May 6, 2025 to October 1, 2024)
(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: No
(c) Scenario for No outcome: Apple follows their current trajectory of adopting USB-C for iPhone 16 models to comply with EU regulations, without announcing any portless models before October 1, 2024.
(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: Apple makes a surprise announcement of an iPhone 16 "Ultra" with a completely portless design as their premium offering before October 1, 2024.

Based on the available information and considering my role as a professional forecaster, I need to analyze the likelihood of Apple announcing a portless iPhone before October 1, 2024.

First, it's important to note that the question asks about an announcement before October 1, 2024, not actual product availability. However, based on the search results and current information, there are several compelling reasons to believe this is unlikely to happen.

## Historical Context and Current Trajectory

Apple has indeed been moving toward USB-C adoption rather than going portless. According to reliable sources, Apple has been internally testing and planning to switch iPhones from Lightning to USB-C[1]. This transition was prompted by EU regulations requiring a common charging port (USB-C) for all mobile devices by December 27, 2024[2].

While Apple could technically avoid this requirement by creating a completely portless iPhone (as devices that only charge wirelessly are exempt from the EU's rules)[2], the evidence suggests they are taking a more measured approach:

1. Apple has already begun transitioning to USB-C with their iPad lineup[5]
2. Reliable analyst Ming-Chi Kuo indicated Apple would adopt USB-C for iPhones in 2023 (iPhone 15)[1][5]
3. The EU deadline for USB-C adoption is December 27, 2024, meaning Apple technically could retain Lightning for the iPhone 16 (2024) but would need to make changes for the iPhone 17 (2025)[2][4]

## Technical and Market Considerations

There are significant technical and market challenges to going completely portless:

1. Data transfer speeds would be limited compared to wired connections
2. Emergency recovery options would be more limited without physical ports
3. Consumer acceptance of a major change may require more preparation

Apple has historically been cautious with major design changes, often implementing them gradually. The removal of the headphone jack, for example, happened years before other manufacturers followed suit, but even that was a gradual transition.

## Timing and Announcement Patterns

Apple typically announces new iPhones in September. With the October 1, 2024 resolution date, this gives Apple essentially one announcement cycle. Based on current information, the iPhone 16 lineup is expected to continue with USB-C ports[4]. There have been no credible leaks or supply chain evidence suggesting imminent production of portless models.

## Weighing the Status Quo

As a forecaster, I must give significant weight to the status quo. The most likely outcome is that Apple continues on its current path of USB-C adoption for the immediate future, with portless options potentially coming later. While Apple has surprised the market before, making such a significant design change without substantial supply chain leaks would be unusual given Apple's scale of production.

The most likely scenario is that Apple will announce the iPhone 16 lineup in September 2024 with USB-C ports across all models, in compliance with upcoming EU regulations, and may introduce a portless iPhone in a future generation (iPhone 17 or later).

Probability: 15%
