(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  
The outcome will be determined by Metaculus Admins on or after March 22, 2025, for the Bloomberg Billionaires Index as it appeared on March 20, 2025. Today is May 6, 2025, so the outcome should now be knowable, though at the time of this forecast (relative to February 26, 2025), there were just under a month left.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
As of late December 2025, the 250th-ranked person (the "median" billionaire by this question's definition) was Scott Duncan of the United States[1]. U.S. billionaires have a long-standing dominance at both the top and median positions of the Bloomberg Billionaires Index[2][3]. If current trends and rankings remained stable, the 250th-ranked individual on March 20, 2025, would remain a U.S. citizen.

(c) **Brief description of a scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
A "No" outcome would occur if, by March 20, 2025, a non-U.S. billionaire overtook the 250th spot. This could result from:
- Significant asset price declines uniquely affecting U.S. billionaires (e.g., a sharp U.S. market correction disproportionately impacting holdings of those near the median rank).
- A surge in wealth or asset values in another country (e.g., a dramatic increase in Chinese or European billionaire fortunes).
- Corporate actions, regulatory changes, or exogenous shocks highly unfavorable to a cluster of U.S. billionaires just above the 250th rank.

(d) **Brief description of a scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
A "Yes" outcome occurs if, on March 20, 2025, the 250th-ranked billionaire is still a U.S. citizen. This is the default expectation based on:
- Persistent and broad-based growth in U.S. billionaire wealth, especially driven by the ongoing strength in the technology sector and U.S. equity markets[2][3].
- No major market or regulatory disruptions affecting U.S. billionaires' global standing.
- The consistent pattern where more than half the individuals at or near the index median have historically been from the United States.

## Rationale

The United States has dominated global billionaire rankings for years, and the status quo shows no signs of immediate change[1][2][3]. Market and wealth growth trends in 2024â€“2025 continued to favor American billionaires, particularly in technology, which has contributed to their resilience and dominance on the Bloomberg list[2][3]. Barring highly unusual financial upheaval or specific events rapidly elevating non-U.S. fortunes, it is highly probable the 250th-ranked billionaire on March 20, 2025, will be American.

## Final Answer

Probability: 90%
