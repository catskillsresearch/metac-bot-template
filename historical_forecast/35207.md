(a) **Time left until resolution:**  
Approximately 1.5 months remain until April 1, 2025. The key outcome will be determined by whether Weedmaps lists any recreational dispensaries in New Hampshire on or after that date.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changes:**  
Recreational marijuana is not legal in New Hampshire, and there are currently no recreational dispensaries, only medical marijuana dispensaries[1][3][4]. No laws enabling recreational dispensaries have been enacted as of February 21, 2025[1][3][4]. Thus, the status quo outcome is "No."

(c) **Scenario for a No outcome:**  
No new legalization bill passes or is implemented, and no recreational dispensaries are licensed and open by April 1, 2025. Weedmaps continues to list only medical dispensaries in the state, which do not satisfy the resolution criteria[1][4]. This scenario matches the legislative reality and regulatory timeline as of the current date.

(d) **Scenario for a Yes outcome:**  
A successful legislative push unexpectedly legalizes both recreational possession and the licensing of retail dispensaries in rapid succession. State regulators enact rules, award licenses, and at least one recreational dispensary opens and is listed on Weedmaps before April 1, 2025. Given the lack of enabling law and slow pace of regulatory action, this scenario requires multiple improbable events in a short timeframe[1][3][4].

## Rationale

The legislative history in New Hampshire shows repeated failures to legalize recreational marijuana sales, despite some progress in 2024 and strong public support[1][2][3][4][5]. The most significant recent bill (HB 1633) was ultimately killed in the House in June 2024[1][4]. While new bills are again under discussion for 2025, none has become law or set up a regulated retail system as of February 21, 2025[3][4][5]. 

Governor Kelly Ayotte has reiterated opposition to adult-use cannabis and would likely veto any legalization measure, with a veto override considered a "long shot" due to GOP control[3]. Even if a bill were passed and signed immediately, establishing a regulatory framework, issuing licenses, and opening dispensaries in less than six weeks would be highly implausible.

As of the current date, Weedmaps lists only medical dispensaries, which do not count for resolution[1]. There is no indication of any imminent recreational dispensary openings.

**Status quo is strongly favored in this short timeframe.**

Probability: **2%**
