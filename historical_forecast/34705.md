(a) **Time Remaining Until Resolution**  
The forecast must cover the period up to April 1, 2025. As of today (May 6, 2025), this date has already passed. However, for the purposes of this exercise, assuming a forecast is being made as of a hypothetical earlier date (e.g., February 8, 2025), there would be less than two months until resolution.

(b) **Status Quo Outcome If Nothing Changes**  
The United States has not accused China of invading Taiwan with ground forces. The current state is one of heightened tensions, but no ground invasion has occurred, and no formal U.S. accusation matching the specified criteria has been made[1][4]. If current trends persist, the likely outcome is No.

(c) **Scenario Resulting in a No Outcome**  
China continues its military exercises, gray zone activities, and economic/diplomatic pressure on Taiwan without deploying ground forces onto the island. The U.S. maintains its policy of strategic ambiguity and does not issue a public accusation of invasion, as there is no event that meets the criteria of ground forces entering Taiwan without Taipei’s consent[1][4].

(d) **Scenario Resulting in a Yes Outcome**  
A major escalation occurs: the PRC deploys ground military forces onto Taiwan’s territory without consent. The United States, in response to clear evidence of this, issues an official public accusation that China has invaded Taiwan, explicitly referencing the movement of ground forces in violation of Taiwanese sovereignty.

## Rationale

China has intensified its pressure and military posturing against Taiwan but is widely viewed as reluctant to launch a full-scale ground invasion in the near term, preferring other forms of coercion[4]. Xi Jinping has recently accused the U.S. of trying to “trick” or “goad” China into invading Taiwan, signaling a wariness about taking aggressive steps that would play into U.S. strategy[1][2][3][5]. U.S. policy continues to emphasize strategic ambiguity rather than direct military confrontation or preemptive accusation[4].

While tensions are high, an actual invasion—and thus a U.S. accusation of such—remains unlikely barring a dramatic and unanticipated shift. Change in this area is typically slow and incremental, supporting the importance of the status quo in forecasting.
