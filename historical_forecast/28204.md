(a) **Time left until resolution:**  
The outcome will be officially determined on October 1, 2024. Given today is September 16, 2024, there are about two weeks (roughly 15 days) remaining before the question resolves.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
As of now, the Chicago White Sox have completed their 2024 MLB season with a record of 41-121[1][2][3]. This means they have lost 121 games, which is below the 124-loss threshold required for the question to resolve as "Yes."

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
A No outcome is realized if the White Sox finish the season with fewer than 124 losses. This has already occurred: their final loss total stands at 121, as confirmed by authoritative sources[1][2][3].

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
A Yes outcome could only occur if the White Sox finish the season with 124 or more losses by October 1, 2024. This is now mathematically impossible, as their season is over and their official loss total is set at 121[1][2][3].

## Rationale

- All authoritative MLB sources report the White Sox's season is complete with 121 losses.
- There are no remaining games to play, nor any pending results or scoring corrections, and no league policies or irregularities have been announced.
- The official standings used for question resolution confirm the loss total.

## Final Forecast

Probability: 0%  
There is no chance the Chicago White Sox will lose 124 games in the 2024 MLB season before October 1, 2024, as their official, finalized loss total is 121, three short of the required number for a "Yes" resolution[1][2][3].
