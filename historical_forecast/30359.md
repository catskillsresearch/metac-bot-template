(a) Time until outcome known:  
There are 41 days remaining until January 1, 2025, at which point it will be known whether a new post appeared at Rivian’s Stories site after November 21, 2024.

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changes:  
If Rivian does not add any new posts to its Stories site between November 21, 2024, and January 1, 2025, the outcome will be No.

(c) Scenario resulting in a No outcome:  
Rivian’s Stories site sees no activity—no new posts or updates appear—through the rest of 2024. The last visible post remains the November 14, 2024 entry, and the site either remains idle or is taken offline (as per criteria, a site outage would also resolve as No).

(d) Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:  
At least one new post appears on the Rivian Stories site (stories.rivian.com), timestamped after November 21, 2024 and before January 1, 2025. This could be regular content, a community feature, or a special update, but must occur at that specific web address per the criteria.

## Rationale

- The most recent post as of November 20, 2024 was dated November 14, 2024, demonstrating that the site is actively maintained up to mid-November.
- Rivian Stories claims to host regular content including a “weekly show” and a “monthly live event,” both pointing to at least monthly, possibly even more frequent, posts[1]. This pattern supports the expectation that routine updates will continue, especially since the most recent post is only a week old.
- However, the December period contains holidays, during which content schedules for many organizations may be paused or scaled back—a factor that raises the odds of inactivity.
- The absence of detailed post-frequency history for December in prior years injects some uncertainty, as does the possibility of technical issues or staff absences, which occasionally affect end-of-year content schedules.
- The status quo bias applies: in the absence of a strong reason to expect a change, recent patterns (i.e., regular posting) are informative. However, even small risks (like organizational or technical disruptions, or a holiday pause) should be included in the probability.

Given the regular content cadence, the extremely recent site activity, and the site’s stated routines (weekly and monthly updates), a new post before January 1, 2025 remains more likely than not. But modestly significant uncertainty exists due to potential year-end lulls and the nonzero chance of a technical or operational hiccup.

Probability: 75%
