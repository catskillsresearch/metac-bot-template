(a) Time until outcome is known: The question will be resolved when Zillow releases its November 2024 data, which typically occurs on the 12th of each month. Since today is May 6, 2025, the outcome is already known but not provided in the search results.

(b) Status quo outcome: Based on the most recent data from August 2024, Dallas, TX had a month-over-month rent change of 0.2% and a year-over-year change of -1.4% according to the Zillow Observed Rent Index (ZORI)[4]. If this trend continued, the status quo would be a negative year-over-year growth rate.

(c) No outcome scenario: If the cooling rental market trend continues or accelerates in Dallas, rent prices could continue to decline year-over-year. With property managers increasingly offering concessions nationwide[4] and rental growth slowing below pre-pandemic levels nationally[5], Dallas might experience continued negative growth through November 2024.

(d) Yes outcome scenario: If the Dallas rental market stabilizes or shows slight improvement from the August 2024 figures, the year-over-year rent growth could return to positive territory by November 2024. National rents were still increasing as of April 2024, albeit at a slower pace than pre-pandemic[2], so Dallas could potentially align with this broader trend.

When examining the available data, I see several important trends to consider:

## National Rental Market Context

As of April 2024, national rents were still growing, with the typical U.S. rent reaching $1,997, just shy of the $2,000 mark[2]. This represented a 0.6% month-over-month growth, slightly slower than the pre-pandemic average for this time of year of 0.7%[2]. However, the rental market showed signs of cooling by August 2024, with one-third of property managers offering concessions to attract tenants[4].

Looking at earlier data, we can see that annual rent growth had been consistently slowing. In September 2023, the annual growth rate was 3.2%, continuing a 19-month-long slowdown from the record-high 16% in February 2022[5]. By January 2024, rents were up 3.4% compared to the previous year, with the national average reaching $1,958[1].

## Dallas-Specific Trends

The most relevant data point for Dallas comes from the August 2024 report, which shows:
- Typical rent: $1,605
- Month-over-month change: 0.2%
- Year-over-year change: -1.4%[4]

This indicates that Dallas was experiencing negative annual rent growth while still seeing slight monthly increases. This divergence suggests the market may have been in transition.

## Geographic Patterns

Interestingly, by July 2024, rent growth was fastest in smaller markets in the Northeast and Midwest, while large coastal markets remained the most expensive but weren't leading in growth[3]. Dallas, being a large non-coastal market, falls somewhere in between these trends.

## Forecasting Considerations

Given the cooling trend in the national rental market and Dallas's negative year-over-year growth as of August 2024, it seems more likely that Dallas would continue to show negative or flat year-over-year growth by November 2024. The month-over-month positive growth (0.2%) was modest and might not be sufficient to overcome the -1.4% year-over-year deficit within just three months.

Additionally, the increased rate of concessions being offered by property managers suggests continued downward pressure on effective rents, even if nominal rents remain stable.

Good forecasters do indeed put extra weight on the status quo, and the status quo for Dallas as of our most recent data point was negative year-over-year growth. While there's always a possibility of reversal, there's no strong evidence in the search results to suggest such a reversal was imminent for Dallas specifically.
