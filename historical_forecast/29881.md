(a) **Time left until outcome is known**  
As of November 11, 2024, there are approximately 51 days remaining until January 1, 2025.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed**  
The status quo is a continuation of current trends, with no large-scale armed conflict inside Russia meeting the criteria (internal, >1,000 deaths, >100 Russian participants on both sides) before January 1, 2025. Existing fighting is external (Ukrainian forces), not internal Russian-on-Russian conflict.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome**  
Russia's government maintains control, with no major organized armed opposition by Russian citizens. Any anti-government actions (e.g., protests, small-scale sabotage, isolated terrorist incidents) do not escalate into widescale armed conflict. The war with Ukraine continues, but spillover violence does not meet the threshold for a large internal conflictâ€”no events with 1,000+ deaths and 100+ Russian citizen combatants on both sides.

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome**  
A major shock, such as an unexpected Russian defeat in Ukraine, economic collapse, or a political crisis (e.g., a coup attempt or a split within the security services), triggers mass violence within Russia. Two or more armed Russian groups engage in large-scale fighting (e.g., mutiny, civil war, or large-scale secessionist rebellion), resulting in at least 1,000 deaths and major press coverage, likely leading to a dedicated Wikipedia page about the conflict.

## Rationale

While Russia faces significant stress from the ongoing Ukraine war, Western sanctions, and economic pressures[2][4], there is currently no direct evidence of large organized internal opposition or imminent civil conflict. The Russian government is still showing the capacity to manage both the war effort and internal security, and recent expert assessments suggest that Russian forces and political structures are holding, albeit with increasing challenges[2][5].

Historical analogies (such as the aftermath of the Russo-Japanese War) point out that catastrophic military defeat can trigger internal upheaval, but current scenarios do not indicate collapse is imminent within the short time left before January 1, 2025[1][3]. Western and US officials expect Ukraine to remain defensive through early 2025, and Russian advances, though costly, remain incremental rather than resulting in dramatic reversals that could destabilize the regime[5]. No credible reporting points to widespread mutinies, coup attempts, or armed uprisings by Russian citizens as of November 2024.

Given the weight of the status quo and the lack of concrete signs of imminent instability, the likelihood of a large-scale, internal armed conflict occurring in Russia before January 1, 2025, remains low, though nonzero given the unpredictability of war and political shock events.
