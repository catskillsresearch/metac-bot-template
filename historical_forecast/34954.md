(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
The exact date when the outcome will be determined is not specified, but as of February 11, 2025, the result will be resolved when "Opus" releases, its opening weekend grosses are reported, and Metaculus Admins access the Box Office Mojo figure. If the film has not yet been released, the time left is indeterminate but could be weeks or months, up until the end of the forecasting tournament or latest permissible resolution window.

(b) **Outcome if nothing changed:**  
If nothing changed and the situation remained as it is as of February 11, 2025—meaning "Opus" is not reported in the box office charts—then the reported opening weekend domestic gross would be **1.0 million US dollars** (as per the outcome bounds given, where the lowest possible outcome is 1.0).

(c) **Outcome if the current trend continued:**  
The current trend is the absence of "Opus" from any significant box office reporting and no evidence of release or box office activity[1][4][5]. If this continues, the outcome remains at the lowest bound: **1.0 million US dollars**.

(d) **Expectations of experts and markets:**  
Given no reported release, no promotional buzz, and no box office figures, expert and market expectations would default to a minimal figure, assuming either a non-release, an extremely limited release, or a micro-grossing opening weekend. In such cases, the minimum resolvable figure is most likely.

(e) **Unexpected low outcome scenario:**  
An unexpected scenario resulting in a low outcome (at or near the lower bound) would be if "Opus" receives an extremely limited theatrical release (for example, a token or qualifying release in a handful of theaters with almost no marketing), achieving only negligible box office receipts, thus reported as **1.0 million US dollars**.

(f) **Unexpected high outcome scenario:**  
A surprising high outcome could occur if "Opus" is suddenly picked up by a major distributor, receives a wide release, and benefits from a viral marketing campaign or critical buzz, resulting in an opening weekend in line with small to mid-tier indie releases—but there is currently no evidence for such a scenario.
