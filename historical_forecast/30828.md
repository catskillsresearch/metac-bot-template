(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  
The outcome window is from after Election Day (November 5, 2024) to January 1, 2025. As of December 6, 2024, there are 25 days remaining for President Biden to sign additional executive orders before the deadline.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
Since Election Day, only one executive order has been signed by President Biden[5]. If no further executive orders are signed before January 1, 2025, the outcome would be **No**.

(c) **Scenario that results in a No outcome:**  
President Biden signs fewer than three additional executive orders in December 2024, ending the period with a total of one, two, or three executive orders signed after Election Day. This would be a continuation of the current slow pace and consistent with the recent downward trend in his use of executive orders.

(d) **Scenario that results in a Yes outcome:**  
President Biden ramps up his executive order activity and signs at least three more executive orders during the remainder of December 2024, reaching a total of four or more orders between Election Day and January 1, 2025. This would slightly exceed his average for previous Decembers (which ranged from 2 to 6 executive orders per December).

## Rationale

- **Historical context:** In the past three Decembers, Biden signed 6 (2021), 2 (2022), and 3 (2023) executive orders, averaging just under 4 per December. Notably, none of these periods coincided exactly with a post-election "lame duck" period, but December 2021 (6 orders) provides the upper bound for his end-of-year activity.
- **Recent trend:** Biden’s executive order issuance has slowed in 2024, with several months at zero and most months at one or two orders. Since Election Day, he has signed only one executive order, so he would need to triple that output in less than a month to reach four[5].
- **Lame duck dynamic:** While some presidents use their final weeks to issue a flurry of executive orders, Biden's overall pace and the low activity in November 2024 suggest his administration is not prioritizing this tactic so far. However, the possibility of a late surge cannot be fully ruled out, especially if policy priorities or external events demand executive action.
- **Status quo weighting:** Given Biden’s recent pattern of low executive order activity and with only one order issued since Election Day, the "status quo" outcome (fewer than four executive orders) should be given significant weight. While a late burst is possible, it would require a break from his current pace.
