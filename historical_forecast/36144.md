(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
Today is May 6, 2025. The 36th GLAAD Media Awards ceremony took place on March 27, 2025[2]. The announced winner for Outstanding Film – Wide Release has already been made public as of January 22, 2025[2][4].

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
The status quo is that "My Old Ass" (Amazon MGM Studios) is the winner of the 2025 GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Film – Wide Release. This outcome was officially announced and is confirmed by multiple reputable sources[1][2][4].

(c) **Scenario that results in an unexpected outcome:**  
An unexpected outcome would require substantial irregularities, such as:
- The announcement of "My Old Ass" as winner was in error and the GLAAD organization issues a public correction, naming another film as the winner.
- Discovery of ineligibility, major controversy, or vote tabulation error leading to retraction and reassignment of the award after the public winner announcement.
- Significant procedural violation during the review or voting process that prompts legal or organizational intervention and revision of results.

Such scenarios are exceedingly rare, especially given the robust, multi-stage review and certification process GLAAD employs for its awards. Historically, awards of this type are not rescinded after public announcement except in extraordinary circumstances.

**Rationale:**  
Professional forecasting emphasizes inertia: once reputable institutions, including GLAAD, announce outcomes based on established processes, those outcomes very rarely change. However, best practice is to reserve a small, nonzero probability for surprises, as errors or scandals, while unlikely, are not impossible.

Given current evidence and the explicit announcement of the winner, the rational forecast is near-certainty for the status quo outcome, with only a token probability assigned to all other possibilities.

## Final Probabilities

Cuckoo: 0.1%  
Drive-Away Dolls: 0.1%  
Love Lies Bleeding: 0.1%  
Mean Girls: 0.1%  
My Old Ass: 99.0%  
Problemista: 0.1%  
Queer: 0.1%  
Wicked: 0.4%  

"My Old Ass" is effectively certain to remain the 2025 GLAAD Media Award winner for Outstanding Film – Wide Release[1][2][4]. The residual probability on the other nominees reflects only the slimmest chance of reversal or error.
