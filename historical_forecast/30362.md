(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
There are approximately 41 days until January 1, 2025, when the outcome will be determined, assuming today is November 21, 2024.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
Alphabet/Google would continue to operate, and Eric Schmidt would *not* be announced as CEO or as a member of its Board of Directors. As of now, Schmidt holds no formal roles at Alphabet/Google, and there have been no credible announcements or signals indicating an imminent return[1][2][3][4][5].

(c) **Scenario that results in a No outcome:**  
- If Alphabet/Google, before January 1, 2025, announces that Eric Schmidt will become the next CEO (including as one of several co-CEOs) or will join the Board of Directors—either via an official press release, reputable news outlet, or if Schmidt's name appears on the official board and governance page.  
- Alternatively, if Alphabet/Google ceases operations entirely before January 1, 2025.

(d) **Scenario that results in a Yes outcome:**  
- Alphabet/Google continues regular operations through January 1, 2025, without any announcement of Eric Schmidt’s return as CEO or board member, and the company does not cease operations.

## Rationale

Alphabet/Google is among the world's most stable, valuable technology companies, with no evidence of impending operational disruption[2][3][4][5]. Executive changes—particularly the return of a former CEO—are rare and typically foreshadowed by substantial media coverage or rumors; as of the current date, there are none suggesting Eric Schmidt is in line to retake a leadership or board position[2][3][4][5].

Schmidt has moved on to a portfolio of interests in AI, philanthropy, and public policy and has had no formal role at Alphabet/Google since 2020[3][4][5]. Recent comments and media visibility focus on technology and AI, not on a return to executive or board roles[1][2][4][5]. Alphabet’s official board and governance documentation does not list Schmidt[3]. Furthermore, there is no indication of board or CEO instability that could plausibly catalyze his return within the next six weeks.

Given that the status quo is robust and high-profile board or CEO returns are extremely rare without prior robust signals in the business or tech press, the base rate for such a dramatic shift is very low. Likewise, Alphabet/Google ceasing operations within such a short time frame is nearly inconceivable absent a catastrophic and highly publicized event.

## Final Probability

Probability: 98%  
(The probability that Alphabet/Google will continuously operate through January 1, 2025, without announcing Eric Schmidt's return as CEO or as a member of its Board of Directors is extremely high, given the weight of current evidence and prevailing corporate stability[1][2][3][4][5].)
