(a) **Time until resolution:**  
Approximately 3-4 weeks remain until April 2025, when the outcome will be determined.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changes:**  
BC Hydro will continue to exclude Tesla products (including EV chargers) from its rebate program for single-family homes in April 2025. This exclusion is currently in effect as of March 12, 2025, and there is no indication of a pending reversal[1][2][5].

(c) **Scenario for a No outcome (Tesla not excluded):**  
A No outcome would occur if, before or during April 2025, BC Hydro updates its official page to remove mention of Tesla’s ineligibility—likely due to a policy reversal or policy update by the BC government, possibly as a response to improved trade relations or significant political pressure.

(d) **Scenario for a Yes outcome (Tesla still excluded):**  
A Yes outcome will occur if, as of April 2025, BC Hydro’s official page continues to state that Tesla products are ineligible for the EV charger rebate program for single-family homes. This would reflect the maintained status quo, driven by ongoing trade tensions and the BC government’s "Buy Canadian" preference, which was the basis for the initial exclusion[1][2][5].

## Rationale

- The exclusion of Tesla products is a high-profile and explicit policy change, enacted as a direct response to trade tensions with the U.S. and framed as a "Buy B.C." initiative[1][2][5].
- The government and BC Hydro made this decision public, and all program documentation and official communications as of March 20, 2025, reinforce Tesla’s exclusion[1][2][5].
- There is no evidence or announcement suggesting a reversal or reconsideration of this policy, and such government-driven regulatory decisions tend to persist unless there is a strong catalyst for change.
- The time frame until April 2025 is short, and abrupt reversals on policy—especially ones connected to international trade disputes—are rare in practice, especially when they have been framed as retaliatory/nationalist countermeasures.
- Even if new developments emerged after March 20, 2025, there is little time for policy negotiation, public consultation, and official update before the outcome is due.

Given these points, forecasters should heavily weight the status quo, especially when changes would require coordinated policy and communication shifts with no indications of movement so far.
