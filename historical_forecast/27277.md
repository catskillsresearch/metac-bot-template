I'll analyze the measles case forecast question carefully, considering the current data and potential future scenarios.

(a) Time left until outcome: About 41 days (from August 20, 2024, to September 30, 2024)

(b) Status quo outcome: If current trends continue, the outcome will be No. As of May 9, 2024, there were 132 confirmed cases, and by the end of 2024, the total reached 285 cases, which is below the 400-case threshold[4][2].

(c) Scenario for No outcome: The rate of new measles cases continues at the pace observed through most of 2024, with occasional small outbreaks that are quickly contained. Vaccination efforts and public health responses remain effective enough to keep the total below 400 cases.

(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: A significant new outbreak occurs in one or more densely populated areas with lower vaccination rates, causing a rapid acceleration in cases beyond what was observed in the first half of 2024. This would need to add at least 115+ new cases beyond the documented 285 year-end total.

## Rationale

The most recent data available shows that as of May 9, 2024, there were 132 measles cases reported across 21 jurisdictions in the United States[4]. This represents a significant increase compared to 2023, when only 59 cases were reported for the entire year[2]. 

Looking at the pattern of case reporting, we can see that in the first quarter of 2024 (January through March), there were 97 cases reported, which was a seventeenfold increase over the average number of cases reported during the first quarters of 2020-2023[1]. This indicates that 2024 started with an unusually high number of cases.

However, the rate of increase appears to have slowed after the first quarter. Between March 28 (97 cases) and May 9 (132 cases), only 35 additional cases were reported over approximately six weeks[1][4]. This suggests a declining rate of new infections compared to the initial surge.

The CDC's year-end data shows that a total of 285 cases were reported in 2024, with 16 outbreaks (defined as 3 or more related cases)[2]. This indicates that while 2024 saw substantially more cases than 2023, the total remained well below the 400-case threshold.

There are several factors that make a "No" outcome more likely:

1. **Historical context**: Even with the increased case count in 2024, the total (285) remained below 400.

2. **Vaccination status data**: Among the reported cases, 81% were in unvaccinated individuals or those with unknown vaccination status[4]. This suggests the outbreaks were largely contained to pockets of unvaccinated populations rather than indicating widespread vaccine failure.

3. **Outbreak containment**: The 8 outbreaks reported as of May 9, 2024, accounted for 69% of cases (91 of 132)[4]. This indicates that public health authorities were identifying and tracking related cases, which is important for containment.

4. **Status quo bias**: As noted, the world typically changes slowly, and the status quo (less than 400 cases) is the most likely outcome unless there is compelling evidence of a dramatic shift.

However, a "Yes" outcome can't be completely ruled out. Measles is highly contagious, with one infected person capable of infecting 9 out of 10 unvaccinated people they encounter. The high hospitalization rate (53% of cases) indicates severe disease that might prompt increased detection and reporting[4].

Weighing all these factors and giving appropriate weight to the status quo, the most reasonable conclusion is that the total number of measles cases in the United States for 2024 will not exceed 400 by September 30.

Probability: 15%
