(a) Time until outcome: Given today's date (May 6, 2025), the outcome determination period (through March 31, 2025) has already passed.

(b) Status quo outcome: Based on the current date being past the resolution date, we need to determine if Microsoft stock exceeded $468.35 at any point between the question launch and March 31, 2025.

(c) A "No" outcome scenario: Microsoft stock price exceeded $468.35 at some point (even intraday) between the question launch and March 31, 2025, perhaps driven by strong AI performance, positive analyst upgrades, or overall market momentum.

(d) A "Yes" outcome scenario: Microsoft stock remained consistently below $468.35 from question launch through March 31, 2025, possibly due to market concerns about AI investments, general market weakness, or company-specific headwinds.

As a professional forecaster, I need to analyze the available information to determine what likely happened between the question launch and March 31, 2025.

Based on the search results, Microsoft stock was experiencing mixed performance in early 2025. As of February 2025, the stock was "in the red so far this year"[1] and "down slightly here in the beginning of 2025"[5]. The stock was trading at approximately $417 per share around late 2024[2], with another source indicating a price of $434.67[3] at the time of reporting.

Analyst price targets for Microsoft in 2025 varied. UBS raised its Microsoft price target to $525 from $500 in December 2024[4]. According to CoinCodex prediction, Microsoft was anticipated to trade between $427.23 and $609.54 in 2025[3]. A YouTube analysis from December 2024 suggested a base case scenario of Microsoft stock reaching between $460 and $500 per share by the end of 2025[2].

However, these were forecasts, and the actual performance may have differed. The search results indicate that Microsoft was underperforming in early 2025, which suggests it was below previous highs. 

Given that Microsoft was trading below $468.35 in early 2025 and was described as underperforming, it's reasonable to conclude that the stock likely did not exceed its all-time high by March 31, 2025. While some analyst targets suggested potential upside beyond $468.35 later in 2025, the subdued performance described in early 2025 indicates the stock was still below this threshold during the relevant period.

The stock market can be unpredictable, and sudden rallies can occur, but the consistent reports of Microsoft underperforming in early 2025 suggest that a sustained rally above the all-time high before March 31, 2025 was unlikely.

Probability: 85%
