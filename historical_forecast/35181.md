Based on the given question, I'll provide a professional forecaster's assessment of the likely highest rank of metac-GPT4o or metac-o1 in the Q1 2025 Quarterly Cup.

(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.
The Q1 2025 Quarterly Cup is currently ongoing. Since we're currently in May 2025 (May 6, 2025), and this question pertains to Q1 2025 (January-March), the tournament should have already concluded. However, the question specifies that resolution occurs "after all questions besides this one have been resolved and no more questions are set to open." Some prediction questions in the tournament might still be resolving, so the final ranking may not be determined yet.

(b) The outcome if nothing changed.
Without specific current rankings for metac-GPT4o or metac-o1 in the Q1 2025 tournament, it's difficult to establish a clear status quo. Based on the search results, we know that this question was active as of January 31, 2025, indicating significant community interest in tracking these AI models' performance.

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued.
The search results don't provide information about current trends in the performance of these AI forecasting bots. However, we know these models use a combination of GPT architectures and AskNews for search capabilities, with forecasts updated every two days.

(d) The expectations of experts and markets.
There is no specific expert or market consensus provided in the search results regarding the expected performance of these models in the Q1 2025 Quarterly Cup.

(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome.
A low ranking could occur if the AI models struggled with the specific questions in this quarter's tournament, particularly if the questions involved topics requiring nuanced judgment or specialized knowledge that wasn't well-represented in their training data. Technical issues with the AskNews integration could also hamper performance.

(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome.
A high ranking could result if the models received significant improvements before the Q1 2025, perhaps with enhanced reasoning capabilities or better integration with current information sources. The nature of the questions in this specific tournament might also align particularly well with the strengths of these AI models.

I need to be humble in my assessment given the limited information available about these models' historical performance in Quarterly Cups. The Metaculus community has shown interest in tracking these models' performance, as evidenced by the question about their ranking being actively discussed in January 2025.
