(a) **Time until outcome known:**  
The question will be resolved after data for the week ending January 4, 2025, is finalized—this typically happens about 4 weeks later, making resolution likely in early February 2025.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
With the current trend of declining hospitalizations and the weekly rate at 3.2 per 100,000 as of September 28, 2024, the status quo suggests a continued decline or stabilization. If this trajectory holds, it is plausible rates could reach or drop below 2.0 during the forecast window[4][5].

(c) **Scenario for a No outcome:**  
Hospitalization rates remain at or above 2.0 throughout the period. This could happen if a seasonal uptick begins in October due to increased indoor mingling or if waning immunity, modest vaccine uptake, or localized surges in states with higher viral activity (such as Montana and Oregon) offset the declining summer trend before rates dip below 2.0[5].

(d) **Scenario for a Yes outcome:**  
The current downward trend persists for several weeks into October and November, with rates falling below 2.0 before a traditional winter increase. Alternatively, if the autumn/winter wave is smaller than previous years—as CDC projections suggest is possible—rates could remain suppressed, allowing for one or more weeks below 2.0 before any possible uptick late in the period[5].

## Rationale

Recent national data show the lowest COVID-19 hospitalization rates for the last week of September in the pandemic’s history—3.2 per 100,000, compared to 4.6 the prior year and still higher rates before that[4][5]. Since mid-August 2024, there has been a consistent decline in cases, hospitalizations, and deaths, and wastewater data confirms generally low viral activity nationally, barring a few states[5]. Critically, the CDC’s modeling assumes the peak for the 2024–25 season will be similar to or lower than last year’s, absent a disruptive new variant or failure in vaccine uptake.

The dominant variants as of late September (KP.3.1.1 and XEC) do not show evidence of dramatically increased transmissibility or severity, per CDC and expert commentary[5]. The downward trend, supported by both surveillance and modeling, suggests rates could continue to decline into early October. More importantly, with the 2024–25 season expected to mirror or underperform last year’s peaks, and especially since the summer wave already appears to have crested, there is credible support for the minimum in the upcoming quarter falling below 2.0.

However, the risk for a “No” outcome is nontrivial. Respiratory viruses often see a rebound as weather cools and people congregate indoors. If the seasonal uptick begins swiftly in October, or if vaccination rates are lower than assumed, hospitalizations could stabilize above 2.0 throughout the period. Additionally, local surges—especially in states with higher viral activity per wastewater data—could affect the surveillance sample.

Weighing these factors, and putting extra weight on the status quo (declining hospitalizations, CDC projections based on conservative assumptions, and absence of alarming variant dynamics), a further decrease below 2.0 is the most likely outcome, though not a lock, given the potential for early or abrupt seasonal increases.
