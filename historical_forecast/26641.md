(a) Time left until outcome: Approximately 2 months (until October 1, 2024)
(b) Status quo outcome: Yes (less than two debates)
(c) Scenario for No outcome: The Democratic nominee quickly agrees to debate terms with Trump, and they hold two debates before October 1 - the already scheduled September 10 debate on ABC (or another network) plus a hastily arranged additional debate in August.
(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: Negotiations between campaigns drag on with disagreements about venue, format, or scheduling, resulting in either no debates or just one debate before October 1.

Based on the information available as of July 26, 2024, I need to assess the likelihood that Donald Trump will debate the Democratic nominee for president less than twice before October 1, 2024.

The current situation presents significant uncertainty. Only one debate has occurred so far - the June 27 debate between Trump and Biden. However, since Biden has withdrawn from the race, this debate doesn't count toward our total according to the specified criteria, as Biden is no longer expected to be the Democratic nominee.

## Timeline and Scheduling Constraints

The second scheduled debate was set for September 10, 2024, to be hosted by ABC News[3]. This leaves a relatively narrow window between late July (when Biden withdrew) and October 1 to organize and conduct two debates with the new Democratic nominee.

The original debate schedule was already compressed compared to traditional timelines. The Commission on Presidential Debates had planned for their first debate on September 16, which they noted was "the earliest the commission has ever scheduled a debate"[4]. This suggests that organizing two debates before October 1 would be logistically challenging even under normal circumstances.

## Political Considerations

Trump has explicitly questioned whether the ABC debate should proceed as scheduled, suggesting instead that any debate with the new Democratic nominee should be held on Fox News[1]. This introduces a potential negotiation roadblock that could delay or prevent debates from occurring.

Historically, debate negotiations between campaigns can be protracted affairs with disagreements over format, rules, and media partners. With Biden's sudden withdrawal and a new Democratic nominee entering the race, these negotiations would need to start almost from scratch with very little time remaining.

## Precedent and Status Quo

When major disruptions occur in presidential campaigns, the most likely outcome is delay rather than acceleration of planned events. Campaign teams typically need time to adjust strategy, prepare their candidates, and negotiate terms. The status quo trajectory suggests that achieving two debates before October 1 would be difficult given these factors.

Additionally, the new Democratic nominee will likely need time to establish their campaign operation, fundraise, and prepare for debates, making it less likely they would push for multiple early debates.

## Probability Assessment

Given these considerations, I believe it is highly probable that Trump will debate the Democratic nominee less than twice before October 1, 2024:

1. The logistical challenges of organizing two debates in the short remaining timeframe
2. The need for new negotiations with a different Democratic nominee
3. Trump's expressed reservations about the previously scheduled ABC debate
4. The limited precedent for multiple debates occurring this early in the election cycle
5. The natural tendency toward delay rather than acceleration when campaign circumstances change dramatically

While it's certainly possible that two debates could occur (particularly if both campaigns see strategic advantages in debating quickly), the weight of evidence suggests this is unlikely.

Probability: 85%
