(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  
There are approximately 36 days until October 1, 2024.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
As of August 21, 2024, Ukrainian forces had advanced and established positions up to the west bank of the Seim River near Tetkino and appeared to be conducting probing attacks on the settlement itself, but there is no authoritative evidence (from the Institute for the Study of War [ISW]) that Ukraine controlled Tetkino[4]. If the frontlines remain unchanged and Ukraine does not make a decisive push into Tetkino or is unable to consolidate control, the outcome would be **No**—that is, ISW would not map Tetkino as Ukrainian-controlled before the deadline.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
- Russian defenses hold firm east of the Seim River and in Tetkino itself.
- Ukrainian forces, while conducting raids and limited attacks, are unable to secure and hold the settlement.
- Russian troops, despite being threatened with encirclement, successfully withdraw or maintain defensive lines due to destroyed bridges and prepared positions, and ISW never reports Tetkino as Ukrainian-controlled or claimed as such before October 1, 2024[4].

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
- Ukrainian troops continue their advances, cross the Seim River, and capture Tetkino.
- ISW, using geolocated evidence or credible reporting, updates its interactive map to show Tetkino as under Ukrainian control or claimed limit of advance before October 1, 2024.
- Russian forces are either encircled or withdraw, failing to defend the settlement[4].

## **Forecast Rationale**

- **Current Ukrainian Momentum:** Ukrainian forces have achieved tactical gains in Kursk Oblast, consolidating on the western bank of the Seim near Tetkino and conducting attacks in the direct vicinity of the town as of mid to late August[4]. Their advance has created the risk of isolating up to 3,000 Russian troops south of the Seim River.
- **Defensive Measures:** Russian troops responded by blowing bridges, retreating into Tetkino, and attempting to secure the settlement’s approaches. The destruction of these bridges may have temporarily delayed a Ukrainian crossing and complicated logistics for further offensive actions against Tetkino[4].
- **Salient Developments:** There are indications of Ukrainian probing attacks and consolidation near the settlement, but not yet any ISW confirmation of Ukrainian control or claimed control of Tetkino—only positions up to the river and fighting near the town[4][2][1].
- **Operational Constraints:** Ukrainian advances have been described as "marginal" since August 19[2], and Russian resistance remains active. While the situation is fluid, the rate of territorial change has slowed, suggesting significant challenges for further breakthroughs.
- **Reporting Lag:** For the forecast to resolve as "Yes," ISW must explicitly map Tetkino as Ukrainian-controlled before October 1. ISW is generally conservative in assigning control, requiring sustained evidence rather than brief raids or temporary presence.

Given these dynamics, professional forecasting principles advise weighing the *status quo* most heavily—major settlements like Tetkino historically change hands infrequently unless there is a major collapse or breakthrough. While Ukrainian forces are threatening Tetkino and may continue to pressure it, the destruction of bridges and Russian defensive preparations indicate a significant obstacle, and the window for a Ukrainian breakthrough is narrowing.

## **Final Assessment**

- Ukrainian forces are positioned to threaten Tetkino, and tactical developments could still enable a breakthrough.
- However, as of the last update, there is no confirmation of Ukrainian control of Tetkino.
- Given the destroyed river crossings, likely Russian reinforcements, and ISW's cautious reporting policies, the *most likely outcome* is that Tetkino does **not** fall under Ukrainian control (as defined by ISW) before October 1, 2024.

**Probability: 30%**  
Ukraine is threatening Tetkino, and a rapid advance is possible, but the base rate for such a settlement changing hands—especially given ISW's mapping criteria and recent reporting—suggests "No" remains the favored outcome, barring a sudden collapse of Russian defense in the sector[4][2][1].
