(a) Time left until outcome: Approximately 7 months and 25 days (from May 6, 2025 to January 1, 2025, which is in the past from our current date)

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: Based on the limited information provided, I cannot determine IBM's current Pay-as-you-go quantum computing pricing. Therefore, I cannot establish the status quo with certainty.

(c) A scenario resulting in a No outcome: IBM maintains its current pricing structure due to competitive pressures from other providers like AWS and Microsoft Azure, who offer accessible entry points. As industry experts predict decreasing costs over time with advancing technology, IBM follows this trend to remain competitive.

(d) A scenario resulting in a Yes outcome: IBM increases its Pay-as-you-go pricing to reflect significant investments in their ambitious quantum roadmap, including the introduction of more powerful processors like "Flamingo" and "Kookaburra." The high costs associated with quantum computing development and the current R&D phase of the industry justify price increases.

Analyzing this forecasting question presents unique challenges given the information constraints. The search results provide limited details about IBM's specific quantum computing pricing plans, particularly for their Pay-as-you-go service.

The quantum computing market currently features high costs, with fully equipped systems selling for tens of millions of dollars[1]. Cloud-based services from competitors like Microsoft Azure and AWS offer more accessible entry points, with AWS starting at $29 per month[1]. However, these data points don't directly address IBM's specific pricing structure.

IBM has an ambitious quantum computing roadmap, planning significant advancements through 2025, including the introduction of more powerful processors and multi-chip systems[2][4]. These technological developments represent substantial investments that could potentially influence service pricing.

Industry trends suggest that quantum computing costs may decrease over time as technology advances and becomes more accessible[1]. The quantum industry remains in early stages with high unit costs, primarily in the research and development phase[1].

As a forecaster, I must give significant weight to status quo outcomes, recognizing that dramatic changes are less common than continuity. While IBM is making technological advancements, there's no explicit indication in the provided information that they plan to raise prices. The broader industry expectation is that costs will decrease over time as technology matures.

The search results mention that IBM's quantum systems are sold for "tens of millions as part of full-service contract over several years"[1], suggesting their business model may favor long-term contracts over pay-as-you-go price increases. Additionally, competitive pressures from other providers offering accessible entry points may discourage significant price hikes.

Without specific information about IBM's current pricing or announced plans to change pricing, and considering the industry trend toward decreasing costs over time, I lean toward the probability that IBM will not raise its Pay-as-you-go quantum computing prices before January 1, 2025.

Probability: 35%
