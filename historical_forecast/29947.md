(a) **Time until the outcome is known:**  
There are approximately three weeks (until the end of December 2024) before the final closing values of November and December 2024 are available, which will definitively resolve the question.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
Assuming no dramatic shifts, the S&P 500 would continue along its current trajectory. As of early November, the consensus among major analysts and banks remains bullish, projecting modest but positive gains for the U.S. equity market through year-end[2][4][5].

(c) **Scenario for a No outcome (S&P 500 falls in December):**  
A “No” outcome could occur if unexpected macroeconomic shocks emerge, such as:
- Deterioration in economic indicators (e.g., weaker-than-expected jobs or inflation data)
- Delay or cancellation of anticipated Federal Reserve rate cuts
- Surprises from corporate earnings or negative geopolitical developments
- Renewed political or fiscal uncertainty post-election  
Such developments could lead to a December decline, even if the S&P 500 had previously trended upward.

(d) **Scenario for a Yes outcome (S&P 500 rises in December):**  
A “Yes” outcome is likely if the expected drivers materialize:
- The Federal Reserve signals or implements its first rate cut in late 2024, as many analysts expected[2][4]
- Post-election uncertainty dissipates, encouraging risk-taking and inflows into stocks[2][4]
- Economic data remains supportive, with GDP growth near forecasts and no sharp reversals in sentiment[5]
- Earnings and inflation data align with or beat expectations  
This would result in the S&P 500 closing December at a higher level than in November.

## Rationale and Probability Estimate

Professional forecasters generally put extra weight on the status quo, as markets often trend rather than reverse sharply without a catalyst. The weight of current forecasts (Goldman Sachs, RBC, Fundstrat, others) is notably positive, with year-end targets commonly above current levels and December specifically expected to see a lift from key catalysts (Fed rate cut, resolution of election uncertainty)[2][4][5]. While valuation is rich and risks exist, none of the major investment houses are predicting a December downturn.

Thus, with less than a month to go and the confluence of supportive factors likely to remain in place, the base rate for month-over-month S&P 500 gains historically is slightly positive, and the consensus forecast for late 2024 strengthens that view.
