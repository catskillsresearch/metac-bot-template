As a professional forecaster interviewing for a job, I'll analyze the question about US airline passenger volume for St. Patrick's Day Weekend (March 14-17, 2025) according to the TSA.

(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known:
The outcome will be known after March 17, 2025, when the TSA publishes the passenger screening data for that period. From today (May 6, 2025), this data is already available as we've passed the date in question.

(b) The outcome if nothing changed:
Based on the search results, there's no specific data available for the actual passenger volumes during St. Patrick's Day Weekend 2025. Without this information, I cannot state what the status quo outcome was.

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued:
The search results mention that MSP airport passenger volume increased by 8.5% in the relevant period of 2024, with average monthly passenger volume at MSP being 3.3 million between April and August 2024. However, this data is specific to Minneapolis-St. Paul airport and not representative of nationwide TSA screening numbers.

(d) The expectations of experts and markets:
The search results don't provide expert predictions or market expectations for passenger volumes during St. Patrick's Day Weekend 2025. Islands Magazine does note that TSA statistics show a rise in flight numbers over weekends in March as winter draws to a close and spring break approaches, but no specific forecasts are provided.

(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome:
An unexpected severe weather system affecting multiple major airports across the country during the St. Patrick's Day Weekend could have significantly reduced passenger volumes due to flight cancellations and travelers choosing to postpone their trips.

(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome:
A combination of factors including favorable weather conditions nationwide, lower-than-usual airfares due to promotional campaigns, and St. Patrick's Day coinciding with spring break for many schools and universities could have led to exceptionally high passenger volumes.

Given the lack of specific data in the search results and the fact that we're now past the date in question (May 2025 looking back at March 2025), I cannot provide precise confidence intervals. The information available doesn't give us enough data to make a well-calibrated forecast about the TSA passenger volumes for that specific weekend.
