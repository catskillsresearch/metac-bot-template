(a) Time until outcome: 10 days (from October 21, 2024 to October 31, 2024)

(b) Status quo outcome: No - Apple's market capitalization ($3.56 trillion) remains larger than Nvidia's ($3.23 trillion)

(c) Scenario for No outcome: Nvidia's growth momentum slows as investors become more cautious about AI investment returns. Concerns about the AI sector's profitability emerge as Goldman Sachs research indicates "too much spend, too little benefit" in AI investments. Meanwhile, Apple's new product launches and "Apple Intelligence" functionality generate renewed investor excitement, maintaining its market cap lead.

(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: Nvidia continues its explosive growth trajectory (192% one-year return vs Apple's 32%) due to sustained AI chip demand. A positive earnings announcement from Nvidia or negative news from Apple could rapidly close the $330 billion gap. Given Nvidia's revenue grew 195% year-over-year while Apple's grew just 0.4%, this momentum could propel Nvidia to surpass Apple within the 10-day timeframe.

I'll assess whether Nvidia's market capitalization will exceed Apple's by October 31, 2024, based on available data as of October 21, 2024.

## Current Market Position

As of October 16, 2024, Apple maintains the top position with a market capitalization of $3.56 trillion, while Nvidia follows at $3.23 trillion[2]. This represents a gap of approximately $330 billion that Nvidia would need to close within the next 10 days to surpass Apple.

## Growth Trajectories

Nvidia has demonstrated extraordinary growth, with a one-year trailing return of 192.04% compared to Apple's 32.31%[2]. More importantly, Nvidia's revenue grew by 195% year-over-year in its most recent four quarters, while Apple's revenue increased by just 0.4% during the same period[4]. This growth disparity represents the fundamental driver behind the narrowing gap between these companies.

## Fundamental Business Considerations

Despite Nvidia's impressive growth, there are important differences in the companies' financial profiles:

- Apple generated $385.60 billion in revenue (TTM) compared to Nvidia's $96.31 billion[2][4]
- Apple's net income was $101.96 billion (TTM) versus Nvidia's $53.01 billion[2][4]
- Nvidia maintains superior gross margins at 75% compared to Apple's 46%[4]

While Nvidia's valuation is largely based on expectations for future growth, Apple's is anchored in established revenue streams and consistent profitability[4]. This distinction may impact short-term market cap movements as investors assess whether Nvidia's current valuation is justified.

## AI Investment Climate

Goldman Sachs research indicates that tech companies are set to spend over $1 trillion on AI capital expenditures in coming years, but questions remain about the return on these investments[5]. This uncertainty could impact investor sentiment toward Nvidia, whose valuation is heavily tied to AI prospects.

## Timing Considerations

With just 10 days until the resolution date, a significant shift in relative market capitalization would require either:

1. Exceptional positive news for Nvidia or negative news for Apple
2. Continuation of the existing trend at an accelerated pace

While Nvidia has been rapidly gaining on Apple, the $330 billion gap represents approximately 10% of Nvidia's current market cap, making this a substantial hurdle to overcome in such a short timeframe.

## Recent Precedents

Nvidia has already gained over $1 trillion in market cap in 2024 alone[1], demonstrating that rapid valuation changes are possible. The company has previously jostled throughout the year for the top market cap position with Apple and Microsoft[2], indicating the competitive nature of this race.

## Conclusion

Weighing these factors, I must give significant weight to the status quo. While Nvidia has demonstrated remarkable momentum, the $330 billion gap is substantial to overcome in just 10 days without a major catalyst. Apple's established business model and the short timeframe favor maintaining its lead, though Nvidia's continued AI-driven growth keeps the possibility open for a change in position.

Probability: 35%
