(a) **Time Left Until Outcome Is Known:**  
Approximately 18 days remain before October 1, 2024, for lithium carbonate prices to fall below 70,000 CNY/T and resolve the question as "Yes."

(b) **Status Quo Outcome If Nothing Changed:**  
As of early September 2024, the lithium carbonate price in China is reported around 72,500 CNY/T, already at its lowest in over three years and just above the 70,000 threshold. If current trends and price drivers persist without further major supply, demand, or policy changes, the price would likely remain near but above 70,000 CNY/T[1][2].

(c) **Scenario Resulting in a No Outcome:**  
- The price remains stable or rebounds above the current 72,500 CNY/T level due to:
  - Implementation of supply cuts or production suspensions by Chinese lithium refiners, stabilizing the market[4].
  - Late Q3 seasonal increase in demand for batteries and EVs supports prices, as the latter half of the quarter is typically a peak season for lithium demand[1].
  - Government intervention (such as new subsidies) bolsters EV sales and lithium demand, countering downward price pressure[1].

(d) **Scenario Resulting in a Yes Outcome:**  
- The price falls below 70,000 CNY/T at least once before October 1, 2024, due to:
  - Persistent oversupply, as production continues unabated and exceeds demand[1][5].
  - Weak downstream demand from battery and EV manufacturers, compounded by sluggish EV sales and high inventories[1].
  - Amplified effects from new US and EU tariffs on Chinese EV exports, further dampening lithium carbonate demand and causing a break below the 70,000 threshold in a volatile market environment[1].

## Rationale and Probability Assessment

Lithium carbonate prices have been on a sustained downward trend since late 2022, falling by more than 80% due to oversupply and weaker-than-expected EV demand, especially in China—the world’s key market. As of early September 2024, prices are already at 72,500 CNY/T, a mere 2,500 CNY above the threshold in question and within striking distance of falling below 70,000 CNY/T[2]. Forecasts and market commentary for Q3 2024 emphasize the ongoing supply glut, a seasonal lull in battery demand, and the risk that new trade barriers will further reduce demand for Chinese EVs (and, by extension, battery-grade lithium carbonate)[1][5].

However, recent history indicates that when prices reach new lows, refiners sometimes respond with production cuts or suspensions, which can provide some price support or stabilization, especially if such actions coincide with a seasonal upturn in demand in the latter part of Q3[4][1]. Additionally, government intervention—in the form of subsidies or other demand-stimulating measures—could provide a temporary floor for prices.

Because the current price is already so close to the key threshold and the predominant market drivers remain bearish, the likelihood of a brief dip below 70,000 CNY/T over the next 18 days is considerable. In commodity markets, such psychological or technical levels often act as magnets—at least in short bursts—during periods of volatility. The oversupply is not expected to resolve in the immediate term, and any seasonal demand recovery is not guaranteed to materialize with the strength needed to decisively reverse current momentum in such a short window[1][5].

Given these factors—and weighting the status quo outcome slightly more, since drastic market shifts are uncommon in short periods—yet recognizing how close the price already is to the threshold, the probability that lithium carbonate closes below 70,000 CNY/T at least once before October 1, 2024, is somewhat more likely than not.

**Probability: 65%**
