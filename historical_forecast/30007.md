I'll analyze the question about Apple stock's potential to remain below its all-time high through the end of 2024.

(a) Time until outcome is known: Approximately 7 months and 25 days (from May 6, 2025 to December 31, 2024, which has already passed).

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: Based on the search results, Apple stock was projected to be in the range of $220-$250 as 2024 drew to a close[5]. Since the all-time high is $237.49, there was a significant possibility that the stock could exceed this threshold before the end of 2024.

(c) Scenario for No outcome: Apple's strong Q4 earnings (projected around $93.4 billion in revenue) combined with holiday season sales and continued growth in its services division could have pushed investor confidence high enough to drive the stock price above $237.49 before December 31, 2024[5]. Analysts had projected potential prices as high as $240 by the end of December 2024[5].

(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: If Apple faced challenges from higher interest rates affecting its debt management, combined with the projected slowdown in revenue growth (around 1%), investor sentiment could have remained cautious enough to keep the stock price below $237.49 throughout 2024[5]. More conservative estimates suggested a price around $250, but actual performance could have been more modest.

Looking at the available information, I need to determine whether Apple stock remained continuously below $237.49 through the end of 2024. Since I'm analyzing this in May 2025, the outcome has already occurred, but I must base my forecast on the information provided in the search results.

According to the search results, as of October 1, 2024, analysts projected Apple's stock to maintain a price range between $220 and $250 by the end of 2024[5]. This range overlaps with the all-time high threshold of $237.49. Some analysts specifically predicted that the stock could hit $240 by the end of December 2024, which would exceed the threshold[5].

Another search result from October 20, 2023, indicated that Wall Street analysts expected the stock to rise to $205.84 over the following 12 months, with a Street-high target price of $240[4]. This suggests that by October 2024, some analysts believed prices could exceed the all-time high.

The most recent evidence from November 6, 2024, shows analysts projecting 21% growth in earnings per share to $7.40 for fiscal year 2025 (ending September 2025)[2]. This strong growth projection could have positively influenced stock prices in late 2024.

As a good forecaster, I acknowledge that the status quo tends to persist, and dramatic changes in stock prices are less common than stability. However, the available evidence suggests that Apple stock was on a trajectory that made exceeding $237.49 before the end of 2024 quite plausible.

Given the analyst projections of $220-$250 for the end of 2024, with specific mentions of $240 as a potential price target, and considering the strong projected Q4 2024 earnings, I believe there was a significant probability that Apple's stock would have exceeded its all-time high at some point before December 31, 2024.

Probability: 35%
