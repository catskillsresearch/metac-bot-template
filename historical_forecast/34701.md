(a) The outcome of this question will be known by April 1, 2025, which is less than 2 months from now. We're currently on May 6, 2025, so the outcome is already determined.

(b) The status quo outcome based on the search results indicates that Bitcoin dominance has already exceeded 63.0% in early February 2025, reaching 64.3%.

(c) A scenario resulting in a No outcome would have required Bitcoin dominance to stay below 63.0% throughout February and March 2025. This could have happened if altcoins had gained significant traction during this period, perhaps due to major innovations or increased institutional interest in cryptocurrencies beyond Bitcoin.

(d) A scenario resulting in a Yes outcome (which appears to have occurred) involved Bitcoin continuing its upward dominance trend from January 2025 (when it was around 55%) to exceed 63.0% in February or March 2025. This was supported by institutional preference for Bitcoin and a continuation of the trend JPMorgan analysts predicted.

Based on the search results provided, I can provide an informed analysis of Bitcoin dominance for February and March 2025.

According to the data available, Bitcoin dominance has already reached 64.3% in early February 2025[2]. This directly answers the question of whether Bitcoin dominance exceeded 63.0% on any single day in February or March 2025. Since the threshold was already crossed in early February, the answer is definitively yes.

The data shows a clear upward trajectory in Bitcoin dominance from late 2024 into early 2025. As of January 16, 2025, JPMorgan analysts reported Bitcoin dominance was "currently near 55%" and expected this dominance over Ethereum and other alternative tokens to continue throughout 2025[5]. By early February, this prediction had already proven accurate with dominance rising significantly to 64.3%.

This increase aligns with the historical pattern observed in the data. Bitcoin dominance had been below 50% in April 2024[2] but steadily increased in the following months. The JPMorgan analysis specifically cited expectations that Bitcoin's dominance would persist through 2025[5], providing additional support for the conclusion.

It's worth noting that some analysts like Benjamin Cowen predicted that Bitcoin dominance "will go down" at some point in 2025[3], but the timing of this potential decline was not specified, and the data shows it did not occur during February or early March 2025.

The evidence strongly indicates that Bitcoin dominance exceeded the 63.0% threshold during the specified timeframe. The upward trend from 55% in January to 64.3% in early February demonstrates a significant increase in Bitcoin's market share relative to other cryptocurrencies.

Probability: 100%
