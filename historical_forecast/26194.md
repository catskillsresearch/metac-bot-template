Based on the search results, I'll address your interview question about measles cases in the United States by first analyzing the timeline and potential scenarios.

(a) Time left until outcome: The outcome will be known on September 30, 2024, which is approximately 4.5 months from today (May 6, 2025).

(b) Status quo outcome: According to the most recent data from May 10, 2024, there were 132 confirmed measles cases reported in the United States for 2024[4]. If the current rate of cases continues, the total would exceed 200 cases before September 30, 2024.

(c) Scenario for No outcome: Measles cases could plateau or decrease if there is a significant increase in vaccination rates, particularly in communities with outbreaks. Additionally, if public health interventions successfully contain the current outbreaks and prevent new ones, the case count might stay below 200 by September 30.

(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: Given the current trajectory with 8 outbreaks already reported in 2024 and 69% of cases being outbreak-associated[4], continued spread within unvaccinated populations could easily push the total above 200 cases. The first quarter of 2024 alone saw 97 cases, which was a seventeenfold increase compared to the average for the same period in 2020-2023[2]. This rapid growth rate suggests the 200-case threshold will be crossed.

Looking at the evidence, several factors point to a high probability of exceeding 200 measles cases by September 30, 2024:

The data shows a significant acceleration in measles cases in 2024 compared to previous years. By March 28, 2024, there were already 97 confirmed cases, representing nearly 30% of all cases reported from January 2020 through March 2024[2]. This indicates a major uptick in transmission.

The May 10, 2024 report shows 132 total cases for 2024[4], demonstrating continued growth from the 97 cases reported through March 28. If this growth rate continues, the 200-case threshold would be crossed well before September.

The outbreak situation is concerning, with 8 outbreaks reported by May 2024[4], and the CDC data indicates these outbreaks have been driving the majority of cases (69% of all cases are outbreak-associated).

The vaccination status of cases is also notable - 81% of cases were in individuals who were either unvaccinated or had unknown vaccination status[4], suggesting a large vulnerable population that could sustain continued transmission.

I should note that the status quo already appears to be pointing toward exceeding 200 cases. The rate of cases in the first 4-5 months of 2024 (132 cases by May 10) suggests that without significant intervention, the 200-case threshold will be crossed before September 30.

While public health measures could potentially slow the spread, the momentum of current outbreaks, the high proportion of unvaccinated cases, and the historical pattern showing accelerated transmission in 2024 make it highly likely that the case count will exceed 200 by the specified date.

Probability: 90%
