I'll now assess this forecasting question about Ukraine's offensives into Russian territory on October 1, 2024.

(a) Time until outcome known: 48 days (August 14, 2024 to October 1, 2024)

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: Ukrainian forces currently hold territory at least five miles into Kursk Oblast only, with no confirmed advances of similar depth into other Russian oblasts.

(c) Scenario for a No outcome: Ukraine launches a new offensive into Belgorod, Bryansk, or another Russian oblast, advancing at least five miles across the border by October 1, 2024. Alternatively, Ukraine completely withdraws from Kursk Oblast before October 1, 2024, holding no Russian territory at the required depth.

(d) Scenario for a Yes outcome: Ukraine maintains its current positions in Kursk Oblast while not expanding operations into other Russian oblasts at the required depth. Russia fails to successfully push Ukrainian forces back from their current positions in Kursk.

The Ukrainian offensive into Russia's Kursk Oblast represents a significant shift in the war's dynamics. Beginning on August 6, 2024, Ukrainian forces have made confirmed advances up to 10 kilometers (approximately 6.2 miles) into Russian territory, penetrating at least two Russian defensive lines and a stronghold[2]. This incursion marks the largest into Russian territory since World War II, with Ukrainian troops equipped with Western-provided vehicles quickly seizing several settlements[3].

This offensive clearly meets the question's criteria of Ukrainian forces holding territory at least five miles inside Russia's borders, specifically in Kursk Oblast. As of mid-August 2024, there are no confirmed reports of similar Ukrainian incursions reaching this depth in any other Russian oblast.

Several factors suggest the status quo is likely to persist until October 1:

1. **Established Ukrainian presence**: Ukrainian forces have already built defensive positions in Kursk Oblast, suggesting they plan to maintain these positions for an extended period[5].

2. **Russian response limitations**: Russia has established a counterterrorism operation in response, rather than declaring a state of war or martial law, indicating a desire to downplay the incursion and avoid domestic panic[1]. This less aggressive response may limit Russia's ability to quickly reclaim territory.

3. **Russian command challenges**: The Russian response appears hampered by "a complicated command and control arrangement" under FSB Director Bortnikov, which "may degrade the effectiveness of the Russian response to Ukraine's operation"[1].

4. **Historical precedent**: The Wikipedia entry notes that despite Putin setting deadlines to push Ukrainian troops out of Kursk, Russian forces had not succeeded in doing so by the end of January 2025, suggesting a prolonged Ukrainian presence[5].

However, several factors could lead to changes in the current situation:

1. **Potential Russian counteroffensive**: Russia may successfully mount a counteroffensive to reclaim Kursk territory before October 1, though their initial response has been disorganized.

2. **Ukrainian strategic decisions**: Ukraine could decide to withdraw from Kursk or expand operations into other oblasts based on military or political considerations.

3. **Seasonal factors**: As autumn approaches, changing weather conditions could affect military operations, potentially limiting further advances or facilitating withdrawals.

While expanding to other oblasts is possible, Ukraine appears to be focused on securing and holding their gains in Kursk rather than opening additional fronts. The element with greatest uncertainty is whether Russia can mount an effective counteroffensive to push Ukrainian forces out of Kursk before October 1.

Considering the established Ukrainian positions, the challenges facing Russian counteroffensive operations, and the relatively short timeframe until October 1, the most likely outcome is that Ukraine will maintain its current presence in Kursk Oblast while not expanding to other oblasts at the required depth.

Probability: 75%
