(a) **Time until outcome known:**  
As of November 20, 2024, there are just over three weeks until Kraven the Hunter's opening weekend (December 13–15, 2024), at which point official box office figures will be reported by Box Office Mojo—thus, the outcome will be known in approximately 24 days.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changes:**  
Current industry forecasts, including BoxOfficeTheory and Variety, predict a domestic opening weekend of $13–16 million for Kraven the Hunter[1][5]. This estimate is below the $20 million threshold.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
If current pre-release tracking holds, and there is no significant late surge in marketing or audience interest, Kraven the Hunter will open to less than or equal to $20 million domestically. This would be in line with "soft" press buzz, weak precedents (e.g., Madame Web's $15.3 million debut), and reports of lackluster early reactions[1][5].

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
If there is an unforeseen increase in audience interest due to a viral marketing push, surprisingly positive word-of-mouth, or a sharp uptick in pre-release ticket sales, the film could see a stronger-than-expected opening, potentially surpassing the $20 million mark. December releases sometimes benefit from walk-up business or holiday surges, though these are more likely to help legs rather than opening frame.

## Rationale

Most recent and credible box office tracking has steadily trended downward for Kraven the Hunter, with multiple sources now consensus at $13–16 million for opening weekend[1][5]. This is reinforced by weak social media and press reactions, and an industry narrative that positions Sony's Spider-Man Universe as losing commercial momentum outside the Venom franchise[4][5]. The comparable recent performance of Madame Web, which opened at $15.3 million, sets a low bar that Kraven may only slightly exceed, if at all.

While holiday releases can sometimes deliver upside surprises, this effect is more relevant to a film's total run than its specific opening weekend. There is still time for Sony to attempt a final marketing push, but no signs as of November 2024 point to a turnaround of the scale needed to change the outcome. Industry forecasts rarely shift dramatically in the final weeks barring shockingly good reviews or viral pre-release buzz, neither of which are evident here.

Given all currently available evidence and typical box office dynamics, the status quo outcome (sub-$20 million opening) should be weighted most heavily.
