(a) **Time Left Until Outcome is Known:**  
There are just over 1 month left until October 1, 2024, the resolution date for this question.

(b) **Status Quo Outcome if Nothing Changed:**  
Plug Power has not filed for bankruptcy protection as of August 28, 2024. Its most recent public statements and SEC filings indicate ongoing financial distress, but also efforts to secure additional funding, operational improvements, and no announced intent to file for bankruptcy[2][5]. Therefore, if the situation remains unchanged, the status quo outcome would be “No”—Plug Power will not file for bankruptcy before October 1, 2024.

(c) **Scenario Leading to a No Outcome:**  
Plug Power continues to operate, manages to maintain enough liquidity through additional partnerships, government support, or capital raises, and does not file for bankruptcy protection. The leadership team delivers on short-term stabilization (e.g., operational improvements, cost-cutting, or government loans), and no catastrophic developments (such as sudden loss of key financing or operational failure) occur before October 1, 2024[2][5].

(d) **Scenario Leading to a Yes Outcome:**  
Plug Power encounters an acute cash crisis, cannot secure additional funding from investors, lenders, or government sources, and runs out of working capital. This results in the company’s board deciding to file for bankruptcy protection under the United States Bankruptcy Code before October 1, 2024. This scenario could be triggered by a failed fundraising round, significant customer loss, or market events that further erode its ability to operate as a going concern[5].

## Rationale

- The “going concern” warning and persistent losses create elevated risk—Plug Power faces a real possibility of distress[5].
- However, the company has made efforts to secure financing and has publicly expressed confidence in its near-term viability as of August 2024[2][4]. There is no recent public signal of impending bankruptcy, and the company continues to pursue operational and strategic milestones.
- Bankruptcy tends to be a last resort, and companies often continue operations under strained financial conditions, especially if there is hope of external support or improvement.
- The status quo, given the short window until October 1, 2024, and absent any announced catastrophic event, is that Plug Power will not file before the deadline if current trends continue.

## Final Probability Estimate
