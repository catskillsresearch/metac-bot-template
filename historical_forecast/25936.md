(a) **Time until resolution:**  
There are about 83 days remaining until September 30, 2024.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
Since the last confirmed strike on the Crimean Bridge was in July 2023 and no credible public reports indicate a successful new strike since the eligibility window opened on May 2, 2024, the current status quo is "No attack qualifying under the question's criteria has occurred since May 2, 2024."[3][5]

(c) **Scenario for a No outcome:**  
Despite ongoing threats, statements of intent by Ukraine, and sporadic explosions reported in the vicinity, no attack physically strikes the bridge (road or rail span or immediate approaches) before September 30, 2024, or any attempted attacks are intercepted or fail to hit the structure in a way that meets the question’s threat criteria.

(d) **Scenario for a Yes outcome:**  
A missile, drone, or other weapon strikes and credibly threatens the integrity of the Crimean Bridge (road or rail span or approaches) before September 30, 2024, with credible reporting confirming the impact as meeting the question's criteria. This could result from a successful Ukrainian operation, an act of sabotage, or a terrorist attack that clearly hits the bridge.

## Rationale

The frequency of attacks on the Crimean Bridge establishes it as a high-profile military and symbolic target. The bridge was successfully struck in October 2022 and July 2023[3], demonstrating both intent and capability on the Ukrainian side despite substantial Russian air defenses and security measures[2]. Ukraine’s defense intelligence has stated a goal of disabling the bridge in the first half of 2024, and speculation around major symbolic dates (such as Putin’s May 2024 inauguration) reflects ongoing operational planning and psychological warfare.

Recent reporting confirms persistent threats, with explosions near Kerch and regular disruptions or closures of the bridge, though as of early July 2024, no credible report asserts a confirmed strike on the bridge structure itself in the relevant time window[5]. Russian authorities have enhanced security—including multi-layered air defense and physical barriers such as barges and radar traps—yet military experts note these may be insufficient against modern weapons, especially if Ukraine can launch from closer positions[2].

Still, history shows that successful attacks are rare (two in over two years), and Russian defensive adaptations and changes in logistical routes demonstrate some deterrent impact[1]. The Ukrainian military may also face resource constraints, shifting battlefield priorities, or political calculations affecting whether and when a high-risk operation is attempted.

Given these factors, while further attempts are highly likely, the actual probability of a successful, qualifying strike in the next 83 days is lower than the probability of status quo maintenance, but still significant due to explicit Ukrainian intent, historical precedent, and ongoing regional instability.
