(a) Time left until outcome: There are less than 8 months remaining until January 1, 2025 (from May 6, 2025).

(b) Status quo outcome: Currently, there are nine nuclear-armed states (United States, Russia, United Kingdom, France, China, India, Pakistan, Israel, and North Korea), and this has been stable for several years. If nothing changes, no new nuclear-armed state will emerge before January 1, 2025.

(c) Scenario for No outcome: No country successfully develops and tests a nuclear weapon in the next 8 months due to technical challenges, international monitoring, diplomatic consequences, and the limited timeframe. Iran, the most likely threshold state, continues development but doesn't reach the testing stage by year's end.

(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: Iran, facing increasing regional tensions, accelerates its nuclear program and conducts a surprise underground test in late 2024. International monitoring systems detect the test, and intelligence agencies confirm Iran as a new nuclear power.

As a forecaster, I recognize that the status quo tends to persist in international relations, especially regarding such consequential developments as nuclear proliferation. The development of nuclear weapons is a complex, time-intensive process that typically requires years rather than months to complete.

Currently, nine countries possess nuclear weapons: the United States, Russia, the United Kingdom, France, China, India, Pakistan, North Korea, and Israel (though Israel does not officially acknowledge its arsenal)[1][3]. This nuclear landscape has remained unchanged for several years.

While there are concerns about nuclear proliferation, the timeline for a new state to develop and successfully test a nuclear weapon by January 1, 2025, is extremely compressed. As of mid-2024, all nine nuclear states are modernizing or expanding their arsenals, with China expanding its nuclear arsenal faster than any other country[2]. However, this does not indicate the emergence of a new nuclear state.

Iran is generally considered the primary threshold state with the technical capacity to potentially develop nuclear weapons. However, for Iran to become nuclear-armed before January 2025, it would need to make a political decision to pursue weapons, convert existing capabilities into weapons, and conduct a test or announce its nuclear status. Historical precedent suggests this process typically requires more time than the remaining months of 2024.

The extensive international monitoring systems would likely detect preparations for nuclear tests, creating significant diplomatic consequences for any state attempting to join the nuclear club[5]. Additionally, the resolution criteria require credible evidence of a successful nuclear test, which raises the threshold for confirmation.

Given these factors—the technical barriers, international monitoring, diplomatic consequences, and extremely limited timeframe—the emergence of a new nuclear-armed state before January 1, 2025, is highly unlikely. While geopolitical tensions could theoretically accelerate nuclear decision-making in threshold states, the historical pattern of nuclear development suggests longer timelines are required.
