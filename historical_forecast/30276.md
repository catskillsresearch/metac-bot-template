As a professional forecaster, I'll analyze the question about whether FBI firearms background checks initiated through NICS will exceed 2.4M for November 2024.

(a) Time until outcome: The outcome will be known in early December 2024 when November 2024 figures are reported. Given today's date (May 6, 2025), this outcome is already known, but I'll analyze as if we're forecasting from before the outcome.

(b) Status quo outcome: Based on the search results, November 2023 had 2,652,870 unadjusted NICS checks, which exceeds the 2.4M threshold[5]. This suggests that if patterns remain similar, November 2024 would also exceed 2.4M checks.

(c) Scenario for a No outcome: A significant cooling of the firearms market could occur if economic conditions worsen, reducing discretionary spending. Additionally, if political tensions ease or regulatory concerns diminish leading up to the November 2024 election, we might see lower motivation for firearms purchases, keeping the number below 2.4M.

(d) Scenario for a Yes outcome: With November 2024 coinciding with the presidential election and the search results indicating year-over-year monthly increases since July 2024, political uncertainty could drive significant firearms purchases. Additionally, November typically includes Black Friday, which in 2023 saw record NICS checks[5]. These factors combined could push numbers well above 2.4M.

## Historical Context and Trends

Looking at the historical data, November has traditionally been a strong month for firearms background checks. In November 2023, the FBI processed 2,652,870 total background checks[5]. While this represented a 5.6% decline from November 2022's 2,788,138 checks, it's important to note that both figures significantly exceed the 2.4M threshold we're considering[5].

The search results mention that November 2023 included "the largest number of NICS checks conducted on Black Friday since the system was established in 1998"[5]. Black Friday promotions typically drive a significant spike in firearms purchases, and this pattern is likely to continue in 2024.

## Recent Trends and Leading Indicators

The query mentions that "starting in July 2024, year-over-year monthly numbers have again begun trending upward." This recent reversal from the post-2020 downward trend is particularly significant. The search results corroborate this pattern shift, noting that the fourth quarter of 2023 saw more than 4.7 million background checks, representing a 4.6% increase over the same period in 2022[5].

November 2023's adjusted figure (removing permit checks and rechecks) was 1,595,476, which was 5% higher than November 2022's adjusted figure[5]. This indicates growing retail firearms sales even as overall NICS checks had declined.

## Election Year Effects

November 2024 coincides with the U.S. presidential election. Historically, elections and potential changes in firearms policy have driven increases in firearms purchases. The uncertainty surrounding policy changes, especially in a polarized political environment, typically motivates purchases among those concerned about potential restrictions.

## Seasonal Patterns

November consistently sees strong firearms sales due to:
- Black Friday sales and promotions
- Holiday shopping season beginning
- Hunting season in many states
- End-of-year purchasing decisions

## Final Assessment

The status quo strongly suggests exceeding 2.4M checks for November 2024. November 2023's total was already approximately 2.65M, and November 2022's was even higher at about 2.79M[5]. With the documented uptick in year-over-year numbers beginning in July 2024, combined with the presidential election in November 2024, there are compelling reasons to expect numbers to exceed the 2.4M threshold.

The primary risk factors that could lead to a No outcome would be a significant economic downturn affecting discretionary spending or unexpected policy changes that dampen firearms demand. However, these seem less likely than the continuation of established patterns.

Given the historical November figures consistently above 2.4M, the recent upward trend in monthly numbers, and the additional stimulus of a presidential election, I assess the probability of exceeding 2.4M NICS checks in November 2024 to be very high.

Probability: 85%
