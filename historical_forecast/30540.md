(a) **Time left until outcome known:**  
The outcome will be known on December 30, 2024. As of November 27, 2024, that is just over 1 month (about 33 days) away.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
Biden’s 538 approval rating has recently hovered around 37.7% (as of December 2023)[4], and has remained steadily below 40% for an extended period[3][4]. Approval has been below his disapproval rating for over three years[3], and there are no recent signs of significant upward momentum or a major rally.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
The most likely scenario under current trends is that Biden’s 538 approval rating remains below 38.5% through December 30. This would continue a pattern of historic unpopularity, with economic concerns and international events keeping approval stagnant or drifting slightly lower as pollsters include any late-year negative sentiment[3][4].

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
A Yes outcome would require Biden’s approval rating to rise by at least a percentage point, reaching or exceeding 38.5% by December 30. This could occur if there is a significant positive event for the administration (such as an economic turnaround, legislative win, or foreign policy success), or if holiday or post-election dynamics temporarily boost his standing. Alternatively, a shift in polling methodologies or a sudden change in the opposition’s fortunes could help move the 538 average up.

## Rationale

Biden’s 538 approval rating has been at historic lows for a modern president, recently sitting at 37.7%[4]. There is no evidence in late 2024 of a bounce or sustained improvement, and the approval average is a lagging, smoothed metric that responds slowly to new polls[5]. While small, short-term fluctuations are possible, meaningful upward movement above 38.5% would require a notable and positive change in public opinion or polling composition in a very short time. Historically, late-year ratings change little unless driven by major, widely-perceived events. Given the trends, and barring an unexpected development, the status quo outcome is the best guide.

**Probability: 25%**
