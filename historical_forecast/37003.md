(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
The 2025 Viennese state election date is not specified in the search results, but as of May 6, 2025, the election has not occurred, and a few months or less likely remain until the outcome is known.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
Historically, the Social Democratic Party of Austria (SPÖ) has dominated Vienna’s state elections. Recent polling, including the March 24, 2025 IFDD poll, as well as general analyses, confirm that the SPÖ continues to lead in Vienna and is favored to win a plurality of seats if current trends persist[5][3][1].

(c) **Scenario for a No outcome:**  
A plausible No outcome would occur if the Freedom Party of Austria (FPÖ) or another party rapidly increased its support in Vienna, perhaps due to a significant local issue, a powerful late campaign surge, or a scandal affecting the SPÖ that erodes its urban base. This would require an abrupt and unusual shift in public sentiment, given Vienna’s long-standing center-left voting patterns and SPÖ’s entrenched organizational strength[5][3].

(d) **Scenario for a Yes outcome:**  
A Yes outcome arises if the SPÖ maintains its current lead, benefiting from its urban appeal, established voter base, and alignment with Viennese priorities on issues like immigration and integration[3]. Given historical precedents and recent polling, this is the most likely scenario.

**Rationale:**  
Expert forecasters put added emphasis on the status quo because major electoral realignments, especially in established urban strongholds, are rare and usually require sustained shifts in voter sentiment or dramatic events. In Vienna, where the SPÖ has a long record of electoral strength, and where recent polling and analyses still show them ahead, the default expectation is that the SPÖ will again win the most seats[5][3][1]. Urban voters in Vienna have shown resilience to national far-right surges, and while national dynamics are in flux, Vienna’s political culture remains distinctively social democratic.

**Probability: 85%**
