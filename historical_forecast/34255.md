(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  
From January 28, 2025 to April 1, 2025 is just over 2 months (approximately 63 days).

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
Virgin Galactic does not post any new news updates before April 1, 2025. The last observed pattern is a five-month gap between posts, most recently from July to December 2024.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
Virgin Galactic publishes a new post on its News page before April 1, 2025. This could occur if there is a notable development, such as progress in the Italian spaceport feasibility study, a significant milestone in its fleet upgrade, or a corporate update—such as financial results or a strategic partnership.

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
Virgin Galactic makes no new posts on its News page before April 1, 2025, maintaining a quiet period consistent with past behavior during its operational hiatus and irregular news posting schedule.

## Rationale

Virgin Galactic’s news posting behavior is notably sporadic. In 2024, there was a five-month gap between news posts (July 10 to December 12)[1]. This pattern suggests that updates are event-driven rather than scheduled, and long periods of silence between posts are common.

The company is now in a two-year hiatus to upgrade its fleet, indicating fewer major operational milestones or launches to announce[4]. The most recent activity relates to the feasibility study for an Italian spaceport, but public indications are that phase one of this study will conclude sometime in 2025, without a specific timeline pointing to Q1[4]. Unless the study concludes ahead of schedule or another significant event arises (such as an unplanned business update or new partnership), there is little reason to expect a news post before April 1.

Financial results and investor communications could prompt updates, but posted financial results typically appear on the Investor Relations page rather than being cross-posted to the News page, and no such event is specifically scheduled for Q1 2025 on the News page currently[3].

Given the above, *the status quo strongly favors no new post*, and the world tends to change slowly in the absence of compelling triggers. Absent external shocks or surprises, it is reasonable to forecast continued silence on Virgin Galactic’s News page through March 2025.
