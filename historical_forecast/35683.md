(a) Time left until outcome: 26 days (from March 5, 2025 to March 31, 2025)

(b) Status quo outcome: The Diversity Visa program website remains online, as it has been consistently operating for decades with annual cycles.

(c) Scenario for No outcome: An unexpected executive order or emergency policy change discontinues the DV program before March 31, 2025, resulting in the removal of the website or making it inaccessible.

(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: The DV program continues its normal operations through March 31, 2025, with the website remaining accessible as expected for the DV-2025 cycle that runs until September 30, 2025.

Based on the available evidence, there are strong indicators that the US State Department's Diversity Visa page will remain online through March 31, 2025:

## Current Program Status

The Diversity Visa Program for fiscal year 2025 (DV-2025) is actively in progress. Up to 55,000 diversity visas have been allocated for this period[1]. The entry period for DV-2025 already completed in November 2023, and the selection results became available starting May 4, 2024[3][5]. This demonstrates that the program is following its normal operational timeline for the 2025 cycle.

Importantly, the DV-2025 program infrastructure is explicitly designed to remain operational until at least September 30, 2025. Entrants have been instructed to maintain their confirmation information through this date to check their status through the official E-DV website[5]. This indicates a clear intention by the State Department to maintain the online infrastructure well beyond March 31, 2025.

## Statutory Foundation and Historical Continuity

The DV program is established by federal statute under Section 203(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act[1]. This gives it a strong legal foundation that would typically require congressional action to modify or eliminate. The program has operated continuously for many years, with a consistent pattern of annual cycles.

Even when there have been political discussions about the program (such as the referenced 2017 tweet), the actual implementation has continued uninterrupted. There have been no recent legislative changes or executive orders indicating imminent discontinuation of the program.

## Recent Updates and Activity

The DV-2025 program has shown recent activity, with status checks becoming available starting May 4, 2024[5]. The US Embassy in the Democratic Republic of Congo published information about the program on May 6, 2024, confirming its continued operation[3]. This demonstrates active maintenance and updating of program information across government websites.

The fact that the program instructions note only minor changes in eligibility (the UK and its territories becoming eligible) for DV-2025 indicates business-as-usual operations with no major disruptions planned[1].

## Risk Factors

While unlikely, there are scenarios that could lead to the website becoming unavailable:
- An emergency executive action targeting immigration programs
- Technical issues or website restructuring
- A major policy shift in immigration enforcement

However, the short timeframe (26 days) makes dramatic policy shifts less likely. Additionally, even if new policies were announced, the implementation timeline would likely extend beyond March 31, especially for a program with ongoing obligations to current applicants.

Given the program's statutory basis, established operational timeline extending to September 2025, recent activity, and absence of any indications of planned discontinuation, the most reasonable forecast strongly favors the continued availability of the website.

Probability: 93%
