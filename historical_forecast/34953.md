(a) **Time left until the outcome:**  
March 15, 2025, is approximately 5 weeks (about 33 days) from today, February 11, 2025.

(b) **Outcome if nothing changed:**  
The outcome is based on the number of daily likers reported by Jaz's Bluesky Index for March 15, 2025. Although exact daily liker data is not published in the provided sources, we know that as of early 2025, Bluesky reported around 3.2–3.5 million daily active users (DAUs), with the majority from the US and UK[1][2]. Historically, daily likers on social platforms tend to be a significant subset of DAUs—often 20–40%, but this can vary by platform and engagement level.

Given the context of slowing engagement and anecdotal reports of minimal interaction for some brands as of January 2025 (despite growth in user base)[2], if current engagement levels hold, a reasonable baseline estimate for daily likers is about 25–35% of DAUs.

Assuming 3.3 million DAUs, that suggests:
- 25% of DAUs like at least one post = 825,000 daily likers
- 35% of DAUs like at least one post = 1,155,000 daily likers

If the current engagement pattern persists, the number could hover in that range.

(c) **Outcome if the current trend continued:**  
User growth remains robust, but engagement growth is slowing and potentially even declining as the novelty wears off and the platform matures[2][4]. If the proportion of users who interact with likes declines slightly while DAUs increase modestly, the number of daily likers could:

- Stay roughly flat or decline slightly as a percentage of users, even as the user base grows.  
- For example, if DAUs grow to 3.7 million but engagement dips to 22% daily likers, that yields ~814,000 daily likers.

Trend-based models therefore suggest a range slightly below the baseline, perhaps 750,000 to 1,050,000 daily likers on March 15, 2025.

(d) **Expectations of experts and markets:**  
There are no direct market forecasts, but industry commentary notes that brand engagement is minimal and "slowing," despite healthy DAUs[2]. This implies skepticism from social media professionals about a rapid uptick in daily likes. The broad expectation is for continued softening of the daily liker ratio as Bluesky transitions from novelty to maturity in its user lifecycle.

(e) **Unexpected scenario resulting in a low outcome:**  
A significant platform outage, controversial policy change, or public relations mishap could sharply reduce user engagement for several days or weeks. For example: a major data breach or widespread spam/bot problem could blunt daily activity and engagement, causing daily likers to drop well below historic levels, potentially to only 10–15% of DAUs (roughly 320,000–500,000).

(f) **Unexpected scenario resulting in a high outcome:**  
A viral event—such as a globally trending meme, breaking news, or a high-profile celebrity joining and engaging on Bluesky—could lead to a short-term engagement spike. If, say, a major cultural moment unfolds and DAUs spike to 4.5 million, with 40% liking at least one post, daily likers could surge briefly to 1,800,000.
