(a) **Time Left Until Outcome Is Known**  
There are roughly one month and one day left until October 1, 2024, the deadline for Taylor Swift to publicly endorse Kamala Harris.

(b) **Status Quo Outcome If Nothing Changes**  
As of August 30, 2024, Taylor Swift has not publicly endorsed Kamala Harris or any other presidential candidate for 2024[1][2][3]. If nothing changes before the deadline, the outcome will be "No."

(c) **Scenario Resulting in a No Outcome**  
Taylor Swift continues to refrain from making any public statements of support, direct endorsements, or official declarations regarding Kamala Harris's presidential campaign prior to October 1, 2024. Even if rumors, indirect hints, or fan speculation arise, without an explicit statement, official announcement, or unambiguous report from credible sources, the question will resolve as "No."[1][2][3]

(d) **Scenario Resulting in a Yes Outcome**  
Before October 1, 2024, Taylor Swift issues a clear, official, and public statement—whether through her own or her representatives’ social media, press release, or direct comment—unambiguously endorsing Kamala Harris for president. Such a statement would explicitly support Harris’s campaign or declare Swift’s vote for her, and would be reported by credible sources as an endorsement.

**Rationale:**  
Taylor Swift has a recent history of political engagement, having endorsed the Biden-Harris ticket in 2020[2][3]. Her popularity gives her endorsement considerable political weight, and there have been persistent rumors and pressure for her to take a stand in the current cycle. However, fact-checking as of late August 2024 shows that all alleged or viral hints of a Harris endorsement have been misinterpretations or wishful thinking; Swift remains publicly silent on a 2024 endorsement[1][2].  

Although political and media speculation suggests she is a likely Harris supporter, and Democratic strategists reportedly hope for her endorsement, there is no direct evidence yet of her intent to make a public statement before the October 1 deadline. Historically, Swift has waited until fairly close to elections to make endorsements, but with just a month remaining, the absence of any apparent campaign or preparatory messaging reduces the odds of an imminent declaration.

Given that the world changes slowly and the status quo often persists—especially in high-profile, carefully managed public relations scenarios—the base rate favors "No" unless concrete movement occurs soon. However, there is a non-negligible probability that late-campaign developments or strategic considerations could prompt Swift to endorse Harris at the last minute.
