Based on the search results provided, I'll analyze the likelihood of diplomatic expulsions or recalls between the Philippines and China before September 30, 2024.

(a) Time remaining until outcome is known: Approximately 4 months and 24 days (from May 6, 2025 to September 30, 2024)

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: No diplomatic expulsions or recalls have yet occurred between the Philippines and China, despite escalating tensions.

(c) Scenario resulting in No outcome: Ongoing diplomatic efforts succeed in de-escalating tensions, with both countries prioritizing economic ties and stability in the region over symbolic diplomatic actions. The Philippines continues to express strong rhetoric but ultimately decides against expulsion, while China exercises restraint to avoid pushing the Philippines closer to the US.

(d) Scenario resulting in Yes outcome: The controversy over alleged wiretapping of Philippine naval officers by Chinese diplomats escalates, with the Philippine government concluding its investigation and finding clear violations of anti-wiretapping laws. Under pressure from defense officials and public opinion, the Philippines expels the implicated Chinese diplomats, potentially triggering retaliatory expulsions from China.

Given the search results provided, I see significant evidence pointing toward possible diplomatic expulsions or recalls before September 30, 2024:

The Philippines' National Security Adviser Eduardo Ano has already called for the expulsion of Chinese diplomats over an alleged leaked telephonic conversation on May 10, 2024[1]. This represents an official, high-level call for diplomatic expulsions, which is a strong indicator of potential action.

Philippine Defense Secretary Teodoro has explicitly endorsed the expulsion of Chinese diplomats involved in wiretapping Philippine officials, stating "We must find out who is responsible for this and remove them from the Republic of the Philippines"[4]. This suggests that key security officials are actively pushing for expulsions.

Justice Secretary Jesus Crispin Remulla has instructed the National Bureau of Investigation to conduct a comprehensive investigation into the alleged illegal wiretapping activities of Chinese diplomats[2]. The outcome of this investigation could provide the formal justification needed for expulsions.

Philippine-China relations are described as "reaching a new and dangerous nadir, one which could trigger tit-for-tat diplomatic expulsions"[4]. This assessment from Asia Times indicates that diplomatic observers see expulsions as a realistic possibility.

However, there are also factors suggesting restraint:

The Philippine government's response has been described as "mixed," with some officials calling for investigations and potential expulsions while others have taken different positions[2].

The search results indicate ongoing diplomatic channels between the two countries, suggesting both sides may prefer to avoid further escalation that would damage bilateral relations.

The timeframe is relatively short (less than 5 months from the date of the search results), which may not be sufficient for the investigation to conclude and formal diplomatic actions to be taken.

Weighing these factors, I believe there is a substantial but not overwhelming probability of diplomatic expulsions or recalls occurring before September 30, 2024. The explicit calls from high-ranking officials, ongoing investigation, and deteriorating bilateral relations all point toward increased likelihood of expulsions. However, diplomatic inertia, economic considerations, and the possibility of de-escalation through ongoing talks provide counterbalancing factors.

Probability: 65%
