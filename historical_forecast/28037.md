(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
There are about 19 days remaining in September 2024 before the question will be resolved using National Hurricane Center (NHC) reports published as of October 1, 2024.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
As of September 12, 2024, no major (Category 3+) Atlantic hurricanes have occurred in September. If current conditions persisted with no new developments, the outcome would be "No major hurricanes in September 2024."

(c) **Scenario for a No outcome:**  
The remainder of September 2024 passes without any Atlantic hurricanes reaching Category 3 status or higher. This could occur if inhibiting factors (such as increased wind shear, dry air, or unfavorable atmospheric conditions) persist, suppressing the formation or intensification of storms.

(d) **Scenario for a Yes outcome:**  
One or more Atlantic hurricanes strengthen to Category 3 or higher at any point from September 13 to September 30, 2024. This could happen rapidly given the forecasted above-average conditions and the historical tendency for major hurricanes to occur during this period, especially if weather patterns become more conducive to storm development.

## Rationale

- **Historical context:** September is climatologically the peak month for Atlantic hurricane activity, with the greatest likelihood for major hurricanes to form[1][2].
- **2024 season forecasts:** All major forecasting agencies (NOAA, TSR, AccuWeather) project an above-average season, with 4–7 major hurricanes possible, driven by La Niña development and record-warm Atlantic sea surface temperatures[1][3].
- **Current observations:** As of September 12, 2024, no major hurricanes have formed in the Atlantic in September. The month began unusually quiet, but the peak risk period is ongoing and could produce rapid changes[5].
- **Atmospheric and oceanic factors:** The anticipated transition to La Niña, combined with very warm SSTs, creates a favorable environment for rapid intensification events, even if the first part of September was quiet[3][5].

Good forecasters weigh the status quo heavily but must also account for the elevated baseline risk in September, especially in a season with strong consensus on above-normal activity. While the first 12 days have been quiet, the majority of historical major hurricanes form after this point in the month. One or more major hurricanes forming in the remainder of September is a realistic possibility, supported by both the seasonal outlook and the climatology.

**Probability: 70%**  
There is a strong likelihood that at least one major Atlantic hurricane (Category 3 or higher) will occur in September 2024, given the historical peak, ongoing favorable conditions, and above-normal season forecasts, despite the quiet start to the month[1][2][3].
