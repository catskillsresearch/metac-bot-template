(a) Time left until the outcome is known:
- The outcome will be known shortly after March 31, 2025, once INMET releases the cumulative rainfall data for the month, and no later than April 7, 2025. As of today (March 11, 2025), there are about 27 days left until the data will be available.

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed:
- If rainfall follows its long-term climatological average, Brasília would receive approximately 132 mm of rain in March, based on recent historical data[2].

(c) Outcome if the current trend continued:
- Brasília recently exited a record-breaking drought (167 days without rain) and had the hottest September on record, with 2024 expected to be among the hottest years. If abnormally dry or hot conditions persist, rainfall in March could be below the long-term average but it is also possible for a rebound (above-average rain) to occur if the delayed wet season "catches up." Recent years have demonstrated both suppressed and compensatory rain patterns after droughts, making this uncertain.

(d) Expectations of experts and markets:
- Experts expect March in Brasília to be a reliably rainy month within the wet season, typically receiving between 132 mm[2] and 202 mm[1] of rainfall, with estimates of about 19 to 25 rainy days[2][1]. Some regional forecasts for Brazil in March show even higher typical values, up to 183 mm, though this likely reflects broader areas or different stations[5]. Given the transition from drought, there is a moderate risk for lower-than-average rainfall, but the climatological signal remains strong for a wet March.

(e) Unexpected scenario resulting in a low outcome:
- An unexpected continuation of the drought or a new episode of atmospheric blocking (such as a persistent high-pressure system or a strong El Niño effect), could suppress rainfall significantly, potentially resulting in March totals below 50 mm.

(f) Unexpected scenario resulting in a high outcome:
- If the delayed wet season leads to heavy, compensatory rainfall events (such as unusually persistent convective systems or an active South Atlantic Convergence Zone), March could see substantially above-average rain, potentially exceeding 220 mm.
