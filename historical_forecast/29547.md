(a) **Time remaining until outcome:**  
As of November 4, 2024, there are just under 2 months (approximately 8 weeks) until the Forbes Real-Time Billionaires List’s ranking on December 31, 2024, will resolve the question.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
Elon Musk is currently ranked first, with a net worth of $260.8 billion, leading Larry Ellison by about $49.2 billion and Mark Zuckerberg by $55.8 billion. If these standings and relative gaps remained unchanged, Musk would remain the richest person on December 31, 2024.

(c) **Scenario for a No outcome:**  
A “No” outcome would occur if, by year-end, another billionaire (such as Larry Ellison or Mark Zuckerberg) overtakes Musk on the Forbes list. This could happen via:
- A sharp decline in Tesla’s stock price, which constitutes a large share of Musk’s wealth
- A surge in Ellison’s Oracle shares or Zuckerberg’s Meta shares, possibly combined with positive developments for their other assets
- Negative events for Musk’s other holdings (e.g., SpaceX or xAI), or regulatory/legal setbacks affecting his net worth[1][2]

(d) **Scenario for a Yes outcome:**  
A “Yes” outcome would occur simply if Musk maintains his current lead and finishes in first place on the Forbes Real-Time Billionaires List on December 31, 2024. This would be supported by:
- Continued or stable performance in Tesla and SpaceX valuations
- Absence of abrupt stock market corrections harming Musk’s holdings disproportionately
- No extraordinary wealth gain by close competitors[1]

## Rationale

Musk currently holds a lead of approximately $49 billion over his nearest rival. This is a substantial buffer, especially given just eight weeks until the year-end cutoff. Historically, while Musk’s wealth (and those of his peers) has shown significant volatility—both up and down[2][3]—a swing of $49 billion in this timeframe, though possible, would require either a major rally in a competitor’s primary assets or a steep, sudden decline in Tesla or SpaceX’s valuations.

Significant events earlier in 2024 (such as Musk losing his Tesla compensation package, or a 9% increase in Meta shares netting Zuckerberg $14 billion in a single month)[1][2] underscore that fortunes can shift quickly. However, catching up to Musk’s current lead would require one or more competitors to repeat such large gains in consecutive months, or for Musk to suffer a corresponding loss.

Stock market and tech sector volatility, legal/risk exposures, and competitor momentum are all real risks. Still, barring an extraordinary event, Musk’s position is statistically favored to endure, as very large wealth swings typically require several months of compounding events or a market-wide shock.

**Good forecasters give extra weight to the status quo, especially when the size of the lead and the time remaining are both substantial.**

Probability: **82%**
