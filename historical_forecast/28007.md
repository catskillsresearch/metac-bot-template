(a) **Time left until outcome known:**  
From September 9, 2024, to October 1, 2024, there are **22 days** remaining until the AAA national gas price will be observed for resolution.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
As of September 8, 2024, the national average price reported by AAA is $3.273 per gallon—**above** the $3.25 threshold. If prices remain flat, the answer resolves **Yes**.

(c) **Scenario for a No outcome:**  
A No outcome would occur if the national average gas price falls by at least $0.024 (from $3.273 to $3.249 or lower) over the next three weeks. This could result from an unexpected and sustained drop in crude oil prices, a surge in refinery output or inventories, a sudden demand shock (such as a major economic event), or relief from seasonal gasoline blend requirements. However, no such major events have recently occurred, and post-summer declines over a three-week period are typically more modest unless driven by significant external factors[5][3][1].

(d) **Scenario for a Yes outcome:**  
A Yes outcome is most likely if gasoline prices remain stable or decrease only slightly—a standard pattern in early fall—or if any supply disruptions (hurricanes, geopolitical tensions) occur, which could even push prices higher. Market forecasts and historical trends both indicate that average prices in late September 2024 are expected to be above $3.25[5][1].

## Rationale

- The **current price** ($3.273, September 8, 2024) is comfortably above the $3.25 threshold.
- Price movement over the last month appears modest, with typical late-summer/early-fall declines being slow and incremental[1][5].
- The EIA’s 2024 forecast calls for average prices well above $3.25 in this period, even as increased supply and reduced demand temper prices through the fall[1][5][3].
- No news of major new supply, demand, or policy shocks has emerged to drive a rapid decrease.
- Overweighting the status quo is prudent: gasoline prices tend to change gradually barring crises, and a drop of ~$0.025 in three weeks is less common outside of market shocks or large crude oil moves.

## Final answer

Probability: **87%**

This probability reflects the strong tendency of gasoline prices to remain stable absent large shocks, combined with the current price comfortably above the resolution threshold and forward-looking forecasts supporting a Yes outcome.
