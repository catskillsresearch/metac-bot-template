(a) Time left until outcome: The question resolves on April 1, 2025, which is approximately 7 weeks from today (May 6, 2025). However, since the resolution deadline has already passed, we have complete information about whether the interview occurred.

(b) Status quo outcome: Based on the available information, the status quo would be "No" - there is no evidence that Elon Musk was interviewed by Jon Stewart on The Daily Show before April 1, 2025.

(c) Scenario for No outcome: After the initial exchange and Jon Stewart calling out Elon Musk for "flaking" on the interview offer on March 7, 2025, Musk continued to avoid committing to an actual interview date, citing concerns about bias. The disagreement about "bipartisanship" and Stewart's approach created an impasse that prevented the interview from being scheduled before the April 1 deadline.

(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: Despite the public disagreement shown in the search results, Musk and Stewart could have reached an agreement shortly after their March exchange. The interview could have been quickly arranged and aired in late March 2025, meeting the deadline with the unedited format Musk requested.

Based on the available search results, I can see clear evidence that as of March 7, 2025, the interview had not yet taken place, and in fact, Jon Stewart was publicly calling out Elon Musk for "flaking on his offer to come on the Daily Show"[1]. The search results show that while there was an initial agreement in principle - with Musk stating "I will do it if the show airs unedited" and The Daily Show responding "we'd be delighted"[2] - the situation deteriorated after that.

Instead of proceeding with scheduling the interview, Musk made critical comments about Stewart, calling him "more a propagandist" and "too set in his ways"[1]. Stewart responded on March 7th by challenging these characterizations and essentially reiterating the invitation while expressing skepticism about Musk's real reasons for hesitation.

The search results available to me don't show any evidence that the interview actually took place after this exchange and before the April 1, 2025 deadline. Given that Stewart was publicly calling out Musk for "flaking" on the offer as late as March 7, and the deadline was less than a month away at that point, it's highly unlikely that they resolved their differences, scheduled, and conducted the interview within that timeframe.

As a forecaster, I must give significant weight to the status quo evidence. The search results clearly indicate friction between the parties and an unresolved situation as of March 7, with no evidence of resolution thereafter. The burden of proof would be on showing that the interview did occur, and there is no such evidence in the available information.
