(a) Time until outcome: The 2025 World Figure Skating Championships will take place from March 25-30, 2025. The outcome will be known by April 7, 2025, which is in about 10 months from the current date (May 6, 2025).

Note: Based on the current date (May 6, 2025), this event has already occurred. However, I'll analyze this as if we were forecasting before the event.

(b) Status quo outcome: If nothing changed, there would be no new world records set at the 2025 World Figure Skating Championships. World records in figure skating are difficult to break, and most competitions pass without setting new records.

(c) No outcome scenario: Top skaters perform at their usual high level but don't exceed their previous bests or push beyond existing world records. Technical elements are executed safely rather than pushing boundaries. Judges score conservatively, and conditions (ice quality, pressure) don't allow for record-setting performances.

(d) Yes outcome scenario: Elite skaters like Ilia Malinin (men's singles) or Madison Chock and Evan Bates (ice dance) perform flawlessly, incorporating new technical elements or executing existing ones with exceptional quality. The home crowd in Boston energizes athletes, particularly American competitors, pushing them to take risks that result in record-breaking scores in at least one of the many scoring categories.

Based on the available information, I need to forecast whether the 2025 World Figure Skating Championships will produce at least one new world record across any of the categories and scoring types.

## Analysis of Key Factors

**Technical Innovation and Progression**

Figure skating has seen consistent technical progression over time, with athletes continually pushing boundaries. Ilia Malinin, the reigning world champion, scored 114.08 in the short program at the U.S. Championships in January 2025[1]. This score is remarkably close to the current world record of 113.97 for men's short program TSS.

Given Malinin's trajectory and the fact that world championships often inspire peak performances, there's a reasonable chance he could exceed this record with a clean program in Boston.

**Competitive Field Strength**

The 2025 Championships feature several world-class competitors who have demonstrated scoring potential near existing records. Madison Chock and Evan Bates (ice dance) and Amber Glenn are also headliners with strong technical abilities[1]. The competitive pressure at World Championships tends to elevate performances.

**Home Advantage**

Boston previously hosted the World Championships in 2016, which broke attendance records for a U.S.-hosted World Championship[3]. The energetic home crowd could provide American skaters with additional motivation and confidence, potentially leading to exceptional performances.

**Historical Precedent**

World Championships often produce exceptional performances, but world records are relatively rare. The comprehensive scoring system means records can be broken in any of 28 different categories (four disciplines × three segments × two or three score types). This multiplicity of categories increases the probability that at least one record might fall.

**Timing in Olympic Cycle**

The 2025 World Championships will be the last before the 2026 Winter Olympics[3]. This timing typically encourages skaters to showcase their most difficult technical content as they prepare for the Olympics, increasing the likelihood of pushing scoring boundaries.

**Current Form**

Malinin's short program score at the U.S. Championships (114.08)[1] is already higher than the current world record (113.97). While national and international scoring can differ, this suggests he has the capability to break the world record under international judging.

## Weighing the Evidence

While status quo suggests no records will be broken, several factors point to a higher-than-normal probability:

1. Malinin's demonstrated scoring potential exceeding the current world record in men's short program
2. The pre-Olympic timing encouraging technical risk-taking
3. Home advantage for American skaters
4. The multiplicity of record categories creating numerous opportunities

However, I must also consider:

1. International judging may be stricter than at national events
2. Pressure at World Championships can lead to errors
3. Records represent exceptional performances and are, by definition, difficult to surpass

Factoring in the status quo bias while acknowledging the specific evidence pointing toward potential record-breaking performances, particularly by Malinin in men's singles:

Probability: 65%
