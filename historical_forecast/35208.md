(a) Time left until outcome: About 39 days (from May 6, 2025 until April 1, 2025)
(b) Status quo outcome: No, Putin has not traveled outside Russia in 2025 so far
(c) No outcome scenario: Putin continues to focus on domestic affairs and postpones all international trips until after April 1, 2025
(d) Yes outcome scenario: Putin travels to India, China, or another friendly nation for a scheduled bilateral summit before April 1, 2025

Based on the available information, I need to assess whether Vladimir Putin will travel outside of Russia before April 1, 2025. Since today is May 6, 2025, we're already past the resolution date of April 1, 2025. Therefore, I need to analyze if Putin made any international trips between January 1, 2025 and April 1, 2025.

From the search results, there are several planned visits by Putin in 2025:

1. Vladimir Putin is scheduled to visit China in late August or early September 2025 to participate in events marking the 80th anniversary of Japan's defeat in World War II[2]. This visit would occur after April 1, so it doesn't satisfy our criteria.

2. Putin was invited to visit India in early 2025 following an official invitation from Prime Minister Modi[3]. The Indian Foreign Ministry confirmed they were expecting Putin to attend the annual bilateral summit in New Delhi in 2025, though the exact date was unknown as of January 17, 2025[4]. According to Kremlin aide Yury Ushakov, the schedule for Putin's India visit would be set in early 2025[5].

3. There's no indication in the search results that Putin has actually made any international trips between January 1 and April 1, 2025.

The status quo is particularly important here. Based on the search results, while there were plans for Putin to visit India in early 2025, there's no confirmation that this trip actually occurred before April 1. The research assistant's report indicates that as of February 21, 2025, there was no evidence of Putin traveling outside Russia in 2025 or having a confirmed international trip scheduled before April 1, 2025.

Given that we're now past the resolution date (May 6, 2025), and there's no evidence in the search results indicating that Putin made any international trips before April 1, 2025, the most reasonable conclusion is that he did not travel outside Russia during that period.

Probability: 5%
