(a) **Time left until outcome is known**  
It is currently May 6, 2025, which means the entire month of March 2025 has passed, and the outcome could be checked as soon as NUFORC is updated and Metaculus checks the relevant link after April 1, 2025.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed**  
The default or status quo outcome is "No": there is typically no pilot report of a UFO from Africa published on NUFORC for a given month, based on historical reporting patterns and the infrequency of African pilot reports in the NUFORC database.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome**  
No pilot in Africa reports a UFO sighting to the National UFO Reporting Center for March 2025, or, if a sighting did occur, it is not posted by NUFORC at the relevant link by the time Metaculus checks after April 1, 2025. This can happen due to a lack of sightings, low reporting rates from African pilots, or delays and barriers to international reporting.

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome**  
A pilot operating in an African country observes what they believe is a UFO during March 2025, submits a report to NUFORC, and NUFORC then posts this pilot-specific report, clearly marked as coming from a country in Africa and occurring in March 2025, at the resolution link by April 1, 2025.

## Rationale

Historical evidence shows UFO sightings are reported from Africa, with South Africa contributing the highest number[1]. However, internationally sourced pilot UFO reports—especially those that make it into the NUFORC database—are relatively uncommon compared to the U.S., U.K., or Brazil, where pilot reporting is more culturally normalized and infrastructure for reporting may be better developed[1][2]. African sightings reported in global media or on social media platforms often do not make their way into the NUFORC system, and the official NUFORC list of notable UFO reports features very few African incidents, especially those submitted by pilots[2].

Pilot reports, in particular, are rare from Africa. Most pilot sightings in NUFORC come from regions with high numbers of trained commercial pilots, busy airspace, and established reporting awareness. While South Africa stands out with 234 reports overall[1], there is no evidence from the search results suggesting a trend of regular pilot submissions from Africa. Furthermore, reporting delays or international communications barriers could mean that even if a March 2025 incident occurred, it might not be posted in time, especially if the pilot is unaware of or uninterested in the NUFORC process.

Given that a specific Rwanda sighting was cited for January 2025 but not indicated as a pilot report, and no March 2025 pilot UFO reports from Africa are documented in the sources up to March 6, 2025, the most probable outcome is that this situation remains unchanged, i.e., no new pilot report is posted for Africa in March 2025.

## Forecast

Probability: **3%**

This low probability reflects the historically rare intersection of (a) an African pilot encountering a UFO, (b) reporting it specifically to NUFORC, and (c) the report being posted at the official link in the designated timeframe. The status quo is strongly favored, with only minimal possibility for last-minute outlier cases.
