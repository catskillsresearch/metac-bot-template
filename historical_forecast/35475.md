(a) Time until outcome: Approximately 24-25 days until April 1, 2025, with the planned landing date being March 2, 2025, which is about 4-5 days from now based on the current date of May 6, 2025.

(b) Status quo outcome: Based on the search results, the mission appears to be progressing as planned with a target landing date of March 2, 2025. If nothing changes, Blue Ghost will attempt to land on the Moon on that date.

(c) Scenario for No outcome: A technical failure could occur during the lunar descent phase, such as a main engine malfunction, guidance system error, or communication breakdown. The lunar landing is one of the most challenging phases of any Moon mission, and even small errors in trajectory, velocity, or orientation could result in a crash landing that renders the lander unable to communicate or perform its mission objectives.

(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: Based on the current trajectory and successful mission milestones to date, Blue Ghost completes its descent operations as planned on March 2, 2025, lands safely on the lunar surface, establishes communication with Earth, and begins its planned 14-day surface operations with its scientific payloads functioning as intended.

Blue Ghost Mission 1 launched successfully on January 15, 2025, aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from NASA's Kennedy Space Center[1]. The spacecraft separated from the rocket, established communications with Firefly's Mission Operations Center, and completed on-orbit commissioning within hours of launch[1]. This successful start to the mission is an encouraging indicator for the overall mission success.

The mission timeline shows that Blue Ghost planned a 45-day transit to the Moon before landing on March 2, 2025[1][2]. During this transit phase, the spacecraft has already demonstrated several successful milestones:

- It captured its first image and performed health checks[2]
- NASA instrument teams confirmed their payloads are healthy and collecting data[2]
- The spacecraft completed its first main engine burn four days into the mission[4]
- The Lunar GNSS Receiver Experiment (LuGRE) successfully acquired navigation signals at a record distance from Earth[4]

The mission plan includes approximately 45 days of transit, followed by 14 days of lunar surface operations[1]. The detailed timeline indicates a phased approach to reaching the Moon, including 25 days orbiting Earth, a four-day journey to lunar orbit, and 16 days in lunar orbit before descent operations begin[4].

As a forecaster, I recognize that lunar landings remain technically challenging operations with many potential points of failure. However, the meticulous planning and successful execution of mission milestones thus far suggest that Firefly Aerospace has implemented robust systems and procedures. The spacecraft has demonstrated proper functioning of its communication, propulsion, and payload systems during the transit phase.

While acknowledging the inherent risks of lunar landings, several factors weigh in favor of a successful outcome:
- The mission has already completed multiple critical phases successfully
- All NASA payloads were reported as healthy during transit[2]
- The mission operations team has demonstrated precise execution thus far
- The spacecraft successfully performed its first engine burn[4], which is a critical test of the propulsion system that will be needed for landing

The evidence from the search results suggests that the mission is proceeding according to plan with no reported anomalies. Given the successful milestones achieved and the planned landing date of March 2, 2025, which is well before the April 1, 2025 deadline, I assess a high probability of successful landing.

Probability: 85%
