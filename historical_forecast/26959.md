(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  
There are approximately 55 days remaining until October 1, 2024, when this question will resolve.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
Currently, there is **no vice presidential debate scheduled** before October 1, 2024, that meets the question's criteria. The only officially announced debate was the CPD debate on September 25, 2024 at Lafayette College, but all CPD debates—including this one—have been cancelled. There is no public, confirmed commitment from both major party vice presidential nominees to participate in any replacement debate before the deadline.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
No live, formal debate featuring both the Democratic and Republican vice presidential nominees is held before October 1, 2024. This could easily occur if the campaigns remain at an impasse, the Democratic campaign delays naming a VP, or neither side sees political advantage in scheduling such a debate during the relevant period.

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
Both campaigns select their vice presidential nominees and reach an agreement—perhaps under media or public pressure—to participate in a live, formal vice presidential debate (hosted by a major network or otherwise) before October 1, 2024.

## Rationale

- The originally scheduled and sole official vice presidential debate on September 25, 2024 at Lafayette College, planned by the CPD, has been cancelled. This eliminates the only concrete event that would have met the criteria, as noted in the official statements and news reports[1][5].
- Kamala Harris, while still presumed to be the Democratic VP nominee, had accepted a CBS News invitation for a debate in July or August, but that was before she became the presidential nominee. Since then, the Harris campaign has not finalized its VP pick, and there is no remaining agreement for a vice presidential debate[5].
- As of early August 2024, there is no finalized Democratic VP and ongoing deadlock between campaigns regarding not only presidential but also vice presidential debates. There are no publicly announced or scheduled VP debates that would occur before October 1, 2024[5].
- Given the short timeline, absence of public movement to organize such a debate, and the fact that scheduling and agreeing on logistics at this late stage is complex, the status quo strongly favors "No." Only a sudden and concerted effort by both campaigns could change this outcome.
- Good forecasters assign higher weight to the status quo, especially with little time and no evidence of an imminent breakthrough.
