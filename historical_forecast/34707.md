(a) Time left until outcome: 52 days (from February 9, 2025 to April 1, 2025)

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: No announcement of a Chinese military base agreement in North or South America.

(c) No outcome scenario: China continues its cautious approach to military expansion in the Western Hemisphere, focusing instead on less provocative economic and diplomatic engagement in the Americas while prioritizing military facilities in Africa and Asia that are strategically important but less likely to trigger direct U.S. confrontation.

(d) Yes outcome scenario: China accelerates its military ambitions and announces a formal agreement with a country in the Americas (possibly Cuba, Venezuela, or a smaller Caribbean nation) to establish a PLA base, calculating that the strategic advantages outweigh potential U.S. backlash.

As of May 2025, I need to assess whether China announced an agreement to build a PLA military base in North or South America before April 1, 2025. Based on the search results, there is no evidence of such an announcement occurring before the deadline.

The search results indicate that China's newest confirmed overseas military facility was established in Cambodia as of July 2024[1]. While China has been identified as pursuing or considering military facilities in numerous countries, the U.S. intelligence community and Department of Defense reports from late 2024 do not mention any confirmed base agreements in the Americas[1].

The historical pattern shows China has been strategic and methodical about overseas military expansion. Its only established military base abroad for many years was in Djibouti, Africa, with the Cambodia facility representing a significant but carefully calculated expansion[1][5]. China's approach has generally been to integrate military and security components into economic partnerships, especially in Africa, without provoking international backlash through overt troop presence[5].

U.S. Southern Command has expressed concerns about China's investments in the Caribbean and South America potentially being converted from civilian to military use, but this indicates ongoing monitoring rather than a response to an actual base agreement[4]. General Laura Richardson specifically noted China's economic presence and military equipment sales to hemispheric neighbors, but did not reference any formal base agreements[4].

The most recent intelligence assessments cited in the search results (from December 2024) list multiple countries where China might be considering facilities, including Cuba in the Americas, but no confirmed agreements[1]. The January 2025 information about strengthening partnerships with Caribbean nations suggests continued diplomatic and economic engagement but doesn't indicate military base announcements[2].

The status quo strongly favors a "No" outcome. China has historically moved cautiously with military expansions, weighing geopolitical implications carefully. Establishing a base in the Americas would represent a dramatic escalation in the Western Hemisphere that would likely trigger significant U.S. response. The absence of any mention of such a major announcement in these recent sources strongly suggests it did not occur before April 1, 2025.

Given China's calculated approach to military expansion, the sensitive geopolitical implications of a base in the Americas, and the complete lack of evidence for any such announcement in the search results covering the relevant period, I assess with high confidence that no such announcement occurred before the deadline.

Probability: 3%
