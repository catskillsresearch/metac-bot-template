(a) Time until outcome: 
The question asks about the value for August 2024. According to the search results, the latest available data is from April 2025, with a value of 0.27[1]. Since we are currently in May 2025, the outcome for August 2024 is already known, but not provided in the search results.

(b) Status quo outcome:
Based on the provided data, the Real-time Sahm Rule Recession Indicator has remained stable at 0.27 for February, March, and April 2025[1]. This suggests that the economy has not entered a recession according to this indicator, as it remains below the 0.50 threshold.

(c) Scenario for a No outcome:
If the labor market remained resilient through August 2024, with unemployment staying low and job creation continuing, the Sahm Rule indicator would not have increased year-over-year. Economic growth could have remained positive, supported by consumer spending and service sector strength, preventing any significant rise in unemployment that would trigger the indicator.

(d) Scenario for a Yes outcome:
If economic headwinds intensified in mid-2024, with tighter credit conditions, exhausted savings, and manufacturing weakness spreading to the services sector, unemployment could have risen. This would have pushed the three-month moving average of unemployment up by enough to increase the Sahm Rule indicator year-over-year for August 2024, even if it remained below the recession threshold of 0.50.

Looking at the historical data provided, the Sahm Rule indicator was at 0.27 in April 2025[1], and had been at that level since February 2025. It was slightly higher at 0.37 in January 2025 and 0.40 in December 2024[1]. This shows a downward trend in the indicator from late 2024 to early 2025.

While we don't have the specific value for August 2024, the trend suggests that any economic concerns that might have been present in late 2023 and early 2024 did not materialize into a significant increase in unemployment. The Sahm Rule values from late 2024 and early 2025 indicate that unemployment remained relatively stable, without the 0.50 percentage point increase that would signal a recession[2].

The search results from late 2023 indicated some expectations of economic slowdown in 2024, with a 20% probability assigned to a recession scenario where unemployment might rise to 5.5% by mid-2024[5]. However, the actual data from 2025 shows that such a severe scenario did not occur, as the Sahm Rule indicator remained well below the 0.50 threshold.

Given the historical pattern of stability and even decline in the indicator through 2024 into 2025, and the absence of any evidence of a significant economic downturn in the search results, it appears unlikely that the August 2024 value would have been higher year-over-year.

Probability: 25%
