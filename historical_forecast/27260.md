(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  
There are 42 days remaining until September 30, 2024. The question resolves as **Yes** if Big Lots files for bankruptcy before October 1, 2024.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
As of August 19, 2024, Big Lots has not filed for bankruptcy. The status quo is **No bankruptcy filing**.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
Big Lots continues aggressive cost-cutting, closes underperforming stores, manages to secure additional short-term liquidity (perhaps through asset sales, renegotiated credit lines, or favorable supplier terms), and delays a bankruptcy filing beyond September 30, 2024. Market volatility (such as a meme stock rally) provides enough runway to postpone a formal bankruptcy filing, even if financial fundamentals remain weak[2][3][5].

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
Rapid depletion of cash, failure to obtain new financing, or an acceleration of loan covenants forces Big Lots’ management to file a bankruptcy petition before October 1, 2024. This could be precipitated by a missed debt payment, vendor lawsuits, or sudden loss of trade credit as confidence among suppliers and creditors collapses[2][3].

## **Rationale**

Big Lots’ financial position is deteriorating. The company reported a net loss of $205 million in Q1 2024 and a 10% year-over-year drop in sales. Its long-term debt stands at $573.8 million, up 14% from last year, while 244 stores (17.5% of the total) are underperforming[2][3][5]. Negative operating cash flow continues, and recent SEC filings raise "substantial doubt" about ongoing viability[3].

Operationally, Big Lots is closing 35-40 stores and opening only three, signaling retrenchment rather than growth[2][3]. Management is attempting a turnaround with cost controls and value messaging, but success is unclear given persistent demand weakness and competitive pressures[5].

Despite these warning signs:
- There is no public indication that a bankruptcy filing is imminent as of August 19, 2024.
- The company’s stock saw a 17% surge in July, possibly prolonging access to capital or delaying creditor action[3].
- Bankruptcy, once "highly likely" in public disclosures, is often delayed until liquidity options are exhausted and vendor/lender forbearance vanishes.
- Retailers have been known to "limp along" for several quarters after severe warnings, particularly in a speculative environment.

Analysts assign a 4–10% probability of bankruptcy in the near term, and some investors still see potential for a meme-stock-driven reprieve or last-ditch funding solution[3][4].

## **Final Probability**

Given the time left (42 days), the absence of a filing as of today, the frequency of last-minute funding extensions or operational delays in retail bankruptcies, and the heavy influence of the status quo, **the most likely resolution is No**. However, the probability is significantly elevated due to clear distress and explicit warnings.

Probability: **32%**
