(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  
Homestead opens on December 20, 2024, and its domestic opening weekend box office will be reported by Sunday, December 22, 2024, with final numbers likely available by Monday, December 23. This is approximately 10–12 days from the current date (December 11, 2024).

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
Angel Studios’ recent films, *Sight* ($7.2M opening) and *Haikyu!! The Dumpster Battle* ($7.07M), both opened just above the $7 million threshold in 2024[5]. Analyst forecasts place Homestead's debut in the $8–10 million range, with extra optimism due to the holiday release window[1]. The most likely scenario, if patterns hold, is that Homestead lands just above $7 million.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
Homestead’s opening weekend is hurt by intense competition from other holiday releases, poor critical/audience reception, or limited interest due to its format (theatrical event for a streaming series). In this case, its gross falls short and finishes at or below $7 million.

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
Homestead benefits from robust holiday attendance, strong word of mouth, and a turnout comparable to or better than Angel Studios' recent releases. Favorable conditions and dedicated event marketing push its opening weekend box office above $7 million, in line with industry forecasts and recent analogs.

## Rationale

Angel Studios’ two most recent titles in 2024 each achieved opening weekends just above $7 million, establishing a status quo baseline for the studio’s theatrical reach in the current market[5]. Analyst predictions further bolster the case for a performance exceeding $7 million, citing both market comparables and the holiday box office dynamics, which typically see increased attendance[1]. However, notable risks remain due to the crowded Christmas slate and the unconventional nature of Homestead’s release (first two episodes of a series rather than a standalone film)[2]. 

Given the proximity of prior releases to the $7 million threshold, the prediction carries some risk of underperformance—especially if Homestead proves less appealing to general audiences or loses out to bigger holiday films. Still, the weight of evidence, particularly the combination of distributor precedent and favorable forecasts, tips the odds toward a modest overperformance.
