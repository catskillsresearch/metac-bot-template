(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**

- Today is July 15, 2024; the relevant period is July 17–28, 2024.
- The outcome will be determinable at the end of July 28, 2024, meaning about **13 days remain** before the resolution window closes.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**

- Currently, geomagnetic activity has calmed since the major storms of May 2024, with recent weeks seeing only low to moderate solar flare activity and Kp values largely at quiet levels[3].
- If this pattern continues, the strongest Kp between July 17–28 would **likely remain at or below 4** (quiet), resulting in a **No**.

(c) **Scenario that results in a No outcome:**

- AR3697 and other sunspot regions remain quiet or only produce low-level activity during July 17–28.
- No significant Earth-directed CMEs or high-speed solar wind streams reach Earth during this period.
- The Kp index remains at or below 4, indicating no geomagnetic storm conditions.

(d) **Scenario that results in a Yes outcome:**

- AR3697 (or another active region) produces an M- or X-class flare with an Earth-directed CME during July 17–28.
- The CME arrives at Earth, disturbing the magnetosphere and raising the Kp index into the 5–6 range, causing a minor (G1, Kp=5) or moderate (G2, Kp=6) geomagnetic storm.
- The highest Kp reported by the German Research Center for Geosciences during the window is greater than 4 and less than or equal to 6.

## Rationale

The likelihood that the strongest Kp during July 17–28 will be greater than 4 and less than or equal to 6 depends on solar activity, especially from AR3697, which has shown a capacity for powerful flares and CMEs in its recent returns[1][4][5]. However, forecasts for specific geomagnetic storm strengths on week-to-week timescales are highly uncertain, as precise Kp levels can only be predicted a few days ahead[1]. 

Recent solar activity as of late June and early July had quieted, with only some C-class flares and no notable, Earth-impacting CMEs[3]. However, the sunspot region responsible for May's record storms (now AR3723, formerly AR3697) has demonstrated a pattern of producing strong activity during its previous Earth-facing passages[1][4][5]. 

Given the sun's roughly 27-day rotation, the window of July 17–28 coincides with a period when active regions could be Earth-facing and capable of generating geoeffective CMEs. Minor (Kp=5, G1) or moderate (Kp=6, G2) storms are relatively common during solar maximum, especially with a persistent, magnetically complex region like AR3697[1].

Good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo, which, as of now, is quiet to modest solar activity. The base rate for Kp exceeding 4 but not above 6 in any given 12-day period during solar maximum is moderate, but not certain—geomagnetic storms require specific solar events, which cannot be confidently forecast weeks ahead. 

Taking into account:
- The recent quieting of solar activity,
- The history and potential of AR3697/3723,
- The unpredictability of CME occurrence and impact,
- The natural tendency for moderate storms in active periods,
- And the fact that more extreme Kp (greater than 6) is rare even in active cycles,

**A moderate probability is warranted, higher than random but well short of certainty.**

Probability: **60%**
