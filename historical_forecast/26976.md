(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  
As of August 8, 2024, there are just under two months until the October 1, 2024, deadline for SB 1047 to be both passed by the California Legislature and signed by the Governor for this question to resolve as Yes.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
The most recent available legislative record for SB 1047 indicates that, as of September 29, 2024, the bill was *vetoed* by the Governor, with consideration of the Governor's veto pending in the Senate[1][2]. This means that unless the Legislature overrides the veto, the bill will not be enacted into law before the October 1, 2024, deadline.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
The Governor has already vetoed the bill as of September 29, 2024[1][2]. If the Legislature fails to override the veto—which typically requires a two-thirds majority in both chambers—SB 1047 will not become law before the October 1, 2024, deadline.

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
For a Yes outcome, the California Legislature would need to override the Governor's veto by securing a two-thirds majority vote in both the Assembly and the Senate before October 1, 2024. Only if this happens before the deadline would SB 1047 be enacted under the specified criteria.

---

Given the Governor's veto just days before the deadline and the historically rare occurrence of veto overrides in California, the status quo heavily favors a No outcome. The window for action is extremely narrow, and there is no evidence of a concerted or likely successful override effort at this time.
