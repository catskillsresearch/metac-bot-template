(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  
Rivian is expected to report Q1 2025 deliveries roughly two or three days after the quarter ends, likely around April 2–4, 2025. As of May 6, 2025, this report should already be public or imminent, so there is essentially no time left before the outcome becomes knowable[3].

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
If Rivian maintained its Q1 2024 delivery performance, the outcome would be 13,588 vehicles, as reported for Q1 2024[4]. This serves as a baseline or “status quo” scenario.

(c) **Outcome if the current trend continued:**  
From Q1 2023 (7,946 deliveries[2]) to Q1 2024 (13,588 deliveries[4]), Rivian saw approximately 71% year-over-year growth in Q1 deliveries. If a similar rate were sustained, Q1 2025 deliveries would approach:

\[
13,588 \times 1.71 \approx 23,236
\]

However, such rapid growth becomes harder to maintain as the base grows larger. Community and market forecasts suggest expectation of a more moderate increase, with a median prediction around 14,700 deliveries, an interquartile range from 13,300 to 16,000, and about a 31% chance of exceeding 16,000 deliveries[1]. Therefore, the “current trend” would likely result in a modest increase over Q1 2024, with a realistic estimate in the 14,700–16,000 range.

(d) **Expectations of experts and markets:**  
The collective forecast from prediction markets (as of February 2025) centers around a median of 14,700 deliveries for Q1 2025, with:
- 25th percentile at 13,300
- 75th percentile over 16,000
- ~9% probability of less than 11,500 deliveries
- ~31% probability of more than 16,000 deliveries[1].

(e) **Unexpected scenario: Low outcome:**  
A low delivery count (e.g., under 12,000) could result from major supply chain disruptions, production stoppages at the Normal, Illinois plant, or sudden collapse in demand (possibly due to economic downturn, recalls, or serious reliability issues).

(f) **Unexpected scenario: High outcome:**  
A high delivery count (e.g., over 17,000) could result from unexpectedly rapid scaling of fleet/commercial van sales after the Amazon exclusivity period ended, a surge in consumer demand from aggressive promotional campaigns, or operational breakthroughs that increase plant efficiency and product output beyond guidance[1].
