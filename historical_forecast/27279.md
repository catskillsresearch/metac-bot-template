(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  
The outcome will be determined using the CDC’s reported data as of September 30, 2024. Today is August 20, 2024, so there are approximately 6 weeks (about 1.5 months) remaining until the outcome date.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
As of July 15, 2024, the CDC reported 167 measles cases for the year. The total number of cases for the entire year, as of December 31, 2024, was 285[1][3]. Unless there is a significant reporting lag or a late summer surge, the status quo suggests that the number reported by September 30, 2024, will be well below 300 cases.

(c) **Scenario for a No outcome:**  
The pace of new measles cases continues at a similar rate observed between July and December, reaching a cumulative total below 300 cases by September 30, 2024, and not exceeding 400 by that date. Given 167 cases as of July 15 and 285 by year end, the increase from July 15 to September 30 would need to be over 130 cases to reach over 300, which is not supported by the annual trend[1][3].

(d) **Scenario for a Yes outcome:**  
A "Yes" outcome would require more than 300 and less than or equal to 400 cases reported by September 30, 2024. This would necessitate a sharp and sustained outbreak or a sudden reporting of a backlog of cases between mid-July and the end of September—bringing the tally above 300 before October 1. However, since only 285 cases were reported for all of 2024, this scenario is highly unlikely unless there are significant reporting anomalies[1][3].

## Rationale

The observed data from 2024 shows an acceleration in measles cases compared to prior years, with 167 cases by July 15 and a final annual total of 285[1][3]. To reach more than 300 cases by September 30, the reported cases would have needed to surge by at least 133 in a 2.5 month period (from July 15 to September 30), outpacing the entire remaining increase of 118 cases for the rest of the year. Historically, there have not been such sudden late-year surges in recent U.S. measles data, and a significant increase would likely have been visible in year-end totals if it had occurred.

No evidence in the search results supports a major outbreak, delayed reporting, or policy change that would shift the rate so dramatically between July and September 2024. While outbreaks do introduce uncertainty, forecasters typically place more weight on the baseline trend unless there are strong signals of change.

## Final Answer

Probability: 1% 

This reflects the overwhelming likelihood that more than 300 and less than or equal to 400 measles cases will *not* be reported in the U.S. by September 30, 2024, based on the CDC’s official counts[1][3].
