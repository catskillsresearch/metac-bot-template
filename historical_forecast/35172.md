(a) **Time left until outcome known:**  
The 97th Academy Awards ceremony is scheduled for March 2, 2025, which is approximately two weeks from the current date (February 18, 2025) when this assessment is made[2]. The winners will be announced during the ceremony and published shortly after by the Oscars website and major outlets.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
With 8 nominations—including major categories like Best Picture, Best Actor (Timothée Chalamet), and Best Director—*A Complete Unknown* is recognized as a strong contender this year[2][4][5]. Historically, films with this level of nominations often win between 1 and 3 Oscars. Given the positive industry buzz, particularly for Chalamet and the film’s likability among voters, a safe baseline forecast would expect 1 or 2 wins, reflecting both historical precedent and the film’s prestige placement[1][5].

(c) **Scenario for an unexpected outcome:**  
An unexpected scenario would be *A Complete Unknown* either severely underperforming or sweeping major categories. Underperformance could happen if the film is overshadowed by late surging competitors (such as *Conclave* or *Emilia Perez*), or if the Academy’s preferential ballot in Best Picture works against it due to divisive opinions[1][4]. Conversely, a sweep could occur if the film capitalizes on last-minute momentum, sympathy votes, or industry narratives, pulling off wins in 3 or more categories—especially if it secures Best Picture plus a major acting or directing award. However, precedent suggests full sweeps are rare unless a film has overwhelming critical and voting consensus.

**Rationale and Probability Assignments:**  
Good forecasting suggests weighting historical patterns and the “status quo” outcome most heavily, while leaving space for upsets—a movie with 8 nominations very rarely wins zero, but sweeping 4+ categories is also uncommon unless it is a dominant favorite. *A Complete Unknown* has strong support but is not considered the out-and-out frontrunner in every major category, with predictions split among various films and a tight race for Best Picture and Best Actor[1][4][5]. The most likely scenario remains that it walks away with between 1 and 3 awards.
