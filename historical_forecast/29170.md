As a professional forecaster, I'll evaluate whether William Ruto will cease to be President of Kenya before January 1, 2025.

(a) Time left until outcome: Approximately 7 months (from May 6, 2025 to January 1, 2025, working backward)

(b) Status quo outcome: William Ruto remains President of Kenya through January 1, 2025

(c) No outcome scenario: President Ruto maintains political stability through compromises with opposition, manages economic challenges effectively, and contains protests without further escalation, allowing him to serve his full term.

(d) Yes outcome scenario: Renewed protests escalate beyond control, political opposition unifies against him, economic conditions worsen dramatically, or a constitutional crisis emerges, forcing his resignation or removal from office.

## Current Status Assessment

President William Ruto has been serving as Kenya's president since September 2022. Recent evidence from 2024 confirms he was actively governing Kenya, including participating in a state visit to the United States in May 2024, as hosted by President Biden[3][5]. As recently as September 2024, Ruto had settled politically with opposition figure Odinga specifically to quell unrest in Kenya[2]. This indicates his continued hold on power despite challenges.

## Political Stability Factors

The summer of 2024 presented significant challenges to Ruto's presidency. Widespread protests initially focused on the 2024 Finance Bill forced him to make concessions, including refusing to sign the bill on June 26, 2024[2]. Political activist Boniface Mwangi suggested in July 2024 that "Ruto will be a one-term president if he survives this week,"[1] indicating the severity of the crisis at that time.

However, Ruto demonstrated political adaptability by making a settlement with opposition figure Odinga. This political arrangement appears to have temporarily reduced tensions, though it was not universally supported within Odinga's coalition[2]. This settlement represents a significant stabilizing factor that increases the likelihood of Ruto remaining in office.

## Economic and Security Challenges

Kenya faces substantial economic challenges that could threaten Ruto's presidency. Fitch downgraded Kenya to 'B-' with a stable outlook in August 2024, and budget deficits are expected to worsen[2]. The administration will have "less fiscal space" to address demands from organized groups or improve expenditure on public services, potentially fueling further discontent.

Security issues also remain a concern. In May 2024, Ruto reported deploying military and police officers to address insecurity in the North Rift region, reopening schools that had been closed due to security concerns[5]. His ability to manage these security challenges will be crucial for maintaining political stability.

## Historical Precedent and Institutional Factors

Kenya has a history of constitutional governance with established procedures for presidential transitions. No information suggests formal impeachment proceedings against Ruto or scheduled elections before January 2025. The military appears to remain under civilian control, as evidenced by Ruto's deployment of military forces to address security concerns.

## Analysis of Scenarios

For Ruto to cease being president before January 2025, one of several scenarios would need to occur:

1. Resignation under pressure: While the protests were significant, they appear to have subsided following political compromises. The settlement with Odinga suggests Ruto has consolidated enough political support to resist calls for resignation.

2. Impeachment: There is no evidence of formal impeachment proceedings, and Ruto appears to maintain sufficient political alliances to prevent this outcome.

3. Military coup: No evidence suggests military preparations for a coup, and Kenya has maintained relative democratic stability compared to other nations in the region.

4. Death or incapacitation: While always a possibility, there is no specific information suggesting Ruto faces particular health challenges.

## Probability Assessment

The status quo strongly favors Ruto remaining in office. He has weathered significant protests, made political compromises, and continues to function as president. While economic challenges and potential political instability remain concerns, the evidence suggests these are unlikely to force him from office within the next 7 months.

The settlement with opposition figure Odinga represents a significant stabilizing factor, though its durability remains uncertain. Economic challenges will continue but are unlikely to precipitate a crisis sufficient to remove Ruto from office in the short term.

Given the time remaining until January 2025, the lack of formal removal proceedings, Ruto's demonstrated political adaptability, and the historical rarity of presidential removals in Kenya's democratic system, I assess there is a low probability that Ruto will cease to be president before January 1, 2025.

Probability: 15%
