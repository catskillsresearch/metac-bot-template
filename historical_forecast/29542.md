(a) Time left until outcome: The outcome will be known based on CDC data for periods ending between November 9, 2024, and January 4, 2025. From today (May 6, 2025), this is a retrospective question as the resolution period has already passed.

(b) Status quo outcome: Since we're looking at this question from May 2025, the outcome is already determined. Based on the search results, the KP lineage (including variants like KP.3) was dominant but facing competition from emerging variants in late 2024.

(c) No outcome scenario: The KP lineage maintained its dominance above 50% throughout the relevant period (November 9, 2024 - January 4, 2025) despite the emergence of competing variants like XEC.

(d) Yes outcome scenario: The XEC variant or other emerging variants grew rapidly enough to reduce KP lineage prevalence below 50% in at least one weighted estimate period ending between November 9, 2024 and January 4, 2025.

As a professional forecaster, I'll analyze the available evidence from the time period in question to provide my assessment.

The CDC data shows that COVID-19 variants evolved significantly throughout 2023-2024. By April 2024, KP.2-like lineages had reached >10% prevalence, while KP.3 and LB.1-like lineages reached >10% by May 25, 2024, and KP.3.1.1 by July 20, 2024[1][5]. The KP.3.1.1 variant became predominant in August 2024, consistent with the question background.

Looking at the timeline, we can see that SARS-CoV-2 variants typically rise and fall over several months. The JN.1 variant emerged and rapidly became predominant in winter 2023, representing a significant genetic shift from previous variants[1]. This demonstrates how quickly variant displacement can occur.

The question mentions that as of October 26, 2024, KP lineage had a combined estimate of 68% (with KP.3.1.1 at 57%), while the XEC variant had increased from 2% to 17% in just over a month. This rapid growth rate for XEC suggests it had significant competitive advantage, similar to previous variant replacements we've observed.

Critically, a study cited in the question background suggested that "XEC has the potential to outcompete the other major lineage including KP.3.1.1." Given the historical pattern of variant replacement and XEC's demonstrated growth trajectory, it seems likely that XEC continued its rapid growth between late October 2024 and early January 2025.

The search results indicate that the FDA was recommending inclusion of JN.1 lineages (preferentially KP.2) in updated 2024-2025 vaccines as of October 24, 2024[5]. The fact that pharmaceutical companies received approval for KP.2 vaccines in August 2024 (when "KP.3 variants account for about half of current cases"[4]) suggests health authorities were already tracking the evolution of these variants closely.

The WHO dashboard indicates KP.3 was still being monitored as of April 14, 2025[2], suggesting it remained significant, though not necessarily dominant.

Given the historical pattern of variant replacement, XEC's demonstrated growth trajectory, and the significant time period (over 2 months) between the last data point in October and the January 5, 2025 resolution date, I believe there was a high probability that KP lineage fell below 50% in at least one of the weighted estimate periods.

While we must consider the status quo bias, the evidence strongly suggests that variant replacement was already well underway by late October 2024, and the timeline provides sufficient opportunity for this replacement to cross the 50% threshold.

Probability: 85%
