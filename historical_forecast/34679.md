Based on the information provided, I'll analyze the EU gas storage situation and provide a forecast for February 12, 2025.

(a) Time left until outcome is known: 6 days (from today, May 6, 2025, to when the data becomes available on February 13, 2025 - this date has already passed)

(b) Outcome if nothing changed: Based on the search results, EU gas storage levels had dropped below 60% as of January 23, 2025[2]. The February 1, 2025 target was set at 50%[1].

(c) Outcome if current trend continued: The storage levels were declining from 60% in late January toward the 50% target for February 1[2]. If this downward trend continued at a similar rate, by February 12 the levels would likely be several percentage points below 50%.

(d) Expectations of experts and markets: The European Commission set intermediate gas storage filling targets for 2025, with 50% expected by February 1, 2025, and 30% by May 1, 2025[1]. This suggests experts anticipated continued drawdowns through February and into spring.

(e) Unexpected scenario resulting in a low outcome: A sudden, severe cold snap across Europe could dramatically increase gas consumption for heating, causing storage levels to deplete faster than anticipated. Additionally, any supply disruptions or geopolitical tensions affecting gas imports could exacerbate the situation.

(f) Unexpected scenario resulting in a high outcome: An unusually warm February could significantly reduce heating demand, slowing the drawdown rate. Additionally, increased LNG deliveries or other alternative supply sources could help maintain higher storage levels.

Given the information available and the seasonal patterns of gas usage, I need to forecast the EU gas storage level for February 12, 2025. The EU had established a target of 50% filling by February 1, 2025[1]. Storage levels had already dropped below 60% by January 23, 2025[2]. 

February is typically still a winter month with high gas demand for heating. The drawdown rate would likely continue after February 1, but could vary based on weather conditions and supply factors. The next target after February 1 was 30% by May 1[1], suggesting an expected continued decline throughout February, March, and April.

Considering these factors and accounting for uncertainties:
