(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
The result will be determined on January 1, 2025, roughly two months from now.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
As of November 1, 2024, there have been 9 State Department-approved arms sales in October 2024. If November and December follow recent averages—specifically, their 2023 figures of 5 (November) and 17 (December)—the total for Q4 2024 would be 9 + 5 + 17 = 31, exceeding 20 approvals. However, using the longer-term mean of 6.7 approvals per month, the Q4 total would be about 20.1; using the 2022-2023 Q4 average (7 + 5 + 17 = 29/3 ≈ 9.7 per month), the quarter would project to around 29 approvals, again exceeding 20.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
- November and December 2024 both see unusually low approval activity, below historical norms. For example, if both months record 5 or fewer approvals—mirroring the lowest recent November and December counts—the total could remain at or below 19 for the quarter.
- Political, bureaucratic, or procedural delays reduce the number of formal notifications late in the year, perhaps due to a post-election transition or heightened congressional scrutiny.
- The high volume in preceding months (notably August 2024) was due to “pull-forward” activity, causing a subsequent dip in autumn approvals.

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
- November and December follow seasonal patterns, with December especially seeing above-average activity (e.g., 17 in December 2023, 15 in December 2020).
- Elevated geopolitical tensions or urgent arms requests (e.g., Ukraine, Taiwan, or Middle Eastern allies) prompt a surge in end-of-year approvals.
- No unusual slowdowns or political holds occur, and the recent upward trend in 2024 (including the record-setting August) persists into year-end.

## Rationale

The status quo expectation—heavily weighted in good forecasting—points to "Yes." October 2024 has already produced 9 approvals, which is above average. If the next two months are merely average (6–7 approvals each), the total would be 21–23, already above 20. December has historically been a strong month for approvals, often significantly higher than the average, as the government clears backlogs before year-end.

While August 2024’s spike (22 approvals) is an outlier, it may signal a busier period, indicating robust demand or a push to process more sales in 2024. There is little evidence from public reporting or the data provided to suggest a major upcoming slowdown in Q4 2024. Even if November is somewhat slow, a typical December would push the total comfortably over 20.

The primary risks to a Yes outcome are a significant, unexpected administrative or political delay, or if the high activity earlier in 2024 pulled forward deals that normally would have happened at year-end. However, on net, the historical pattern and current trajectory clearly favor the threshold being exceeded.
