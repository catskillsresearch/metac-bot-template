(a) **Time Left Until Outcome Is Known**

As of August 23, 2024, there are approximately 39 days until October 1, 2024—the date by which Greg Brockman would need to return from his sabbatical for the outcome to resolve as "Yes."

(b) **Status Quo Outcome If Nothing Changed**

If nothing changes, Greg Brockman will remain on sabbatical from OpenAI for the rest of the year, as publicly announced. This would mean he does *not* return to OpenAI in an active capacity before October 1, 2024, resulting in a "No" outcome[1][4][5].

(c) **Scenario That Results in a No Outcome**

- Greg Brockman remains on sabbatical through October 1, 2024, and only considers returning to OpenAI later in the year or not at all[1][5].
- Alternatively, if new credible reporting surfaces that he has resigned or joined a different organization before October 1, 2024, without returning to work at OpenAI, this too would resolve as "No."

(d) **Scenario That Results in a Yes Outcome**

- Greg Brockman returns to active work at OpenAI in any capacity, with credible reporting confirming his return, *before* October 1, 2024[1][3][4].
- This could be due to changes in company circumstances, personal decisions, or urgent organizational needs prompting an early end to his sabbatical.

## Rationale

- **Weight to the Status Quo:** Good forecasting practice suggests putting extra probability weight on the status quo, as abrupt changes are rarer than continuations of current trends.
- **Evidence of Intent:** Brockman's public statement is explicit that his sabbatical extends "through end of year" and is described as the "first time to relax since co-founding OpenAI 9 years ago"[1][4]. There is no indication in credible reporting that he expects to return before October 1, 2024.
- **Precedent in Leadership Changes:** The broader context is one of considerable leadership turnover at OpenAI—several co-founders have left permanently during 2024[4][5]. However, Brockman has previously demonstrated loyalty to the company by returning after the November 2023 coup[3][4]. This history implies an intent to remain affiliated, but not necessarily on an early timeline.
- **No Contrary Signals:** As of August 23, 2024, there are no press leaks, credible rumors, or official statements suggesting plans for Brockman’s early return[1][4][5].

## Final Probability Estimate

Given that Brockman himself framed his leave as lasting "through end of year," with no qualifying statements about potentially returning earlier; the absence of contrary signals; and the fact that the status quo scenario (remaining on sabbatical into October) is well supported by available evidence, the probability that Greg Brockman will return to work at OpenAI before October 1, 2024 is **very low**.

Probability: 5%
