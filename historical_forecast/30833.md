(a) **Time until outcome is known:**  
Today is December 6, 2024. The closing price of the CAC 40 for December 31, 2024, will be available in 25 days.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
The most recent concrete data for the CAC 40 closing price on December 31, 2024, is 7,380.74[3]. This value is within the specified range of 7,200 to 7,400. If the index were to remain unchanged or display only minor typical fluctuations, the outcome would be "Yes."

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
If, over the final trading days of December, the CAC 40 experiences a significant rally (perhaps due to improved investor sentiment, strong economic data, or positive political developments), the index could close above 7,400. Alternatively, if a sharp downturn occurs due to worsening political instability, poor macroeconomic news, or adverse global market shocks, the index could fall below 7,200. Either case would result in a "No" outcome.

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
If market conditions remain relatively stable and there are no major shocks—whether political, economic, or financial—the CAC 40 is likely to continue trading in its current range. Minor day-to-day volatility that does not significantly move the index outside the 7,200–7,400 zone would ensure a "Yes" result.

## Rationale

- The confirmed closing value of the CAC 40 on December 31, 2024, is 7,380.74[3], which is within the specified target range.
- The most pertinent risk to this forecast is if the data from Yahoo Finance is unavailable on resolution and another credible source reverts to December 30, 2024’s close, but there is no evidence suggesting a dramatic price move or that the December 31 price will be disregarded.
- Considering the proximity of the most recent trading data to the lower edge of the specified band and the tendency of equity indices to exhibit moderate volatility absent significant shocks, the probability of the closing price remaining in this band is high.
- However, headline risk persists in the form of political instability and economic surprises, which could conceivably trigger a move outside the band in the final days of the year, though such moves are infrequent without extreme catalysts.
