(a) Time left until outcome is known: Approximately 6-7 weeks
The Time Person of the Year is typically announced in early-to-mid December each year. As of today (May 6, 2025), we have about 7 months until the announcement for the 2024 Person of the Year, which would have been made around December 2024.

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: No
Historically, it is rare for a woman to be named the sole Person of the Year. When women have been recognized, they have often shared the title with men or groups, which would not satisfy the criteria for this question.

(c) Scenario resulting in a No outcome:
Donald Trump wins the 2024 U.S. presidential election and is named Time Person of the Year, continuing the pattern of newly elected or re-elected U.S. presidents receiving this recognition. This is plausible given that Trump is currently among the betting favorites for the award according to multiple betting markets.

(d) Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:
Kamala Harris makes history as the first female U.S. president after winning the 2024 election, making her impact so significant that Time names her the sole Person of the Year. Alternatively, another prominent woman like Yulia Navalnaya (widow of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny) could be recognized for extraordinary global influence.

## Rationale

Looking at the betting odds and historical precedent, there are several factors to consider in making this forecast:

Current betting markets show that the two frontrunners for Time Person of the Year 2024 are Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, with odds placing them nearly neck-and-neck as favorites[2][4]. This reflects the significance of the 2024 U.S. presidential election in shaping global headlines.

Historically, Time has often selected U.S. presidents in election years. If we follow this pattern, the winner of the 2024 election would have a strong chance of being named Person of the Year. If Harris were to win the election, she would have a high probability of receiving this recognition, potentially as the sole recipient.

However, Taylor Swift, who was named Person of the Year in 2023, appears in the betting odds again for 2024 at 9/1 odds[2]. While she has continued her record-breaking Eras Tour through 2024 and even entered the political sphere by endorsing Harris, it would be unprecedented for someone to win this recognition in consecutive years.

Other women appearing in the betting odds include Yulia Navalnaya at 10/1[2], representing the opposition to Putin's regime following her husband's death. Her selection would align with Time's occasional recognition of political dissidents and activists.

The historical rarity of women being named sole Person of the Year suggests a lower probability. Since the award's inception in 1927, very few women have been named individually, with most female recipients sharing the honor with others or as part of a group.

When considering the status quo and the slow pace of change in established institutions, we must recognize that even in years with highly influential women, Time has often not selected them as the sole Person of the Year. This historical pattern weighs heavily against a "Yes" outcome.

Based on the current betting odds and historical precedents, there is a meaningful but still minority chance that a woman will be the sole Person of the Year for 2024. The strongest path to this outcome would be Kamala Harris winning the presidential election, but even then, there's no guarantee she would be named individually rather than with her running mate or as part of a broader political movement.

Probability: 35%
