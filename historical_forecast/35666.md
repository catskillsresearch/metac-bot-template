(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
The Census Bureau will release the February 2025 building permits figure on March 18, 2025. From today (May 6, 2025), that event is already in the past, so the outcome is known. For the purpose of a forecasting exercise, if answering as of March 3, 2025, the release would have been approximately 15 days away.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
If the January 2025 seasonally adjusted annual rate (SAAR) of building permits simply continued, the figure would be 1,482,000 units, as reported for January[2][3][4].

(c) **Outcome if the current trend continued:**  
Building permits have been declining modestly:
- December 2024: 1,483,000
- January 2025: 1,482,000
- February 2025: 1,459,000 (revised)[4]

This reflects a slow decrease of about 1.6% month-on-month from January to February. If that trend persisted into February, an estimate near 1,459,000 would be reasonable[2][4].

(d) **Expectations of experts and markets:**  
Industry and market expectations for 2025 generally projected a modest overall decline in multifamily permitting, with some stability or slight improvement in the single-family sector, due to persistent affordability issues, high rates, and uncertainty in the new housing market[4][5]. Experts anticipated continued volatility and little near-term rebound in permit issuance as builders calibrate to demand and ongoing supply-side challenges[5]. Apartment starts and permits were especially expected to decline after the surge of 2022-23, while single-family permits were forecast to be relatively flat or show mild improvement.

(e) **Unexpected low outcome scenario:**  
A sudden financial shock—such as a sharp rise in mortgage rates, a major regional banking failure, or an unexpected economic policy disruption—could quickly dampen builder confidence and halt new projects, leading to a sharper-than-expected monthly drop (e.g., sub-1,390,000 units).

(f) **Unexpected high outcome scenario:**  
A rapid, unexpected easing of monetary policy or a surprise surge in demand (perhaps due to a change in immigration policy, tax incentives for builders, or a significant drop in mortgage rates) could spur permits well above recent levels, e.g., a spike over 1,520,000 units.

*All figures are seasonally adjusted annual rates, in thousands of units (e.g., 1,420,000 = 1.42 million).*
