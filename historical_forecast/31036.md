(a) Time until outcome: The outcome of this question will be known on January 2, 2025, when the TSA posts complete data for December 31, 2024. This is approximately 7 months and 27 days from today (May 6, 2025).

(b) Status quo outcome: Based on historical data, the total passenger volume for December 25-31, 2023 was approximately 17.3 million passengers. If nothing changes significantly, we would expect a similar volume for 2024.

(c) Scenario for No outcome: The TSA passenger volume could exceed 18 million if travel demand continues its strong growth trajectory seen throughout 2024, with the 6% year-over-year increase observed during Thanksgiving extending to Christmas week. Alternatively, volume could fall below 17 million if economic concerns, higher airfares, or severe weather events across multiple regions significantly depress travel demand during the holiday period.

(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: TSA passenger volume would fall between 17-18 million if growth continues but at a moderate pace (around 1-4% year-over-year) compared to 2023's approximately 17.3 million. This could happen if we see continued recovery but with some constraints like moderately higher airfares or slight economic headwinds that temper growth without causing a decline.

## Analysis of Historical Trends

Looking at the historical data for December 25-31 over the past few years, we can see a clear recovery pattern:

| Year | Total Passengers | Year-over-Year Change |
|------|------------------|------------------------|
| 2019 | ~17.1 million    | (pre-pandemic baseline)|
| 2020 | ~7.6 million     | -55.6% (pandemic)      |
| 2021 | ~13.5 million    | +77.6%                 |
| 2022 | ~14.8 million    | +9.6%                  |
| 2023 | ~17.3 million    | +16.9%                 |

The 2023 volume of 17.3 million already puts us within the target range (17-18 million) for a "Yes" outcome. This serves as our baseline reference point[1][4].

## Recent Travel Patterns and Projections

The search results indicate 2024 has been a record-breaking year for air travel:
- TSA passenger volumes reached record highs in 2024, with a 17% increase since 2022[5]
- The Thanksgiving 2024 travel period was projected to be the busiest on record with approximately 18.3 million travelers (a 6% increase from 2023)[5]
- AAA projected 119.3 million people would travel during the year-end holiday period (December 21, 2024 - January 1, 2025), narrowly surpassing the previous record set in 2019[2]
- AAA expected 7.85 million air passengers during the broader holiday period, which would set a new record[2]

However, I must consider the slowdown mentioned in the question background:
- By October 2024, year-over-year growth had slowed compared to summer
- The 7-day period through October 14, 2024 was down 1.4% against the comparable period in 2023

## Factors Affecting Holiday Travel

Several factors could influence the final outcome:

**Factors supporting growth:**
- Record-setting travel patterns throughout 2024
- Strong holiday travel projections from AAA
- Christmas Day falling on Wednesday in 2024, potentially spreading travel over more days[2]

**Factors constraining growth:**
- Slowdown in year-over-year growth observed in October 2024
- Potential economic headwinds or airfare increases
- Possible weather disruptions during winter travel season

## Probabilistic Assessment

Starting with the 2023 base of 17.3 million for the December 25-31 period, I need to estimate the most likely growth rate for 2024.

If we apply:
- 0% growth: 17.3 million (within the target range)
- 1% growth: ~17.5 million (within the target range)
- 2% growth: ~17.7 million (within the target range)
- 3% growth: ~17.8 million (within the target range)
- 4% growth: ~18.0 million (outside the target range)
- 5% growth: ~18.2 million (outside the target range)
- 6% growth: ~18.3 million (outside the target range)

Given the slowdown in growth noted in October 2024, I believe the 6% growth rate seen during Thanksgiving likely represents an upper bound. The most likely scenario is modest growth between 0-3%, which would keep the total within the 17-18 million range.

Considering the status quo (17.3 million in 2023) already falls within our target range, and given the historical patterns showing continued but moderating growth, I believe there is a higher probability that the outcome will fall within the target range than outside it.

Probability: 65%
