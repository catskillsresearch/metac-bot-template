Based on the available information, I'll provide a structured forecast for Tesla's Q1 2025 vehicle deliveries.

(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known:
Tesla typically reports quarterly deliveries on the second day of the following quarter. Since today is May 6, 2025, the Q1 2025 deliveries have likely already been reported (around April 2, 2025). However, I don't have access to that report in the search results.

(b) The outcome if nothing changed:
If Tesla's Q1 2025 deliveries remained the same as Q1 2024, they would be approximately 387,000 vehicles[1].

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued:
Tesla experienced a significant quarter-over-quarter drop from Q4 2024 (495,570 deliveries)[4] to what's predicted for Q1 2025. According to prediction markets, deliveries could fall to around 359,000 vehicles in Q1 2025, which would represent a 7% year-over-year decline and a 27% quarter-over-quarter decrease[2].

(d) The expectations of experts and markets:
Prediction markets currently forecast Tesla will deliver approximately 359,000 vehicles in Q1 2025[2]. Some analysts suggest deliveries could fall "significantly below 400,000" due to weakening demand across multiple markets worldwide[3]. The company is facing sales challenges particularly in Europe, where sales are reportedly down by as much as 50%, while Chinese sales are slightly down year-over-year[2].

(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome:
Tesla could face a perfect storm of negative factors: rapidly accelerating demand collapse across all major markets, production disruptions due to supply chain issues, and negative consumer sentiment related to Elon Musk's political activities. This could push deliveries down to around 320,000 vehicles or lower.

(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome:
Tesla's aggressive financing incentives (0% APR, zero due at signing, and free lifetime supercharging) could drive a late-quarter sales surge, particularly in the US market[3]. Combined with a potential production breakthrough for the refreshed Model Y, deliveries could exceed expectations and reach up to 410,000 vehicles.

As a humble forecaster, I need to set wide confidence intervals to account for unknown unknowns, especially since the data points to significant uncertainty in Tesla's delivery trajectory.
