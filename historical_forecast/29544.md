(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
The outcome will be known on January 1, 2025. As of the end of 2024, this is less than two months away.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
Joe Biden remains president through January 1, 2025, completing his first term without Kamala Harris becoming president. In this scenario, the answer is No.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
President Biden does not die, resign, or become incapacitated to a degree that triggers removal under the 25th Amendment, and therefore continues as president through at least January 1, 2025, with Harris remaining vice president.

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
President Biden dies, resigns, or is otherwise removed from office under the 25th Amendment before January 1, 2025. Kamala Harris would then assume the presidency and, provided she serves at least 30 consecutive days in that role before this date, the answer would be Yes.

## Rationale

The constitutional mechanisms for Vice President Harris to become president before January 1, 2025, are very clear: they require President Biden’s death, resignation, or removal from office[1][3]. While health and age are legitimate concerns—Biden is 81 and recently withdrew from the 2024 race, endorsing Harris as his preferred successor for the next term—there is no public evidence of imminent health crises or political processes underway that would make his exit likely before the end of the first term[2][4].

Harris has already once served as Acting President temporarily under Section 3 of the 25th Amendment during a medical procedure in 2021, but this did not make her president; the office only passes permanently upon death, resignation, or removal of the incumbent[3]. Temporary transfers of power for medical reasons, unless extended by unexpected crisis, do not satisfy the requirement for Harris to serve for 30 consecutive days.

Despite significant speculation and polling in the past questioning Biden’s fitness, political inertia and the high threshold for involuntary removal (two-thirds of both Houses of Congress) make such a scenario extremely unlikely in the absence of a clear, urgent crisis. Even with Biden’s decision to exit the 2024 race, this is about the next presidential term, not the current one[2].

Given historically how rarely a sitting president leaves office due to resignation or incapacity—only one resignation (Nixon), and no removals under the 25th Amendment outside voluntary medical procedures—the status quo strongly favors Biden remaining in office until at least January 1, 2025.
