(a) Time until outcome known: The outcome will be determined when NOAA publishes its official Global Land and Ocean Average Temperature Anomaly for November 2024, which should occur by early December 2024. Since today's date is May 6, 2025, the outcome is already known.

(b) Status quo outcome: Based on the search results, the global temperature anomaly for November 2024 was +0.64°C according to UAH satellite data[3]. This is below the specified range of 1.25°C to 1.31°C.

(c) Scenario for a No outcome: The official NOAA measurements confirm that November 2024's global temperature anomaly falls outside the 1.25°C-1.31°C range. This could occur if the cooling influence of La Niña conditions strengthened, or if regional cooling patterns (like those observed in western Antarctica and parts of the Pacific) had a greater impact on the global average.

(d) Scenario for a Yes outcome: The NOAA measurements place the November 2024 global temperature anomaly precisely within the narrow 1.25°C-1.31°C range. This would require the combination of persistent global warming trends with the moderating effect of the developing La Niña to create just the right conditions for the temperature anomaly to fall within this specific window.

## Rationale

Looking at the available evidence from November 2024, there are several factors to consider when evaluating whether the temperature anomaly will fall within the specific 1.25°C-1.31°C range.

According to the University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH) satellite data, the global temperature anomaly for November 2024 was +0.64°C (+1.15°F)[3]. This measurement is significantly below the specified range. However, it's important to note that different measurement methodologies and baseline periods can yield different results.

The Copernicus Climate Change Service reported that November 2024 was the 16th month in a 17-month period for which the global-average surface air temperature exceeded 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels[5]. This suggests that temperature anomalies measured against pre-industrial levels were higher than the UAH measurement, which uses a different baseline period.

Looking at NOAA's report for the contiguous United States, November 2024 was 3.6°F (approximately 2.0°C) above average, ranking as the sixth warmest in their 130-year record[2]. However, this is only for the contiguous United States, not global.

The ENSO conditions were transitioning toward La Niña, but as of November 2024, it was developing later than typical and expected to be weak if it formed at all[1][3]. The presence of a weak La Niña would typically have a slight cooling effect on global temperatures, but the effect would be minimal given its weak nature.

Temperature patterns showed significant regional variations, with some areas experiencing much warmer conditions (Hudson Bay, Middle East, China, eastern Russia) while others were cooler than average (western Antarctica, western North America)[3]. This regional variability makes it difficult to precisely predict the global average.

Given the historical context of 2023-2024, which saw record-breaking global temperatures, and the persistence of above-average sea surface temperatures in many ocean regions despite the developing La Niña conditions[5], it's reasonable to expect November 2024's global temperature anomaly to be well above the long-term average.

However, the specific range of 1.25°C-1.31°C is extremely narrow, making it less likely to be hit exactly. The UAH measurement of +0.64°C suggests that the NOAA measurement, while likely higher due to methodological differences, would probably fall outside this range on the lower side.
