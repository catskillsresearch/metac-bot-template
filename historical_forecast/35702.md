(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  
Today is May 6, 2025. The question’s cutoff is April 1, 2025, which is already in the past. Therefore, the outcome is already determined as of today.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
If no official NFL announcement or rule change regarding the "Tush Push" was made before April 1, 2025, the status quo outcome is **No**—the NFL did not ban the play by the deadline.

(c) **Scenario for a No outcome:**  
The Packers’ proposal to ban the "Tush Push" is not brought to a vote at the March 2025 owners’ meeting, is withdrawn, or fails to receive the required 24 of 32 owner votes. No official rule or restriction is approved or announced regarding the play before April 1, 2025[2][4].

(d) **Scenario for a Yes outcome:**  
At the March 2025 NFL owners’ meeting, the proposal to ban the "Tush Push" is voted upon and passes with at least 24 owner votes. The NFL officially announces or approves a rule banning or restricting the play before April 1, 2025[2][4].

## Rationale

As of early March 2025, the Packers had formally submitted a proposal to ban the "Tush Push," and it was scheduled to be discussed—potentially voted on—at the March owners' meeting in Palm Beach, Florida[1][2][4][5]. For the proposal to pass, approval from 24 of 32 owners was required[2]. Historically, the NFL has considered banning the play in previous offseasons but had not acted, and the last adjustment was a minor rule requiring “pushers” to be at least one yard behind the quarterback[5].

The debate is highly polarized:  
- *Arguments for a ban* are largely focused on concerns about fairness, aesthetics, and the perception of diminishing the role of skill in short-yardage situations[5].  
- *Arguments against a ban* emphasize the lack of injury data, the historical precedent allowing pushing, and concerns about "punishing" successful teams like the Eagles[3][5].

The key bottleneck is owner support. No reporting before April 1, 2025, suggested a groundswell of support for a ban, nor was there any indication that the necessary 24 votes would be reached. Furthermore, no reports confirmed that the NFL had officially approved or announced any such rule change by the deadline.

Given historical reluctance to make abrupt rule changes, especially on high-profile and controversial plays, **the status quo was heavily favored**. If no owner vote or rule announcement occurred by April 1, 2025, the question resolves as a No.

## Final Answer

**Probability: 0%**

As of the deadline (April 1, 2025), there was no official NFL approval or announcement restricting or banning the "Tush Push." The question resolves as No, and the probability that the NFL banned the "Tush Push" before April 1, 2025, is 0%[1][2][4][5].
