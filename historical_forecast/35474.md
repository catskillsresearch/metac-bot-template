(a) Time left until outcome: About 25 days (from today, May 6, 2025, until April 1, 2025 - which has already passed)
(b) Status quo outcome: No, the Gaganyaan-1 test flight did not launch before April 1, 2025
(c) Scenario for No outcome: ISRO maintained its revised Q2 2025 launch schedule as reported in multiple sources, with technical preparations and testing continuing beyond April 1, 2025
(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: ISRO accelerated its launch schedule from the reported Q2 2025 target and successfully launched the uncrewed test flight in March 2025

Based on the search results provided, I can see that the Gaganyaan mission has experienced several delays and schedule revisions. Let me analyze the likelihood that India launched the Gaganyaan-1 test flight before April 1, 2025.

Looking at the timeline of announcements and preparations, there is a clear pattern of delays for the Gaganyaan program. In October 2024, ISRO Chairman S. Somanath announced that the crewed Gaganyaan mission would not launch in 2025 as previously planned but would be pushed to 2026[2]. This delay for the crewed mission suggests a corresponding delay for the prerequisite uncrewed test flights.

Several sources from late 2024 and early 2025 specifically mention Q2 2025 as the target launch window for the Gaganyaan Demo Flight 1 (the uncrewed test)[4]. As of December 31, 2024, launch tracking sites were listing Q2 2025 (which begins April 1, 2025) as the earliest projected launch date[4].

While a January 2025 report mentioned local media suggesting a tentative launch "early this year, perhaps as soon as February"[5], this appears to have been speculative, as ISRO had not officially announced a date. The same report noted that ISRO was still in the process of completing various tests and validations of critical systems[5].

It's also important to note that as of February 2025, Wikipedia was reporting the expected launch of Gaganyaan as "no earlier than 2026"[1], indicating continued delays rather than acceleration of the program.

The status quo strongly favors the "No" scenario - that the launch did not occur before April 1, 2025. Space programs, especially those involving human-rated systems, typically experience delays rather than accelerations due to the rigorous safety testing required. Given ISRO's methodical approach to ensuring mission success and safety, and the consistent reporting of Q2 2025 as the earliest launch window across multiple sources, it is highly unlikely that they would have dramatically accelerated the timeline to launch before April 1, 2025.

Since we are now in May 2025, and there are no reports indicating a successful launch before April 1, 2025 (which would have been a major news event), we can reasonably conclude that the launch did not occur before the specified date.

Probability: 2%
