(a) **Time Left Until Outcome Known:**  
There are about six weeks remaining until the resolution date of October 1, 2024.

(b) **Status Quo Outcome If Nothing Changes:**  
As of now, Netflix is not listed on Tech Crunch's "comprehensive list of 2024 tech layoffs" for any material layoffs this year. If there are no new Netflix layoffs publicly reported by Tech Crunch in August or September 2024, the question will resolve as **No**[2].

(c) **Scenario That Results in a No Outcome:**  
Netflix conducts either no layoffs or only very small, unreported staff adjustments, or any such events are not picked up or listed by Tech Crunch in its tracker before October 1. For instance, the recent layoff of only 15 people in April 2024 was not significant enough to receive much coverage and may not prompt tracker inclusion[1]. Another example: Netflix reportedly has ongoing, small-scale reductions (such as 10 people in publicity), but these have not triggered tracker updates[3]. If this pattern continues, the answer remains No.

(d) **Scenario That Results in a Yes Outcome:**  
Netflix announces new, material layoffs in August or September 2024 that are substantial enough to be covered by major tech news outlets and specifically listed by Tech Crunch on its layoff tracker. Typically, previous instances that made the tracker involved layoffs in the hundreds or widely-reported restructuring. Should such an event be announced and added to the tracker during the specified period, the outcome is Yes[2].

## Rationale

- **Recent Layoffs Have Been Minimal:** The only confirmed Netflix layoffs in 2024 involved 15 people, too small to be categorized as "material" by Tech Crunch's standards or commonly included in their tracker[1].
- **Historical Pattern:** Netflix layoffs in recent years have been sporadic and, when significant, have typically involved hundreds of employees and attracted significant media attention.
- **Industry Context:** While the broader tech industry remains volatile and layoffs are ongoing at many companies, there is no strong indication of imminent, large-scale layoffs at Netflix. There are also conflicting rumors about hiring and potential small-scale cuts, but nothing concrete or substantial enough to alter the status quo[3].
- **Status Quo Bias:** Forecasters should give greater weight to the current lack of evidence for a large, imminent Netflix layoff, given the company's latest moves and industry trends. Sudden changes are possible but historically infrequent.

## Final Assessment

Based on the provided data and the specified criteria (Tech Crunch tracker inclusion, company-specific listing, timing), the probability of Netflix being newly listed for layoffs **before October 1, 2024** appears modest but nonzeroâ€”mainly due to the possibility of industry surprises, but the base rate and recent signals support the status quo.

**Probability: 15%**
