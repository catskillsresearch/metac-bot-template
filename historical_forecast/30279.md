(a) **Time until outcome is known:**  
The November 2024 NICS numbers should be released by the FBI in early to mid-December 2024, so the outcome will be known in about 3–4 weeks from now.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
Recent Novembers (2022, 2023) saw unadjusted NICS totals at 2.79 million (2022) and 2.65 million (2023), both well below the 3.0 million threshold[5]. The last time November exceeded 3 million was in 2020 (an election year), with a substantial spike, but in recent years the monthly total has not come close[5]. October 2024’s unadjusted total was 2.30 million, up just 4.7% from October 2023[4]. If this modest year-over-year trend persists, November 2024 will likely come in below 3.0 million.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
If the moderate, single-digit year-over-year growth seen in October 2024 continues and no major national event (e.g., legislative shock, widespread unrest) drives an unprecedented spike, NICS checks for November 2024 will rise marginally but remain under 3.0 million, consistent with patterns since 2021[4][5].

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
A “Yes” requires a sharp increase—on the order of 15–20% year-over-year growth—compared to November 2023, possibly triggered by an extraordinary surge in demand (e.g., highly publicized political turmoil, major policy announcements, or sudden national security fears) that brings the monthly total above recent norms[5].

---

**Rationale:**  
The status quo points toward a “No” outcome. The last two Novembers were below 3 million even as demand was relatively strong and the market remains elevated compared to pre-2020 levels[5]. October 2024’s unadjusted NICS number, at 2.30 million, showed only modest growth (4.7% year-over-year), not the kind of acceleration required to make up the 400,000–500,000 gap to the threshold in a single month[4]. Even factoring in the possibility that election-year uncertainty slightly boosts November checks, this would need to be well above the trends of the last two years and is not yet evident in recent monthly data.

Unless late-breaking events substantially shift public behavior before or during November, the most likely scenario is a total below 3.0 million. While a substantial, election-driven spike is not impossible, recent years’ experience—even in politically active environments—suggests that such a jump is improbable.

**Probability: 20%**
