Considering your interview question about recognizing Lukashenko as President of Belarus, I'll analyze the situation with a structured approach.

(a) Time left until outcome: Approximately 55 days (from May 6, 2025 to April 1, 2025). However, since we're already in May 2025, the outcome is already determined, as the deadline of April 1, 2025 has passed.

(b) Status quo outcome: Neither the US, EU, nor Brazil formally recognized Alexander Lukashenko as the legitimate President of Belarus following the January 26, 2025 elections or prior to April 1, 2025.

(c) Scenario resulting in a No outcome: The US, EU, and Brazil maintain their position of not recognizing the January 2025 election results as legitimate, consistent with their stance following the 2020 elections. They continue to view the election as fraudulent and maintain sanctions against the Belarusian regime.

(d) Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome: A major geopolitical shift occurs causing either the US, EU, or Brazil to reverse their position and formally recognize Lukashenko for strategic reasons, despite previously condemning the election results.

## Analysis of Current Situation

The January 26, 2025 presidential election in Belarus resulted in Alexander Lukashenko reportedly winning 86.82% of the vote with a turnout exceeding 85.7%[5]. This marked his seventh term in office, extending his 30+ year rule over Belarus[2][5].

Western governments, particularly the US and EU, have consistently refused to recognize Lukashenko's legitimacy since the 2020 elections. The European Parliament explicitly declared they did not recognize Lukashenko as the president of Belarus following the 2020 election and considered him persona non grata in the European Union[4].

## Recent Developments

The 2025 election has been widely condemned by Western powers:

- High Representative for EU Foreign Affairs Kaja Kallas and Commissioner for Enlargement Marta Kos issued a statement describing the 2025 election as a "sham" that was "neither free, nor fair"[5].
- German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock stated that "The people of Belarus had no choice. It is a bitter day for all those who long for freedom & democracy"[2].
- A European Commission spokesperson declared that the election has been "rejected as a sham" by western governments[2].

As recently as August 9, 2024, the US, EU, UK, and Canada announced new sanctions against Belarus, specifically citing "fraudulent presidential elections" that kept Lukashenko in power[1]. This demonstrates ongoing alignment among Western powers in their stance toward the Belarusian regime.

## Consideration of Precedent

The pattern established after the 2020 election provides strong precedent. Following those elections:
- The EU explicitly stated it did not recognize Lukashenko as legitimate
- The European Council declared the elections "neither free nor fair"
- The European Parliament recognized an opposition council as the "interim representation of the people" of Belarus[4]

This pattern has continued with the 2025 election, with immediate criticisms from Western governments following the announcement of results[2].

## Status Quo Considerations

The status quo strongly favors continued non-recognition. For recognition to occur:
1. A significant shift in foreign policy would be required
2. There would need to be a compelling strategic reason to reverse years of established policy
3. The governments would need to overlook their own recent statements condemning the election

None of these conditions appear to have been met before April 1, 2025.

Given the consistent and strong statements from EU officials rejecting the legitimacy of the 2025 election results, the recent history of sanctions against Belarus, and the absence of any information suggesting a change in position from these governments, it seems clear that the status quo of non-recognition continued through April 1, 2025.
