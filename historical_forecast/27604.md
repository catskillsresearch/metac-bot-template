(a) **Time remaining:**  
There are 35 days remaining until October 1, 2024.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
As of August 26, 2024, Mexico has not confirmed any Clade I mpox infections. All mpox cases reported to date (49 confirmed in 2024) are unrelated to Clade I or its subclades[2][4]. If current trends persist, the outcome would be **No**: Mexico will not confirm Clade I mpox infections before the deadline.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
Clade I mpox remains geographically limited to Africa and a few exported cases (e.g., Sweden), with no importation or onward transmission detected in Mexico. Surveillance remains vigilant and no positive Clade I genomic sequencing results are reported from Mexican laboratories before October 1, 2024. Official health bulletins and international situation reports continue to state no cases of Clade I in Mexico.

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
An imported case of Clade I mpox (including any subclade, such as 1b) is identified in Mexicoâ€”potentially through an international traveler or via secondary transmission following the spread observed in Europe or neighboring countries. Mexican health authorities confirm the case via genomic sequencing and officially report it in national bulletins and WHO/PAHO updates before October 1, 2024.

## Rationale

- **Status quo**: Available data from PAHO, WHO, and Mexican health authorities confirm that, as of August 26, 2024, there are no Clade I mpox cases in Mexico[1][2][4]. Existing cases are attributed to other clades, and recent infections are not genetically related to the Clade 1b variant driving the current emergency alert[2][4]. The closest confirmed export outside Africa is Sweden (reported August 15, 2024)[2].
- **Surveillance and policy**: Mexico has heightened its epidemiological surveillance and issued alerts in response to the WHO declaration. Laboratories are urged to test and genotype suspect cases, though resources and sequencing coverage remain a limiting factor[4]. Rapid reporting protocols are in place, reducing the likelihood of unrecognized, undetected introductions.
- **Transmission risk**: Despite substantial risk elevation given the ongoing Clade I outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and subsequent spread to neighboring African countries, as well as the first case of Clade I detected in Europe, there is no current evidence of Clade I mpox circulation in the Americas beyond historical endemic regions[1][2].
- **Importation dynamics**: Risk of introduction remains, but with no travel-related cases or transmission chains reported thus far and less than five weeks until the deadline, the probability of confirmation by October 1 remains moderate but below 50%.
- **Reporting delay**: Even if an imported case were to occur, laboratory confirmation (which requires genomic sequencing) and public reporting may introduce a delay, slightly further reducing the probability of timely confirmation.

## Final Probability Estimate

Given the above, while heightened international movement and vigilance create a non-negligible risk, good forecasting places weight on the status quo absent signs of imminent change. The probability that Mexico will confirm Clade I mpox infection before October 1, 2024, is:

**Probability: 28%**
