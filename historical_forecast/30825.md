(a) **Time until outcome is known:**  
The outcome will be determined after December 29, 2024, so there are just over three weeks (about 23 days from December 6, 2024) until the end of the relevant period.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
If current patterns hold, New Delhi will NOT experience "Hazardous" AQI for at least one third of the last two weeks of December 2024. Historically, even during very polluted winters, the proportion of "Hazardous" hours has remained well below this threshold—year-to-date in 2024, only 6% of hours have been "Hazardous," and in December 2023, no similar period sustained such high levels[3][4][5].

(c) **Scenario that results in a No outcome:**  
If air quality remains similar to recent patterns—dominated by "Very Unhealthy" and "Unhealthy" levels but with "Hazardous" hours remaining rare—then less than one third (that is, less than ~112 out of 336 hours) will be categorized as "Hazardous," resolving the question as No[3][5].

(d) **Scenario that results in a Yes outcome:**  
A Yes outcome would require a drastic and unusually sustained pollution event, such as an extended period of stagnant air, extreme temperature inversion, or a major local or regional biomass burning incident that drives "Hazardous" readings for at least a third of the time (over 112 hours in 14 days). This would likely require several days in a row with persistent "Hazardous" AQI, which has not occurred in recent history even during severe pollution episodes[3][5].

## Rationale

- **Historical data:** December in New Delhi is notorious for poor air quality, but the "Hazardous" category (AQI >300 per US EPA, or generally >400 in Indian systems) is rarely sustained over such a large proportion of hours. In December 2023, severe days occurred, but sustained "Hazardous" episodes over one third of the month were not observed[3][4][5].
  
- **Current (2024) trends:** The year-to-date data for 2024 shows only 6% of hours as "Hazardous," with typical winter increases but no evidence of a new record event underway. Early December has seen air in the "Poor" to "Very Poor" range, with the improvement on December 1 (AQI 285) showing the air can shift to lower categories given favorable weather[5].

- **Meteorological context:** Winter meteorology favors pollution buildup, but current indications (including above-average monsoon and recent dispersion events) do not suggest a prolonged, unprecedented pollution spell in late December 2024[3][5].

- **Status quo inertia:** Air quality deteriorates in late December, but the pattern is overwhelmingly "Very Poor" with only brief "Hazardous" spikes, making a sustained "Hazardous" period unlikely barring an exceptional event.

**Probability: 10%**

The chance of New Delhi recording "Hazardous" AQI for at least a third of the last two weeks of December 2024 is low, given typical patterns, current year data, and the absence of signs pointing to an extraordinary pollution event in the forecast period[3][5].
