(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  
From August 28, 2024, to September 30, 2024, is 34 days. The outcome will be known in just over a month.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
If current patterns persist, the outcome will be "No." The August 26, 2024, violation was the first confirmed entry of a Chinese military aircraft into Japanese territorial airspace since records began in 1958. Despite frequent near-incursions and over 669 scrambles in the past year, such actual violations are extremely rare[2][3][4][5].

(c) **Scenario for a No outcome:**  
Japan continues heightened vigilance and diplomatic pressure. Chinese military aircraft maintain their provocative approaches but do not cross into Japanese territorial airspace. No new airspace violation is officially reported by the Japanese Defense Ministry during the period.

(d) **Scenario for a Yes outcome:**  
Escalated tensions or miscalculation leads to another Chinese military aircraft entering Japanese territorial airspace (as defined by Japan and international law). The Japanese Defense Ministry publicly confirms such a violation through an official channel between August 28 and September 30, 2024.

## Rationale

- **Historical precedent:** In over six decades of monitoring, no Chinese military aircraft had ever violated Japanese territorial airspace until the August 26, 2024, incident[3][5].
- **Frequency of close encounters:** About 70% of JASDF scrambles target Chinese aircraft, totaling hundreds annually[2][4]. However, none of these led to a confirmed territorial breach until now.
- **Diplomatic reaction:** Japan's unusually strong diplomatic protest and demand for preventative measures, along with increased vigilance, make a near-term repeat less likely[1][2][5].
- **Geopolitical context:** While military activity and regional tensions remain high, both sides have strong incentives (deterrence, crisis management) to avoid incidents that could spiral out of control.
- **Public and official scrutiny:** The first violation being met with immediate and transparent official communication suggests that any future breach will be quickly and clearly reported.

Given the extreme rarity of such violations, the swift Japanese response, and the potential international consequences, the likelihood of another incident before October 1, 2024, is lowâ€”though not zero due to inherent unpredictability in military operations.
