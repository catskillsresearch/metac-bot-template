(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  
There are about 5 weeks remaining until April 1, 2025. The question will be resolved at that deadline whether or not any new developments occur.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
As of the most recent reporting (February 21, 2025), Perplexity AI has not announced plans for an IPO, nor has it filed an SEC Form S-1 or made any qualifying statement on its News page. If nothing changes before April 1, 2025, the outcome will be **No**[5].

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
Perplexity AI continues to rapidly grow and secure private funding, but does not publicly announce IPO plans or file an S-1 by April 1, 2025. The company may pursue more private fundraising, strategic partnerships, or even mergers, but without an explicit IPO announcement or filing, the resolution is No[5].

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
Perplexity AI decides to go public before April 1, 2025, and makes this official either by filing an SEC Form S-1 or publicly announcing the plan on its official News page. This announcement could be prompted by favorable market conditions, pressure from investors, or strategic necessity, but would need to occur within the monitored window[2][5].

---

At this stage, the preponderance of evidence points to a continued preference for private fundraising and partnership growth. While Perplexity is widely mentioned as a likely IPO candidate, there is no public evidence (as of February 21, 2025) of movement toward an IPO announcement within the next five weeks[2][5]. The status quo strongly favors no announcement, as high-growth AI companies frequently delay going public in favor of private capital and flexibility[1][5]. Speculative media mentions and strategic merger proposals do not meet the resolution criteria[3][5].

**Probability: 20%**
