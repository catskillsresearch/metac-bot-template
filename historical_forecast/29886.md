Based on the information provided, I need to assess Jelly Roll's chances of winning in specific categories at the 2024 CMA Awards.

(a) Time left until outcome is known: 9 days (from November 11, 2024 to November 20, 2024 when the 58th Annual CMA Awards ceremony will take place)

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: No winner has been announced yet, so the status quo is that Jelly Roll has not won any of the specified awards.

(c) Scenario resulting in a No outcome: Jelly Roll faces strong competition, particularly from Morgan Wallen (leading with seven nominations), Chris Stapleton and Cody Johnson (five nominations each). If these more heavily nominated artists win in their respective categories, Jelly Roll would not secure a win in any of his nominated categories.

(d) Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome: Jelly Roll has shown momentum in his career, recently winning three CMT Awards and securing his first Entertainer of the Year nomination. If voters recognize his breakthrough status and impact on country music, he could potentially win in one of his nominated categories.

Looking at the available evidence, I need to assess Jelly Roll's chances of winning in either Entertainer of the Year, Album of the Year (for "Whitsitt Chapel"), or Male Vocalist of the Year categories.

Based on the search results, Jelly Roll is confirmed to be nominated for Entertainer of the Year and Album of the Year ("Whitsitt Chapel")[1][3]. However, I don't see explicit confirmation that he's nominated for Male Vocalist of the Year, though he was nominated for Male Artist of the Year at the ACM Awards[4].

In the Entertainer of the Year category, Jelly Roll competes against Luke Combs, Chris Stapleton, Morgan Wallen, and Lainey Wilson[3]. This is an extremely competitive field, with Wallen leading overall nominations (seven) and Stapleton having five nominations[1][3]. As a first-time nominee in this category, Jelly Roll's chances may be somewhat lower against these established artists.

For Album of the Year, "Whitsitt Chapel" competes against strong contenders including Chris Stapleton's "Higher" and Cody Johnson's "Leather"[1]. Both of these artists have more total nominations than Jelly Roll, which could indicate broader industry support.

While Jelly Roll has shown significant momentum in his career, winning three CMT Awards[4] and being recognized as New Artist of the Year previously, the status quo in major award categories often favors artists with more total nominations or established track records in those specific categories.

Morgan Wallen and Chris Stapleton appear to be the frontrunners based on nomination counts alone[1][3]. This suggests that Jelly Roll, while certainly a contender, may face an uphill battle to secure a win in these major categories.

Given the competitive field, Jelly Roll's relatively fewer nominations compared to some competitors, and the tendency of major awards to favor established artists, I would assess that while he has a meaningful chance, it's more likely than not that he won't win in the specified categories.

Probability: 30%
