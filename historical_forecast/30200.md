I'll analyze this forecasting question about Biden's December 2024 executive orders:

(a) Time until outcome: The outcome will be known when December 2024 ends and the Federal Register updates its records. From today (May 6, 2025), this outcome is already determined as December 2024 has passed, but I need to determine what actually happened.

(b) Status quo outcome: Based on historical patterns, President Biden typically issued 1-2 executive orders in December during previous years of his presidency. If this pattern continued, the outcome would be "Yes" (1 or 2 executive orders in December 2024).

(c) Scenario for "No" outcome: President Biden could have issued either zero executive orders in December 2024 (perhaps due to holiday recess, focus on transition activities following the 2024 election, or lack of pressing policy matters) or more than 2 executive orders (perhaps due to a desire to cement his legacy before the end of his term or in response to multiple urgent situations).

(d) Scenario for "Yes" outcome: Maintaining his historical December pattern of 1-2 executive orders, President Biden issued exactly 1 or 2 executive orders in December 2024, perhaps for routine matters or modest policy initiatives.

Looking at the search results and the current date information, I notice that we're in May 2025, meaning December 2024 has already passed. The search results show executive orders from May 2025, but don't provide specific information about December 2024. However, I can analyze historical patterns to make an informed judgment.

Looking at President Biden's executive order history:
- 2021: 77 executive orders (average of 6.4 per month)
- 2022: 29 executive orders (average of 2.4 per month)
- 2023: 24 executive orders (average of 2 per month)

There's a clear downward trend in the number of executive orders issued each year. December typically sees fewer executive orders than other months, often just 1 or 2.

Additional considerations:
- December 2024 was after the 2024 presidential election, which likely affected executive order activity
- End-of-term presidents sometimes issue a flurry of executive orders to cement their legacy
- Conversely, they might also focus on transition activities rather than new policy initiatives

The status quo outcome of 1-2 executive orders seems most likely given the consistent pattern across previous Decembers in Biden's presidency. The downward yearly trend suggests that maintaining the pattern of 1-2 orders is more likely than exceeding it.

Without specific evidence to suggest a departure from the established pattern, and considering that end-of-term behavior can be variable but typically doesn't deviate dramatically from established patterns, I lean toward the status quo outcome.

Probability: 65%
