I'll analyze this forecasting question carefully based on the available data.

(a) Time left until outcome: The outcome will be determined by April 1, 2025, which is less than a month away from today (May 6, 2025). However, since the question asks about events before April 1, 2025, and today's date is May 6, 2025, the outcome period has already passed. We need to determine if the condition was met during the period before April 1, 2025.

(b) Status quo outcome: Based on the search results, we have partial data for Denver's temperatures in early 2025. The highest recorded temperature in Denver in 2025 (as of April 28) was 86°F on April 12[1]. However, this occurred after the April 1 deadline. For the period before April 1, we have some March data showing temperatures reaching around 80°F on May 4[5], but this is also after the deadline.

(c) Scenario for No outcome: If Denver's highest temperature before April 1, 2025, remained below Honolulu's lowest low temperature during the same period, the outcome would be No. Given that Honolulu typically has mild temperatures year-round, with lows rarely dropping below 65°F even in winter, it's possible Denver's temperatures in winter/early spring didn't exceed this threshold.

(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: If Denver experienced an unusually warm day in January-March 2025 that pushed temperatures above Honolulu's lowest recorded temperature during the same period, the outcome would be Yes. Denver can experience significant temperature swings and occasionally has warm days even in winter due to downsloping winds.

As a forecaster, I need to analyze what we know from the data:

1. The highest temperature recorded in Denver in 2025 (as of April 28) was 86°F on April 12[1], but this is after the April 1 deadline.

2. We have some data for early May showing temperatures reached 80°F on May 4[5], but this is also well after the April 1 deadline.

3. Denver's temperature patterns in March typically include an average temperature of about 41.6°F with historical records showing the highest March temperature ever recorded was 84°F[4].

4. We lack specific data for Denver's highest temperature in January-March 2025, and we have no data on Honolulu's lowest temperature during this period.

Given that the outcome period has already passed (we're in May 2025 looking back at a period before April 1, 2025), and we lack the specific data needed for both cities during the relevant timeframe, I cannot make a definitive forecast. However, based on typical weather patterns, Denver occasionally experiences warm days even in winter/early spring that could exceed Honolulu's typical lows.

Without specific data points for both locations during the relevant period, I must rely on climatological patterns and the partial information available. Denver can experience significant temperature swings, and if there were any unseasonably warm days in late March (which often happens), temperatures could have temporarily exceeded Honolulu's lowest lows.

Probability: 60%
