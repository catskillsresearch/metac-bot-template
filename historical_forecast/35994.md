(a) Time left until outcome: 9 days. The Curaçao general election is scheduled for March 21, 2025, which is 9 days from the current date of May 6, 2025. Wait, that doesn't make sense - the election should have already happened. Based on the search results and current date (May 6, 2025), the election has already occurred.

(b) Status quo outcome: According to the search results, the Movement for the Future of Curaçao won the 2025 general election with 13 seats out of 21 (55.22% of votes)[2]. This represents an increase of 4 seats from their previous position.

(c) Unexpected outcome scenario: An unexpected outcome would have been if smaller parties like Movementu Kousa Promé or Mihó Kòrsou had gained enough votes to secure representation in parliament. Alternatively, if the National People's Party had significantly increased their seat count beyond the 4 they received, or if the Real Alternative Party had maintained or increased their representation instead of losing 2 seats.

Looking at the 2025 election results provided in the search data, I can see that the Movement for the Future of Curaçao emerged as the clear winner with 13 seats, representing 55.22% of the votes[2]. This is a significant increase of 4 seats compared to their previous representation.

The National People's Party maintained their position with 4 seats (16.31% of votes), while the Real Alternative Party lost 2 seats, ending up with only 2 seats (10.03% of votes)[2].

The Partido MAN-Partido Inovashon Nashonal maintained their 2 seats with 8.46% of votes. Several smaller parties including Curaçao is the Best, Movementu Kousa Promé, Work for Curaçao, and Mihó Kòrsou failed to secure any seats in parliament[2].

The Curaçaoan Parliament consists of 21 members who are directly elected by proportional representation to serve 4-year terms[1]. The election appears to have been conducted properly, as past elections in Curaçao have been reported as peaceful and orderly, reflecting the will of the people and reinforcing their commitment to the democratic process[3].

Given that the search results show the actual 2025 election results, my forecast is simply reporting these outcomes:

Movement for the Future of Curaçao: 100%
Real Alternative Party: 0%
Another outcome: 0%
