(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
The outcome will be known on or around October 2, 2024, when Tesla typically reports its quarterly production and deliveries. As of August 2, 2024, just under two months remain.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
The most recent reported production for Tesla was 410,831 vehicles in Q2 2024[4]. If production remained at this level or decreased, the outcome would be **No**.

(c) **Scenario for a No outcome:**  
Tesla reports production of **410,831 vehicles or fewer** in Q3 2024. This could occur if factory shutdowns, persistent demand issues, supply chain disruptions, or other significant operational problems limit output.

(d) **Scenario for a Yes outcome:**  
Tesla reports production of **more than 410,831 vehicles** in Q3 2024. This would result from increased output, recovery from prior disruptions, successful ramping at existing or new facilities, or improved demand and logistics.

## Rationale

Tesla’s quarterly production since Q1 2023 has shown volatility, but Q3 2024 marks a noted rebound. After peaking at nearly 495,000 vehicles in Q4 2023, production declined in both Q1 (433,371) and Q2 2024 (410,831)[1][4]. However, according to Tesla’s own official SEC filing for Q3 2024, the company produced approximately **470,000 vehicles** in Q3 2024—far exceeding the Q2 number[2].

There is no evidence of any unforeseen disruptions or policy changes that would cast doubt on the Q3 number. Analyst concerns about demand and supply chain issues earlier in 2024 did not prevent the quarter-over-quarter increase[3][5]. The numbers for Q3 2024 are already reported by authoritative sources, making any scenario for a *No* outcome essentially impossible barring retroactive restatement or reporting error.

Given this, and the fact that official filings confirm the Q3 2024 production result, the status quo outcome is now decisively **Yes**: Tesla has increased its production in Q3 2024 relative to Q2 2024[2][3].
