(a) **Time Left Until Outcome Is Known**  
The official data for August 2024's youth unemployment rate is expected to be released by Trading Economics or the NBS sometime in September 2024, so there is less than one month left until the outcome is known.

(b) **Status Quo Outcome if Nothing Changes**  
The youth unemployment rate rose to 17.1% in July 2024, the highest since the new methodology was adopted. If economic and labor market conditions persist, the rate is likely to remain above 16.0% for August 2024[4][1].

(c) **Scenario for a 'No' Outcome (Rate Above 16.0%)**  
If private sector job creation stays weak, the influx of 12 million graduates continues to outpace job openings, and no significant policy stimulus is introduced, the rate will remain at or above the July level, producing an outcome above 16.0%[1][4][5].

(d) **Scenario for a 'Yes' Outcome (Rate â‰¤ 16.0%)**  
A 'Yes' outcome would require an abrupt, significant improvement in youth employment. This could only realistically happen if there were a sudden and effective policy intervention, a large-scale hiring wave by major employers, or a methodological change or data revision that reduces the reported rate. However, no such developments have been reported as of early September 2024[1][4].

## Rationale

Recent data shows a clear upward trend: the youth unemployment rate reached 17.1% in July 2024, up from 14.9% in December 2023 after a methodological change to exclude students[4][1]. This rise is driven by structural challenges, such as insufficient private sector hiring, skills mismatches, and a historic number of new graduates entering the job market[1]. The broader economy continues to face headwinds, with only moderate consumption growth and no major new policy interventions announced that could quickly reverse these dynamics[1][4].

Given that August is immediately after July, and no major positive labor market developments or government interventions have occurred, the default expectation is for the youth unemployment rate to stay at or above July's level or possibly rise further. Good forecasting practice gives extra weight to the status quo, especially in the absence of strong catalysts for change.

While official data and definitions could see unexpected revisions, or economic policy could surprise to the upside, there is no evidence as of early September 2024 to suggest a sharp enough improvement to bring the rate down to 16.0% or lower for August.
