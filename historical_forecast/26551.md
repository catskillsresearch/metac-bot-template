(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
There are approximately two months remaining until the deadline of September 30, 2024.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
As of July 24, 2024, Revolut has obtained a *restricted* UK banking licence, entering a regulatory mobilisation phase. This is not a full banking licence; Revolut remains an e-money institution in the UK and cannot offer full banking services until it exits mobilisation and secures full approval[3][4][5]. If nothing changes and no full licence is granted before September 30, 2024, the question will resolve as "No".

(c) **Scenario for a No outcome:**  
Revolut continues in the mobilisation phase past September 30, 2024, as is typical for other fintechs. The regulatory review, close supervision, and demonstration of operational standards take several months to a year, and no formal full banking licence is announced by the FCA or PRA before the deadline[3][4].

(d) **Scenario for a Yes outcome:**  
Revolut completes the mobilisation phase exceptionally quickly, successfully addresses all regulatory requirements—including demonstrable improvements in anti-money laundering controls and operational resilience—and the FCA/PRA make a formal announcement of approval for a full UK banking licence before September 30, 2024.

## Rationale

The best reference for the current regulatory position is that Revolut has only just received a restricted banking licence in July 2024, starting the mobilisation period[3][4]. This phase is a standard requirement, often lasting up to a year, during which Revolut must prove to regulators that it can operate as a compliant bank. During mobilisation, Revolut has significant limitations: deposit caps (£50,000 total), continued EMI status, and operational restrictions[3].

There is no public indication from regulators or credible financial news sources that this process will conclude unusually quickly or that the FCA/PRA are prepared to grant a full licence imminently. While Revolut's CEO has expressed optimism that approval is "coming soon," such optimism is not uncommon among executives and should be weighed against the procedural realities and past delays caused by complex capital structures and lingering AML risks[2][4].

Historical precedent with other challenger banks (e.g., Monzo, Starling) suggests that full approval after mobilisation is thorough and deliberate, rarely completed in just a few months. Given previous regulatory hesitations and the lack of any formal announcement or signal of accelerated progress, the most probable scenario is that the mobilisation phase will extend beyond September 30, 2024.

**Probability: 5%**

Unless there is an unprecedented acceleration, Revolut is very unlikely to obtain a full UK banking licence before September 30, 2024[3][4][5]. The default, status quo outcome is "No."
