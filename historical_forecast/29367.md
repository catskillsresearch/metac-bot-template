(a) **Time until outcome known:**  
The outcome will be known by November 6, 2024, at 4:00 AM ET. As of October 30, 2024, that's about one week away.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
Historically, Dave Wasserman, Nate Silver, and Nate Cohn are known for calling elections based on available data when the results are clear enough. However, there are no public commitments or new policies from any of them regarding early calls for 2024. The polling environment is more cautious due to fewer polls and mixed signals, but there are still enough data for credible analysis[2]. If current trends—high uncertainty, polling splits, and lack of overwhelming clarity—hold on election night, the *status quo* leans toward **no early call** by these analysts.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
Suppose, on election night, the results in major swing states remain too close to call due to late-counted ballots, persistent polling uncertainty, and possible divergence between the popular vote and the Electoral College. In this scenario, Dave Wasserman, Nate Silver, and Nate Cohn refrain from calling the winner before 4:00 AM ET on November 6, either out of caution or lack of decisive data[2]. This would resolve the question as **Yes**.

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
If the election night data is unexpectedly decisive—for example, key states such as Pennsylvania, Michigan, or Arizona report clear margins early, and the path to 270 electoral votes for one candidate is unambiguous—then at least one of these analysts may confidently call the winner before the AP or other media outlets do. This would resolve the question as **No**.

## Rationale

Given the context:
- The 2024 race is expected to be close, with polling splits and fewer high-quality polls available, increasing analyst caution[2].
- There are no known public commitments from Wasserman, Silver, or Cohn to either refrain from or accelerate early calls this year.
- Their history is to call when data is clear, but not recklessly so.
- Modern elections, especially recent ones, have frequently seen delays in decisive data due to mail ballots and close margins.

Good forecasters recognize that most of the time, the status quo prevails, and radical shifts (such as a sudden early landslide) are rare. Therefore, the baseline expectation is that **analysts will be cautious, especially in a year with evident polling complexity and likely close state results**.

Probability: **Yes** outcome (no call before 4 AM) is a bit more likely, but the possibility of a fast result cannot be ruled out. Balancing the history of caution, current polling uncertainty, and the lack of a known overwhelming favorite, I forecast:

Probability: **65%**
