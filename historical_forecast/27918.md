(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
As of September 4, 2024, there are 12 days until September 16, the deadline for Starliner Calypso to undock from the ISS for the outcome to resolve as "Yes."

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
Boeing's Starliner Calypso is officially scheduled by NASA and Boeing to undock from the ISS on September 6, 2024, at 6:04 p.m. EDT[1][2][3]. This date is well before the September 16 cutoff. If operations proceed as currently scheduled, the undocking will happen within the "Yes" window.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
A "No" outcome would require a delay or cancellation of the scheduled undocking. This could happen if:
- Technical issues arise with Starliner’s autonomous undocking software or propulsion systems during final checks.
- Concerns from NASA or Boeing about Starliner’s readiness to undock autonomously are raised, leading to additional tests or software updates.
- An unexpected operational issue with the ISS or its other visiting vehicles prompts NASA to postpone the undocking.
- Change in contingency planning for crew safety or ISS operations causes NASA to delay Starliner’s departure past September 16.

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
A "Yes" outcome will occur if Starliner Calypso undocks from the ISS on its scheduled date of September 6, 2024, or any time before September 16. This includes the scenario currently planned and officially announced by NASA and Boeing, wherein Starliner performs an autonomous undocking and return sequence to land at White Sands Space Harbor[1][2][3].

## Rationale

The current plan—supported by official NASA and Boeing statements, operational planning, and news briefings—is for Starliner to undock on September 6, 2024, with live NASA coverage scheduled for the event[3]. The backup rationale for this timing includes the need to clear the docking port for Crew Dragon arrivals and broader ISS scheduling considerations[3][5].

While there is always a small risk of last-minute technical issues, these would have to appear and be significant enough to delay the undocking for over a week—past September 16. Most credible sources and the current operational schedule point toward Starliner undocking as planned, and history suggests the default scenario is for schedules to hold unless a significant anomaly is discovered. The risk of a significant, schedule-altering issue so late in preparations is present but low, especially given the operational focus and lack of crew risk for the uncrewed return.

Probability: **95%**  
Starliner Calypso is highly likely to undock from the ISS before September 16, 2024, given the current schedule, public statements, and operational imperatives[1][2][3][5].
