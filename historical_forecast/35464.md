(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known: 10 months from the current date (May 6, 2025) until March 31, 2025. Actually, since we're already in May 2025, the outcome is already known but not reflected in the search results which only go up to February 27, 2025.

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed: As of the latest information available (February 27, 2025), Cathy Harris has been temporarily reinstated as MSPB Chair through a judicial temporary restraining order while her lawsuit is being considered.

(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome: The federal court ultimately rules against Harris, determining that the President has the authority to remove her despite the statutory protections. Alternatively, Harris could voluntarily resign from her position before March 31, 2025, or the Trump administration could find legal grounds under the "inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance" standard to remove her.

(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome: The federal court issues a final ruling upholding Harris's position that her removal violates the Civil Service Reform Act, making her temporary reinstatement permanent. The legal proceedings extend beyond March 31, 2025, leaving her temporary reinstatement in effect through that date.

Forecasting whether Cathy Harris will still be listed as chairing the Merit Systems Protection Board on March 31, 2025 requires careful analysis of the legal, institutional, and political factors at play.

## Current Situation

As of February 27, 2025, Cathy Harris has been temporarily reinstated as Chair of the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) by U.S. District Judge Rudolph Contreras[1]. This followed President Trump's actions to first demote her as chair on his first day in office and then fire her completely on February 10, 2025, despite her term not being scheduled to end until March 2028[1]. 

Harris filed a lawsuit on February 11, 2025, challenging her dismissal on the grounds that the Civil Service Reform Act only permits removal of MSPB members "for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office"[1]. The temporary restraining order issued by Judge Contreras prevents the Trump administration from removing Harris while her lawsuit is being considered and reinstates her as chairwoman, giving Democrats a 2-1 advantage on the board[1].

## Legal Considerations

The core legal question is whether the President can remove an MSPB member without meeting the statutory causes specified in the Civil Service Reform Act. There is strong precedent supporting the view that when Congress establishes specific conditions for removal of officials, these limitations are binding on the President. The fact that Judge Contreras issued a temporary restraining order suggests he found merit in Harris's initial arguments.

The MSPB serves a critical function in protecting federal employees from partisan political practices, and its independence is structurally important[1]. This institutional role strengthens the case for enforcing the statutory limitations on removing board members.

## Timeline Considerations

The temporary restraining order is just thatâ€”temporary. For Harris to remain chair through March 31, 2025, either:
1. The court would need to issue a final ruling in her favor before that date
2. The legal proceedings would need to extend beyond March 31 with the temporary order still in effect
3. The administration would need to abandon its efforts to remove her

Given the complexity of the case and the importance of the legal principles involved, it would not be unusual for the proceedings to extend for several months. Based on typical timeframes for federal litigation of this nature, it's quite possible that a final resolution might not occur before the March 31, 2025 target date.

## Political Context

The Trump administration has shown determination to reshape federal agencies, particularly those with oversight functions. The dismissal of Harris occurred alongside other personnel changes in oversight bodies[1]. This suggests a strategic approach rather than an isolated incident, indicating the administration may continue to pursue Harris's removal through all available means.

## Weighting the Status Quo

As a forecaster, I recognize that the status quo often has inertia. The temporary reinstatement represents the current state of affairs, and judicial proceedings typically move slowly. Courts are generally cautious about allowing potentially unlawful removals, particularly when statutory language explicitly limits removal authority.

The temporary restraining order itself indicates the judge found:
1. A likelihood that Harris would succeed on the merits
2. That she would suffer irreparable harm without interim relief
3. That the public interest favored temporary reinstatement

These factors suggest a significant probability that Harris's position will be protected at least through the litigation process.

## Probability Assessment

Given the statutory protections for MSPB members, the initial judicial action favoring Harris, the typical timeline of federal litigation, and the institutional importance of MSPB independence, I assess that Harris is more likely than not to remain as chair through March 31, 2025. However, the determined efforts of the administration to remove her and the uncertainty of judicial proceedings introduce significant uncertainty.

Probability: 65%
