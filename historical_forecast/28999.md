(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
Approximately 2 months remain until the end of 2024, at which point it will be definitively known whether a book written by a language model has made the New York Times Best Seller list before 2025.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
No book written by a language model (99%+ AI-generated, main text of at least 20,000 words, minimal human intervention) has appeared on the NYT Best Seller list as of October 21, 2024[1][2]. If current trends persist and no new evidence emerges, the outcome will remain "No" at the end of the year.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
AI-generated books continue to proliferate but none are able to achieve the sales volume, marketing support, or cultural attention necessary to be listed by the NYT before 2025. Additionally, the lack of publicly verifiable attribution (i.e., books that are openly and credibly marketed as 99%+ language model–written) makes it unlikely that any book meeting the strict criteria gets recognized on the NYT list in the time remaining.

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
A publisher or self-published project uses a language model to generate an entire (20,000+ word) book, markets and promotes it aggressively, and the book resonates with the public or captures media attention—leading to a sales surge sufficient for NYT Best Seller list inclusion. The authorship is disclosed and can be independently verified to meet the 99%+ AI-generated threshold. NYT’s methodology allows the book, either knowingly or without special scrutiny, onto its list.

## Rationale

- **Historical precedent:** There is no documented case of a language model–authored book (meeting these strict criteria) achieving NYT Best Seller status so far[1][2].  
- **Industry and media monitoring:** AI-generated books are increasingly common and widely discussed, but still face skepticism, limited mainstream acceptance, and do not appear in reputable sources as NYT best sellers[1].  
- **Verification & transparency issues:** The NYT does not disclose authorship methodology for books on the list, nor is there a public database that identifies the role of AI authorship for charting works[3]. Furthermore, mainstream publishers have not announced such an achievement, and self-published efforts, while possible, have not cracked the list as of the cutoff date.
- **Barriers to rapid change:** The NYT’s editorially curated process, lag in industry transparency, potential stigma, and the inherent difficulty in achieving bestseller status—especially for non-celebrity or unconventional authors—make it highly unlikely that this milestone is reached in the final months of 2024 without significant, currently unforeseen developments.

Given the lack of evidence, the slow pace of change in high-profile publishing, and the absence of a trend break as of October 21, 2024, the **status quo heavily favors a No outcome**.
