(a) **Time Until Outcome Is Known**

- From today (May 6, 2025) until April 1, 2025, is *negative time*: the deadline has already passed. However, if we reference the research provided, which appears to use a February 21, 2025, analysis date, the time left from that date until April 1, 2025, is approximately 5-6 weeks.

(b) **Status Quo Outcome If Nothing Changed**

- As of the last available check (late February 2025), Noodles & Company had not filed for bankruptcy.
- If no major developments or shocks occurred by April 1, 2025, the default outcome would be *No bankruptcy filing* by that date. The status quo for distressed public companies is often a slow decline, with management exhausting turnaround options and external financing before resorting to bankruptcy.

(c) **Scenario Leading to a No Outcome**

- The company avoids bankruptcy by continuing cost-cutting (store closures, layoffs), seeking financing, and possibly executing a reverse stock split to maintain Nasdaq listing[1][3][5].
- Cash flow, while negative, is enough to stave off a liquidity crisis for several more months, especially with net debt projected to decrease significantly from 2023 to 2024[2].
- Lenders cooperate, and there is no sudden external shock (e.g., sharp revenue plunge or debt maturity) forcing a bankruptcy petition before April 1, 2025.

(d) **Scenario Leading to a Yes Outcome**

- A severe, unexpected event (e.g., loss of financing, covenant violation, sharp further sales deterioration) suddenly causes a liquidity crisis, leaving the company unable to meet obligations.
- Lenders or landlords push for immediate relief through the courts.
- Management determines all options are exhausted and files for bankruptcy protection before April 1, 2025.

## **Rationale**

Noodles & Company is in clear financial distress: declining sales, operating losses, cash flow challenges, and the threat of Nasdaq delisting[1][3][5]. However, bankruptcy is a specific, costly step typically taken only when all alternatives are exhausted or a true cash crunch makes continued operation impossible.

As of February 2025, most signals suggest management is still focused on turnaround efforts: closing underperforming stores, reducing headcount, adjusting benefits, and considering a reverse stock split for compliance[1][3]. Delisting risk is recognized, but even that process provides time extensions and alternatives[5]. The company's projected financials, while weak, do not yet indicate an immediate liquidity crisis before April 1, 2025[2]. Net debt is projected to drop sharply in 2024, possibly from asset sales or refinancing, which could buy short-term survival[2].

Bankruptcy filings for public restaurant companies often lag many months after the onset of distress, as management and stakeholders typically attempt every other option first. The June 2025 deadline for Nasdaq compliance gives further incentive to delay such an action if possible[1][5]. There is no public evidence as of late February 2025 of imminent bankruptcy (such as missed debt payments, sudden leadership departures, or bankruptcy-specific communications).

Given these facts and absent knowledge of any new crisis as of late February 2025, the status quo scenario (no bankruptcy by April 1, 2025) remains significantly more likely, although material risk exists.

**Probability: 20%**  
This reflects elevated risk given continued deterioration but recognizes that bankruptcy filings prior to April 1, 2025, remain unlikely compared to the alternative of protracted distress and further attempts at stabilization[1][2][3][5].
