(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  
There are approximately one month and two days (about five weeks) until February 28, 2025.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
As of late January 2025, Chasiv Yar remains contested but not fully under Russian control. Ukrainian forces still hold significant positions, most notably the former brick factory, and recent Russian assaults have failed to completely dislodge them[1]. The ISW last noted that while Russia is advancing and using effective small-unit tactics, Ukraine is still present and actively defending. If nothing changed from the current status, the outcome would be **No**—Russia would not have full control of Chasiv Yar at the specified coordinates.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
Ukrainian forces successfully reinforce and resupply their positions, particularly around key defensive strongpoints like the brick factory. Despite continued Russian assaults—including their reported use of small, mobile assault groups—Ukrainian defenders prevent further Russian advances. The front line remains static or Ukrainian forces even recapture some ground. As a result, the ISW map on February 28, 2025, shows the coordinates as not under Russian control.

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
Russian forces maintain momentum, leveraging their effective small assault unit tactics and exploiting the deteriorating conditions for Ukrainian defenders (lack of supplies, limited civilian evacuation)[1]. Russian troops succeed in encircling and overrunning the remaining Ukrainian positions—specifically the former brick factory—and establish uncontested control over Chasiv Yar. By February 28, the ISW map marks the coordinates as Russian-controlled.

## Rationale

- **Status Quo and Trends:**  
The situation in Chasiv Yar as of January 22, 2025, is precarious for Ukrainian defenders. Russian advances have been documented within the town, with Russian troops reportedly "moving in the direction of the factory," and their small assault group tactics are described as "effective"[1]. Ukrainian forces still control the brick factory, but conditions are worsening, and civilian support is no longer feasible due to the intensity of fighting and Russian drone activity.

- **Russian Offensive Momentum:**  
Recent patterns indicate that while Russian forces consistently push forward, their pace is incremental. For instance, Russian troops have not made confirmed new advances as of January 14, 2025, despite persistent assaults[4]. However, there is credible evidence of territorial gains in January, especially in central Chasiv Yar.

- **Ukrainian Defensive Capabilities:**  
Ukrainian units have demonstrated some ability to recapture lost ground and repel attacks in and near Chasiv Yar, but their position is increasingly difficult, particularly given the logistical constraints and the loss of civilian infrastructure[1].

- **Remaining Timeframe:**  
A five-week window remains before the resolution date. While rapid collapses are possible in intense urban battles, most recent updates suggest a slowly shifting but not collapsing front. Historically, urban and semi-urban battles in Ukraine (such as Bakhmut and Avdiivka) have seen protracted fighting even under heavy pressure, often with defenders holding out longer than expected.

- **Weighting the Status Quo:**  
Given the relatively slow rate of change observed in similar battles and the resilience shown by Ukrainian defenders, the most likely outcome favors continuation of the current contested status, unless a significant breakthrough occurs. It is prudent as a forecaster to assign extra weight to the status quo with incremental Russian advances, rather than predicting imminent and total Russian control in the short timeframe remaining.

## Final Probability Estimate

Given the current defensive posture, the difficulties faced by Ukrainian defenders, Russian momentum, and the remaining time until February 28, 2025, I assess:

**Probability: 60%**

that Russia will have control of Chasiv Yar at the specified coordinates on February 28, 2025.

This probability slightly favors a Russian advance based on recent trends and Ukrainian vulnerability but also reflects the resilience of Ukrainian defenses and the slow pace of territorial change in similar battles[1][4].
