(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
There are approximately 20 days left until the resolution date of March 21, 2025.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
As of the latest available data, the Ukrainian General Staff had reported 862,390 Russian personnel losses as of February 19, 2025[5]. The daily reported loss rate has averaged about 1,300 per day throughout February 2025[5][3]. If this rate continues, the 900,000 threshold would be reached before March 21, 2025.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
A No outcome would occur if the daily reported loss rate dropped dramatically (e.g., due to a sudden ceasefire, peace agreement, or a major change in reporting practices), or if the Ukrainian General Staff ceased publishing updates before the 900,000 milestone was reported. Another No scenario would be an official correction that retroactively lowers the cumulative loss figure below 900,000 before the deadline.

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
A Yes outcome would occur if the Ukrainian General Staff continues its current reporting practices and operational tempo, maintaining or increasing the average daily personnel loss rate. If the current average of approximately 1,300 losses per day is sustained, the threshold will be reached around March 20, 2025, before the March 21 cutoff[5][3].

## Rationale

The most reliable indicator is the status quo: daily reported Russian personnel losses are consistently above 1,000 since July 2024 and continue to average about 1,300 per day into early March 2025[3][5]. There have been no reported interruptions or changes to the Ukrainian General Staffâ€™s publication practices. Additionally, corroborating reports indicate that Russian personnel losses remain exceptionally high, with no signs of a sudden, dramatic reduction in combat intensity or changes in reporting that could push the figure below 900,000 past the deadline[5][3].

Barring a highly unusual and rapid reduction in hostilities or a cessation of public reporting, existing trends strongly favor the 900,000 milestone being reported before March 21, 2025. In fact, reporting from the Ukrainian General Staff on March 31, 2025 already notes over 915,000 total losses, further confirming this trajectory[5].
