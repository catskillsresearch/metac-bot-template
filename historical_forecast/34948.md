(a) Time left until outcome is known: Approximately 2-3 weeks. The PlayStation Store's top downloads for February 2025 will likely be published in early-to-mid March 2025, based on the pattern of previous monthly reports (January 2025's report was published on February 11, 2025).

(b) Status quo outcome: If nothing changes, we would expect to see 3-4 sports games in the EU top downloads list for PS5 in February 2025, with EA Sports FC 25 remaining prominent. This is consistent with recent trends observed in the January 2025 data and throughout 2024.

(c) Unexpected outcome scenario: An unexpected outcome could occur if a major new sports game is released in February 2025 that wasn't mentioned in the available data, or if a significant update to an existing sports title drives renewed interest. Alternatively, if there's a major non-sports game release that dominates downloads, it could push several sports titles lower on the list, resulting in fewer sports games appearing in the top downloads.

Based on the search results provided, I can analyze the trends in PlayStation Store downloads to make a forecast about sports games in February 2025's top downloads for the EU.

The data shows clear patterns regarding sports games' popularity in the EU market. In January 2025, EA Sports FC 25 was the top downloaded game in Europe[4][5]. This indicates strong ongoing interest in sports titles, particularly soccer games, which is unsurprising given soccer's popularity in Europe.

Looking at historical data, sports games have maintained a consistent presence in PlayStation's top downloads. While we don't have the exact number of sports games in the top downloads for each month of 2024, we know that multiple sports titles appeared throughout the year, including EA Sports FC 24/25, NBA 2K24/25, UFC 5, and others.

February typically doesn't see major sports game releases, as most annual sports franchises update in late summer or fall to align with their respective real-world seasons. EA Sports FC titles usually release around September, NBA 2K around September, and Madden NFL in August. Without new releases, download rankings tend to be driven by existing popular titles.

The seasonal factor is important to consider as well. February doesn't coincide with the start of major sports seasons that might drive increased interest in related games. However, the ongoing popularity of established sports franchises suggests they'll maintain their positions in the download charts.

Based on these factors, I would expect the number of sports games in the EU top downloads for February 2025 to be similar to January 2025 and previous months. Without specific data on exactly how many sports games were in January's top downloads, I'm inferring from the available information that 3-4 sports games is the most likely outcome, with EA Sports FC 25 almost certainly being one of them.

As a professional forecaster, I recognize that while the status quo is the most likely outcome, I should account for unexpected scenarios. There's a reasonable chance we could see fewer sports games (0-2) if new non-sports releases dominate the charts. There's also a possibility of seeing more sports titles (5 or more) if multiple sports games maintain their popularity or if there are unexpected sports game releases or promotions.
