I'll provide a professional forecast analysis for the interview question about US airline passenger volume during Christmas-New Year's week 2024.

(a) Time until outcome: Approximately 8 months. The outcome will be known after December 31, 2024, when the TSA publishes the final passenger counts for the week of December 25-31, 2024, with resolution by January 7, 2025 at the latest.

(b) Status quo outcome: Based on current trends, the status quo would be a Yes outcome. Passenger volumes have been consistently increasing, with 2024 showing a 6% year-over-year increase for Thanksgiving travel and a 17% increase since 2022[5]. If these growth patterns continue, passenger volume would exceed the 2023 benchmark of 17,307,363.

(c) No outcome scenario: A significant economic downturn or unexpected travel disruption could lead to a No outcome. If airfare prices increase substantially due to inflation or fuel costs, consumer demand could decrease. Alternatively, widespread extreme weather events during the holiday period could lead to mass cancellations and lower passenger volumes, or a new health concern could emerge that deters travel.

(d) Yes outcome scenario: Continued economic stability coupled with the trend of increasing travel demand would lead to a Yes outcome. TSA is already projecting record numbers for Thanksgiving 2024[5]. If the pattern of 6% year-over-year growth observed for Thanksgiving continues through December, the Christmas-New Year week would easily exceed the 17,307,363 benchmark from 2023.

## Analysis of Key Factors

The data shows consistent growth in air travel throughout 2024. Passenger volume in early 2024 was 6% higher than 2023 and 5% above pre-pandemic 2019 levels[2]. This indicates a solid recovery and expansion beyond pre-pandemic baselines.

The TSA has recorded multiple record-breaking days in 2024, with August 30, 2024, seeing the highest single-day passenger count ever at 2,909,901[3]. This demonstrates that the capacity for higher volumes exists and has been tested successfully.

For the 2024 Thanksgiving period, TSA projected a 6% increase over 2023 volumes[5]. If this growth rate holds for the Christmas-New Year period, we would expect approximately 18.35 million passengers during December 25-31, 2024, which would exceed the benchmark by over 1 million passengers.

The busiest travel days after Christmas 2023 were December 26, 27, and 30, along with January 2, 2024[4]. With Christmas 2024 falling on a Wednesday, we can expect similar patterns with heavy travel on the Thursday and Friday after Christmas, potentially creating even higher volume due to the mid-week holiday positioning.

## Risk Factors to Consider

While the trend is positive, several factors could impact the outcome:

- **Economic conditions**: Inflation or recession could reduce discretionary spending on travel
- **Weather events**: Severe winter storms across key hub airports could lead to widespread cancellations
- **Operational challenges**: Staffing shortages or technical issues could constrain capacity
- **Unforeseen events**: Global or domestic incidents that discourage travel

However, the TSA and airlines appear well-prepared for the 2024 holiday season. Secretary Mayorkas stated that the "TSA workforce will be on duty throughout Thanksgiving Day and week," suggesting strong operational readiness that will likely extend to the Christmas period[5].

## Weighting the Status Quo

While acknowledging that unexpected events can occur, the status quo of increasing passenger volumes provides a strong baseline. Air travel has shown remarkable resilience and growth post-pandemic. The consistent year-over-year increases throughout 2024 establish a clear trend that would need to be disrupted by a significant event to reverse.

The 6% growth seen for Thanksgiving 2024 would only need to be maintained (not increased) for the Christmas-New Year period to result in a Yes outcome. Given that the Christmas-New Year period typically sees similar or higher travel volumes than Thanksgiving, this seems reasonable.

Considering all factors and giving appropriate weight to the status quo trend of increasing passenger volumes, I assess that there is a high probability that the Christmas-New Year week in 2024 will exceed the 2023 passenger count of 17,307,363.

Probability: 82%
