(a) Time left until outcome: 61 days (from July 30, 2024 to September 30, 2024)

(b) Status quo outcome: No invasion occurs; diplomatic tension continues but remains below the threshold of military conflict.

(c) No scenario: Venezuela continues its provocative rhetoric and legal maneuvers regarding the Essequibo region but adheres to the December 2023 joint declaration promising non-use of force. International pressure and Venezuela's own economic challenges prevent military escalation beyond border posturing.

(d) Yes scenario: Maduro's government, facing internal political pressure and seeking to capitalize on nationalist sentiment, orders a limited military incursion of more than 100 troops into the disputed Essequibo territory, claiming to be "reclaiming Venezuelan land" following the April 2024 law establishing it as a Venezuelan state.

Based on the available information, I assess that a Venezuelan invasion of Guyana before September 30, 2024 is unlikely. The status quo strongly favors continued tension without crossing the threshold into actual invasion for several reasons:

First, despite escalatory rhetoric and concerning actions like the April 2024 "Organic Law for the Defense of Guayana Esequiba," both countries have maintained diplomatic channels. Venezuela and Guyana established a joint commission in January 2024 to address the dispute and have committed to dialogue rather than force[1]. This commitment was reinforced in the December 2023 joint declaration where both sides explicitly pledged not to threaten or use force against one another[1][4].

Second, international constraints are significant. The International Court of Justice ruled in December 2023 that Venezuela must refrain from actions altering the status quo in Essequibo[4]. An invasion would face significant international condemnation and potentially trigger responses from regional powers and the United States, which has shown concern about the situation.

Third, while Venezuela has deployed military forces to the Guyanese border, including troops, light tanks, and missile-equipped patrol boats[3], these actions appear more consistent with posturing and pressure tactics than immediate preparation for invasion. Such deployments serve Venezuela's strategy of maintaining pressure while avoiding the substantial risks of actual military conflict.

The most concerning indicators are Venezuela's formal legal steps to claim Essequibo as its territory and the military deployments near the border[1][3]. The law signed by Maduro in April 2024 establishing Essequibo as Venezuela's "state number 24" represents a significant escalation in Venezuela's territorial claims[1]. Combined with military movements, these steps demonstrate that Venezuela's claims are not merely rhetorical.

However, several factors mitigate against invasion in the near term:

- The economic and political costs of invasion would be severe for Venezuela's already struggling government
- Both countries continue participating in diplomatic forums to address the dispute
- No evidence yet indicates Venezuelan troops have entered Guyanese territory
- The timeline until September 30 is relatively short for organizing a large-scale military operation

While Venezuela has taken provocative steps that increase tensions, the balance of evidence suggests that crossing the threshold to actual invasion within the next two months remains unlikely. The status quo of heightened tensions without direct military confrontation is likely to persist in this timeframe.

Probability: 15%
