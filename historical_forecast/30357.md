(a) **Time until outcome is known**:  
The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim is scheduled to open on December 13, 2024. Opening weekend box office figures are typically reported Sunday morning after release, so the outcome should be known by December 15, 2024. As of November 21, 2024, just over three weeks remain until the number is published.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
Both major industry trackers (BoxOfficeTheory and BoxOfficePro) currently place the film's opening weekend forecasted range straddling the $20 million mark. BoxOfficeTheory reports a range of $15–24 million, with a midpoint and average forecast around $20 million[2]. BoxOfficePro reports a range from $10–25 million[1]. The status quo central tendency is essentially right at the $20 million threshold, suggesting an approximately even chance of being above or below that mark at this time[1][2].

(c) **Scenario leading to No outcome (≤ $20M):**  
A No outcome occurs if final ticket pre-sales and opening weekend turnout are soft—perhaps due to lukewarm reception to marketing, limited interest in an animated, non-Peter Jackson entry, or strong competition from other holiday releases like Sonic the Hedgehog 3 or Thunderbolts. If The War of the Rohirrim functions more as a niche event for die-hard fans and does not expand to general audiences, it could open in the $15-18 million range, consistent with the lower end of forecasts[1][2].

(d) **Scenario leading to Yes outcome (> $20M):**  
A Yes outcome is realized if pre-release buzz, strong reviews, effective marketing, or nostalgia draws more mainstream viewers than expected. If the film successfully taps into the franchise's fanbase and reaches beyond to families or anime fans, it could easily exceed $20 million, especially given the upper ends of current forecasts ($24–25 million)[1][2]. Strong advance ticket sales or positive critical/social media reception could push it decisively above the threshold.

## Rationale

The status quo is a near coin-flip: tracking models from respected industry sources place their midpoint or consensus right at $20 million[1][2]. There is genuine uncertainty, and the opening will hinge on late-breaking factors like pre-sales, final marketing, and competitive positioning in a crowded holiday window. Historical context suggests the franchise's brand is strong, but this installment has notable handicaps: it's animated (a first for the series on this scale), lacks the live-action prestige of prior Peter Jackson films, and arrives over 20 years after the original trilogy's cultural zenith[1][3][4].

Good forecasters give extra weight to current tracking and consensus, since sudden surges or drop-offs are less common absent strong new data. The current industry expectation implies a roughly even chance, with perhaps a slight lean below $20 million due to the "uncertainty premium" and repeated caveats in trade analysis about the film performing well below earlier trilogies.
