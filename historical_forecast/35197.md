Looking at the interview question about Fentanyl Citrate injections being in shortage on April 1, 2025, I'll analyze this methodically:

(a) Time until outcome is known: April 1, 2025 is approximately 11 months from the current date (May 6, 2025). Actually, since May 6, 2025 is after April 1, 2025, the outcome should already be known based on the current date.

(b) Status quo outcome: Based on the search results, Fentanyl Citrate Injection was expected to remain in shortage until at least April 28, 2025[3]. Since we're now in May 2025, the status quo would be that it was indeed in shortage on April 1, 2025.

(c) Scenario for No outcome: The FDA could have resolved the shortage earlier than expected if manufacturers ramped up production significantly, alternative suppliers entered the market, or emergency measures were implemented to address the specific shortage. The FDA might have updated its shortage list before April 1, 2025, removing Fentanyl Citrate injections.

(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: The projected shortage end date of April 28, 2025[3] suggests the shortage was ongoing on April 1, 2025. Manufacturing challenges, supply chain issues, or increased demand could have maintained or worsened the shortage situation through that date.

## Rationale

Looking at the available evidence, several factors point to Fentanyl Citrate injections being in shortage on April 1, 2025:

The Drugs.com Current Drug Shortages List explicitly states that Fentanyl Citrate Injection had an expected shortage end date of April 28, 2025[3]. This is a strong indicator that the shortage was ongoing on April 1, 2025, which is nearly a month before the projected resolution date.

Additionally, injectable opioids including fentanyl citrate were noted as facing shortages in November 2024[4], indicating this was a persistent issue. The drug appeared on current shortage lists, suggesting it was a recognized and ongoing problem.

Drug shortages, particularly for injectable medications, often take significant time to resolve. The FDA considers a shortage "resolved" only when supply consistently meets demand[4], which requires sustained manufacturing improvement.

The search results don't indicate any specific accelerated resolution for this particular shortage. While the FDA has implemented measures to address various drug shortages, including temporary flexibility for compounding certain drugs[4], there's no evidence that these measures specifically resolved the Fentanyl Citrate injection shortage ahead of schedule.

Given that we're looking backward from our current date (May 6, 2025) to April 1, 2025, and the projected shortage end date was April 28, 2025, it's highly likely that Fentanyl Citrate injections were still listed as in shortage by the FDA on April 1, 2025.

Putting extra weight on the status quo outcome (continued shortage until April 28, 2025), and the absence of any evidence suggesting early resolution, the probability is very high that the shortage persisted on April 1, 2025.

Probability: 95%
