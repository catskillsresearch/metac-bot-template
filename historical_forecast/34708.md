(a) **Time left until the outcome will be known:**  
As of today, May 6, 2025, the threshold date (April 1, 2025) has already passed. For this forecast, assume the assessment date is February 9, 2025 (the "knowledge cutoff" date), which means there were approximately 51 days (about 1.7 months) remaining until the question resolves.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
As of the knowledge cutoff, there had been no official Chinese announcement of a second PLA military base in Africa outside Djibouti. Thus, the status quo outcome would be **No**.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
Despite speculation, China does not reach or publicly announce any agreement to build a military or dual-use base in Africa (outside Djibouti) before April 1, 2025. Negotiations may remain secret, stall, or host nations may hesitate due to international, regional, or domestic pressures.

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
China formalizes and publicly announces (by April 1, 2025) an agreement with an African government—likely Equatorial Guinea or another candidate country—to build a new PLA military or dual-use facility. This includes official statements or joint press releases confirming the base.

## Rationale

**China’s intentions and activity:**
- China’s ambitions to expand its military footprint in Africa are well documented. Official statements and policy direction signal ongoing interest in “deepening involvement in Africa’s security affairs” and “enhancing the quality and effectiveness of defense cooperation” with African militaries[1].
- Multiple sources note China’s interest—specifically pointing to Equatorial Guinea, Angola, and Namibia as potential hosts for a future base. The Gulf of Guinea is repeatedly mentioned as a strategic focus, and the PRC is described as likely to pursue “more military bases and infrastructure around the continent”[5][3].
- The expansion of the existing Djibouti base (and its evolution from a “logistics facility” to a major naval hub) indicates both capability and precedent for further overseas basing[5].

**Constraints and headwinds:**
- Despite these signs, no agreement has been publicly announced as of February 9, 2025. Previous years of speculation have not yet yielded a public declaration.
- Host countries must make significant political calculations, and there is potential for internal, regional, or international resistance to hosting a PLA base[4].
- China’s “long-term strategy around bases in Africa is unclear”—deliberate ambiguity is possible, especially to manage diplomatic risk[4]. Keeping plans private until agreements are certain serves Chinese interests.
- African countries may hesitate to formalize a deal under U.S., European, or regional scrutiny.

**Process and momentum:**
- When China announced the Djibouti base, there was significant international reporting, but also a lengthy buildup period. If an announcement were imminent, more concrete signs (statements, construction activity, leaks) might be visible.
- While the direction of travel is clear, world events and government deals often proceed more slowly than anticipated, especially given high-stakes geopolitical implications.

**Weighing the status quo:**  
Historical inertia (slow, careful movement) and ongoing ambiguity suggest the status quo—no public announcement by April 1, 2025—remains the most likely outcome, though the substantial evidence for preparations and intent means the probability of an announcement is not negligible.

**Probability: 20%**

This reflects a modest but real risk China will announce a second PLA military base in Africa before April 1, 2025, primarily in Equatorial Guinea. However, the likelihood remains low in the short term due to the absence of recent concrete public moves and the typically slow pace of such sensitive international agreements[1][3][5].
