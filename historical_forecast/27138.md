(a) **Time left until outcome:**  
Just over one month remains until the outcome is known—September 17, 2024, from today (August 13, 2024).

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
As of mid-2024, Nvidia has already surpassed Apple in market capitalization. On June 18, 2024, Nvidia became the world's most valuable company, with a market cap of $3.34 trillion, overtaking both Microsoft and Apple[3]. Since then, all three—Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple—have at times held market caps exceeding $3 trillion[2]. If the current situation holds, Nvidia’s market capitalization would remain higher than Apple’s on September 17[2][3].

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome (Nvidia < Apple):**  
A No outcome would likely occur if Nvidia experiences a sharp stock correction or if investor sentiment shifts away from AI-driven growth. Possible triggers include disappointing quarterly results, slower-than-expected AI or chip demand, supply chain disruptions, or a broad tech sector selloff. Conversely, Apple could regain its lead if it releases a strong product cycle (e.g., new iPhone or AI-powered services), posts unexpectedly robust financials, or otherwise impresses investors relative to Nvidia. Macro conditions, such as higher interest rates disproportionately impacting high-growth stocks like Nvidia, could also play a role[4][5].

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome (Nvidia > Apple):**  
A Yes outcome could result from continued or accelerated investor enthusiasm for Nvidia’s AI leadership and data center dominance, strong quarterly earnings, or evidence that corporate AI investment will sustain or expand. If Apple’s growth remains steady but less remarkable—perhaps due to maturity in core product lines—while Nvidia continues to capture the lion’s share of upcoming AI and infrastructure spending, Nvidia could maintain or widen its lead[2][4][3].

## Rationale

Nvidia’s surge to become the world's most valuable company in June 2024 was driven by intense demand for its AI chips and rapid expansion of AI infrastructure by major tech firms[3][2]. All three—Nvidia, Apple, and Microsoft—remain in a volatile race for the top market cap spot, but Nvidia’s momentum and narrative remain strong as of August 2024[2]. 

However, good forecasting means putting extra weight on the status quo: *most of the time, the world changes slowly*. Therefore, since Nvidia is already ahead, it is more likely than not to remain ahead unless a significant reversal or Apple outperformance occurs.

That said, the risk of a sudden market rotation, AI spending disappointment, or a sharp correction remains material—especially given the volatility in both tech valuations and sentiment around generative AI[4][5]. Apple, with its immense stable cash flows driven by hardware and services, could surprise or benefit from any market “flight to safety.”

**In sum:**  
- Nvidia currently leads and is favored to remain ahead in the near term.
- Market caps of both are volatile and could shift on new data or market sentiment.
- With just over a month to go and the trends still favoring Nvidia, the probability that Nvidia’s market cap will be greater than Apple’s on September 17, 2024, is **more likely than not**, but not a certainty.

**Probability: 65%**
