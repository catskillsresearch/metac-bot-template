## Forecast Analysis for Unique Posters on Bluesky

Given the context and available data as of December 20, 2024, here's an analysis for predicting the number of unique posters on Bluesky on December 29, 2024.

### (a) Time Left Until the Outcome is Known
- **9 days** remain until December 29, 2024, when the outcome is known.

### (b) Status Quo Outcome (No Change)
- Assuming no change in user engagement or posting behavior, the number of unique posters might remain stable at previous levels. However, given the rapid growth in total users, some increase in unique posters is likely.

### (c) Outcome if Current Trends Continue
- With Bluesky's recent surge in user registrations (from 15 million to 25 million users) and the general trend of increasing engagement on social media platforms, it's plausible that a higher percentage of users will become active posters. This is especially true if new users are joining to engage with content actively.

### (d) Expectations of Experts and Markets
- Experts might expect a moderate increase in unique posters as new users become more familiar with the platform and start engaging. The market's expectations could be influenced by trends in similar platforms and the ongoing migration from X.

### (e) Unexpected Scenario with a Low Outcome
- An unexpected **policy change** that restricts posting capabilities, a **technical issue** that makes posting difficult, or a **significant decrease in user interest** due to external factors (e.g., a competing platform attracting attention) could result in a low outcome.

### (f) Unexpected Scenario with a High Outcome
- An unexpected **partnership with influential content creators** or a **successful campaign encouraging user engagement** (e.g., through contests or events) could significantly increase the number of unique posters.

### Estimating the Number of Unique Posters
Given that Bluesky has over 25 million users and using historical data that suggests about 3-5% of users are unique posters, we can estimate a baseline range. However, as new users join, this ratio might increase slightly due to higher engagement levels.

Assuming an average ratio of unique posters to total users as 4% based on historical trends (a conservative increase over the 3-5% range considering recent growth):
- **Estimated Unique Posters**: \(25,000,000 \times 0.04 = 1,000,000\)

### Final Prediction

**Percentile 10**: 750,000  
**Percentile 20**: 850,000  
**Percentile 40**: 950,000  
**Percentile 60**: 1,050,000  
**Percentile 80**: 1,150,000  
**Percentile 90**: 1,250,000  

This prediction reflects a wide range to account for uncertainties in user engagement and the potential impact of future trends or unexpected events.
