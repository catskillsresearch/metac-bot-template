(a) Time left until outcome: 26 days (from May 6, 2025 to April 1, 2025 - note this has already passed)
(b) Status quo outcome: "Snack foods" is listed on the USDA's "What Can SNAP Buy?" page as an eligible item
(c) A No scenario: The Trump administration implements policy changes removing "snack foods" from the eligible items list in response to the USDA chief's February 2025 statement about banning "bad food and sugary drinks"
(d) A Yes scenario: No changes are made to the SNAP-eligible food categories, and "snack foods" continues to be listed as it was as of February 19, 2025

Looking at the question carefully, I notice there's a timing issue. The query states the outcome will be determined on April 1, 2025, but today's date is May 6, 2025. This means the outcome should already be known. However, since I don't have search results showing the current status of the USDA's "What Can SNAP Buy?" page as of May 2025, I'll need to analyze what's most likely to have happened.

Based on the search results provided, I don't see any concrete evidence that changes to SNAP-eligible food categories were planned or implemented between February and April 2025. The most recent SNAP-related information from the search results is from March 1, 2025, which discusses payment amounts but makes no mention of changes to eligible food categories.

While there was discussion from a Trump USDA chief in February about potentially restricting "bad food and sugary drinks," implementing such policy changes typically requires a regulatory process that includes public notice, comment periods, and implementation timelines. This process generally takes months to complete, making it unlikely that "snack foods" would be removed from the eligible items list in the short period between mid-February and April 1.

The search results show that SNAP continues to follow established guidelines for eligible food items, including "foods for the household to eat" across various categories[3][4]. There's no indication of an imminent change to these categories.

Good forecasters tend to favor the status quo when there's no strong evidence of change, especially for governmental programs that typically change slowly due to administrative and regulatory requirements. Without clear evidence of an impending policy change specifically targeting "snack foods," the most reasonable prediction is that this category remained listed on April 1, 2025.

Probability: 85%
