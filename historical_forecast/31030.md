(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
There are 18 days remaining until the deadline of January 1, 2025.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
As of December 13, 2024, Blue Origin has New Glenn fully integrated and on the launch pad at LC-36, but the rocket has not yet completed its critical static fire ("hot fire") test and is still awaiting regulatory approval for that test[1][3][4]. No launch date has been publicly announced. If nothing changes—meaning no static fire or regulatory clearance in the next two weeks—the launch will not occur before the deadline, resolving the question as **No**.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
Delays in securing regulatory approval or technical issues during the static fire test could prevent Blue Origin from launching New Glenn before January 1, 2025. For example, if the hot fire is postponed or reveals problems that require further repair or analysis, the launch window would slip past the end of the year, and the maiden flight would be delayed into 2025[1][3][4].

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
If Blue Origin promptly receives regulatory approval in the coming days, successfully conducts the static fire test with no significant issues, integrates the fairing and payload without delay, and finds a suitable launch window before January 1, the New Glenn rocket could launch before the deadline[1][3][4]. This would require a highly efficient sequence of events with minimal unexpected problems.

## Rationale

Blue Origin's public statements and technical progress indicate a strong push to launch before the end of 2024, with official language stating the mission is "on track" for this year[2][3]. However, the outstanding requirements are non-trivial:

- **Regulatory approval for the hot fire test is still pending as of early December**[3].  
- **The static fire test itself is a known risk point**—any anomaly could introduce days or weeks of delay, especially for a first-time, full-scale integrated test[1][3].
- **Payload fairing integration and final preparations must follow the hot fire test**, compressing the remaining schedule into the holiday season—a period that often introduces range and staff constraints.

Historically, inaugural launches of large orbital rockets frequently experience last-minute technical or regulatory delays. While Blue Origin has brought New Glenn to the pad—a major milestone—there are multiple steps left, any of which could push the flight into January or beyond.

Given the short timeline (less than three weeks), the outstanding tests and approvals, and standard patterns of aerospace project execution, the "status quo" scenario (No launch by January 1, 2025) remains the base rate and deserves extra weight.

**Probability: 25%**  

While not impossible, the likelihood of Blue Origin launching New Glenn before January 1, 2025, remains moderate but well below even odds due to the compressed remaining timeline and the non-negligible risks attached to first-of-its-kind operations and approvals[1][3][4].
