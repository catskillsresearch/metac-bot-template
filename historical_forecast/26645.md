(a) **Time Left Until Outcome is Known:**  
Approximately 66 days remain until September 30, 2024.

(b) **Status Quo Outcome if Nothing Changes:**  
No formal diplomatic relations will be established between Saudi Arabia and Israel by the deadline. There are ongoing informal contacts but no public mutual announcement of diplomatic normalization as required by the question[4][1][5].

(c) **Scenario Resulting in a No Outcome:**  
Saudi Arabia maintains its current position tying normalization to the recognition of an independent Palestinian state. Israel’s government continues to oppose a two-state solution, and no mutual agreement or public announcement is made. The current regional instability, especially the aftermath of the Gaza conflict, makes any breakthrough highly unlikely in this timeframe[1][3][5].

(d) **Scenario Resulting in a Yes Outcome:**  
A dramatic shift occurs: either the Israeli government softens its stance and offers a credible commitment toward Palestinian statehood, or Saudi leadership decides to sidestep its public prerequisite for a two-state solution, perhaps in exchange for major U.S. security guarantees or incentives. Both countries would then make a formal, public announcement of intent to establish diplomatic relations before September 30, 2024[2][3].

## Rationale

Saudi Arabia’s official position is unwavering: “there will be no diplomatic relations with Israel unless an independent Palestinian state is recognized on the 1967 border, with east Jerusalem as its capital”[1][5]. This position has been repeatedly and publicly emphasized by Saudi and U.S. officials, especially in the wake of the war in Gaza. Israel’s current government, led by Prime Minister Netanyahu, remains firmly opposed to a two-state solution[3]. Netanyahu and his coalition partners have publicly rejected any movement toward Palestinian statehood, seeing it as unacceptable and as "a reward for terrorism"[3].

Despite persistent U.S. efforts to broker a deal, these core positions have not softened. In fact, the ongoing Gaza conflict has further entrenched Saudi requirements for normalization around the Palestinian issue and made any diplomatic opening even less likely[1][3][5]. While informal cooperation and contact between the two countries continue—especially on security matters[5]—neither government seems willing, or politically able, to take the public leap required by the question.

To reach a Yes outcome, one or both sides would need to make a major policy reversal in the next two months. This would require either a public Israeli commitment to a two-state solution, which is contrary to everything signaled by the current government, or a Saudi decision to abandon its decades-old demand for Palestinian statehood, which would have serious domestic and regional repercussions for Riyadh. There are no credible signals that such dramatic changes are imminent[1][3].

Given the firm positions, regional instability, and short time left, the most likely outcome is that no agreement to establish diplomatic relations will be announced by September 30, 2024.

**Probability: 5%**
