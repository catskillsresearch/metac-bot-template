(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
Approximately 5 weeks, as the assessment window closes on September 30, 2024.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
CDC’s current assessment (as of July 8, 2024) is "VERY LOW" risk to the US general public from mpox. No new domestic cases of clade I mpox have been detected, and US surveillance has not indicated a rise in risk. Therefore, the status quo outcome is "No"—the CDC’s risk assessment will not exceed "High" before October 1, 2024[1][2][5].

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
- No significant increase in imported or locally transmitted mpox cases (especially clade I) within the US.
- Continued effectiveness of current surveillance, prevention, and vaccination measures.
- The outbreak in Africa, while severe, does not translate to domestic transmission or increased risk to the US general public.
- CDC maintains its current or only modestly elevated risk categorization due to lack of change in domestic epidemiology[1][2][5].

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
- Sudden, sustained, and widespread transmission of clade I or clade II mpox in the US general population, with clear evidence of high infectiousness or immune escape.
- Multiple large outbreaks in US communities outside known high-risk groups, overwhelming containment efforts.
- New evidence showing the US population has much lower immunity than anticipated, or the virus develops novel, highly transmissible or virulent traits.
- CDC rapidly revises its risk assessment based on the above, issuing a written document classifying risk as above "High" ("Very High") for the general public.

## Rationale

The evidence overwhelmingly supports the status quo:

- **No domestic cases of clade I mpox** have been detected as of August 22, 2024[1].
- The CDC’s most recent official assessment remains at "VERY LOW" and, even while an update is pending, neither public statements nor risk alerts suggest a significant increase is imminent[1][2].
- **Risk factors for a rapid escalation**—including large-scale undetected transmission, substantial viral change, or a failure of detection/vaccination measures—are absent. The US has robust diagnostic, surveillance, and response infrastructure[1][2][5].
- **Global context matters**: While the WHO has declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern for Africa, the CDC explicitly maintains that the risk to the US general public is very low, and focus remains on targeted recommendations for travelers and high-risk groups, not the general public[1][2][5].
- **Expert analysis (e.g., Johns Hopkins)** continues to assess the risk to the US general population as low, including in scenario-based modeling for summer 2024[5].
- A shift to a "Very High" risk assessment for the general public would require a dramatic and rapid epidemiological change in the US not suggested by any current evidence.

Given the inertia of public health risk categorization, the resilience of US detection systems, and the lack of current domestic threat—even in the face of serious developments abroad—the probability of CDC raising its risk assessment above "High" for the US general public before October 1, 2024, is exceedingly low.

**Probability: 1%**
