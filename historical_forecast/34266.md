(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 2 months (from January 29, 2025 to April 1, 2025).

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be "No" - the Scottish government has not announced a date for an independence referendum.

(c) A scenario resulting in a No outcome: The legal impasse continues, with the UK government maintaining its position that a Section 30 order is required and refusing to grant one. The Scottish government continues exploring legal avenues but fails to make any definitive announcement before the April 1 deadline due to lack of constitutional clarity and political hesitation.

(d) A scenario resulting in a Yes outcome: The Scottish government decides to proceed unilaterally and announces a referendum date despite UK objections, arguing that Scotland has the democratic right to determine its future. This could happen if political pressure intensifies or a new strategy emerges in February-March 2025.

Based on the available information, I need to assess the probability that the Scottish government will officially announce a date for an independence referendum before April 1, 2025.

Looking at the historical context and current situation, several key factors influence this forecast:

First, there is a clear legal obstacle as established by the UK Supreme Court in November 2022, which ruled that Scotland does not have the power to hold a new referendum on independence without the consent of the British government[2]. This ruling directly blocks the Scottish Parliament from legislating for such a referendum.

Second, the UK government has consistently refused to approve another vote, stating that the question was settled in the 2014 referendum when Scottish voters rejected independence by 55% to 45%[2]. This continued resistance makes the granting of a Section 30 order (which would temporarily devolve the power to hold a referendum) highly unlikely within the next two months.

Third, following the Supreme Court decision, former First Minister Nicola Sturgeon declared her intention to fight the next UK general election as a "de facto referendum" on Scottish independence[1][3]. This suggests the SNP had already pivoted to an alternative strategy rather than announcing another formal referendum date.

Fourth, with only two months remaining until the deadline, there have been no significant developments reported that would indicate an imminent announcement. Political decisions of this magnitude typically involve extensive preparation and public messaging, which we would expect to see signs of by now.

The status quo strongly favors a "No" outcome. While the Scottish government remains committed to pursuing independence, the legal and political barriers are substantial. The Supreme Court ruling has effectively closed the door on a unilateral referendum, and there's no indication that the UK government has changed its position on granting the necessary powers.

For a "Yes" outcome to occur, we would need to see the Scottish government make a dramatic and potentially legally contentious move within the next two months. While possible, this would represent a significant departure from their current approach following the Supreme Court ruling.

As a forecaster, I must place substantial weight on the status quo, especially given the short timeframe remaining and the absence of signals pointing to an imminent change. The legal constraints, continued UK government opposition, and the Scottish government's pivot to alternative strategies all suggest that an official announcement of a referendum date before April 1, 2025 is highly unlikely.
