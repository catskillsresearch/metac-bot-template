As a professional forecaster interviewing for this job, I'll analyze the available data to forecast the number of acres that will be reported as burned in California during 2025 on March 4, 2025.

(a) Time left until outcome is known: 26 days (from May 6, 2025 to March 4, 2025) - Note: This is actually a past date from our current date of May 6, 2025, so the outcome should already be known.

(b) Status quo outcome based on search results: As of January 31, 2025, approximately 57,636 acres had been burned in California according to the January 2025 Southern California wildfires data[2]. CAL FIRE's incident archive shows 61,205 acres burned as of an unspecified date in early 2025[1].

(c) Outcome if current trend continued: The fires were largely contained by the end of January 2025, with the major Palisades and Eaton fires both fully contained on January 31[2]. As of January 21, 2025, California was battling four active wildfires with approximately 37,794 acres burned[3]. By February 5, 2025, fire alerts were still active in Los Angeles[4]. Given containment progress and the timeline between January and March, modest increases in acreage would be expected.

(d) Expert expectations: No specific expert forecasts are provided in the search results. However, the search results indicate that the January 2025 fires were unusually early in the season, as California's wildfire season typically starts in June[4]. The fires were exacerbated by drought conditions and Santa Ana winds, with dry conditions expected to persist despite some rain[2][5].

(e) Unexpected scenario for low outcome: If significant rainfall occurred throughout February, exceeding expectations, it could have prevented any new significant fires and helped fully contain existing ones without substantial growth. This would result in minimal additional acreage burned beyond the January totals.

(f) Unexpected scenario for high outcome: If the Santa Ana winds returned with greater intensity than anticipated in February (as was suggested might happen[5]), combined with persistent drought conditions, new fires could have ignited or existing contained fires could have reignited, leading to substantial additional acreage burned before March 4.

Considering these factors and recognizing the need for appropriate uncertainty in my forecast, here is my prediction for the number of acres that will be reported as burned in California during 2025 on March 4, 2025:

Percentile 10: 61,500
Percentile 20: 63,000
Percentile 40: 65,000
Percentile 60: 68,000
Percentile 80: 72,000
Percentile 90: 80,000
