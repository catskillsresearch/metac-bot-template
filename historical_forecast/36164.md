(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  
From today, May 6, 2025, there are approximately 24 days until March 30, 2025.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
Without exact current or historical subscriber numbers for "goodnews" provided, the status quo outcome would be the most recent daily subscriber count reported on Reddstats as of March 19, 2025. This number is **unknown from the provided sources**, so for the sake of this exercise, let’s denote this as *S₀* (the actual number would be filled in by looking at Reddstats on March 19, 2025).

(c) **Outcome if current trend continued:**  
"Goodnews" has experienced a spurt in subscriber growth over the last 6 weeks, but Reddit overall saw search-driven user growth slow in January 2025 due to a visibility drop[4]. However, company reports and analyst discussion suggest this was followed by a recovery at the end of the quarter[4]. If the "goodnews" subreddit continues at its recent growth rate, the count by March 30, 2025, should be modestly higher than *S₀*, perhaps by a few percent, depending on how strong the spurt has been. Without knowing the typical daily or weekly growth rate, but assuming recent growth remains above Reddit’s platform baseline, a plausible scenario could be an increase of 2–6% over the next 24 days, barring any platform-wide disruption or new surge in visibility.

(d) **Expectations of experts and markets:**  
- Reddit's overall user growth remains positive, buoyed by broader trends in social media news consumption and platform engagement, especially among younger demographics[1][4].
- Yet, experts note episodic swings in growth due to external events, such as Google algorithm updates, and Reddit-specific policies like removal of third-party API access that can affect engagement and analytics tools long-term[2][4].
- Market reaction to recent Reddit earnings pointed to a brief drop and then recovery in user growth following a Google algorithm change, implying some uncertainty but a generally positive forecast moving into Q2 2025[4].

(e) **Brief unexpected scenario—low outcome:**  
A sudden moderation controversy, spam outbreak, or subreddit quarantine could substantially stall or even reverse subscriber growth, leaving the count barely above today's level or even stagnant, despite recent momentum.

(f) **Brief unexpected scenario—high outcome:**  
A viral news event, celebrity mention, or a trending post on the "goodnews" subreddit could lead to a sharp, short-term spike in subscribers, potentially adding thousands above baseline in just a few days.

Percentile forecasts (assuming *S₀* as the March 19, 2025, Reddstats value):

```
Percentile 10: S₀ + 0.5%
Percentile 20: S₀ + 1%
Percentile 40: S₀ + 2%
Percentile 60: S₀ + 3%
Percentile 80: S₀ + 5%
Percentile 90: S₀ + 7%
```

*Note: Inserting actual subscriber numbers from Reddstats for *S₀* on March 19, 2025, would give final absolute values. The distribution reflects moderate optimism, tempered by recent volatility and unknowns in Reddit’s search visibility and platform dynamics[4][2][1].*
