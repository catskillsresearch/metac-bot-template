(a) **Time until outcome:**  
The outcome will be known on March 31, 2025, which is about 7.5 weeks from the current date, May 6, 2025.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
As of the latest available information (early February 2025), Sam Altman's net worth on Forbes is $1.2 billion[3]. Unless there is a material positive change in the value of his investments or his stake in OpenAI, his net worth will remain below the $1.4 billion threshold required for a "Yes" resolution.

(c) **Scenario for a No outcome:**  
If OpenAI does not undergo a restructuring that grants Altman equity or if there is no substantial increase in the market value of his current major holdings (such as Reddit or other private company stakes), his net worth will likely remain at or around $1.2 billion, resulting in a "No" outcome[2][3].

(d) **Scenario for a Yes outcome:**  
If OpenAI finalizes a restructuring and Altman receives a significant equity stake, or if there is a sharp, documented increase in the valuation of one of his major investments that Forbes recognizes, his net worth could rise above $1.4 billion on the Forbes Real-Time Billionaires List[2]. This could also occur if there is a substantial and positive market move in a company where he has a large, public holding.

## Rationale

- **Status Quo Bias:** The majority of Altman's wealth is held in long-term investments, and his billionaire status is recent and grounded in already-public assets, notably Reddit and Stripe[2][3]. As of the most recent data, Forbes lists his net worth at $1.2 billion[3].
- **Potential Upside:** Any material change to his net worth before March 31, 2025, would likely need to come from either (a) OpenAI granting him a meaningful equity stake following a corporate restructuring, or (b) a dramatic increase in the value of companies he is known to hold large stakes in (such as Reddit or Stripe)[2].
- **Catalyst Likelihood:** Public reporting and Forbes' methodology suggest that such changes, especially restructuring at OpenAI, are both uncertain in timing and magnitude. As of February 2025, there has been no public confirmation that Altman has received substantial equity in OpenAI[2].
- **Forbes Adjustments:** Forbes updates private company valuations infrequently, and there is no indication of a pending revaluation or exceptional liquidity event in any of Altman's major holdings in the next two months.
- **Conclusion:** Absent clear news of a transformative event (such as OpenAI granting equity or a major asset IPO/sale), Altman's net worth is unlikely to rise by over $200 million in the short window before March 31, 2025. The baseline scenario—no major change—is by far the most probable, as rapid and large upward adjustments in billionaire net worth are rare without a public, market-moving event.
