(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  
Less than 2 months remain until the resolution deadline of April 1, 2025.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
As of February 8, 2025, ChatGPT cannot, on its native chat interface at chatgpt.com, directly order a Starbucks delivery for a user with no additional plugins or tools required. This is based on the absence of any public announcements or evidence of such a capability being live.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
No formal integration or partnership is launched between OpenAI and Starbucks (or its delivery partners, like DoorDash) during Q1 2025. ChatGPT remains unable to conduct fully automated, end-to-end Starbucks ordering through a single chat interaction on chatgpt.com—either because of technical, legal, or business barriers, or simply the lack of development and rollout within the timeframe.

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
OpenAI and Starbucks (potentially via DoorDash) announce and deploy an integration allowing ChatGPT to access Starbucks’ delivery APIs and process payments. This would let any North American user go to chatgpt.com, request Starbucks delivery, and receive it solely via conversational interaction—no plugins, extra tools, or manual work required from the user.

## Rationale

- **Starbucks digital readiness:** Starbucks continues to invest heavily in its digital and AI infrastructure, including its Deep Brew platform and delivery partnerships (notably with DoorDash, now nationwide)[2][4][5]. However, these integrations still require users to operate within Starbucks' or its partner's apps and do not publicly offer open APIs for third-party agents[4][5].

- **OpenAI's public trajectory:** OpenAI’s CEO has signaled progress toward AI agents joining the workforce in 2025, but provided no direct evidence of a Starbucks integration with ChatGPT as of early February[1]. There is no confirmed public launch or pilot enabling the required hands-off, autonomous ordering via chatgpt.com alone.

- **No evidence of partnership or integration:** There are no public news releases, blog posts, or product updates confirming such a functionality is live or imminent. Starbucks is focused on personalizing user experience and expanding delivery channels but nothing indicates an open, agent-initiated order API usable by ChatGPT in the required way[2][3][4][5].

- **Barriers and inertia:** Significant technical and legal hurdles remain for allowing a third-party AI assistant to handle payments, address validation, and menu navigation at this scale. Historically, such integrations take months to years from announcement to broad, reliable rollout. With no visible signs of testing or staged deployment, the likelihood of a surprise launch within the next eight weeks is low.

- **The world changes slowly:** Major consumer tech integrations, especially involving payment and delivery, rarely appear overnight. The status quo—no native ChatGPT-to-Starbucks ordering—will generally persist absent direct evidence of change, and there’s no such evidence as of February 2025.
