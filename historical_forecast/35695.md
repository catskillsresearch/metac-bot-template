(a) Time left: The question resolves on April 1, 2025, which is approximately 25 days from today (March 6, 2025).

(b) Status quo outcome: If nothing changes, the outcome will be "No" as Anthropic has not yet announced plans for an IPO on its news section nor filed an SEC Form S-1.

(c) Scenario resulting in a "No" outcome: Anthropic continues to rely on private funding rounds as it has successfully done so far, raising $3.5 billion in March 2025 at a valuation of $61.5 billion[2][5]. The company decides that the current market conditions or its strategic priorities don't favor an IPO in the immediate term.

(d) Scenario resulting in a "Yes" outcome: Given its recent massive valuation increase to $61.5 billion and completion of a Series E funding round[1][2], Anthropic decides to capitalize on its momentum and announces plans for an IPO on its news section within the next 25 days to access public markets for additional capital.

## Rationale

Looking at the available evidence, several factors suggest that a "No" outcome is more likely:

First, Anthropic just completed a massive Series E funding round of $3.5 billion in March 2025[1][2][5]. Companies typically don't immediately pursue an IPO right after securing substantial private funding. This recent funding round gives Anthropic significant runway without needing to tap public markets.

Second, the timing is extremely tight. With only 25 days remaining until the resolution date, Anthropic would need to move extraordinarily quickly to announce IPO plans, which typically involve months of preparation. There's no indication in the search results that such preparations are underway.

Third, as The Next Platform noted, "Series E is when people start to wonder. Series F is when they start to worry"[1]. This suggests that while an IPO might be on the horizon eventually, the company is still in the private funding phase of its growth cycle.

Fourth, no reports from financial news sources or IPO watchlists indicate that Anthropic is preparing for an imminent IPO[3]. If preparations were underway, there would likely be some indication in financial reporting.

However, there are some factors that could support a "Yes" outcome:

Anthropic's valuation has grown dramatically from $18.4 billion in May 2024 to $61.5 billion in March 2025[2]. This rapid growth might incentivize the company to capitalize on its momentum through an IPO.

The company reportedly had a revenue run rate of $1 billion exiting 2024 and is growing at about 30% in 2025[1]. This financial performance could make it an attractive IPO candidate.

Still, the weight of evidence strongly favors the status quo. The company has just secured massive private funding, there are no reports of IPO preparations, and the timeframe is extremely short. Following the principle that the status quo tends to persist, especially in the absence of contrary evidence, a "No" outcome appears substantially more likely.
