As a professional forecaster interviewing for this position, I'll approach the December 2024 Houston rainfall forecast systematically, analyzing the available data and providing a comprehensive assessment.

(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known:
There are 12 days remaining in December 2024 (from December 19 to December 31).

(b) The outcome if nothing changed:
If no additional rainfall occurs, Houston would finish December 2024 with 0.41 inches of precipitation.

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued:
If we extrapolate the current trend (0.41 inches over approximately 19 days), Houston would finish with about 0.67 inches of precipitation for the full month.

(d) The expectations of experts and markets:
Based on the search results, the Weather Prediction Center indicated that SE Texas would be below average for rainfall in December 2024[4]. The search results also show that several days of rain were expected in early December, with "rain chances through the weekend" as reported on December 3, 2024[5]. Specific rainfall amounts included 0.01 inches on December 5, 0.00 inches on December 7, and 0.19 inches on December 8[2].

(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome:
An unexpected strengthening of the La Ni√±a pattern in late December could block moisture from reaching the Houston area, resulting in completely dry conditions for the remainder of the month, leaving the total at or very near the current 0.41 inches.

(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome:
A sudden shift in weather patterns could bring a significant coastal low pressure system with tropical moisture from the Gulf, potentially delivering several days of heavy rainfall in the final week of December, pushing the monthly total closer to normal levels.

Looking at the data available, I note that Houston had recorded 0.41 inches of precipitation by mid-December, with 9 days of precipitation expected for the month according to one forecast[1]. The coastal low coupled with a warm front mentioned in the December 3 forecast suggested potential for heavier downpours and possibly thunderstorms[5].

Given the data constraints mentioned in the query (outcome between 0.0 and 1.0 inches), and considering the evidence of below-average rainfall expectations but also some rainfall events already observed and forecast, I'll provide my probabilistic forecast while accounting for uncertainty:

Percentile 10: 0.45
Percentile 20: 0.50
Percentile 40: 0.60
Percentile 60: 0.70
Percentile 80: 0.80
Percentile 90: 0.90
