(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
The BLS will release the preliminary November 2024 nonfarm payroll employment number on December 6, 2024. As of December 2, 2024, there are four days remaining until the official release[3].

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
The reported preliminary figure for November 2024 nonfarm payroll employment is an increase of 227,000 jobs[2]. This is above the 175,000 threshold required by the resolution criteria, meaning that, as things currently stand, the question would resolve as **Yes**.

(c) **Scenario that results in a No outcome:**  
A "No" outcome would occur if, upon the preliminary release of the November 2024 jobs report, the BLS reports a nonfarm payroll employment increase of less than 175,000. This could happen if late data corrections, reporting errors, or last-minute economic shocks were reflected in the initial release. However, such last-minute downward adjustments before the official publication are extremely rare, especially since the current preliminary figure has already been widely reported.

(d) **Scenario that results in a Yes outcome:**  
A "Yes" outcome will occur if the BLS, in its first (preliminary) report for November 2024, confirms a change in total nonfarm payroll employment of 175,000 or more. According to the most recent and authoritative sources, the current preliminary figure for November is an increase of 227,000[2].

**Rationale:**  
The status quo—based on the data currently available from official and reputable sources—indicates that the November 2024 nonfarm payroll employment increase is 227,000, which is well above the 175,000 threshold required for resolution as "Yes"[2]. Historically, while there can be last-minute adjustments before publication, these are rare and typically small. Most major changes to payroll data occur during subsequent revisions, which do not affect this question's resolution[4].

Given the weight of the status quo, the lack of intervening economic shocks or major new labor market policies, and the BLS's well-established reporting practices, the chance of a last-minute downward revision of over 52,000 jobs (enough to move the figure below 175,000) is extremely low. Thus, a "Yes" outcome is overwhelmingly likely.

**Probability: 99%**
