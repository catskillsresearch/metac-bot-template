(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
As today is May 6, 2025, and the Polymarket question resolves on April 1, 2025, the outcome has already been determined on the Polymarket platform. However, based on the date context of the research (as of March 11, 2025), there were about 3 weeks remaining until the question closed.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
If there is minimal further news or engagement—no unexpected publicity or controversy—the Polymarket volume would likely reflect a moderate level of interest typical for a high-profile yet uncertain celebrity crypto event, possibly clustering in the lower-to-mid range of past notable "celebrity crypto" markets.

(c) **Outcome if the current trend continued:**  
Kanye West has generated substantial media attention and community discussion, but the actual launch has been delayed and authenticity concerns persist. If this level of interest continues, the trading volume would likely reach the mid-to-upper tier of Polymarket celebrity prediction markets, propelled by ongoing speculation, rumors, and periodic news cycles[1][3][5].

(d) **Expectations of experts and markets:**  
- Experts observe that Kanye’s celebrity status, history of erratic public actions, and the explosive nature of memecoin markets add high upside volatility but also risk of rapid drop-off if the launch does not materialize or negative controversy intensifies.
- The market likely expects significant volume given the star power and news attention, but with a cap well below sensational mainstream events (such as presidential election questions).
- Most anticipate a volume in the hundreds of thousands to low millions USD based on historical precedent and the existing media profile, unless something extraordinary occurs.

(e) **Unexpected scenario leading to a low outcome:**  
- Kanye disavows or cancels the blockchain launch, causing the market to resolve early or dry up.  
- A credible scam or negative press (e.g., legal intervention, hacking, or major platform delisting) triggers a loss of interest, and volume remains minimal, close to the platform minimum (around $20,000 as seen in past low-volume markets).

(f) **Unexpected scenario leading to a high outcome:**  
- Kanye announces a concrete launch partnership with a major crypto exchange or demonstrates real technological progress, creating a mass speculative frenzy.
- Viral moments, such as celebrity endorsements or a viral social media event, drive a stampede of small retail bettors and whales, sending volume into the multimillion-dollar range, rivaling top Polymarket events.

This distribution reflects the high uncertainty typical for celebrity crypto markets, with a significant rightward tail for breakout interest but most probability mass in the low-to-mid six-figure range[1][3][5].
