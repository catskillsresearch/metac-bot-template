(a) **Time left until the outcome is known**  
There are just over two months remaining until October 1, 2024, which is the cutoff date for debates to count toward this question.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed**  
The status quo is: one debate occurred between Trump and Joe Biden on June 27, 2024. Biden has since dropped out and is no longer seeking reelection. There is no confirmation that Trump will debate the eventual Democratic nominee, and no additional debates are scheduled or confirmed as of July 26, 2024[1][2][3].

(c) **Scenario that results in a No outcome**  
If the Democratic Party does not formally select a new nominee in time, or if no additional formal, live debate between Trump and the new Democratic nominee is scheduled and held before October 1, 2024, then only the June 27 debate (with Biden) will have occurred. Since Biden is not the nominee, this debate may not count unless he is reaffirmed as the nominee. Even if it does count, unless a second debate happens, the total remains at one or zero—resulting in a “No” outcome[1][2][3].

(d) **Scenario that results in a Yes outcome**  
A “Yes” outcome would require that Trump and the official Democratic nominee (whoever is chosen to replace Biden) participate in at least two formal, live debates before October 1, 2024. This would need:
- The Democratic Party to select a new nominee quickly.
- Both campaigns to agree on formats and logistics for at least two live debates before the deadline.
- Trump’s agreement to participate, despite currently expressing reluctance and questioning the fairness of potential hosts[Deadline Hollywood, as referenced in the question].

## Rationale

The situation is highly uncertain and unprecedented. Biden’s withdrawal has thrown the scheduled debate plans into disarray, and Trump has been noncommittal about debating a new Democratic nominee, publicly suggesting changes to the venue and setting conditions that may slow or derail debate planning.

The Democratic Party has not yet named a new nominee, and even once they do, it will take time to organize a debate. Given the historic slow pace of organizing general election debates, and the fact that Trump and the Democrats would need to negotiate new terms, formats, and network agreements for at least two debates in just two months, it is improbable. The fact that only one debate (with Biden) has happened so far, and that there are zero confirmed debates with a new nominee, means the baseline (status quo) overwhelmingly favors a "No" outcome[1][2][3].

Debates are logistically complex and require significant lead time. The compressed timeframe, current lack of agreements, and political friction all decrease the likelihood of multiple debates.

## Probability Estimate

Probability: 5% 

The vast preponderance of evidence points to zero or one qualifying debate occurring between Trump and the Democratic nominee before October 1, 2024, given the current state of debate planning and partisan dynamics. The chance of two or more such debates is very low barring rapid, unexpected changes.
