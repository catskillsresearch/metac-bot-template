(a) Time left until the outcome is known: Approximately 2.5 months (from today, January 20, 2025, until April 1, 2025)

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: Based on recent trends, we would expect 0-1 bank failures in Q1 2025.

(c) Unexpected outcome scenario: A rapid deterioration in commercial real estate markets, particularly in the office sector, combined with a sudden spike in interest rates could trigger a cascade of failures among smaller regional banks heavily exposed to these sectors. This could push the number of bank failures well above historical norms.

As a professional forecaster analyzing the potential number of banks that will be listed on the FDIC's Failed Bank List in Q1 2025, I'll examine the current banking landscape and relevant trends.

The FDIC's Problem Bank List, which identifies institutions at risk of failure, increased from 52 banks in Q4 2023 to 63 banks in Q1 2024[5]. This list represents about 1.4% of total banks, which falls within the normal range for non-crisis periods[4]. These problem banks collectively hold $82.1 billion in assets[5].

Looking at actual bank failures, it's noteworthy that no banks failed during the first quarter of 2024[4]. The most recent bank failure recorded in the search results is The First National Bank of Lindsay, which was closed on October 18, 2024[2]. Additionally, Millennium Bank appears to have failed on January 17, 2025[1].

The FDIC considers the U.S. banking system to be generally stable, though it acknowledges ongoing pressures from inflation, volatile market rates, and geopolitical concerns[5]. These factors could potentially lead to credit quality, earnings, and liquidity challenges that require continued monitoring.

Examining historical patterns is instructive. Bank failures typically occur in waves during periods of significant economic stress. While we are seeing an increase in the number of problem banks, this doesn't necessarily translate directly to failures. The FDIC has effective resolution mechanisms in place, and many troubled institutions are able to recapitalize or merge rather than fail outright.

The banking sector does face some headwinds, including unrealized losses from residential mortgage-backed securities due to higher mortgage rates[5]. However, the FDIC's Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) balance was $125.3 billion as of March 31, 2024, indicating strong reserves to handle potential failures[4].

As a forecaster, I recognize that while the status quo suggests minimal failures, I must account for tail risks. Economic conditions could deteriorate unexpectedly, or issues in specific sectors like commercial real estate could cascade through regional banking networks.
