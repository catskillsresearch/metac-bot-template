(a) **Time left until outcome:**  
There is roughly 1 day left until the presidential debate between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump on September 10, 2024. The outcome—whether Harris says "I'm speaking" or "I am speaking" during the debate—will be determined by the end of the event, no later than September 11, 2024[4][5].

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
The most likely outcome, based on the current rules and anticipated debate format, is that Kamala Harris will **not** say "I'm speaking" or "I am speaking" during the debate.

(c) **Scenario for a No outcome:**  
The debate proceeds as planned with strict enforcement of the rules: each candidate’s microphone is only active during their designated time to speak, preventing interruptions. Without being actively interrupted by Donald Trump (or anyone else), Harris has no situational prompt to say "I'm speaking," and the debate progresses without her using the phrase[3][5].

(d) **Scenario for a Yes outcome:**  
Despite the microphone rules, a moment arises where Trump attempts to interject visibly (for example, through body language, nonverbal reactions, or speaking while muted), or Harris makes a rhetorical point referencing her 2020 debate persona. In that moment, Harris utters "I'm speaking" or "I am speaking"—either in direct response to Trump, to the moderators, or as a deliberate callback to her previous viral moment.

## Rationale

Kamala Harris has a well-documented history of using "I'm speaking" in debates when interrupted, most famously in 2020 against Mike Pence. This phrase has since become closely associated with her assertive debating style and public image[1][4].

However, the September 10, 2024, debate will feature a new, stricter format: candidates' microphones will be muted when it is not their turn to speak, a rule designed explicitly to prevent interruptions and cross-talk that previously prompted Harris to use the phrase[3][5]. ABC News has confirmed both candidates accepted these guidelines, and barring a breakdown in enforcement, interruptions should be minimized or eliminated[3][5]. 

Without interruptions, there is little natural context for Harris to deploy "I'm speaking" in the manner she did in 2020. Though she could theoretically use the phrase proactively—for instance, as a rhetorical flourish or callback to her prior debates—such unprompted usage would be less organic and arguably off-message given the focus on policy and undecided voters[5]. The most likely scenario, given the status quo and historical precedent of heavily controlled debate formats, is that Harris does **not** use the phrase.

Forecasters recognize that the world is generally stable and historical trends—especially the intent behind new debate rules—often persist. The status quo scenario (no utterance of the phrase unless interrupted) carries the most weight.
