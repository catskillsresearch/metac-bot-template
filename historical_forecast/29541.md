(a) Time left until outcome: The outcome will be known by January 5, 2025, which is approximately 2 months from today (November 4, 2024).

(b) Status quo outcome: If nothing changed from the current trends, the outcome would be "No" since XEC is currently at around 10.7% (Nowcast estimate) as of October 12, 2024, well below the 50% threshold required.

(c) Scenario for a "No" outcome: XEC continues to grow but at a slowing rate, reaching 30-40% prevalence by early January. KP.3.1.1 maintains partial dominance or another variant emerges to compete with XEC, preventing it from crossing the 50% threshold before January 5, 2025.

(d) Scenario for a "Yes" outcome: XEC maintains or accelerates its current growth advantage, rapidly displacing KP.3.1.1 as the dominant variant. Given its sharp increase from 2.3% to 10.7% in one reporting period, it continues this exponential growth pattern and exceeds 50% in weighted estimates by late December 2024.

## Rationale

The XEC variant is currently showing signs of rapid growth in the United States, increasing from 2.3% to 10.7% in a single reporting period according to CDC Nowcast estimates[5]. While this growth is significant, reaching the 50% threshold by January 5, 2025 (about 2 months from now) would require continued exponential growth.

Looking at historical precedent, we can see that variant displacement can occur relatively quickly. During 2023-2024, we observed multiple variants reaching >10% prevalence within short timeframes, including EG.5-like lineages, FL.1.5.1-like lineages, HV.1 lineage, and HK.3-like lineages[1]. More significantly, the JN.1 variant "rapidly attained predominance nationwide" in winter 2023, representing a substantial genetic shift from previous dominant variants[1].

The current situation with XEC shows similar patterns of rapid growth. XEC has been detected in multiple countries, with the highest prevalence in Germany (around 13%), followed by the UK (around 7%) and the US (below 5% at the time of that report)[2]. More recent data indicates it has already grown to 10.7% in the US according to Nowcast estimates[5].

XEC appears to have a growth advantage over other circulating variants, which suggests it will likely continue to increase in prevalence. This advantage may be due to mutations in the spike protein, particularly the T22N mutation combined with Q493E[2], which could enhance transmissibility or immune escape.

However, there are several factors that create uncertainty:

1. The weighted estimate (which is what will be used for resolution) typically lags behind the Nowcast estimate, meaning the true current prevalence may be lower than 10.7%.

2. Growth rates of variants often follow S-curves rather than maintaining exponential patterns throughout their rise.

3. The current dominant variant, KP.3.1.1, still represents 57.2% (Nowcast) or 41.2% (weighted estimate) of cases[5], and while its growth is slowing, displacing it completely would take time.

4. The holiday season in November-December could affect transmission patterns in unpredictable ways.

5. New variants could potentially emerge and compete with XEC.

Given the information available, XEC has a plausible path to dominance, but reaching 50% in the weighted estimate by January 5, 2025, requires rapid displacement of KP.3.1.1 in a relatively short timeframe. While we've seen such rapid shifts before (as with JN.1), the status quo suggests XEC still has significant ground to cover in a limited timeframe.
