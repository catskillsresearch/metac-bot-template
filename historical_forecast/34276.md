(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  
The question will be resolved as of March 31, 2025. Given today is January 30, 2025, there are approximately 2 months (about 60 days) remaining until the resolution date.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
As of the current date, there have already been delays and accusations surrounding the implementation of the ceasefire. On January 19, 2025, Israel publicly accused Hamas of failing to comply with the agreement, specifically regarding the list of hostages to be released, which delayed the ceasefire's start[2]. Hamas acknowledged the delay but attributed it to technical reasons and maintained its commitment to the agreement[2]. These events indicate that mutual blame has already surfaced, even within the first week of the ceasefire.

(c) **Scenario for a No outcome:**  
A No outcome would occur if, between now and March 31, 2025, neither Israel nor Hamas publicly accuses the other of violating the January 15, 2025 ceasefire agreement. For this to happen, both sides would need to:
- Strictly adhere to all the terms of the agreement in all its phases.
- Avoid public statements of accusation, even in the case of any border incidents, misunderstandings, or civilian harm.
- Rely on behind-the-scenes diplomatic channels or third-party mediators to resolve disputes quietly and refrain from going public with any claims of violations.

Given the current tensions and historical precedent, such a scenario is highly unlikely, but it is theoretically possible.

(d) **Scenario for a Yes outcome:**  
A Yes outcome would result if, before March 31, 2025, either Israel or Hamas issues a public accusation that the other party violated the January 15, 2025 ceasefire agreement. This could happen through:
- Official government or spokesperson statements.
- Press releases or interviews by leaders or military officials.
- Reports in major media outlets quoting direct accusations from either side.

Given the immediate post-ceasefire accusations by Israel against Hamas regarding compliance, the pattern of public blame is already established[2]. Furthermore, the ceasefire is described as "shaky at best" and "guaranteed to fail" by analysts, highlighting the likelihood of future disputes and public accusations as tensions persist[4][5].

**Rationale:**  
Historically, Israel-Hamas ceasefires have been fragile, with both sides routinely accusing each other of violations even during the most stable periods. The current agreement has already seen public accusations and delays within its first week, and the language from all sides indicates very low trust and high volatility[2][4][5]. The structure of the agreement (multi-phased, with ambiguous terms) and the fraught context mean that misunderstandings, disputes, and—importantly—accusations are extremely likely. Analysts and observers consistently rate the ceasefire's chances of holding as low, suggesting the status quo is one of continued friction.

Given this context, the status quo heavily favors a Yes outcome, and, if anything, the probability could rise further as more phases of the ceasefire are implemented and additional stresses emerge[3][4][5].
