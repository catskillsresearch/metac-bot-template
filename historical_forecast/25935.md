(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known: 83 days (from July 9, 2024 to September 30, 2024)

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed: No publication or official description of Q* by OpenAI before the deadline.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome: OpenAI continues to maintain secrecy around Q* due to ongoing legal concerns, competitive advantages, or safety considerations. The company focuses instead on releasing updates to existing models and products while keeping frontier research like Q* under wraps until after the September deadline.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome: In response to competitive pressures from other AI labs or to demonstrate technological leadership, OpenAI decides to publish a blog post describing the basic concept of Q* and officially acknowledges its existence. This could happen alongside a major company announcement or as part of a strategic pivot to more research transparency.

As a professional forecaster, I need to assess the probability that OpenAI will publish information describing Q* by September 30, 2024, based on historical patterns, current evidence, and reasonable projections.

## Current State of Information

Based on available evidence, Q* appears to be an internal OpenAI project focused on mathematical reasoning capabilities that might represent a significant step toward artificial general intelligence (AGI)[1][4]. While its existence has been indirectly acknowledged by OpenAI in internal communications, no public technical details or official descriptions have been released as of July 9, 2024[1][2].

The project gained attention following Sam Altman's temporary removal as CEO in November 2023, with reports suggesting that concerns about Q*'s capabilities may have played a role in that decision[1][4]. According to reports, Q* can "solve math problems that it hadn't seen before," which represents an important technical milestone[4].

## Historical Patterns and Organizational Behavior

OpenAI has demonstrated a pattern of increased caution regarding frontier AI research, especially following the internal turmoil of late 2023. This suggests a reluctance to publicly disclose potentially sensitive advancements like Q*. The formation of a "superalignment" team led by Ilya Sutskever further indicates OpenAI's concerns about the safety implications of advanced AI systems[4].

Additionally, there are reports of delays in any planned Q* release, potentially due to legal disputes or internal caution about the technology's implications[2]. This aligns with a more conservative approach to releasing information about sensitive research.

## External Factors and Timing Considerations

With 83 days remaining until the deadline, there is limited time for OpenAI to prepare and publish a description of Q*. The company would need to navigate internal approval processes, potential safety reviews, and strategic considerations before making such a publication.

Recent industry trends show increasing competition among AI labs, which could potentially incentivize OpenAI to demonstrate technological leadership by revealing more about Q*. However, the status quo of secrecy around this project has persisted for over 8 months since the initial reports, suggesting a strong organizational preference for keeping this research private.

## Weighing Status Quo vs. Change

As a forecaster, I must give significant weight to the status quo, which strongly favors a "No" outcome. OpenAI has had ample opportunity to publish information about Q* since November 2023 but has chosen not to do so. There are several compelling reasons why this status quo might persist:

1. Safety concerns about publicly describing advanced AI capabilities
2. Competitive advantages of keeping frontier research private
3. Ongoing legal and regulatory considerations
4. Internal uncertainty about how to present Q* to the public

For a "Yes" outcome to occur, OpenAI would need to significantly change its current approach to Q*, which represents a substantial deviation from established patterns. While not impossible, such a shift would require compelling new incentives that currently aren't evident in the available information.

## Conclusion

Given the persistent secrecy around Q*, the apparent organizational caution regarding frontier AI research, and the absence of clear signals indicating an imminent publication, I assess that the probability of OpenAI publishing information describing Q* by September 30, 2024, is relatively low. The status quo strongly favors continued non-disclosure, and the burden of evidence falls heavily on demonstrating why OpenAI would change its established approach within the next 83 days.

Probability: 15%
