(a) Time until outcome known: Approximately 1 month and 26 days (from today, May 6, 2025, until data from Similarweb's March 2025 update becomes available, which would be accessed by Metaculus on or after March 1, 2025).

(b) Status quo outcome: Based on the provided search results, there is no direct information about the current ranking positions of chatgpt.com versus reddit.com on Similarweb. Without this baseline information, I cannot definitively state the status quo.

(c) No outcome scenario: Reddit maintains its historically strong user base and engagement metrics, benefiting from its diverse communities and content. ChatGPT experiences a plateau or decline in traffic as the novelty of AI chat tools wears off or as competitors gain market share. Reddit's established position in the social media landscape helps it maintain a higher ranking than ChatGPT.

(d) Yes outcome scenario: ChatGPT continues to experience explosive growth as AI adoption accelerates across industries and everyday use cases. New features and integrations drive increased user engagement. Meanwhile, Reddit faces challenges from competing platforms or experiences moderation/community issues that impact its traffic. This combination allows ChatGPT to surpass Reddit in the rankings.

The search results provide limited information about the current positioning of these two websites in Similarweb's rankings. While we know that Google holds the #1 position globally and in the US for March 2025[1][2], and that YouTube and Facebook hold the 2nd and 3rd positions in the US[1], there's no specific mention of either chatgpt.com or reddit.com.

The question references a previous article indicating that ChatGPT hit a new high, ranking sixth in the world, but we don't have information on when this occurred or what Reddit's position was at that time. Without knowing the current positions and recent trajectory of both websites, it's difficult to establish a strong baseline for this forecast.

Similarweb's 2025 Digital 100 Ranking released in January 2025 highlights fast-growing websites and apps, but neither ChatGPT nor Reddit are specifically mentioned among the standout performers[4]. This suggests that while they may be highly ranked overall, they weren't among the fastest-growing digital properties in this particular timeframe.

As a forecaster, I must acknowledge the limited data available for this specific prediction. The status quo typically has strong inertia, and without clear evidence of ChatGPT overtaking Reddit or a strong trend in that direction, I would need to assign a lower probability to this outcome.

One relevant factor is the continued growth and interest in AI technologies, which could benefit ChatGPT. However, Reddit's established position as a major social platform with diverse communities gives it substantial staying power in website rankings.

Probability: 30%
