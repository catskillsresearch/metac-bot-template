(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
As of today, May 6, 2025, the outcome is already known since Metaculus’s assessment window (on or after January 1, 2025) has passed. The cutoff for the leaderboard in question was the end of Q4 2024, i.e., December 31, 2024.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
As of September 30, 2024, the highest-ranked Llama model ("Meta-Llama-3.1-405b-Instruct-bf16") was tied for seventh on the LMSYS Chatbot Arena Leaderboard. If the relative positions remained the same through the end of Q4 2024—with no significant improvements or new releases from Meta—a Llama model would not be ranked #1 overall[4].

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
If Meta did not release a major new Llama model or fail to significantly improve the ranking of its current top model, and the leading models from OpenAI (GPT-4 series), Anthropic (Claude series), and Google (Gemini series) maintained their rankings or improved further, a Llama model would not reach the #1 spot by the end of Q4 2024[3][4]. This scenario is highly plausible given past leaderboard trends and the competitive landscape.

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
A “Yes” outcome would require Meta to either release a substantially improved Llama model or for the Llama-3.1-405b-Instruct-bf16 to somehow outperform all other contenders in new Elo battles through the end of 2024. This could happen if Meta’s model received a significant upgrade or if competitor models suffered setbacks (such as bugs, negative user perception, or technical downgrades) that led to a drop in their rankings. However, there is no evidence in the search results of such an event or major Llama model announcement slated for late 2024[4][3][1].

## Rationale

- **Weight of status quo:** The best available data shows Llama’s top model significantly trailing the leaders on the LMSYS Chatbot Arena as of late Q3 2024, and there is no indication of a new Llama release before the Q4 deadline[4].
- **Leader persistence:** Historically, top leaderboard positions (OpenAI GPT-4, Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini) have been relatively stable and have not been overtaken by Llama models since the arena’s inception[3][5].
- **Competitive dynamics:** The dominant models are backed by some of the most well-resourced AI organizations and continuously receive updates, making it less likely for Meta’s Llama to leapfrog to #1 without a major, announced, and successful new version.
- **Lack of evidence for Llama surge:** The search results contain no reporting on a newly-announced or game-changing Llama model released in Q4 2024, or on any market disruption that would allow Llama to claim the top spot[3][4][5][1].
- **Elo system inertia:** Given the Elo rating dynamics and the number of votes required to shift rankings significantly, it is rare for models outside the top three to vault to #1 in a matter of weeks without a transformative update[5][1].

## Final Forecast

Given the status quo, historical leaderboard stability, and absence of any evidence of a major Meta Llama release or leap in performance through the end of 2024, the probability that a Llama model was ranked #1 (tied or alone) on the LMSYS Chatbot Arena Leaderboard at the end of Q4 2024 is:

Probability: 5%
