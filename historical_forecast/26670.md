(a) Time left until outcome: 88 days (from May 6, 2025 to August 31, 2024 - which is actually in the past relative to the current date)

(b) Status quo outcome: As of the most recent information available from the search results, Gabriel Attal had resigned as Prime Minister of France on July 16, 2024, but he and his cabinet were to remain in place during the Paris Olympics while a new head of government was being nominated. The status quo would be a caretaker government with no permanent Prime Minister yet appointed.

(c) No outcome scenario: President Macron could appoint a Prime Minister from his own centrist coalition despite lacking a majority, or choose someone from LFI (the furthest-left member of the New Popular Front), or select someone from outside the New Popular Front entirely.

(d) Yes outcome scenario: Macron appoints a Prime Minister from one of the more moderate parties within the New Popular Front coalition (such as the Socialists or Greens, but not LFI) who can build consensus across the fragmented National Assembly.

This question presents a unique forecasting challenge because we're technically looking backward from our current date (May 2025) to predict an event that would have happened in August 2024. Based on the search results, I need to analyze what was likely to happen following Gabriel Attal's resignation in July 2024.

The search results indicate that as of July 16, 2024, Prime Minister Gabriel Attal had officially resigned following legislative elections, but he and his cabinet were to remain in place during the Paris Olympics (which would have ended on August 11, 2024)[5]. This means there would be approximately 20 days between the end of the Olympics and our target date of August 31, 2024, for a new Prime Minister to be appointed.

The search results show that following the snap elections of June 30 and July 7, 2024, France ended up with a divided parliament where the left-wing New Popular Front (NFP) alliance had the largest bloc with 182 seats, but still far short of the 289 needed for a majority. Macron's centrist coalition had 168 seats, and the far-right National Rally had 143 seats.

While the NFP had the most seats, there are several factors that complicate the likelihood of a non-LFI member of the NFP becoming Prime Minister:

1. The French Constitution gives the President sole authority to appoint the Prime Minister, with no legal obligation to choose someone from the largest parliamentary group[1].

2. Any Prime Minister would need to maintain the confidence of the Assembly to avoid being quickly removed through a no-confidence vote.

3. There was no constitutional deadline for forming a new government, allowing for potentially prolonged negotiations[1].

4. The search results don't provide specific information about the internal composition of the NFP or the strength of LFI within it, making it difficult to assess whether a non-LFI member would be the coalition's candidate.

Given Macron's historically centrist position, he would likely prefer a more moderate figure from the NFP rather than someone from LFI, which has typically taken more radical positions. This preference aligns with the "Yes" outcome.

However, considering the status quo bias and the significant political fragmentation, there's a substantial possibility that Macron might have attempted to maintain control by appointing someone from his own coalition, or that negotiations could have extended beyond August 31 with Attal's caretaker government continuing in place.

Without more recent information about how these political dynamics resolved after July 16, 2024, there remains considerable uncertainty. However, the combination of the NFP having the largest bloc and Macron's likely preference for a moderate from that coalition if forced to choose from it, slightly favors the "Yes" outcome over alternatives.

Probability: 45%
