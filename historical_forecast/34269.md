(a) **Time left until outcome known:**  
Approximately two months remain until Forbes publishes (or updates) Donald Trump's net worth figure as of March 31, 2025. Today is May 6, 2025, so this forecast window is now retrospective, but the question asks about the figure that will be published with that specific date.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
As of the latest credible sources from January 2025, Forbes estimated Trump's net worth at $6.7 billion[1], with other outlets referencing figures between $5.7 and $6.7 billion depending on market fluctuations[3].  
The vast majority of his net worth is tied to his majority stake in Trump Media & Technology Group (Truth Social), which experienced major gains upon going public in March 2024 and periods of market volatility but no documented crashes or windfalls since January 2025[1][3].  
If nothing changed, Forbes’ estimate on March 31, 2025, would most likely remain in the narrow range just above $6 billion and below $8 billion.

(c) **Scenario for an unexpected outcome:**  
An unexpected outcome could arise from dramatic market moves or legal/regulatory events. For example,

- **Major rally in Trump Media & Technology Group stock** (e.g., due to political events, meme frenzy, or surprising business results) could push his Forbes-estimated net worth above $8 billion, possibly toward $10 billion, but there is no evidence for such a rally in early 2025[1][3].
- **Market crash or negative legal development** (e.g., severe penalties, asset seizures, market collapse of Trump Media) could drive his net worth sharply below $6 billion. However, such events are not reported as of late January 2025[1][3].
- **Change in asset valuation methodology** at Forbes, or new revelations about under- or overvalued assets, could alter the estimate, though this would be atypical and is unsupported by current reporting.

## Rationale

Recent Forbes estimates and corroborating media put Trump's net worth at $6.7 billion as of January 2025[1], with the trend driven by the value of his stake in the publicly traded Trump Media & Technology Group and stabilized by late January[3]. His real estate and golf assets provide a stable base, while the swing factor is the media company and any crypto holdings associated with his brand[1][3].

No new developments, market shocks, or legal events have been reported that would significantly push his net worth outside the $6–$8 billion range by March 31, 2025[1][3]. While meme stocks and individual equities can be volatile, the lack of major news through January 2025 makes sharp departures less likely in the short 2-month window ahead.

Forbes’ methodology relies on public and best-estimate private valuations, so absent new information or market action, the published estimate is expected to remain near the January value.

Good forecasting practice demands a moderate probability on outlier outcomes, accounting for the possibility of unforeseen market or legal events, as neither a total collapse nor an explosive windfall is entirely impossible for a high-profile, market-sensitive billionaire.

## Final Probabilities

Based on all available information and status quo bias, the probabilities for each Forbes net worth range as of March 31, 2025, are:

'0-$6 billion, inclusive': 8%  
'>$6 billion and <$8 billion': 85%  
'≥$8 billion and ≤$10 billion': 5%  
'>$10 billion and <$20 billion': 1.5%  
'≥$20 billion': 0.5%
