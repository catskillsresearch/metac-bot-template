(a) **The time left until the outcome to the question is known.**  
The outcome is already known. The winner of the 2025 (36th) GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding New Series was announced at the ceremony on March 27, 2025[2].

(b) **The status quo outcome if nothing changed.**  
The status quo is that a Netflix show (among Black Doves, Kaos, and No Good Deed) did not win the 2025 GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding New Series. The award went to "Agatha All Along" on Disney+[2].

(c) **A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.**  
All eligible Netflix contenders (Black Doves, Kaos, and No Good Deed) are nominated but do not win; instead, a show from another platform, notably Disney+'s "Agatha All Along," is chosen as the winner for Outstanding New Series[2].

(d) **A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.**  
One of the Netflix nominees (Black Doves, Kaos, or No Good Deed) is selected and officially announced as the winner at the 36th GLAAD Media Awards[1][2]. However, this did not occur.

## Rationale

Official results have been published: "Agatha All Along" (Disney+) won Outstanding New Series at the 36th GLAAD Media Awards, despite three Netflix series being nominated in the category[2]. The results are definitive and confirmed by authoritative sources, and there are no reported controversies, recounts, or reversals that could alter the outcome[1][2][3]. The resolution is final and public.

## Final Answer

Probability: 0%
