(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
There are approximately 16 days remaining until August 3, 2024, the cutoff by which the US Department of Commerce (DOC) would need to take official action to end or sunset its Cooperative Agreement with Verisign for this question to resolve "Yes."

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
If no action is taken by the DOC before August 2, 2024, the Cooperative Agreement will automatically renew for another six-year term. In this scenario, Verisign will continue operating as the authoritative registry for the .com TLD[1][5].

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
The DOC does not issue a notice of non-renewal or otherwise terminate the agreement before the deadline. The agreement renews by default, and Verisign continues to manage the .com registry under the existing arrangements[1][5].

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
The DOC provides written notice to Verisign by August 2, 2024, either terminating or sunsetting the Cooperative Agreement. This would end Verisign’s government-backed role in managing the .com TLD, although this would likely be announced publicly and would constitute a major industry event[1][5].

## Rationale

As of July 18, 2024, there is no evidence or indication of the DOC taking steps to terminate or sunset its Cooperative Agreement with Verisign. No official notice of non-renewal has been made public, and recent SEC filings and industry sources suggest that Verisign and the broader domain industry expect the agreement to renew automatically. Although there has been advocacy and public pressure urging the Biden administration to act, there is no sign that such efforts have resulted in government movement toward ending the agreement[1][3][5].

The status quo—a passive automatic renewal—is therefore heavily favored. Historically, U.S. government contract relationships of this nature are rarely disrupted without significant advanced notice, regulatory debate, and industry preparation. While it is technically possible for the DOC to issue a last-minute notice, the absence of concrete signals, leaks, or preparatory steps makes this outcome unlikely.

Probability: **3%**

- There is a slim chance the DOC could issue a sudden, unprecedented notice, but all observable evidence currently supports the automatic renewal scenario[1][5].
