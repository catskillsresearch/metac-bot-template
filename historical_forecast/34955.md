(a) **Time Remaining Until Outcome is Known**

- The resolution deadline is March 15, 2025.
- Today is May 6, 2025, so the deadline has already passed.

(b) **Status Quo Outcome If Nothing Changed**

- As of February 11, 2025, and all available data through that period, Reform UK had not been the highest polling party in the UK by at least 2 points in Politico’s poll of polls. Reform UK had led in some individual polls by 1 point, but the aggregated polling averages (such as Politico’s) did not show a 2-point lead over the second place party[3][5].

(c) **Scenario That Results in a No Outcome**

- Reform UK never achieves a 2-point or greater lead over Labour (or any other party) in the Politico polling average at any time before March 15, 2025. This has been the situation as of February 11, 2025, and would remain the case if no sudden surge or polling swing occurred.

(d) **Scenario That Results in a Yes Outcome**

- Reform UK would need to surge in popularity across multiple polls, with the aggregated average on Politico showing them at least 2 percentage points ahead of the second-highest party at any time before March 15, 2025. Such a development would likely require either a dramatic shift in public sentiment, a major event affecting the major parties, or a succession of polls showing Reform UK with a substantial lead.

## Rationale

Reform UK’s recent polling shows it has closed the gap with Labour and even led by 1 point in some polls in early February 2025[3]. However, this lead is within the margin of error and not reflected as a 2-point advantage in polling averages like Politico’s. Polling averages are less volatile than individual polls, requiring consistent and sizable leads across different pollsters to register a 2-point gap[2][3]. As of the last available data before the March 15, 2025 deadline, no such 2-point lead has appeared in Politico’s aggregation.

For Reform UK to have reached the required 2-point lead before the deadline, there would need to have been an exceptionally rapid and broad-based shift in voter sentiment, resulting in a string of strong polls in their favor. No such trend or significant event was documented in the relevant period, and all available publicly aggregated data up to mid-February 2025 showed no such lead[3][5].

The status quo—slow-moving polling averages and no dramatic realignment in voter intentions—suggests the most likely outcome is No.
