(a) Time left until outcome is known: Approximately 1 month (from February 27, 2025 until sometime after April 1, 2025 when Metaculus accesses the FAA page)

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: Based on the current trajectory of 181 incidents as of February 16, 2025, and assuming a consistent rate of incidents through the remainder of Q1, we would expect to see approximately 300-350 total incidents by the end of March.

(c) Scenario for unexpected outcome: A sudden spike in unruly passenger incidents could occur if there's a major weather event causing widespread flight disruptions and passenger frustration, or if there's a significant policy change in airline operations that triggers passenger resistance. Alternatively, a coordinated national enforcement campaign could significantly reduce incidents in March.

As I analyze the unruly passenger incident data for Q1 2025, I need to carefully consider both historical patterns and recent trends. The FAA reported 181 incidents as of February 16, 2025[1][2], which gives us approximately 45-46 days of data for the quarter.

Looking at historical data, 2023 saw 2,075 total incidents for the year, with approximately 649 by April 28, suggesting roughly 200-250 incidents occurred in Q1 2023[2]. The 2024 data shows 1,240 cases reported by August, indicating the problem continues but at a lower rate than the 2021 peak[1].

To project the final Q1 2025 number, I need to estimate the daily rate of incidents. With 181 incidents in approximately 47 days (January 1 to February 16), that's about 3.85 incidents per day. Projecting this rate through March 31 (90 days total), we would expect approximately 346 incidents (3.85 Ã— 90).

However, I should be cautious about a simple linear extrapolation. Several factors could influence this projection:

1. The FAA and TSA have maintained zero-tolerance policies with substantial penalties including fines up to $37,000 per violation and potential criminal referrals[1][2], which could suppress incident rates.

2. In January 2024, penalties were increased to $42,658 for assaulting or threatening crew[2], which might further deter unruly behavior.

3. Seasonal travel patterns and holiday periods can affect incident rates, though Q1 typically has fewer holidays than Q4.

4. The data shows a general downward trend since 2021, but with continued significant activity[1][3].

While the status quo projection points to around 346 incidents, I must account for the uncertainty. There's a reasonable chance the rate could slow in March due to enforcement effects or accelerate due to increased spring break travel. Additionally, reporting lags could affect the final number.

Given all these considerations, I allocate probabilities as follows:

Option_A: 300 or fewer - 25%
Option_B: 301 to 350 - 45%
Option_C: 351 to 400 - 20%
Option_D: 400 or more - 10%
