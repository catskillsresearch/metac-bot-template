(a) **Time left until outcome is known**:  
Approximately 2.5 months remain until September 30, 2024. The question will be resolved on October 1, 2024, based on CDC (or USDA) data as of September 30.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed**:  
The current trajectory, as of mid-June to July 2024, shows more than 100 confirmed affected dairy herds—growing from 46 on May 15, 2024, to over 80 by June 4, and likely exceeding 100 by mid-June due to Michigan’s surge and ongoing reports[1][2][5]. If this rate of increase persists, the number of affected herds will surpass 200 but may not quite reach 300 by September 30, 2024.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome** (fewer than 200 or at least 300):  
- A sharp acceleration in cases, caused by a breakdown in biosecurity, regulatory inaction, or new, highly efficient transmission routes, could push the total over 300 before the cutoff.
- Conversely, if enhanced biosecurity, vaccination, or restricted animal/farm movement policies are rapidly implemented and effective, the outbreak could slow dramatically, resulting in the total number of confirmed affected herds staying below 200.

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome** (between 200 and 300 herds):  
- The current rate of increase continues, with an average of 30-40 new herds affected per month, and no major interventions or dramatic changes in transmission.
- Incremental improvements in containment slow but do not halt the spread; the outbreak grows at roughly the same (slowing or steady) pace as seen from April to June.
- Confirmation/reporting lags remain similar, adhering to CDC/USDA methodologies.

## Rationale

The best forecast weighs the base rate and status quo heavily. The outbreak escalated swiftly: 16 herds in early April, 46 by mid-May, at least 80 by June 4, and likely over 100 by mid-June[1][2][5]. The monthly increase was ~30 herds from April to June. If this continues, the count by September 30 would likely be in the 200–300 range:

- June 15: ~100 herds
- July 15: ~130 herds
- August 15: ~160 herds
- September 15: ~190 herds
- September 30: ~210–220 herds (conservatively), possibly higher if the trend accelerates or more states become affected.

There are no indications of strong, immediate interventions sufficient to halt the trend before September[5]. The herd count metric is based on confirmed cases, and reporting may lag, but this has been consistent so far[2][5]. The risk of the count surpassing 300 exists (if the outbreak accelerates), as does the risk it falls short of 200 (if interventions suddenly become highly effective), but both require clear breaks from current trend.

Therefore, the status quo—steady, moderately rapid ongoing spread—makes "between 200 and 300" the most likely outcome, though not overwhelmingly certain.

**Probability: 68%**
