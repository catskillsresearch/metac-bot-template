(a) Time until outcome: The outcome will be known by April 1, 2025, which is approximately 2 months from today (May 6, 2025). However, since we're currently past April 1, 2025, the outcome is actually already determined.

(b) Status quo outcome: Based on the provided search results, the Federal Reserve was projected to implement only about two rate cuts in all of 2025, with many analysts expecting the Fed to pause at or above 4%. The status quo outcome would have been no rate cut before April 1, 2025.

(c) Scenario for No outcome: The Fed could have maintained its cautious approach due to sticky inflation concerns and continued economic strength, leading them to hold rates steady through the first quarter of 2025. As indicated in the search results, some analysts like Roger Hallam from Vanguard predicted that "a skip in January could very easily turn into an extended pause"[2].

(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: Economic data could have shown weakening growth or faster-than-expected disinflation in early 2025, prompting the Fed to implement one of their projected rate cuts before April 1. The Fed had already demonstrated willingness to cut rates with three cuts in late 2024, so another cut in early 2025 was certainly possible if conditions warranted it.

Given the current date of May 6, 2025, I need to analyze what likely happened in the first quarter of 2025 based on the search results provided.

From the search results, we can see that as of December 2024 and early January 2025, the Federal Reserve had indicated they expected to cut rates by just a half point total in 2025, which would mean about two rate cuts during their eight policy-setting meetings throughout the year[2]. This projection was a reduction from their earlier September 2024 forecast of four quarter-point cuts in 2025.

The search results indicate that many analysts were expecting the Fed to be cautious with rate cuts in early 2025. Roger Hallam from Vanguard suggested that a skip in January "could very easily turn into an extended pause," and that the Fed would likely pause at or above 4%[2]. The Fed had already cut rates three times in late 2024 (September, November, and December), bringing the target federal funds rate down to around 4%[1][2].

The updated dot plot from December 2024 showed the Fed projecting the funds rate at 3.875% at the end of 2025, suggesting only two quarter-point cuts for the entire year[5]. This indicates a "slower and shallower rate cut story for 2025"[5] with the Fed being "much more cautious" due to sticky inflation concerns.

Given these projections and the cautious stance indicated in the search results, it seems unlikely that the Fed would have implemented another rate cut in the first quarter of 2025. The consensus view from the search results points to the Fed holding rates steady through at least the first quarter, with cuts more likely in the spring or later in 2025.

Probability: 15%
