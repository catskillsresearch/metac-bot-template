(a) **Time until resolution:**  
As of November 12, 2024, the outcome will be determined shortly after the Federal Register page for Biden’s 2024 executive orders is checked by Metaculus Admins. Given publication lag and site access requirements, resolution could take several days to a few weeks beyond November 12, 2024.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changes:**  
Historically, Joe Biden has issued executive orders in nearly every month of his presidency. Examination of previous years (2021, 2022, 2023) shows that no months were skipped entirely[1][2][3]. Therefore, the default expectation is that at least one executive order will appear for November 2024 in the Federal Register, meaning the most likely outcome is "No" (i.e., more than zero executive orders).

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
President Biden signs and transmits at least one executive order in November 2024, and it is published on the Federal Register page for that month before the Metaculus Admins check the page. This would align with all observed precedent[1][2][3].

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
President Biden refrains from signing any executive orders during November 2024, or—if he does sign any—a publication or clerical error prevents their appearance in the Federal Register’s listing for November by the time the page is checked. This would be unprecedented during his presidency.

**Rationale**

The Federal Register is the definitive source for official executive orders tied to specific signing dates. While some presidential actions, such as "notices" (e.g., the November 7, 2024 continuation of a national emergency[5]), are published, these are not executive orders unless explicitly identified as such in the Federal Register. 

The publication lag is usually brief (1-5 days), making it unlikely that a November executive order would remain unpublished by the time of the check unless it is issued on the last days of the month[1][3]. As of November 12, 2024, there is no evidence suggesting November will break the continuous monthly issuing pattern Biden has maintained[1][2][3]. No known systemic, political, or procedural factors point to a complete absence of executive orders for November. 

Historically, even during election and post-election periods, presidents typically continue to issue at least some executive orders. Notices and other presidential documents published in the Federal Register, such as the November 7 national emergency continuation[5], do not alter this unless they are formally executive orders (which this notice is not).

Given these factors and the weight that forecasters should assign to established patterns, the probability that November 2024 will see *zero* executive orders listed is extremely low.
