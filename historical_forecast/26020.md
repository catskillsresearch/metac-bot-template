(a) **Time until outcome is known:**  
As of July 11, 2024, the August 2024 CPI-U data is scheduled for release on September 11, 2024 (the second Wednesday of September, per the BLS schedule). That is about 2 months from today.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
The most recent CPI-U value is 314.175 for June 2024, essentially unchanged from May 2024 (313.225)[4]. If the index continues at roughly the same level, it would remain below the 316.000 threshold.

(c) **Scenario for a No outcome (CPI-U ≤ 316.000):**  
If the CPI-U grows at its average rate from recent months, the index is likely to stay below 316.000. For example, over the past year, CPI-U increased 3.0 percent, but recent monthly changes have been flat (no increase from May to June 2024)[4]. A continuation of this very modest or flat growth would keep the index beneath the threshold.

(d) **Scenario for a Yes outcome (CPI-U > 316.000):**  
To exceed 316.000 by August, the CPI-U needs to rise by at least 1.825 index points from June 2024 (314.175 to 316.000) in two months, requiring an average monthly increase of about 0.91 points, or roughly 0.29% per month. This would likely require an acceleration in inflation from the current flat trend—potentially sparked by a surge in energy prices, supply shocks, or other macroeconomic surprises.

## Rationale

- **Historical trend:** The CPI-U was 306.187 in August 2023 and rose to 314.175 in June 2024, an average annual growth rate around 2.6%. However, the growth has slowed recently, with no monthly increase in the latest reported figure[1][4].
- **Recent momentum:** From May to June 2024, the index was unchanged[4]. For the last several months, increases have been small or non-existent.
- **Required pace to exceed 316.000:** Hitting 316.000 by August would require a reversal of this flat pattern and a return to more robust monthly inflation than currently observed. Unless there is an unexpected inflationary shock, this scenario is less likely.
- **Baseline:** Good forecasters emphasize inertia; the most likely outcome is a continuation of recent movement, which suggests CPI-U remains below the threshold.

## Final Answer

Probability: 30%

With the available data, the most likely scenario is that the August 2024 CPI-U does not exceed 316.000. Recent stagnation in the index and modest underlying inflation point to a lower probability that a rapid acceleration occurs in the next two months, barring unexpected shocks[4].
