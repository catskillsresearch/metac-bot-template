(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
As today is May 6, 2025, the outcome date of April 1, 2025, has already passed.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
If President Trump did not issue a new presidential action mentioning the "Diversity Visa" (using those exact words) by April 1, 2025, the status quo outcome is **No**.

(c) **Scenario leading to a No outcome:**  
President Trump focuses his early 2025 immigration actions on other areas—such as enhanced vetting, border security, or investor visa programs—without issuing any presidential action that specifically references "Diversity Visa" before April 1, 2025. There are no published presidential actions on the official White House site meeting the required criteria.

(d) **Scenario leading to a Yes outcome:**  
Before April 1, 2025, President Trump issues and publishes a new presidential action (e.g., executive order, proclamation, or memorandum) in which he explicitly mentions "Diversity Visa" by name—whether to end, modify, or comment on the program.

## Rationale

- **Recent Activity:** President Trump began his second term with multiple executive orders on immigration, showing a willingness to act quickly and broadly on related issues[1][3]. However, these early policy moves addressed topics like enhanced vetting, birthright citizenship, border security, and refugee programs, not specifically the Diversity Visa[1].
- **President’s Position:** Trump has previously criticized the Diversity Visa program and has signaled intent to try to end or eliminate it via executive action, as he attempted in his prior term[2][4][5]. His broader immigration agenda, as outlined in platforms like Project 2025, includes removing the Diversity Visa Lottery[4][5].
- **Constraints:** Legal and procedural limitations mean significant changes to the Diversity Visa program often require legislative action, and the courts have previously intervened when executive actions appeared to overstep[2]. Furthermore, there is no publicly available indication that a new presidential action mentioning "Diversity Visa" was issued before the deadline.
- **Recent Announcements:** Recent official actions and public statements through February and March 2025 focused on other parts of the immigration system, such as the EB-5 investor visa program and not on the Diversity Visa[1]. No reliable source confirms a presidential action mentioning "Diversity Visa" was published before April 1, 2025.

Given the documentation and the passage of the April 1, 2025, deadline, unless there is evidence of such a presidential action published and accessible before that date, the outcome is **No**.
