(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
As of November 11, 2024, there are just under 2 months remaining until January 1, 2025, when the outcome will be determined.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
No laboratory mouse (*Mus musculus*) has credibly been reported to live 2,500 days (about 6.85 years). The record-holding mice, such as the growth hormone receptor knockout mice, have reached nearly 5 years (~1,800 days), with the most extreme verified cases approaching, but not surpassing, 1,800 days. There have been no credible or mainstream media reports claiming a 2,500-day-old mouse[3][4][5]. Therefore, if nothing changes, the outcome is “No.”

(c) **A scenario that results in a No outcome:**  
No laboratory mouse reaches or is reported by credible media to have reached 2,500 days of age before January 1, 2025. The field sees no radical breakthrough allowing mice to surpass the previous record by a considerable margin. Ongoing research continues as before, with the maximum lifespan remaining under 2,000 days, and no new peer-reviewed publications or substantial news reports emerge documenting a 2,500-day-old mouse[1][3][4][5].

(d) **A scenario that results in a Yes outcome:**  
A major breakthrough in rejuvenation or lifespan-extending biotechnology is achieved, possibly through genetic engineering or other interventions, and a laboratory mouse is verified by credible scientific or mainstream media outlets as having lived at least 2,500 days. This would likely be a globally reported event due to the scale of the advance, given it would far exceed the long-standing record by hundreds of days and have meaningful implications for aging research[4][5]. Alternatively, evidence emerges that a previously unnoticed individual reached this milestone, and a credible outlet confirms the achievement before the deadline.

**Rationale:**  
- The maximum confirmed laboratory mouse longevity on record remains just shy of 5 years (about 1,800 days), specifically in growth hormone receptor knockout mice[4][5].  
- Typical and even outlier cases in laboratory conditions rarely surpass 1,300–1,800 days[3].  
- No credible media or scientific sources have reported a *Mus musculus* laboratory mouse reaching 2,500 days as of November 2024[1][3][4][5].  
- A leap from 1,800 to 2,500 days (an increase of over 38%) would almost certainly require a transformative scientific breakthrough, which would be widely reported.

Given the historical stability of record longevity and the absence of any signals indicating such a breakthrough has occurred or is imminent, the base rate is extremely low. Good forecasting practice gives strong weight to the status quo barring significant new evidence.
