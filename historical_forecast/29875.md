(a) **Time until outcome known:**  
From November 11, 2024, there are about 1.5 months until January 1, 2025.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
As of early November 2024, Russia controls Simferopol, Nova Kakhovka, Svatove, Donetsk, and Tokmak (the “must have” locations), but does **not control any** of the “at least two” additional specified cities—Mikolaiv, Zaporizhzhia city, Kharkiv, Odesa, Lozova, Sumy, or Chernihiv. Therefore, if nothing changes, the resolution is **No**[5][2].

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
Russia fails to capture at least two of the specified cities (from the list above) by January 1, 2025, even if it continues incremental gains elsewhere. The frontline remains largely unchanged, with any territorial advances limited to rural areas or towns not on the criteria list, or Russia only manages to secure one (or zero) of the specified cities.

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
Russia successfully captures and has de facto control over all five required “must-have” locations (which it already does), **and** at least two of the key cities it does not currently hold—such as Odesa and Kharkiv—by January 1, 2025, as determined by the ISW map.

## Rationale

The best available evidence shows that Russian advances throughout 2024 have been steady but limited, focused on incremental territorial gains at the frontline, particularly in the Donbas region[5]. The largest monthly gain—720 km²—occurred in November 2024, but these gains have not included any of the major cities required for a “Yes” outcome[5].

- Western officials and analysts have repeatedly assessed that Ukrainian forces are likely to remain on the defensive through the end of 2024, and will likely be unable to reclaim substantial territory in the near term[3].
- However, Russia’s advances have been characterized as incremental rather than dramatic breakthroughs capable of seizing major urban centers such as Odesa or Kharkiv[5][4].
- The status quo finds Russia consolidating its existing positions and nibbling at frontlines, with no evidence of large-scale offensives that would likely be required to take and hold major cities by January 1, 2025[5].
- There is no evidence in the record that Russia is poised to capture any of the two-or-more key cities needed for a “Yes.” Such operations would require substantial escalation and military resources beyond the current pattern of attritional, incremental gains[2][5].

Good forecasting practice emphasizes the status quo unless there is compelling evidence for significant change. At present, none of the required additional locations are under imminent threat of falling to Russian control, and the timeline is short.

## Final Answer

Probability: **3%**

Russia is highly unlikely to control two or more of the specified additional major cities (Mikolaiv, Zaporizhzhia, Kharkiv, Odesa, Lozova, Sumy, or Chernihiv) by January 1, 2025, while retaining the others, based on the current trajectory and the defined resolution criteria[2][5].
