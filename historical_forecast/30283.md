(a) Time until outcome: 38 days (from November 19, 2024 to December 27, 2024)

(b) Status quo outcome: Based on the most recent data, the US oil rig count is at 479 as of early May 2025, which is below the 585 threshold. If nothing changes, the outcome would be "Yes" (less than 585 rigs).

(c) Scenario for a "No" outcome: A significant and sudden spike in global oil prices due to geopolitical tensions or supply disruptions could trigger rapid deployment of additional drilling rigs. Oil companies might quickly activate mothballed rigs in response to sustained higher prices, pushing the count above 585 by late December.

(d) Scenario for a "Yes" outcome: The current downward trend in rig counts continues or stabilizes at current levels due to ongoing capital discipline by oil companies, moderate oil prices, and focus on efficiency rather than expanding drilling programs. The count remains below 585, potentially even declining further from the current 479.

As a professional forecaster, I need to analyze the question of whether US oil drilling rigs will be less than 585 on December 27, 2024, based on the Baker Hughes count.

The most recent data available shows that as of May 2, 2025, the total rig count in the United States was 584, which had decreased from 587 the previous week[5]. This represents the lowest count since January 21 (presumably January 2025). More specifically, the Baker Hughes US oil rig count was reported at 479 in October 2024[3].

Looking at the historical context, US rig counts have been following a generally declining trend. The total rigs in the United States have averaged 1482.16 from 1950 until 2025, with an all-time high of 4530 in December 1981 and a record low of 244 in August 2020[5]. The current level is significantly below historical averages.

The current level of 479 oil rigs (as reported in October 2024) is well below the 585 threshold in question. Even considering the total rig count (which includes both oil and gas rigs) of 584 as of May 2025, we're still at or below the threshold.

It's important to note that the rig count acts as a leading indicator of demand for drilling products and services[1]. This means changes in rig count often reflect broader industry expectations about future oil prices and demand.

When forecasting the December 27, 2024 count, I need to consider potential drivers that might significantly increase drilling activity in the short term:

1. **Oil price dynamics**: A substantial and sustained increase in oil prices could incentivize more drilling, but would require several weeks to months to translate into significantly higher rig counts.

2. **Seasonal factors**: Winter weather can sometimes affect drilling operations, but this typically leads to decreases rather than increases in active rigs.

3. **Industry capital discipline**: Oil companies have maintained capital discipline in recent years, focusing on returns rather than production growth, which has kept rig counts lower than in previous price cycles.

Given the current count is at 479 for oil rigs specifically, it would require a substantial increase of over 100 rigs (more than 20%) in a relatively short period to exceed the threshold. Such an increase would be unusual without extraordinary circumstances, especially considering the recent trend has been downward.

The status quo strongly suggests the count will remain below 585. While unexpected geopolitical events could shift oil prices dramatically, the industry's response time to deploy new rigs would likely extend beyond the December 27 timeframe, particularly given the holiday season when activity often slows.

Probability: 85%
