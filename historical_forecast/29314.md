(a) **Time left until the outcome is known**: The outcome will be known on or soon after November 5, 2024, which is Election Day. As today is October 29, 2024 (per scenario), there is approximately one week left until the result is known.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed**: If current trends and polling persist through Election Day, Kamala Harris is favored to win New Mexico, New Hampshire, Virginia, and Maine.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome**: For a "No" outcome, Donald Trump would need to win the popular vote in at least one of these four states—New Mexico, New Hampshire, Virginia, or Maine. Based on the polling, the most vulnerable appears to be New Hampshire, where the race is closer. A late-breaking surge for Trump, significant polling error, unexpected political event, or turnout anomaly could result in a loss for Harris in one of these states, most likely New Hampshire.

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome**: For a "Yes" outcome, Harris must carry the popular vote in all four states. This would occur if current polling holds and there is no major late shift in voter sentiment, turnout, or campaign dynamics in these states.

## Rationale

**New Mexico**: Kamala Harris holds a solid and consistent lead in New Mexico polling, with late October polls showing her ahead by 9 points[1][3]. The state has a strong Democratic lean, having voted for the Democratic nominee in eight of the last nine presidential elections[5]. Unless a drastic and highly unlikely late development occurs, Harris is overwhelmingly likely to win New Mexico.

**New Hampshire**: The race is closer here, but Harris maintains a narrow edge. The October 25 Emerson poll gives Harris a 50% to 47% advantage, increasing to 51% to 47% after undecided voters are allocated[2]. An October 17 UMass Lowell poll showed a larger 9-point lead for Harris (50% to 41%), but more recent data suggest a tightening race[3]. Other polls in August and September have consistently shown Harris ahead by 4–6 points[4][5]. New Hampshire is more competitive than the other states in question and is the likeliest point of failure for this scenario, but Harris remains the favorite.

**Virginia**: Although no direct late October polls are cited, Virginia has become a reliably Democratic state in recent presidential cycles, with double-digit margins for Democratic candidates in both 2016 and 2020. No evidence or polling points to a dramatic shift toward Trump as of late October 2024.

**Maine**: Like Virginia, Maine has a strong Democratic track record in recent elections. The only complication is Maine’s split electoral vote, but the question concerns the statewide popular vote—where Democrats have consistently prevailed. No polling or news suggests a Republican upset at the statewide level.

**Uncertainties**: 
- New Hampshire is the most competitive, with a plausible but still unlikely risk of an upset.
- Sudden late events, scandals, turnout surges, or large polling errors could affect these forecasts, but nothing in the available data points to such a scenario as of this writing.

### Forecasting Principle

Election results typically follow the status quo, especially late in a campaign unless significant contrary evidence emerges. As things stand, the balance of evidence and historical voting patterns point toward Harris carrying all four states.
