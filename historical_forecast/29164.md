Based on the current date of May 6, 2025, I must note that this question refers to a past event, as it asks about abolishing the two-child benefit cap before January 1, 2025. Since we're now in May 2025, the outcome of this question has already been determined. I'll analyze what was known before the resolution date to provide the forecast that would have been appropriate before January 1, 2025.

(a) Time left until the outcome is known: The outcome would have been determined by January 1, 2025, which was approximately 8 months from the date of the search results (July 2024).

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: The two-child benefit cap would remain in place, resulting in a "No" outcome.

(c) Scenario resulting in a No outcome: The Labour government, despite internal pressure and advocacy from various organizations, maintains its position that fiscal constraints prevent abolishing the two-child limit. Prime Minister Starmer continues to enforce party discipline on the issue, and public opinion remains largely supportive of maintaining the policy.

(d) Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome: Growing evidence of the policy's negative impact on child poverty creates sufficient political pressure for the Labour government to reverse its position. The government finds fiscal space in its budget to accommodate the estimated £1.7 billion cost and announces a complete abolition of the two-child limit before the end of 2024.

## Rationale for Forecast

The search results provide several strong indicators that the two-child benefit cap was unlikely to be abolished before January 1, 2025:

1. **Political leadership stance**: Despite Labour previously campaigning to abolish the policy in 2017 and 2019, Keir Starmer explicitly stated in July 2023 that Labour would not include a reversal of the policy in its election platform[2]. This represents a clear policy position that would be politically costly to reverse shortly after taking office.

2. **Recent policy enforcement**: The search results indicate that Labour had already suspended seven MPs who defied party leadership by voting against the government on this issue, demonstrating a strong commitment to maintaining the policy[2].

3. **Public opinion**: According to the search results, 60% of the general public, including 50% of Labour supporters, opposed lifting the cap[2]. This public sentiment likely reinforced the government's position.

4. **Fiscal constraints**: The government consistently cited financial constraints as the reason for not abolishing the policy. With an estimated cost of £1.7 billion, this represented a significant budget consideration during a period of economic challenges[1].

5. **Timeline considerations**: The search results date from March to July 2024, which gave only 5-6 months for a complete policy reversal before the January 1, 2025 deadline. Major policy changes, especially those with significant budget implications, typically require longer implementation periods.

While there was strong advocacy for abolishing the policy from organizations like the Child Poverty Action Group and Save the Children, and evidence of its negative impact on child poverty, these factors alone were unlikely to overcome the political, public opinion, and fiscal barriers to policy change within the short timeframe.

As a good forecaster, I must give substantial weight to the status quo outcome, particularly given the clear signals from government leadership and the relatively short timeframe for change. While policy reversals can occur, they typically require either a change in circumstances (such as newly available fiscal resources) or overwhelming political pressure, neither of which appeared imminent in the available information.
