(a) **Time remaining until resolution:**  
About 53 days remain until October 1, 2024, when this question will be resolved.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changes:**  
Tim Walz remains Kamala Harris’s running mate as the Democratic Party’s official candidate for Vice President through October 1, 2024. Outcome: **No**.

(c) **Scenario that results in a No outcome:**  
Walz continues on the ticket without any major scandal, health issue, or internal party upheaval, and the Democratic National Committee does not replace him as the official vice-presidential nominee before October 1, 2024.

(d) **Scenario that results in a Yes outcome:**  
Tim Walz withdraws, is removed, or otherwise ceases to be the official Democratic nominee for Vice President prior to October 1, 2024. This could happen due to personal health crises, a scandal, internal party politics, or another extraordinary event, analogous to the 1972 Thomas Eagleton situation.

## Rationale

All available information as of August 9, 2024, indicates that Tim Walz has only recently been selected to join Harris as the vice-presidential nominee, and his selection has been received positively by both party leaders and the media[1][2][3][4][5]. He is actively campaigning, has no reported controversies, and enjoys a stable standing within the party. There is no evidence of internal dissent or personal vulnerabilities—health or political—that would suggest likely withdrawal or removal before October 1, 2024[1][2][5].

Historically, vice-presidential candidates are almost never replaced after formal selection unless a major, highly disruptive revelation or event occurs. Cases like Thomas Eagleton’s in 1972 are notable precisely because of their rarity. The Democratic Party has every incentive to project stability, especially in a high-stakes election cycle, and there are no emerging factors indicating imminent risk to Walz’s status.

While political “unknown unknowns” are always possible, strong forecasters place significant weight on the status quo and the inertia of political processes. The base rate for last-minute VP switches is extremely low. Unless an extraordinary, currently unforeseen event transpires, the expectation should be that Walz remains on the ticket.
