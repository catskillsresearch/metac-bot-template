(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
The resolution source will be accessed on or after January 1, 2025, meaning there are about four weeks remaining until the outcome is determined.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
Historically, high temperatures in Phoenix during December remain below 80°F. The average high ranges from 66°F to 70°F, with highs rarely exceeding 78°F[5][4]. Most years, the temperature does not reach 80°F, and only in rare cases, such as December 2023, does it exceed this threshold. Therefore, the status quo outcome—if historical trends continue—is **Yes**: the temperature remains below 80°F every day.

(c) **Scenario that results in a No outcome:**  
A short-lived but unusual heat wave occurs, driving the high temperature at Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport to 80°F or higher on at least one day in December 2024, as recorded by the IEM weather calendar. This could be caused by an anomalous ridge of high pressure or other unusual meteorological patterns, similar to what happened in December 2023.

(d) **Scenario that results in a Yes outcome:**  
Weather patterns remain near historical norms, with highs generally in the 60s to 70s, and no daily high at or above 80°F is recorded for the entire month. This is the overwhelmingly common pattern based on decades of December climate data for Phoenix[5][4].

## Rationale

Historical temperature data for Phoenix in December consistently shows daily highs below 80°F, with rare exceptions[5][4]. The average high is around 65–70°F, and even on unusually warm years (excepting rare anomalies), the temperature does not typically reach or exceed 80°F. While 2023 featured a record-breaking 84°F high, this event is atypical and stands out against the backdrop of several decades of sub-80°F readings. Given that weather and climate tend to change slowly, the best estimate going forward is strongly weighted toward the long-term average and distribution.

The main uncertainty comes from the possibility of a rare, short-lived heat wave. However, considering the rarity of such events and the strong historical precedent, the chance of another December day reaching 80°F or higher remains low, albeit not zero.

## Final Answer

Probability: 85%  

Phoenix, AZ will most likely remain below 80°F for every day in December 2024, but a small risk of an anomalous warm spell remains, consistent with the unusual event in December 2023[5][4].
