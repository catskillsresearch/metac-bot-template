(a) Time left until the outcome is known:  
The outcome will be determined by March 17, 2025, so from February 6, 2025, there are about 5 weeks (roughly 39 days) left until the deadline.

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changes:  
If no new law is enacted, the debt ceiling remains at $36.1 trillion as reinstated on January 2, 2025. The Treasury will continue using extraordinary measures and cash on hand to avoid default through at least mid-March. Since these measures are expected to last past March 14, 2025, and no legislative action has been taken so far, the most likely status quo scenario is that no debt ceiling increase or suspension occurs before March 17, 2025.

(c) Scenario resulting in a No outcome:  
Congress does not pass any bill to raise, suspend, or abolish the debt ceiling before March 17, 2025. The Treasury continues to rely on extraordinary measures and tax inflows to meet obligations up to and possibly beyond mid-March, and negotiations remain stalled or slow due to political divisions and the complexity of bargaining over spending cuts and fiscal priorities. No legislative breakthrough happens in this early period.

(d) Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:  
Amid growing market or political pressure, Congress agrees on legislation to raise or suspend the debt ceiling before March 17, 2025. This could happen if last-minute negotiations produce a deal involving spending cuts or revenue adjustments acceptable enough to both parties, similar to past brinkmanship episodes, but occurring earlier than usual due to emerging economic risks or political incentives.

### Rationale

- The Treasury’s use of extraordinary measures and cash reserves currently provides a buffer through mid-March, making an immediate crisis less likely before March 17[1][2].  
- Historical precedent shows Congress often delays action until just before the "X Date"—the point when extraordinary measures are exhausted and risk of default becomes real[1][4]. This usually results in last-minute deals rather than early resolutions.  
- Political dynamics are complicated by a narrowly divided House with factions opposing increases without spending cuts or other concessions[3]. This division slows the legislative process, especially early in the calendar year.  
- There is no public information as of early February 2025 indicating imminent legislation or a bipartisan deal on the debt ceiling before mid-March[1][3][4]. The negotiation environment suggests more time will be taken as pressures mount closer to or after the expiration of extraordinary measures.  
- While political negotiations can accelerate unexpectedly due to market pressures or political shifts, there is no current indicator pointing to an early resolution.

Given these factors, the status quo (no debt ceiling change by March 17) is more likely, but a surprise earlier deal cannot be ruled out entirely.

### Final answer

Probability: 20% that the US will enact a law to raise or suspend the debt ceiling before March 17, 2025.
