(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  
The 2024 Paris Olympics are scheduled from July 26 to August 11, 2024. We expect the outcome to be known by the end of the Games—so less than a month remains until this question will be resolved.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changes:**  
Historically, swimmers are the most likely to win the most gold medals at a given Olympic Games due to the number of swimming events and potential for entering multiple relays and individual races. Recent expert predictions continue to identify swimmers—specifically Leon Marchand, Summer McIntosh, and Katie Ledecky—as primary contenders to lead the gold medal count at Paris 2024[3][4]. Thus, the status quo outcome is that a swimmer will win the most gold medals.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
A "No" outcome would require an athlete in another sport (most plausibly gymnastics or athletics/track and field) to win more gold medals than any swimmer, and for no swimmer to be tied with this athlete. For example, a gymnast winning four or five golds while the top swimmer wins three, with no tie at the top, would result in a No.

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
A "Yes" outcome will occur if the individual with the most gold medals at the 2024 Olympics is a swimmer. In the (likely) event of a tie, as long as a swimmer is among those with the highest gold tally, the outcome is Yes. This could be, for example, Leon Marchand winning four golds solo, or being tied with a gymnast at four—either way, the resolution is Yes[3][4][5].

## Rationale

- Swimming offers the highest concentration of medal events and opportunities for an individual to win multiple golds, especially when combining individual and relay events.
- Recent Olympic history (with athletes like Michael Phelps and Caeleb Dressel) and current expert forecasts for Paris 2024 point to swimmers as frontrunners for the highest gold medal haul[3][4][5].
- Leading swimmers (Marchand, McIntosh, Ledecky) are each entered in multiple events and are favorites in several, increasing their chances.
- While it's possible for a gymnast or track athlete—who also have multi-event potential—to have a historic Games, the structure of their respective programs typically allows for fewer golds than the top swimmers can realistically win.
- Barring an outlier performance or unforeseen events (injury, illness, DQ), the most probable result is that a swimmer will win the most gold medals at Paris 2024[3][4][5].

**Probability: 85%**
