(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
The Port Authority typically publishes detailed monthly TEU figures for January in late March. As of January 24, 2025, this is about 2 months away.

(b) **Outcome if nothing changed:**  
If January 2025 matched January 2024, the monthly cargo volume would be **667,346 TEUs**[3].

(c) **Outcome if the current trend continued:**  
From January 2023 to January 2024, volume grew by 3.4%[3]. If this growth rate continues, January 2025 would see:

\[
667,346 \times 1.034 \approx 690,033 \text{ TEUs}
\]

(d) **Expectations of experts and markets:**  
Industry forecasts from the National Retail Federation (NRF) and Hackett Associates predict US-wide January container imports up about 10% year-over-year[2][4]. If the Port of NY–NJ tracks the national trend, the January 2025 volume could be near:

\[
667,346 \times 1.10 = 734,080 \text{ TEUs}
\]

(e) **Brief description of an unexpected scenario resulting in a low outcome:**  
A sharp slowdown in US or global consumption (e.g., a sudden recession or major supply chain disruption), or severe winter weather disrupting East Coast port operations, could drive the number well below recent years—potentially flat or modestly negative versus January 2024, meaning volumes near or just above 660,000 TEUs.

(f) **Brief description of an unexpected scenario resulting in a high outcome:**  
A surge in rerouted cargo due to disruptions elsewhere (e.g., extended Gulf/West Coast congestion, or another significant closure like the Baltimore bridge incident), combined with robust economic growth, could push January 2025 volumes sharply higher—potentially exceeding 750,000 TEUs.
