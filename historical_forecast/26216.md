(a) **Time remaining until outcome is known:**  
There are approximately 2 months left until September 15, 2024—the deadline for the outcome of whether Bitcoin will surpass $100,000.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
As of mid-July 2024, Bitcoin is trading in the $55,000–$65,000 range and has not yet reached $100,000. If current trends persist with no major new bullish catalyst or dramatic price rally, Bitcoin is unlikely to hit $100,000 before the deadline[2][4].

(c) **Scenario for a No outcome:**  
Bitcoin remains below $100,000 as broader macroeconomic conditions (such as high interest rates, regulatory interventions, or risk-off sentiment in global markets) dampen both retail and institutional buying. ETF inflows stabilize, and post-halving momentum is modest or fizzles, with prices oscillating in their current range or rising only moderately.

(d) **Scenario for a Yes outcome:**  
A rapid inflow of institutional capital into spot Bitcoin ETFs, coupled with a significant Federal Reserve interest rate cut or escalating demand in response to global economic instability, ignites a sustained rally. Bitcoin quickly breaks through technical resistance and, fueled by renewed investor euphoria and FOMO (fear of missing out), briefly spikes to or above $100,000 before September 15[1][3].

## Rationale

Most respected industry forecasts for 2024 give possible highs between $78,000 and $120,000, with $100,000 identified as a bullish but not consensus scenario[2][4]. Institutional adoption, ETF inflows, and supply reduction from the recent halving are all strong tailwinds, and some analysts even predict $150,000 to $200,000 in the next 12–18 months[1][3]. However, current price action is well below the threshold, and the remaining timeline is short. 

Historically, Bitcoin has produced sharp rallies, but these are hard to time and depend on a combination of positive macro triggers and overwhelming bullish sentiment. The status quo—steady prices with mild upward or downward trends—usually wins unless there is a clear catalyst.

Therefore, the balance of probabilities still favors Bitcoin *not* reaching $100,000 before September 15, 2024, though the possibility remains live—perhaps a one-in-four risk—given the asset’s historic propensity for extreme, sudden moves.

Probability: **25%**
