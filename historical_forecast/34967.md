(a) Time left until outcome: 47 days (from today, May 6, 2025, until March 31, 2025, which has already passed)

(b) Status quo outcome: The question is asking about a date that has already passed (March 31, 2025). Based on the search results available, we don't have direct confirmation of who was the richest person according to Forbes on that specific date.

(c) Scenario for No outcome: If Elon Musk was not ranked #1 on the Forbes Real-Time Billionaires List on March 31, 2025, perhaps due to continued volatility in Tesla stock or because another billionaire like Jeff Bezos surpassed him.

(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: If Elon Musk maintained his position as the world's richest person according to the Forbes Real-Time Billionaires List on March 31, 2025, possibly due to recovery in Tesla stock or other business ventures performing well.

Based on the search results provided, I can see that Elon Musk's net worth has been significantly growing in recent months. As of late 2024, his net worth stood at $442.1 billion[3], and more recent information indicates it reached around $430 billion[2]. This represents substantial growth from earlier figures like $270.3 billion in October 2024[5].

The search results show that Musk has maintained a substantial lead over other billionaires. Specifically, there's mention that Musk left "Jeff Bezos in the dust by $237 billion" according to a Fortune article from late 2024[3]. This suggests an extremely wide margin between Musk and his closest competitor.

There's even speculation about whether Musk could become a trillionaire in 2025, with markets being set up to predict this outcome[4]. While reaching the trillion-dollar mark is uncertain, this indicates the trajectory of Musk's wealth growth has been strongly positive.

Given the substantial lead Musk had over other billionaires in late 2024 and early 2025, and the continued growth in his net worth to approximately $430 billion in recent months[2], it appears highly likely that he remained the world's richest person on March 31, 2025. The margin between Musk and other billionaires was so substantial that even significant fluctuations in Tesla stock would be unlikely to completely eliminate this advantage in such a short time frame.

While we don't have the exact Forbes ranking for March 31, 2025, the preponderance of evidence from the search results strongly suggests Musk maintained his position as the world's richest person on that date.

Probability: 95%
