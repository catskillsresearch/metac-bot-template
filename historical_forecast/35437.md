I'll approach this forecasting challenge with careful analysis of the available data and structured reasoning.

(a) Time left until outcome: 25 days (February 24, 2025 to March 21, 2025)

(b) Outcome if nothing changed: Based on the March 2025 snapshot of 68,667 concurrent players mentioned in the research materials

(c) Outcome if current trend continued: The game shows a typical post-launch decline pattern. From February 28 release to March 21 represents approximately 3 weeks post-launch, where we'd expect to see a significant drop from initial peak numbers.

(d) Expectations of experts and markets: The market expects Monster Hunter Wilds to be one of the most anticipated games of 2025, with strong initial engagement based on beta test numbers reaching over 463,000 concurrent players. However, all games experience post-launch player count declines.

(e) Unexpected scenario - low outcome: A major game-breaking bug or server issue could dramatically reduce player counts. Alternatively, if another highly anticipated game launches just before March 21, it could draw players away from Monster Hunter Wilds.

(f) Unexpected scenario - high outcome: Capcom could release a major content update or special event timed for mid-March, causing a significant spike in player engagement. Positive word-of-mouth and streamer attention could also create a second wave of interest.

Now for my forecast. Looking at the data, I need to consider:

Monster Hunter Wilds released on February 28, 2025, meaning March 21 is approximately 3 weeks post-launch[3]. Game player counts typically peak in the first few days after launch and then decline steadily. The beta test reached extremely high numbers (463,000+)[5], indicating strong initial interest.

The March 2025 data point of 68,667 concurrent players is particularly relevant[4]. However, this could be from any day in March, potentially before or after our target date.

The measurement time (4:00 PM ET) is important - this is not peak gaming time for all regions, which may result in lower numbers than daily peaks.

Looking at the post-launch trend from the available data:
- February (release): Likely 200,000-300,000 peak concurrent players based on beta performance
- March snapshot: 68,667 players
- Late April peak: 110,715 players[1]
- Early May: 164,464 players (ranked #4 on Steam)[4]

The April and May figures suggest some fluctuation rather than a steady decline, possibly due to content updates or weekend peaks. The measurement on March 21 will be on a Friday, which typically has higher player counts than weekdays.

Taking into account all these factors and the inherent uncertainty in player engagement patterns:

Percentile 10: 45,000
Percentile 20: 55,000
Percentile 40: 70,000
Percentile 60: 85,000
Percentile 80: 110,000
Percentile 90: 135,000
