(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
The resolution date was April 1, 2025. Given today’s date is May 6, 2025, the outcome is already known.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
As of the latest available updates from authoritative sources (NASA, U.S. State Department), there were 53 signatories to the Artemis Accords by April 1, 2025[1]. The 54th signatory, Bangladesh, joined on April 8, 2025—which is after the resolution date[1]. If this status quo holds, the answer is “No.”

(c) **Scenario that results in a No outcome:**  
No new country joins the Artemis Accords between the time there are 53 signatories and April 1, 2025. The 53 signatories remain constant until Bangladesh joins on April 8, 2025. Therefore, on April 1, 2025, there are only 53 signatories.

(d) **Scenario that results in a Yes outcome:**  
A new country joins and is formally recognized as the 54th signatory to the Artemis Accords before or on April 1, 2025, according to the official NASA or U.S. State Department records. No such event is documented in authoritative sources before that date.

## Rationale

- Official records from the U.S. State Department and NASA show 53 signatories as of April 1, 2025[1].
- The 54th signatory, Bangladesh, joined after the resolution date—specifically on April 8, 2025[1].
- No announcements or evidence suggest another country signed before April 1, 2025[1].
- While expansion of signatories has been frequent, the official lists are definitive and no last-minute additions have been recorded in the available sources.
- Good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo, given the general inertia in international agreements unless specific contrary evidence emerges.
