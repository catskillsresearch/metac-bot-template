(a) **Time until outcome is known:**  
The outcome will be known on or after April 1, 2025. Today is May 6, 2025, so the outcome determination date has already passed; however, as of the last factual update dated March 7, 2025, the outcome was still pending and climate.mil remained down.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
If current trends and policies persist, the status quo is that climate.mil remains offline. As of March 7, 2025, "Is It Down Right Now?" confirmed that climate.mil was "DOWN for everyone." No evidence suggested a change[1].

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
The No outcome occurs if the US military's climate resilience portal (climate.mil) is still down (i.e., not accessible according to "Is It Down Right Now?") on or after April 1, 2025. This is the direct extension of the status quo, in light of ongoing federal climate information suppression and a lack of public announcements about restoration[1].

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
A Yes would require the Department of Defense to restore the climate.mil portal by April 1, 2025, with it becoming publicly accessible and confirmed online by "Is It Down Right Now?". This would likely follow a notable shift in policy, an internal directive, or a technical resolution—none of which had been reported as of March 7, 2025[1][4]. While the DOD’s 2024-2027 Climate Adaptation Plan references the value of the portal[4], there is no public indication of imminent restoration.

## Rationale

- The status quo is a strong predictor: climate.mil has been down for an extended period, and historical and current policy trends under the Trump administration indicate continued suppression of official climate resources[1].
- The DOD continues to emphasize climate resilience in its broad planning documents[4], but public-facing resources like climate.mil remain offline. No announcements or technological signals suggest an imminent turnaround.
- Sudden restoration is technically possible with little notice, but in the absence of supporting evidence or shifting policy context, this outcome should be weighed lightly compared to the inertia of ongoing site suppression.

## Probability Estimate

Given the strong policy and technical momentum against restoration, and no sign of pivot as of March 7, 2025, the expectation is that climate.mil **will not be back online** on April 1, 2025.

Probability: 5%
