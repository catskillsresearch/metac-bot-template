(a) **Time left until question resolves:**  
As of May 6, 2025, there are approximately 8 weeks (about 1.8 months) remaining until the April 1, 2025 deadline.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changes:**  
If the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences takes no action, the representation and inclusion standards for Oscars eligibility will remain as they are, with the current requirements—established under the Academy Aperture 2025 initiative and in full effect for the 2024 Oscars—still in force[1][3][4]. In this case, the question resolves as **No**.

(c) **Scenario for a No outcome:**  
The Academy does not announce or implement any textual changes to its representation and inclusion standards page by April 1, 2025. No amendments, removals, or additions appear on the referenced Oscars.org page, meaning the DEI requirements remain unchanged.

(d) **Scenario for a Yes outcome:**  
The Academy publishes an update, amendment, or clarification—however minor—to the text of the representation and inclusion standards for Best Picture eligibility on its official page before April 1, 2025. This could include tightening, loosening, expanding definitions, or even removing the standards entirely. Any such change would result in the question resolving as **Yes**.

## Rationale

- The DEI standards were only fully implemented for the 96th Oscars in 2024 and are presented as a long-term structural reform under the Academy Aperture 2025 initiative[1][4].
- There are no indications from the Academy of a planned review or imminent amendment to these standards in any public communications, nor in the latest available reports as of early 2025[1][3].
- Historically, the Academy has moved cautiously when making changes, often signaling or reviewing adjustments well in advance to industry stakeholders[1][2].
- While outside pressures (such as political scrutiny of DEI initiatives) exist, there have been no signs that these have translated into rapid action or reversals at the Academy in recent months.
- Only about two months remain before the resolution date, making it unlikely that the Academy would suddenly announce and implement changes, especially since the new standards are one of the most significant policy adjustments in recent Oscars history and represent the culmination of a multi-year process[4].
- Major procedural or eligibility changes to the Oscars are typically previewed or signposted at least a year in advance, aligning with the Academy's commitment to transparency and stability for filmmakers and studios.

Given all these factors and the weight of institutional inertia, the status quo outcome carries extra weight.

## Final Probability Estimate

Probability: **8%**
