(a) Time left until outcome: The question resolves on April 1, 2025, which is about 26 days from today (May 6, 2025). However, since this date has already passed, the outcome should already be known.

(b) Status quo outcome: Based on the current date (May 6, 2025), the period in question (from question launch until April 1, 2025) is already in the past. However, there appears to be a mismatch in dates, as the query indicates today is March 19, 2025, while the date header shows May 6, 2025.

(c) Scenario for No outcome: Guatemala City maintains temperatures at or above 80°F every single day between question launch and April 1, 2025, which would be consistent with typical weather patterns approaching April.

(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: At least one cold front moves through Guatemala City during the period, causing at least one day where the high temperature fails to reach 80°F.

Based on the search results provided, I can offer the following analysis:

Guatemala City typically experiences comfortable temperatures in March and April. In March, high temperatures reach around 80°F (27°C), while April sees slightly higher temperatures up to 82-83°F (28°C)[2][3][4]. 

Looking specifically at historical March data, Guatemala City has an average high temperature of 26.8°C (80.2°F) at the beginning of the month[4]. This suggests that temperatures around 80°F are common but don't necessarily exceed this threshold every single day.

While April tends to be warmer with maximum temperatures reaching 83°F[5], the period in question only extends to April 1, so we're primarily concerned with March temperatures.

The weather data indicates that March in Guatemala is generally quite stable, with only about 3-8 days of rain expected[3]. However, the data doesn't explicitly mention cold fronts or temperature variations that might cause temperatures to dip below 80°F.

Given that March temperatures in Guatemala City hover right around the 80°F threshold, and considering the possibility of occasional cooler days, especially in early to mid-March, there is a reasonable chance that at least one day might fail to reach the 80°F mark.

The status quo suggests that most days in late March will reach or exceed 80°F, but the proximity to the threshold means that minor weather variations could cause temperatures to fall just short on certain days.

Probability: 35%
