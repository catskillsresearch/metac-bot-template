(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  
The August 2024 youth unemployment rate data for China will likely be published by the National Bureau of Statistics and Trading Economics by mid to late September 2024. As of September 6, 2024, the outcome should be known within about 1–4 weeks.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
In July 2024, China's youth unemployment rate (for ages 16–24, excluding students) was 17.1%—the highest since the current method was introduced[1][4]. The most recent trend was upward, marking the first increase since February 2024[1]. If this rate held steady into August 2024, the result would fall within the 17.0–18.0 range.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
A "No" outcome would require the August 2024 youth unemployment rate to be ≤17.0% or >18.0%.  
This might occur if:

- A sudden, strong labor market recovery happened, perhaps from unanticipated government stimulus or mass public sector hiring, pulling the rate down below 17.0%.
- Conversely, a sharp new shock—a major economic setback, fresh lockdowns, or a wave of layoffs—could drive the rate above 18.0%. However, such dramatic moves in a single month are rare.

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
A "Yes" outcome requires the August 2024 youth unemployment rate to be >17.0% and ≤18.0%.
This would be consistent with:

- Continuation of July's upward but moderate trend, with economic headwinds (slow job creation, persistent skills mismatch, a surge of 2024 graduates) keeping the rate elevated but stable[1][4][5].
- Policy measures (such as support for the property sector and stimulus) lacking sufficient time or force to significantly shift youth employment in either direction before the August survey[1][5].
- No new methodological changes in labor statistics reporting.

## Rationale

- **Recent Data:** The July rate was 17.1% (already within the specified range) and reflected a reversal from a previous downward trend[1][4].
- **Structural Problems:** China faces ongoing structural issues—skills mismatch, lack of private sector jobs for youth, and the aftereffects of a record 12 million new graduates in 2024 entering a weak labor market[1][5]. These factors tend to exert slow-changing, upward pressure on youth unemployment.
- **Policy and Macro Forces:** While Beijing has taken steps to support the economy (property sector support, easier monetary and fiscal policy), these measures generally take quarters, not weeks, to significantly shift labor market numbers[5].
- **Data Reporting:** There are no credible indications of a pending change in the reporting methodology for August 2024. The exclusion of students since late 2023 also reduces volatility in the indicator versus prior years[1].
- **Pace of Change:** Single-month moves of a full percentage point in this statistic are rare, especially outside crisis conditions. With the July rate at 17.1% and no evidence of a massive new shock or rapid improvement, the most likely scenario is for the August rate to remain inside the 17.0–18.0 range.

## Final Probability Forecast

**Probability: 80%**

This reflects the strong inertia of recent data and ongoing economic headwinds, suggesting the August 2024 youth unemployment rate will most likely be >17.0% and ≤18.0%, absent a major and unexpected economic or policy surprise[1][4][5].
