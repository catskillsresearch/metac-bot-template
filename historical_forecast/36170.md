(a) Time left until outcome: About 13 days (from March 19, 2025 to April 1, 2025)

(b) Status quo outcome: No impeachment proceedings have been formally initiated against President Zelensky by Ukraine's parliament as of March 19, 2025.

(c) No outcome scenario: The calls for impeachment remain isolated to Dubinsky and perhaps a small faction of opposition lawmakers, failing to gain broader support within the Verkhovna Rada. Given Ukraine's wartime situation, the majority of parliament members prioritize stability and unity rather than a potentially destabilizing impeachment process during an ongoing conflict with Russia.

(d) Yes outcome scenario: Dubinsky's calls for impeachment rapidly gain support among a significant portion of lawmakers, especially if further diplomatic incidents occur or if military setbacks intensify. An emergency parliamentary session is convened before April 1, and the formal impeachment process is initiated with the required votes, driven by mounting frustration over Ukraine's diplomatic isolation and war management.

Based on the information available, I assess that it is unlikely that Ukraine's parliament will initiate impeachment proceedings against President Zelensky before April 1, 2025. My analysis follows several key lines of reasoning:

First, while MP Oleksandr Dubinsky has vocally called for Zelensky's impeachment and an emergency parliamentary session, there's little evidence that his efforts have generated widespread support among other lawmakers[3][5]. The search results indicate that Dubinsky is described as "one of the few opposition figures who vocally attacked Zelensky," suggesting his position remains relatively isolated within parliament[5].

The timeframe is particularly significant here. As of March 19, 2025, there are less than two weeks remaining until the April 1 deadline. Impeachment is a complex constitutional process in Ukraine that requires substantial parliamentary support and procedural steps. The absence of any reported formal parliamentary action as of mid-March suggests there simply may not be enough time to organize and initiate proceedings, even if support were growing[3][4].

Furthermore, I note that even former President Petro Poroshenko, who has been sanctioned by authorities and would presumably have political motivations to oppose Zelensky, has publicly voiced support for the current president following the White House incident[5]. This suggests that despite diplomatic setbacks, there remains a degree of political unity in Ukraine, likely influenced by the ongoing war with Russia.

The war context is crucial - nations typically rally around leadership during existential conflicts, and impeachment proceedings could be viewed as dangerously destabilizing at such a critical juncture. While Dubinsky claims Zelensky has "lost the war," this appears to be a minority view at present based on the available information[4].

I must acknowledge uncertainty factors: the situation in Ukraine is dynamic, and further diplomatic failures or military setbacks could rapidly shift parliamentary sentiment. Additionally, the search results only provide information up to mid-March 2025, and political developments might have occurred after that date.

However, giving appropriate weight to the status quo and considering the significant procedural and political hurdles that would need to be overcome in a very short timeframe, I assess it as unlikely that formal impeachment proceedings will be initiated before April 1, 2025.

Probability: 15%
