(a) **Time until outcome known:**  
There are 20 days left until December 1, 2024.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changes:**  
Historically, California's 22nd Congressional District has taken a long time to be called, with the 2022 Democratic challenger conceding on November 22, 2022. Given California's slow vote-counting process and the district's competitiveness, the baseline expectation is that, unless results point quickly to a clear winner, a concession will happen late in November or potentially after December 1.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
If the vote count remains close through late November—with many mail-in ballots still being processed and no sufficiently clear margin to prompt a concession—neither candidate is likely to concede before December 1, 2024. This would mirror previous cycles in which concessions were delayed due to the need for nearly all ballots to be counted first.

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
If one candidate, likely the challenger, lags significantly in early counts or the margin grows steadily in favor of the incumbent, there may be enough certainty for a concession before December 1. This could occur if, for example, the trailing candidate concludes there is no viable path to victory as updated counts are published around mid-to-late November.

## Rationale

California's 22nd Congressional District is a highly competitive, majority-Latino district with a Cook PVI of R+1, making it essentially a toss-up[1]. Races here have been close, and due to California's vote-counting rules (accepting mail-in ballots postmarked by Election Day and counted over several weeks), elections are typically slow to resolve.

In 2022, the concession came on November 22, suggesting that, while slow, a concession before December is possible but not assured. The general pattern in California, especially in tight races, is for candidates to wait until a conclusive margin emerges—which often happens in the last week of November, but sometimes later.

A significant change in voting patterns, a landslide, or clear early results could accelerate a concession, but the strong default is that the outcome will not be clear well before December. The status quo—slow counts and close margins—should be weighted most highly in the forecast.

Probability: **60%**  
This reflects a modest lean toward a **No** outcome, given the precedent for late concessions in California’s 22nd and the state's slow counting process, but acknowledges that a concession before December remains plausible if the margin is decisive by late November[1].
