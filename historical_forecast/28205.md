Looking at this Boeing strike forecast question from the perspective of a professional forecaster:

(a) Time until outcome is known: 24 days (from May 6, 2025, looking back to September 30, 2024)

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: Yes - the strike continues through September 30, 2024

(c) Scenario for No outcome: Boeing and the Machinists union reach a compromise agreement before September 30, with Boeing offering better terms on compensation and possibly addressing pension concerns, leading to a ratification vote that ends the strike earlier than expected. The AP Strike Hub reports this resolution.

(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: Negotiations remain deadlocked, with significant gaps between Boeing's offers and union demands, particularly regarding compensation and pension benefits. Historical precedent of lengthy Boeing strikes (58 days in 2008) plays out, with neither side willing to compromise substantially within the first 17 days of the strike.

## Rationale

The Boeing machinists strike began on September 13, 2024, following an overwhelming rejection of Boeing's tentative agreement (94.6% voted against it with 96% supporting a strike)[1]. The question asks whether the strike will continue through September 30, which would be 17 days after it began.

Looking at the historical context, Boeing strikes tend to be lengthy affairs. The last full contract negotiation in 2008 resulted in a 58-day strike[3]. This suggests that a 17-day strike duration would actually be quite short by Boeing's historical standards.

The rejection of the proposed contract was decisive, with workers describing it as "insulting" and a "joke of a contract"[1]. The tentative agreement would have raised wages by 25% over four years but eliminated an annual bonus of 3-6% of wages. The strong negative reaction indicates a significant gap between what Boeing is offering and what workers expect.

Workers have been preparing financially for this strike[3], suggesting they're willing to hold out for a better deal. Managers have also been preparing for a prolonged work stoppage[3], indicating that Boeing anticipated and is ready for an extended strike.

The search results don't show any information about scheduled negotiation sessions or mediation efforts that might lead to an early resolution. When strikes have overwhelming support (96% in this case), they typically don't end quickly unless the employer makes substantial concessions.

However, I must consider that Boeing faces significant financial pressure. A 50-day strike could cost Boeing between $3 billion and $3.5 billion in cash flow, and the company is already dealing with reputation issues and financial losses[1]. These pressures could motivate Boeing to offer better terms sooner rather than later.

That said, the union appears prepared for a lengthy dispute. They plan to survey members to decide which issues to emphasize when negotiations resume[3], suggesting they're taking a methodical approach rather than rushing to resolve the strike.

Given the status quo bias (strikes, once begun, tend to continue until significant negotiation breakthroughs occur) and historical precedent of lengthy Boeing strikes, I believe it's more likely than not that this strike will continue through September 30.

Probability: 75%
