(a) The time left until the outcome is known: 39 days (from August 22 to October 1, 2024)

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed: Both Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles remain as Trump's campaign co-managers through October 1, 2024.

(c) A scenario for a No outcome: Trump maintains confidence in his current campaign leadership team despite bringing in additional advisors like Lewandowski. The campaign continues with its current structure as it moves into the final stretch of the election cycle, with both LaCivita and Wiles maintaining their positions through October 1.

(d) A scenario for a Yes outcome: Trump becomes increasingly dissatisfied with campaign performance, polling numbers, or strategic decisions. Following his historical pattern with previous campaign managers, he decides to demote or replace either LaCivita or Wiles before October 1, potentially elevating Lewandowski or another trusted advisor to a campaign management role.

Based on the available information, I need to assess the probability that either of Donald Trump's campaign managers will leave their positions before October 1, 2024. This requires analyzing both historical patterns and current circumstances.

Donald Trump has a documented history of changing campaign managers during his previous presidential runs. In 2016, he fired Corey Lewandowski in June and replaced him with Paul Manafort, who then resigned in August and was succeeded by Kellyanne Conway[1][2]. In 2020, Brad Parscale was demoted from campaign manager to senior advisor in July, with Bill Stepien taking over the role for the remainder of the campaign.

These historical patterns suggest Trump is willing to make significant campaign leadership changes when he feels it necessary. However, several factors indicate the current situation may be different:

First, the timing is important. We're in late August 2024, and previous campaign manager changes occurred in June or July of their respective election years. With only about 75 days until the general election when this assessment is being made, a major leadership change would create significant disruption during a critical period.

Second, recent developments show that rather than replacing his current campaign managers, Trump is expanding his team by bringing back Corey Lewandowski as an advisor[2]. This suggests an expansion strategy rather than a replacement strategy. LaCivita and Wiles themselves issued a joint statement about "continuing to add to our impressive campaign team," indicating they remain in leadership positions.

Third, while there have been media reports suggesting Trump was considering firing his campaign managers, these reports were subsequently softened, and the Trump campaign explicitly denied them, stating that rumors of Wiles or LaCivita being fired are "not rooted in reality."

Despite these stabilizing factors, several risk factors remain:

1. Trump has demonstrated willingness to make abrupt staffing changes throughout his political career
2. The recent hiring of Lewandowski, who previously served as campaign manager and reportedly authored "Let Trump Be Trump," could potentially position him for a larger role[2]
3. Campaign performance issues or strategic disagreements could emerge in the coming weeks

Given these considerations, I believe the probability of either LaCivita or Wiles leaving their positions before October 1 is lower than a simple extrapolation from historical patterns might suggest, but still significant given Trump's management style and the pressures of the campaign's final stretch.

I place extra weight on the status quo scenario (both managers remaining in their positions) because:
- The campaign is in its final critical phase where stability is typically valued
- The explicit denial from the campaign about potential changes
- The addition of Lewandowski as an advisor rather than as a replacement
- The lack of any credible reports indicating imminent changes as of August 22, 2024

Probability: 35%
