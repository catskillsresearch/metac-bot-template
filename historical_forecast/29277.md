(a) Time left until outcome: 8 days (from October 28, 2024 to November 5, 2024)

(b) Status quo outcome: No endorsement of Donald Trump by Riley Green

(c) No outcome scenario: Riley Green continues to maintain his current stance of not publicly endorsing any presidential candidate. He may choose to keep his political views private to avoid alienating fans or may simply not feel strongly enough about either candidate to make a public statement.

(d) Yes outcome scenario: Riley Green decides to make a public endorsement of Donald Trump in the final days before the election, perhaps at a rally or through social media, following the pattern of some other conservative country musicians or in response to a specific campaign event.

Based on the available information, I need to assess the likelihood of Riley Green endorsing Donald Trump before the November 5, 2024 election. 

Looking at the current evidence, there is no indication that Riley Green has endorsed Donald Trump as of October 28, 2024. The Country Music 2024 Presidential Endorsement Tracker, which was updated as of September 11, 2024, does not list Riley Green among artists supporting either Donald Trump or Kamala Harris[1]. This tracker appears to be comprehensive as it includes documentation for each endorsement listed.

While Riley Green is known to be conservative, being politically conservative does not automatically translate to a public endorsement. Many artists, regardless of their personal political leanings, choose to avoid making public endorsements to maintain their broad fan base.

The status quo strongly suggests no endorsement has been made, and with only 8 days remaining until the election, the window for making such an endorsement is narrowing. Most artists who intended to make endorsements likely would have done so already, given that early voting has been underway in many states and the campaign is in its final stages.

That said, last-minute endorsements do occur, particularly as campaigns make their final push for votes. If Riley Green were to endorse Trump, it would likely happen at a campaign event in a key swing state or through a social media announcement.

Given the lack of any indication that Riley Green is planning to make an endorsement, the short timeframe remaining, and the fact that many artists deliberately avoid political endorsements, I must give significant weight to the status quo continuing.

Probability: 15%
