(a) Time left until outcome: 32 days (from May 6, 2025 until December 8, 2024 - this is actually in the past)
(b) Status quo outcome: Based on historical patterns, Hudson Bay Mountain typically opens in late November to early December, so the status quo would be that the resort is open by December 8.
(c) Scenario for No outcome: Insufficient snowfall or unseasonably warm temperatures could delay opening, similar to the 2023 historic drought that caused delays. Technical issues with lifts or staffing shortages could also prevent opening by the target date.
(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: Normal seasonal snowfall patterns continue, allowing the resort to open on schedule. The resort might even benefit from early-season cold temperatures that enable sufficient snowmaking operations to supplement natural snow.

Based on the information available, I can provide a forecast about whether Hudson Bay Mountain ski resort will be open by December 8, 2024, as reported on On the Snow's Ski Report.

## Historical Opening Patterns

Hudson Bay Mountain's general operating season typically runs from late November to mid-April[4]. This established pattern suggests that under normal circumstances, the resort would be open by December 8, which falls within their standard operational timeframe.

The resort has already published their 2024/25 operational calendar according to their website, though specific opening dates aren't detailed in the available search results[1]. They have defined their holiday periods for the 2024/25 season, which begin on December 23, 2024, suggesting they plan to be operational before that date[3].

## Regional Context for 2024/25 Season

Looking at the broader Canadian ski industry, the 2024/25 ski season is projected to begin as early as November 5, 2024, for some resorts[2]. This provides context for the regional ski industry's operational timeline.

According to recent reports about the 2024/25 season openings, Hudson Bay Mountain in Smithers is specifically listed with a projected opening date of December 7, 2024[5]. This date is just one day before the resolution date in question, suggesting a high likelihood of being open on December 8.

## Weather and Operational Factors

The query notes that in 2023, a historic drought caused delays in Hudson Bay Mountain's opening. This historical precedent highlights that weather conditions can significantly impact the resort's ability to open on schedule. However, there is no indication in the search results of similar drought conditions affecting the 2024/25 season.

Other resorts in the region appear to be proceeding with their normal opening schedules. For example, Marmot Basin in Jasper was planning to open on November 15, 2024, despite having faced significant challenges from wildfire disruptions[5]. This suggests resilience in the regional ski industry and possibly favorable snow conditions.

## Status Quo Considerations

The status quo for Hudson Bay Mountain is to be operational by early December. Without specific information indicating a change from this pattern, and with their projected opening date of December 7 explicitly stated, it is reasonable to place significant weight on the resort being open by December 8.

Given that the resort has already published their operational calendar for the 2024/25 season and is actively promoting season passes[1], they appear to be proceeding with normal operations for the upcoming season.

## Uncertainty Factors

Despite the positive indicators, several uncertainties remain:
- Weather conditions can change rapidly in mountain regions
- Operational challenges could arise unexpectedly
- The specific details of current snow conditions at Hudson Bay Mountain are not provided in the search results

However, with their official projected opening date of December 7, 2024[5], the resort would need to face significant unexpected challenges to not be open by December 8.

Probability: 85%
