(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  
As of August 2, 2024, there are 60 days (about 2 months) until October 1, 2024.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
"Woman’s World" by Katy Perry is currently ranked #63 on the Billboard Hot 100. If the song maintains its recent trajectory (typical for non-viral, poorly received major pop releases), it will most likely drop in rank or stagnate, rather than climb significantly. Status quo result: the song does **not** reach higher than 15th place; the outcome is **No**.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
The song receives only modest or diminishing radio airplay, its streaming numbers remain underwhelming, and critical reception continues to dampen public enthusiasm. Even with some promotion, the song never exceeds its current peak and continues sliding down the chart. It never climbs above #63 and certainly not into the Top 15 before October 1. This is the most typical outcome for singles that debut outside the Top 40 with weak reviews and minimal organic momentum.

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
A major, unforeseen event dramatically boosts the song’s popularity. Examples include a viral TikTok dance trend, a high-profile, emotionally resonant use in a film or campaign, or a surprise live performance at a major TV event that captures the public’s attention. Additionally, if the Kamala Harris campaign sparks a surge of interest or if Perry's promotional TV appearances spark a national conversation, streaming and downloads could spike, causing the song to leap up the Hot 100—possibly into the Top 15. This scenario is plausible but would require a break from the current performance trajectory.

## Rationale

**Status quo and historical patterns** both strongly argue for a No. Songs debuting outside the Top 40, especially with negative reviews and weak early streaming, rarely surge into the Top 15. Billboard chart movement is heavily influenced by early momentum, streaming, and radio airplay, all of which are currently tepid for "Woman’s World." Katy Perry’s recent singles have struggled to reach the Top 15 even with better debuts. The planned promotions and political association are unlikely to compensate for the weak organic performance, barring a viral moment or substantial radio push that so far hasn’t materialized.

The **wild card** is the Harris campaign and Perry’s TV appearances in August, which could theoretically generate a surge. However, given the song’s reception and current numbers, these factors are likely to have a moderate rather than explosive effect.

**Professional forecasters overweight the status quo** because most of the time, trends persist unless major, observable changes occur. At present, there are no strong signals suggesting a radical departure from the current underperformance.
