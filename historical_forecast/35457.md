(a) Time left until outcome: 1 month and 22 days (from May 6, 2025 to March 28, 2025 - this is in the past)
(b) Status quo outcome: Based on February 2025 data, 91% of Nebraska's land area was experiencing moderate drought conditions, with northern and northwestern regions facing more severe conditions.
(c) No outcome scenario: Consistent precipitation during March 2025 significantly improved drought conditions, bringing the number of Nebraska residents in drought areas below 1.7 million.
(d) Yes outcome scenario: Drought conditions persisted or worsened from February through March 2025, maintaining or expanding the 91% of land area affected, resulting in 1.7 million or more Nebraska residents living in drought conditions.

As a professional forecaster, I need to analyze whether Nebraska had 1.7 million or more residents living in drought conditions on March 28, 2025, based on the information available before February 26, 2025.

## Current Drought Conditions (as of February 2025)

Nebraska was experiencing widespread drought conditions in early 2025:
- Moderate drought was affecting 91% of Nebraska's land area as of mid-February 2025[3]
- Northern and northwestern Nebraska were facing more severe conditions, with 48% of land in these regions experiencing severe or extreme drought[3]
- Only a small percentage of Nebraska was free from drought stress in February 2025

The drought situation had been worsening in early 2025, with degradation across the southern Panhandle and southwestern Nebraska[1]. Severe drought (D2) expanded into more counties, and moderate drought conditions were spreading across the state[1].

## Population Impact Assessment

Nebraska's total population is approximately 2 million residents. With 91% of the state's land area experiencing moderate drought or worse in February 2025, it's highly likely that a significant portion of the population was affected.

The drought's impact was particularly severe in northern and northwestern Nebraska, which includes several counties with substantial cattle operations. In 2023, ranchers had more than half a million head of cattle between Nebraska's Sioux, Dawes, Cherry, Box Butte, and Sheridan counties - all areas experiencing severe or extreme drought conditions in February 2025[3].

## Potential for Change by March 28, 2025

Several factors suggest the drought conditions were likely to persist through March 2025:

1. Multiple-year dryness: Experts noted that parts of Nebraska were experiencing "not just one year or two years, but multiple years of dryness"[3]

2. Setting up for spring deficit: "We can get through a dry fall and a dry winter, but it really means that we're setting the stage up for the spring already being behind in our precipitation"[3]

3. Need for consistent moisture: Researchers emphasized they would be looking for "consistent snowfall or rainfall over the next few months, not one or two weather events"[3]

4. La Niña possibility: A weak La Niña pattern had a 59% chance of developing in January 2025 and persisting through March 2025[4], which could influence precipitation patterns

## Counterbalancing Factors

There were some signs that conditions could improve:

1. Potential March rains: Experts noted that "a couple of good rains in March would likely eliminate or at least improve drought across much of south-central and eastern Nebraska"[5]

2. Seasonal precipitation patterns: Spring typically brings increased precipitation to Nebraska, which could alleviate some drought conditions

## Historical Context and Status Quo Bias

Drought conditions tend to develop slowly and resolve slowly. Given the multiple years of dryness mentioned by experts and the widespread nature of the drought in February 2025, significant improvement within one month would be unusual without exceptional precipitation.

The status quo in February 2025 was widespread drought affecting 91% of Nebraska's land area. Without substantial and consistent precipitation, this situation was likely to persist through March.

Considering Nebraska's population distribution, with the majority concentrated in eastern cities like Omaha and Lincoln, even if some eastern areas saw improvement, the widespread nature of the drought would still likely impact a substantial portion of Nebraska's population.
