(a) **Time left until outcome known:**  
There are just over one month left until April 1, 2025—the cutoff for an official election announcement per the resolution criteria.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changes:**  
If current information holds, the answer is *Yes*: Canada has already officially announced the date of the next federal election, set for Monday, April 28, 2025, and this information was available in authoritative public sources before April 1, 2025[3][4].  

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
A *No* outcome would occur if, despite published election information, no official body or government agency had actually made an authoritative announcement of a specific election date before April 1, 2025. This could happen if all references to April 28, 2025, were only projections or preparatory notes, not official government declarations, or if the government unexpectedly rescinded or revised the earlier notices before making a formal announcement.

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
A *Yes* outcome occurs if, before April 1, 2025, an official source—such as Elections Canada or the Government of Canada—publicly announces the specific date of the federal election. The published information from Elections Canada and the Parliament of Canada, both referencing the April 28, 2025, election date, strongly suggest such an announcement was made and publicly accessible before the cutoff[3][4].

## Rationale

Canadian law requires federal elections at least every four years, or sooner if a minority government loses confidence. Amidst leadership changes and speculation about a possible earlier vote, Elections Canada and the Parliament of Canada both listed April 28, 2025, as the scheduled date for the 45th General Election. These dates appeared in official communications, and the chief electoral authority publicly referenced this timing before April 1, 2025[3][4]. 

Advance voting dates are also published, further strengthening the evidence that a formal announcement had been made[4]. While there was speculation that a snap election could be called as early as March 10, 2025, no evidence currently suggests that a different (earlier) date was officially announced before April 1, 2025[2][4].

Given this, the default—*status quo*—outcome carries substantial weight. Authoritative government sources confirm a specific election date, widely disseminated before the deadline, satisfying the resolution criteria.

## Final Answer

Probability: 99%  
Canada will have officially announced a federal election before April 1, 2025, with the election scheduled for April 28, 2025[3][4].
