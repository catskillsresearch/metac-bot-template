(a) Time left until outcome: The outcome will be known when the fourth weekly balance sheet for December 2024 is released by the Federal Reserve, which will be approximately 7-8 months from now (from May 2025).

(b) Status quo outcome: Based on the most recent data from September 2024, the Federal Reserve's reverse repo facility usage had already dropped below $250 billion, with approximately $239.4 billion reported on September 16, 2024[3]. If this trend continues, the status quo outcome would be "Yes" - the reverse repurchase agreements would remain under $550 billion.

(c) Scenario for No outcome: A significant market liquidity crisis or financial instability event occurs in late 2024, causing financial institutions to rapidly increase their usage of the Fed's reverse repo facility as they seek safe places to park cash. This could push the balance above $550 billion by December 2024. Alternatively, the Federal Reserve could implement policy changes that make the reverse repo facility more attractive to counterparties, increasing participation rates.

(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: The current downward trend in reverse repo facility usage continues through the remainder of 2024, with financial institutions finding alternative investments for their cash as monetary policy stabilizes and market conditions remain relatively calm. The Fed maintains its current operational parameters for the facility, and usage remains well below the $550 billion threshold.

As a professional forecaster, I recognize that the Federal Reserve's reverse repo facility has shown a significant downward trend throughout 2023 and 2024. By September 2024, the usage had already fallen below $250 billion, with $239.4 billion reported on September 16, 2024[3]. This represents a substantial decline from previous periods and indicates a clear direction.

The reverse repo facility is used by banks, government-sponsored enterprises, and money market funds to make overnight cash investments with the Federal Reserve, receiving Treasury securities as collateral[5]. This facility serves as a tool for implementing monetary policy and helping keep the federal funds rate within the target range set by the Federal Open Market Committee[2].

Several factors support the continuing decline in usage:

1. The September 18, 2024 Implementation Note from the Federal Reserve maintained standing overnight repurchase agreement operations with an aggregate operation limit of $500 billion[4], suggesting no policy changes aimed at increasing usage.

2. As monetary policy stabilizes and alternative investment opportunities become more attractive, financial institutions naturally reduce their reliance on the reverse repo facility.

3. The recent trend shows a consistent decline, with no indications of a reversal as of September 2024.

I must account for potential risks that could increase usage, such as:
- Market volatility or financial stress events
- Unexpected policy changes by the Federal Reserve
- Seasonal fluctuations in liquidity needs

However, the status quo strongly suggests continuing decline or stabilization at lower levels. Given that the current level was already below $250 billion in September 2024, it would require a substantial reversal of the trend to exceed $550 billion by December 2024.

Putting extra weight on the status quo outcome, as the world typically changes slowly, and considering the significant buffer between the September 2024 level ($239.4 billion) and the threshold in question ($550 billion), I believe there is a high probability that reverse repurchase agreements will remain under $550 billion at the end of December 2024.

Probability: 85%
