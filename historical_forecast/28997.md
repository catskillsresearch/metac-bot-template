(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
As of the cutoff date (October 21, 2024), there are just over two months remaining until January 1, 2025, when this question will be resolved.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changes:**  
No senolytic therapy is approved by the FDA for commercial sale in the US for the purpose of selectively removing senescent cells[1][2][3][4][5]. The status quo outcome is therefore **No**—no approval granted.

(c) **Brief scenario for a No outcome:**  
Clinical trials of senolytic agents (such as dasatinib and quercetin) continue at the current pace, with most studies in phase 1 or early phase 2 and no submission of a new drug application (NDA) to the FDA as a senolytic therapy. No late-stage (phase 3) results are available, and there are no major public signals from the FDA or pharmaceutical companies about imminent approval[1][2][3][4]. Thus, no senolytic therapy is approved by January 1, 2025.

(d) **Brief scenario for a Yes outcome:**  
A company completes all required clinical phases and submits a compelling NDA for a senolytic therapy, demonstrating both efficacy and safety, and the FDA reviews and approves the therapy within the remaining time window. Alternatively, an existing drug is rapidly repurposed and receives breakthrough, accelerated, or emergency approval for a new indication as a senolytic, based on extraordinary results and regulatory flexibility. However, current reporting does not indicate any such scenario is underway[1][2][3][4].

## Rationale
- The most advanced senolytic agents (notably dasatinib and quercetin or their combination) are still in early-phase clinical trials for age-related indications such as Alzheimer’s disease[1][2][3][4]. 
- These trials have focused on safety and feasibility, not yet demonstrating the robust clinical benefit required for FDA approval in their intended “senolytic” use[1][2].
- There is no record of a New Drug Application (NDA) for a senolytic therapy pending or under priority review by the FDA as of October 2024[1][2][3][4].
- Dasatinib is FDA-approved, but only for leukemia—not as a senolytic. Quercetin is available as a supplement, not as a prescription drug for any indication[1][3][5].
- No leading candidate is at a stage where approval before January 1, 2025, is plausible without an extremely rapid, unprecedented acceleration of regulatory pathways[1][2][3][4].

Given the slow pace of drug development, the status quo is likely to persist through the small remaining window. There is no sign of pending regulatory change or an exceptional acceleration in this therapeutic area.

## Final Answer

Probability: 1%  

There is overwhelming evidence to support the No outcome, with only a negligible chance of a disruptive or unanticipated approval before the deadline.
