As a professional forecaster interviewing for this position, I'll analyze whether FBI firearms background checks will exceed 2.6M for November 2024.

(a) Time left until outcome: Approximately 6 months. The data for November 2024 will likely be reported in early December 2024.

(b) Status quo outcome: Based on the most recent data available, the unadjusted NICS figure for November 2023 was 2,652,870 checks, which exceeds the 2.6M threshold[5]. If nothing changes, we might expect a similar or slightly higher number in November 2024.

(c) Scenario for No outcome: Economic downturn reduces discretionary spending on firearms; absence of major political developments that typically drive gun purchases; potential implementation of stricter gun regulations that deter purchases; or continuation of the post-2020 downward trend in firearm background checks.

(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: Seasonal holiday shopping combined with the recently observed upward year-over-year trend continues; political tensions around the November 2024 presidential election drive increased firearm purchases; Black Friday sales match or exceed the record-setting performance noted in November 2023[5].

## Historical Analysis

Looking at the available data, November has historically been a high-volume month for firearm background checks. The search results indicate that November 2023 had 2,652,870 unadjusted NICS checks, which exceeded the 2.6M threshold we're forecasting for November 2024[5]. 

The data shows some fluctuation in recent years. November 2023's unadjusted figure (2,652,870) represented a 5.6% decline from November 2022 (2,788,138)[5]. This was actually noted as "the lowest number of checks processed for any November going back to 2018"[5]. However, when adjusted to remove permit checks and rechecks, November 2023 showed a 5% increase over November 2022 in terms of likely actual gun sales[5].

## Seasonal Factors

November consistently shows strong firearm background check numbers due to several factors:

1. Black Friday sales: November 2023 included "the largest number of NICS checks conducted on Black Friday since the system was established in 1998"[5].

2. Holiday shopping: The fourth quarter (October-December) typically sees higher firearms sales as part of holiday gift purchasing.

3. Hunting season: Many regions have active hunting seasons in November, which can drive firearm purchases.

## Recent Trends

The query mentions that "Starting in July 2024, year-over-year monthly numbers have again begun trending upward." This is a critical piece of information suggesting that after the post-2020 decline, we're seeing renewed growth in background checks.

The adjusted NICS figure for November 2023 (1,595,476) was described as "a very strong indicator of a vibrant demand for lawful firearm ownership"[5]. If the upward trend continues through 2024, we could reasonably expect November 2024 to exceed November 2023's numbers.

## Political Context

November 2024 coincides with the U.S. presidential election. Historically, firearms sales often increase during election periods due to concerns about potential changes in gun legislation. This political factor could significantly boost November 2024 numbers above typical levels.

## Weighing the Evidence

Factors supporting exceeding 2.6M checks:
- Recent upward trend in year-over-year monthly numbers since July 2024
- November 2023 already exceeded 2.6M in unadjusted figures (2,652,870)[5]
- Presidential election potentially driving increased purchases
- Strong Black Friday sales tradition for firearms

Factors against exceeding 2.6M checks:
- The long-term trend since 2020 had been downward until recently
- Economic uncertainties could reduce discretionary spending
- The recent upward trend is still new and could reverse

## Accounting for Status Quo

As a good forecaster, I should give significant weight to the status quo. The most recent comparable data point (November 2023) showed 2,652,870 unadjusted background checks[5], which is already above our 2.6M threshold. Combined with the reported upward trend in 2024, this suggests a high probability of exceeding the threshold.

However, I must account for uncertainty and the possibility of trend reversals. While the threshold was exceeded in November 2023, the margin wasn't enormous (about 2% above the threshold), leaving limited room for decline while still meeting the criteria.

Probability: 75%
