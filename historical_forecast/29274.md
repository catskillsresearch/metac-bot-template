As a professional forecaster interviewing for this position, I'll analyze whether Mayor Brandon Scott will receive 70% of the vote in the 2024 Baltimore mayoral election.

(a) Time until outcome: Approximately 6 months. The election will be held on November 5, 2024, and we are currently in May 2024.

(b) Status quo outcome: Based on the 2020 election, Scott received 70.5% of the vote. If nothing changed, we might expect a similar outcome.

(c) Scenario resulting in No: Scott's approval ratings, which were as low as 37% in late 2023, don't recover enough by election day. Voter dissatisfaction with his handling of crime, schools, and city services leads to lower turnout among his supporters, while opposition voters remain motivated. This results in Scott winning but with less than 70% of the vote.

(d) Scenario resulting in Yes: Scott's recent surge in approval (up to 46% by April 2024) continues to grow through the summer and fall. His successful response to the Key Bridge collapse, combined with improvements in the economy and reduced homicides, regenerates enthusiasm among his base. His strong performance in the Democratic primary against Sheila Dixon translates to overwhelming support in the general election, pushing him above the 70% threshold.

Now, for my analysis:

Looking at the available information, there are several key factors to consider in this forecast.

First, Scott was elected with 70.5% in 2020, just barely above our 70% threshold. This suggests that even small changes in voter sentiment could push him below this mark.

The polling data shows significant volatility in Scott's approval ratings. In late 2023, his approval was at a concerning 37%, with 57% disapproving. This would typically spell trouble for an incumbent seeking reelection. However, by April 2024, his approval had improved to 46%, with disapproval at 47%, showing a narrowing gap.

The Democratic primary results are particularly telling. According to the search results, Scott defeated former mayor Sheila Dixon in what was described as a "closely contested" race. The April 2024 poll showed Scott with 40% support among likely Democratic voters compared to Dixon's 32%. This competitive primary suggests Scott faces some significant challenges within his own party.

While Baltimore is heavily Democratic, making the primary "tantamount to victory," the general election dynamics will be different. According to the Wikipedia entry, Scott did ultimately defeat Republican Shannon Wright in the November 5, 2024 general election. However, the precinct-level results show varying levels of support ranging from 50-60% in some areas to over 90% in others.

What's particularly noteworthy is that Scott's path to victory involved "running up massive margins in Baltimore's majority-white precincts while running close to Dixon in its majority-Black areas." This pattern suggests a potentially divided electorate.

The status quo would favor Scott reaching 70%, as he achieved this in 2020. However, good forecasting recognizes that while the world changes slowly, there have been meaningful shifts during Scott's first term:

1. His approval ratings dropped significantly before recovering somewhat.
2. He faced a strong primary challenge from Dixon.
3. His support appears to be geographically and demographically uneven.

The search results also mention that Scott became "the first mayor to win re-election to a second term since Martin O'Malley." This suggests Baltimore voters have historically been reluctant to give mayors second terms, indicating potential voter dissatisfaction with city leadership generally.

While Scott's trajectory shows improvement leading up to the election, starting from such a low approval rating (37%) makes it challenging to reach the 70% threshold. The competitive primary and his need to run stronger in some demographic areas than others indicates potential weaknesses in his coalition.

Given the information available, I believe Scott will win reelection comfortably but fall short of the 70% threshold. His improved performance on crime and his response to the Key Bridge collapse have helped his standing, but the divided nature of his support base and his previous approval challenges suggest he will not reach the same level of support as in 2020.

Probability: 35%
