(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
The Super Bowl halftime show is scheduled for February 9, 2025, which is three days from today (February 6, 2025).

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changes:**  
Kendrick Lamar is the only announced headliner, with SZA as the only confirmed guest[1][2][3][4][5]. No credible source has suggested Rihanna, Jay-Z, or Beyoncé will appear. Therefore, current information points to "No"—they will not appear.

(c) **Scenario that results in a No outcome:**  
Kendrick Lamar and SZA perform the halftime show, and no other artists—specifically, neither Rihanna, Jay-Z, nor Beyoncé—make any appearance (including remotely or pre-recorded) during the official broadcast. This scenario aligns with all presently available announcements and reporting[1][2][3][4][5].

(d) **Scenario that results in a Yes outcome:**  
Rihanna, Jay-Z, or Beyoncé appears at any time during the official broadcast of the halftime show—either in person, remotely, or in a pre-recorded segment. This could occur as an unannounced, surprise guest appearance, which, while not impossible, is highly unlikely for artists of their stature without any leaks or rumors this close to the event.

---

**Rationale:**  
The NFL and Roc Nation have sometimes kept surprise guests under wraps, but artists as prominent as Rihanna, Jay-Z, or Beyoncé typically generate leaks or substantial rumors if involved. All authoritative sources confirm only Kendrick Lamar and SZA are slated to perform[1][2][3][4][5]. Jay-Z remains involved as a producer, not a listed performer[2]. While surprise appearances are not unprecedented, the absence of any credible rumors makes such an outcome very unlikely. Historically, last-minute superstar additions are extremely rare at the Super Bowl.

**Probability:** 2%
