(a) Time until outcome is known: 4 months and 25 days from now (from May 6, 2025 to October 1, 2024)

(b) Status quo outcome: If nothing changed, Kamala Harris's net favorability would remain around -8.5, resulting in a No outcome.

(c) Scenario for No outcome: Harris continues to be associated with unpopular administration policies, particularly on immigration. Economic concerns persist, and she fails to effectively distinguish herself from Biden's low approval ratings during the campaign.

(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: Harris benefits from increased visibility during an active presidential campaign, successfully communicates her vision independent of Biden, and gains support particularly among Democratic-leaning independents as the election approaches. Campaign momentum and direct voter engagement improve her favorability ratings.

Based on the available data and historical trends, I need to assess whether Vice President Kamala Harris's net favorability rating will exceed -8 by October 1, 2024. This requires careful analysis of her current standing, historical patterns, and potential shifts in public opinion over the coming months.

According to FiveThirtyEight's polling data from June 2023, Harris had an approval rating of 39.4% and a disapproval rating of 52.3%, resulting in a net favorability of approximately -12.9[2]. This represents a significant gap that would need to be closed to exceed the -8 threshold.

## Historical Context and Trends

Harris's favorability has historically been challenging. The search results indicate that her net favorability has been lower than several former vice presidents including Mike Pence, Joe Biden, Dick Cheney, and Al Gore[1]. Her ratings appear to have declined notably after she was tasked with addressing immigration issues, which has been a difficult policy area for the administration[1].

It's worth noting that Harris's approval rating has been somewhat tied to President Biden's overall job approval[1]. In late 2021, Harris's approval rating was at 42.7% while Biden's was at 43.7%, with Biden's disapproval at 51% at that time[1]. This suggests a close relationship between their respective approvals, though Harris has typically rated slightly lower.

## Factors That Could Influence the Outcome

Several factors could affect Harris's favorability by October 2024:

**Negative Factors:**
- Persistent association with challenging policy areas like immigration
- The apparent historical trend of Harris having lower favorability than her predecessors
- Potential continued linkage to Biden administration policies that remain unpopular

**Positive Factors:**
- The campaign period typically offers opportunities for candidates to reintroduce themselves to voters
- Harris will likely have increased media presence and opportunities to directly communicate with voters
- The dynamics of a presidential campaign could create momentum and rally support from Democratic voters

## Statistical Considerations

When making a forecast, I should consider base rates and the tendency for political approval ratings to revert to historical means. Vice presidential approval ratings typically hover in a certain range, and substantial deviations tend to be temporary.

Additionally, I need to account for the status quo bias - the tendency for conditions to remain relatively stable absent major interventions or events. Harris's net favorability has been below -8 for some time, suggesting that crossing this threshold would require a meaningful shift in public perception.

## Weighing the Evidence

While Harris will benefit from increased visibility during the presidential campaign and potential opportunities to distinguish herself from Biden's low approval ratings, the historical data suggests she faces an uphill battle to exceed a -8 net favorability by October 1, 2024.

The gap between her last recorded net favorability (-12.9) and the threshold (-8) is significant but not insurmountable in a campaign environment. However, given the persistence of her negative ratings and the historical data showing consistently lower favorability compared to other vice presidents, I must assign a higher probability to the status quo scenario.

Probability: 35%
