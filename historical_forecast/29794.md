(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
At today's date, November 8, 2024, there are just under 2 months (approximately 54 days) until January 1, 2025, when the relevant Forbes Real-Time Billionaires rankings will be observed to resolve this question.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
If rankings and net worth levels remain exactly as observed on November 6, 2024, the gap between Elon Musk and the second-richest individual (Jeff Bezos) would be $48.2 billion—well under the $100 billion threshold.

(c) **Scenario that results in a No outcome:**  
Everything continues as it has: Tesla and SpaceX stock prices remain stable or move only modestly, and neither Elon Musk’s nor his closest rivals’ net worths experience extraordinary volatility. The gap remains large but less than $100 billion, reflecting the pattern of 2024, with the top positions closely clustered and the differences typically within $40–$60 billion.

(d) **Scenario that results in a Yes outcome:**  
A dramatic and unusual event occurs: either Tesla’s share price surges by more than 50% (adding $100 billion or more to Musk’s wealth) while competitors’ fortunes stagnate or decline, or key rivals like Jeff Bezos or Bernard Arnault experience a sharp decline in net worth due to a collapse in the value of Amazon or LVMH, or face unexpected divestitures or legal issues. No such events are currently forecasted or hinted at in recent news[1][2].

## Rationale

The gap between the net worth of Elon Musk and his nearest competitor has not approached $100 billion in recent years. The richest ranks have been dynamic, with Musk, Bezos, and Arnault alternating in the top spot throughout 2024, but the differences have generally been less than $50 billion[1]. There are no pending corporate actions, stock market catalysts, or macroeconomic signals suggesting a drastic repricing of relevant assets in the next two months[1][2].

Sharp moves of the necessary scale ($100 billion differential) are exceedingly rare. Even when Tesla’s stock was at its all-time highs, the largest historical gaps were modestly above the current year’s range and still did not break the $100 billion mark[1][2]. The probability of an extreme, outlier event (such as Tesla’s price doubling in a matter of weeks or Amazon collapsing by half) is low in such a short time frame, absent any known triggers.

As is typical in forecasting, the best estimate is that the present dynamic will continue, and the gap will not suddenly double in size. Good forecasters place extra weight on the status quo, unless compelling, specific evidence warrants a fundamental change.

## Final Answer

Probability: 5%
