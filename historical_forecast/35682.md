(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
As of March 5, 2025, there are about 27 days (just under one month) until April 1, 2025, when the official outcome will be determined.

(b) **Outcome if nothing changed:**  
The most recent concrete figure for registered Syrian refugees in Jordan is "around 675,000" as of January 2025, with 550,000 living in communities and 125,000 in camps[4]. This figure comes from the UNHCR Country Factsheet published on March 4, 2025, but is based on January data. If nothing changes, this number remains at 675,000.

(c) **Outcome if the current trend continued:**  
Since the fall of the Assad regime in December 2024, UNHCR has reported a significant uptick in voluntary returns—over 125,000 Syrians have returned home from Jordan since December 8, 2024[5]. The number of registered Syrians was approximately 660,000 shortly before this flow[5]. The pace of returns in January suggests a monthly outflow of about 50,000 refugees. If the return rate slowed after the initial surge, a conservative estimate is that another 10,000–20,000 will leave by April 1, 2025. Continuing this trend, the expected number would be around 655,000–665,000.

(d) **Expectations of experts and markets:**  
UNHCR projects that up to 1.5 million Syrian refugees across the region could return in 2025, with the Jordanian outflow being a significant component[2]. However, returns tend to be front-loaded after major political shifts, and most refugees require time and resources to organize voluntary returns. Experts anticipate ongoing returns but not at the rate seen immediately after the regime’s fall; therefore, a total just below the January figure (but not dramatically lower) is widely expected.

(e) **Unexpected scenario for a low outcome:**  
An unexpected dramatic improvement in the security and economic situation within Syria—such as a massive influx of international reconstruction aid or a new amnesty—could rapidly accelerate returns, lowering the registered refugee count in Jordan to below 650,000 by April 1, 2025.

(f) **Unexpected scenario for a high outcome:**  
A sudden deterioration in Syria’s situation (e.g., renewed violence, humanitarian crisis, or political instability), or restrictive changes in Jordan’s border or return policies, could stall or reverse returns. In this case, the registered refugee count could remain at or slightly above the January 2025 figure, potentially even increasing if some unregistered Syrians seek formal protection.
