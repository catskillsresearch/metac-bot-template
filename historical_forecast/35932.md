(a) Time until outcome known: 26 days (March 14, 2025 to April 1, 2025)
(b) Status quo outcome: "In progress" - not yet marked complete
(c) No outcome scenario: The Project 2025 Tracker maintainers determine that despite regulatory changes, the objective hasn't been fully achieved because some cryptocurrency regulations remain in place or the changes aren't comprehensive enough.
(d) Yes outcome scenario: The Project 2025 Tracker maintainers determine that the January executive order and subsequent SEC actions (closing investigations, declassifying memecoins as securities) constitute sufficient regulatory reduction to mark the objective complete.

The question asks whether the Project 2025 Tracker will mark the objective of "reducing regulations on cryptocurrencies" as complete by April 1, 2025. Currently, this objective is marked as "in progress," and we need to determine if it will change status in the next 26 days.

Since January 2025, the Trump administration has taken several concrete steps that demonstrate significant progress toward reducing cryptocurrency regulations. On January 23, 2025, President Trump signed an executive order aimed at "providing regulatory clarity and certainty" with a new approach to crypto regulation and enforcement[1]. This represents a formal policy shift at the highest level of government.

Following this executive order, several important developments occurred:
- On February 4, an SEC task force outlined plans to address cryptocurrency regulation and criticized the previous administration's policies[1]
- On February 21, the SEC closed investigations into Opensea and Robinhood without action and dismissed claims against Coinbase[1]
- On February 27, the SEC announced that memecoins would no longer be considered securities subject to SEC oversight[1]

Additionally, on March 6, 2025, President Trump established a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, further demonstrating the administration's pro-cryptocurrency stance[3].

Despite these deregulatory actions, some enforcement continues. On February 24, cryptocurrency exchange OKX pled guilty to operating an unlicensed money business and agreed to pay significant fines[1]. Private litigation against crypto exchanges and issuers also continues[1].

As a forecaster, I must consider that the status quo is "in progress," and things tend to change slowly. However, the evidence suggests substantial movement toward completing this objective:

1. Multiple concrete regulatory reductions have already occurred
2. The administration has clearly signaled its intent through executive orders
3. There are still 26 days until April 1st for additional actions to be taken

The primary uncertainty is what threshold the Project 2025 Tracker uses to determine when the objective is "complete." Given the significant regulatory rollbacks already implemented, it seems likely that the objective will be marked complete by April 1st, especially considering the executive order and multiple SEC actions directly reducing regulatory oversight.

Still, I must account for the possibility that the Tracker maintainers might require additional specific actions or more comprehensive deregulation before marking it complete.

Probability: 75%
