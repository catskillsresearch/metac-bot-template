I'll analyze whether bluebird bio will file for bankruptcy before April 1, 2025, considering all available information.

(a) Time left: The outcome will be known in less than a month (from May 6, 2025 to April 1, 2025). However, since we're analyzing this from a past perspective (May 2025), the outcome is already determined.

(b) Status quo outcome: Based on the February 21, 2025 acquisition announcement, bluebird bio avoided bankruptcy through a buyout by Carlyle and SK Capital Partners.

(c) Scenario for No outcome: The acquisition deal announced in February 2025 successfully closed before April 1, 2025, allowing bluebird to avoid bankruptcy filing despite its severe financial distress.

(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: The acquisition deal fell through due to regulatory issues, shareholder rejection, or other complications, forcing bluebird to file for bankruptcy protection before April 1, 2025.

Looking at the evidence, bluebird bio was clearly in severe financial distress before the acquisition announcement. The company had implemented a major restructuring in September 2024, cutting 25% of its workforce and attempting to reduce operating expenses by 20%[1]. Financial analysis indicated that the company had a very high probability of bankruptcy, with its chance of financial distress estimated at over 79%[3].

However, on February 21, 2025, bluebird bio announced that it would be acquired by funds managed by Carlyle and SK Capital Partners for approximately $30 million[2]. This acquisition was described as the "only viable solution" for the company, which was at risk of defaulting on its debts without a "significant infusion of capital"[4]. The CEO explicitly stated that "as our financial challenges mounted, it became clear that securing the right strategic partner was critical"[4].

The search results from March 7, 2025, show that the acquisition was moving forward, though the final price had been reduced from an initially reported $100 million to just $29 million[5]. This suggests that while the terms may have been adjusted, the acquisition was proceeding.

Given that the acquisition was announced in February 2025 and was still being discussed in March 2025, it appears that bluebird bio found a path to avoid bankruptcy through this acquisition. The search results do not indicate that the deal fell through or that bankruptcy proceedings were initiated before April 1, 2025.

The status quo evidence suggests that the acquisition saved bluebird bio from bankruptcy. While the company was clearly in dire financial straits—having gone from a "$10 billion company during the heyday of gene therapy to being sold for a measly $2"[5]—the acquisition appears to have prevented a formal bankruptcy filing.

Probability: 5%
