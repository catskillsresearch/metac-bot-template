(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
The question will resolve on or after April 1, 2025. As today is March 6, 2025, there are approximately 3½ weeks left until the outcome is confirmed.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
In 2024, the rate of unruly passenger incidents per 10,000 flights consistently exceeded the long-term average of 1.818. For instance, in 2023 the rate was about 2.08 per 10,000 flights, and in 2024, over 1,240 cases had been reported by August, showing continued elevated rates[2][3]. Unless there was a dramatic and unprecedented drop in the first quarter of 2025, it is highly likely that the weekly rate continued to exceed 1.818 for at least one week before April 1, 2025.

(c) **Scenario for a No outcome:**  
A No outcome would require a sudden and sustained, sharp decrease in unruly incidents beginning in 2025—such that for every week before April 1, 2025, the reported rate remained below 1.818 per 10,000 flights. This outcome could occur if there was an immediate and extremely effective intervention (e.g., drastic new security protocols or a large reduction in total flights leading to a suppressed numerator and inflated denominator), neither of which is indicated in recent FAA reports[1][2][3].

(d) **Scenario for a Yes outcome:**  
A Yes outcome would occur if, for any week between now and April 1, 2025, the FAA’s reported rate of unruly passenger incidents per 10,000 flights exceeds 1.818. Given the persistent elevated rates throughout 2024 and early 2025, and no evidence of a dramatic decline, this scenario aligns with the recent trend and is highly probable[2][3].

## Rationale

Historical data show that incident rates have consistently exceeded the long-term average since 2021, even as they declined from the pandemic peak[2][3]. News and official FAA updates indicate that, as of late 2024, rates continued to be a concern, and no evidence suggests a sharp change downward leading into early 2025[2][3]. In the absence of any reporting or policy change that would affect case rates or reporting standards, the most likely outcome is that the threshold was exceeded for at least one week before April 1, 2025.
