Based on the information provided, I need to assess whether Texas will have 15.0 million or more residents living in drought conditions on March 28, 2025.

(a) Time left until outcome: The outcome will be known in about 7 weeks (from May 6, 2025 to March 28, 2025, which has already passed).

(b) Status quo outcome: Based on the search results, a significant portion of Texas was experiencing drought conditions as of January 2025. However, the exact number of residents affected is not specified in the search results.

(c) Scenario for No outcome: If recent rainfall trends continue and drought conditions improve across Texas between January and March 2025, fewer than 15.0 million residents would be living in drought-affected areas by March 28, 2025. The January 2025 drought report indicated a decrease in drought coverage in the South region compared to December[1], suggesting a potential improving trend.

(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: If drought conditions persist or worsen in populated areas of Texas, 15.0 million or more residents could be affected by March 28, 2025. The 2022 Texas Water Plan indicates significant water supply concerns and growing population pressures[5], which could exacerbate drought impacts in populated regions.

## Analysis of Current Drought Conditions

As of January 2025, moderate to exceptional drought covered 25.9% of the South region, which includes Texas, representing a decrease from December 2024[1]. However, we don't have specific data on what percentage of Texas itself was under drought conditions or how many residents were affected.

The search results indicate that Texas is facing significant water challenges. The state's population is booming while water resources are strained[5]. According to the 2022 Texas Water Plan, the state's population is projected to increase by 73% by 2070, while existing water supplies are expected to decline by 18%[5]. This suggests a worsening water situation over time, though the short-term outlook is less clear.

## Factors Affecting the Forecast

1. **Recent Trends**: The drought report from January 2025 shows some improvement in drought conditions in the South region[1]. This could indicate a positive trend that might continue into March.

2. **Population Distribution**: Texas has a large population, with major urban centers potentially falling within drought-affected regions. However, the search results don't provide specific information about population distribution relative to drought areas.

3. **Water Infrastructure Challenges**: Texas is experiencing "severe growing pains" in terms of water infrastructure according to water experts[5]. This suggests that even with some precipitation, water delivery systems may remain strained.

4. **Climate Patterns**: The search results mention high evaporative demand in parts of the Southwest during 2024[4], which could continue into 2025, potentially maintaining drought conditions even with normal precipitation.

## Status Quo Consideration

Given the limited information in the search results, I need to be cautious about extrapolating to March 2025. The most recent information indicates some improvement in drought conditions in the broader South region[1], but Texas-specific data is limited. Without knowing the exact number of Texas residents currently living in drought conditions, it's difficult to determine the status quo precisely.

The Texas population issue is significant - the state is experiencing population growth that is straining water resources[5], suggesting that even if drought conditions improve slightly, the number of people affected might remain high due to population concentration in affected areas.

Considering the available information and giving weight to the status quo (some improvement in drought conditions but ongoing water challenges), I believe there's a moderate chance that 15.0 million or more Texas residents will be living in drought conditions on March 28, 2025.

Probability: 60%
