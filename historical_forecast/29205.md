I'll analyze this forecasting question as a professional forecaster would:

(a) Time left until outcome: About 2 months (from current date May 6, 2025 until January 1, 2025)

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changes: YouTube remains available in Russia with significant slowdowns and partial restrictions, but no official ban.

(c) No outcome scenario: Russia continues its current strategy of throttling and restricting YouTube access without implementing a full ban. The government maintains this approach to avoid public backlash while still pressuring Google, ultimately keeping YouTube technically accessible though degraded through January 1, 2025.

(d) Yes outcome scenario: Russia officially announces a complete YouTube ban through Roskomnadzor before January 1, 2025, citing national security concerns, refusal of Google to comply with Russian content removal demands, and the readiness of domestic alternatives like Rutube and VK video.

Based on my analysis of the evidence and current trends, I assess the probability of Russia officially banning YouTube before January 1, 2025 as follows:

The evidence strongly suggests Russia is on a path toward banning YouTube. Since July 2024, Russian authorities have been actively suppressing YouTube traffic nationwide, with millions of users experiencing significant access problems by August 2024[1][5]. These disruptions appear to be deliberate government actions rather than technical issues, with officials claiming YouTube was being "punished" for violations of Russian legislation[1].

YouTube remains the last major free social media platform in Russia with over 93 million users, serving as a critical source of uncensored information[2]. The Russian government has long been in conflict with the platform over content removal, with multiple experts describing a ban as "not a question of if but when"[2].

Several factors support an imminent ban:

1. The systematic escalation of restrictions throughout 2024, moving from scattered disruptions to nationwide throttling[1][5].
2. Active government preparation of domestic alternatives like Rutube and VK video[3].
3. The precedent of banning other Western platforms like Instagram.
4. Explicit warnings from Roskomnadzor to internet providers about facilitating YouTube access[5].

However, there are reasons to believe the ban might be delayed beyond January 1, 2025:

1. YouTube's enormous popularity in Russia (93 million users) creates potential for significant public backlash[2].
2. Technical challenges in completely blocking such a high-bandwidth platform[2].
3. The status quo of throttling may achieve many of the government's goals without the political cost of a full ban.

The Russian government appears to be implementing a gradual approach, slowly degrading service while building domestic alternatives, which suggests they may extend this transition period beyond January 1, 2025 to minimize disruption and opposition.

Given the evidence of deliberate government action against YouTube, expert assessments that a ban is inevitable, but acknowledging the potential for delay due to YouTube's popularity and technical challenges, I assess:

Probability: 70%
