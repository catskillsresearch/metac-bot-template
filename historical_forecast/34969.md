(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
Approximately 1.5 months remain until April 1, 2025.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
As of February 13, 2025, the US has not officially announced the withdrawal of at least half of its troops from Syria. If there is no change, the answer will be "No."

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
Despite ongoing Pentagon planning, no official decision or announcement is made before April 1, 2025. Institutional resistance, security concerns (such as ISIS activity), or shifting priorities delay or halt any public move toward a major withdrawal. Vague statements of intent are made, but no concrete plan is officially set in motion.

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
The US government—via the Department of Defense, White House, or CENTCOM—formally announces a specific plan to withdraw at least 1,000 out of the roughly 2,000 troops stationed in Syria, or begins the withdrawal itself, before April 1, 2025. This would satisfy the question’s resolution criteria.

## Rationale

Recent reporting confirms that the Pentagon is drafting plans for a full US troop withdrawal from Syria, spurred by renewed interest from President Trump and his administration[1][5]. Draft timelines under consideration (30, 60, or 90 days) would—if a decision is made soon—allow for action or an announcement before April 2025[1][5].

However, US defense officials emphasize that no final decision has been made[1][5]. White House clarification suggests that recent high-level meetings (e.g., NSA Waltz’s visit to CENTCOM) were not specifically about Syria withdrawal, showing that while planning is advancing, there is not yet a commitment[5]. Furthermore, there is recent precedent for institutional and regional resistance: in past withdrawals, military and security advisors have slowed or reversed decisions, citing the risk of ISIS resurgence and the destabilization of local partners like the SDF[1][4].

There are also international implications, particularly with Israel and regional security partners, and ongoing threats from ISIS, all of which could prompt caution or delay[4]. The Trump administration has previously reversed or modified its Syria withdrawal decisions in response to such pressures.

Given that institutional inertia and security considerations have historically favored maintaining the status quo, and as there is still no official announcement as of mid-February 2025, the default likelihood is that a "No" outcome remains more probable unless clear, decisive political leadership intervenes very soon.

Despite the compressed Pentagon timelines, the key hurdle remains the actual decision and official public announcement—criteria that are clear and specific for this question.

Probability: **35%**  
A public, official, and specific announcement to withdraw at least half of US troops from Syria before April 1, 2025, is plausible given current planning and political interest—but institutional resistance, security concerns, and lack of a final decision mean the "No" outcome (announcement does not happen in time) remains more likely.
