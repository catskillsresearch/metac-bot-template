I'll analyze whether the United States will impose new tariffs on Mexico before April 1, 2025 based on the available information.

(a) Time left until outcome: Approximately 25 days (from the current date of May 6, 2025, looking back at the deadline of April 1, 2025)

(b) Status quo outcome: No new tariffs imposed on Mexico before April 1, 2025

(c) Scenario resulting in No outcome: Mexico successfully addresses U.S. concerns regarding border security and drug trafficking during the 30-day pause period, leading to either a permanent suspension of the tariffs or additional extensions of the pause beyond March 4. Alternatively, diplomatic negotiations could lead to a different agreement that avoids tariff implementation.

(d) Scenario resulting in Yes outcome: Mexico fails to satisfy U.S. demands by March 4, 2025, prompting the Trump administration to implement the previously announced 25% tariffs on Mexican imports, which would occur before the April 1 deadline.

## Analysis of Current Situation

President Trump signed executive orders on February 1, 2025, imposing tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico, and China[1][2]. The Mexico-targeted executive order established a 25% ad valorem tariff on all products imported from Mexico, citing border security and drug trafficking concerns[2][3].

While these tariffs were initially scheduled to take effect on February 4, 2025, the United States and Mexico reached an agreement on February 3 that temporarily paused the implementation until March 4, 2025[3][5]. This pause was contingent on Mexico taking specific actions related to border security, illegal drugs, and immigration issues[5].

## Key Considerations

The temporary pause expires on March 4, 2025, which is nearly a month before the April 1 deadline in question[5]. This timeline is critical because if Mexico fails to satisfy the U.S. demands during this 30-day period, the tariffs would likely be implemented after March 4 but before April 1.

The Trump administration has taken an unprecedented approach by using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose these tariffs[2]. This indicates a strong commitment to using tariffs as a policy tool to address border and immigration concerns.

Both countries have strong incentives to avoid the implementation of these tariffs:
- For Mexico, the economic impact of a 25% tariff on all exports to the U.S. would be severe
- For the U.S., tariffs would likely increase prices for American consumers and disrupt supply chains[4]

## Historical Context and Status Quo Bias

Historically, tariff threats have sometimes been used as negotiating leverage rather than being implemented in full. In this case, we've already seen that the initial February 4 implementation date was paused following negotiations[3].

According to the search results, the tariffs on China did go into effect on February 4, 2025, while the tariffs on Canada and Mexico were delayed until March 4, 2025[3]. This suggests the administration is willing to follow through on tariff threats but is also open to negotiated solutions when counterparties make concessions.

## Final Assessment

Given that the March 4 deadline for the pause comes before April 1, the most likely scenario is that one of two things happened:
1. Either Mexico satisfied U.S. demands during the 30-day pause period, leading to a further extension or cancellation of the tariffs
2. Or Mexico failed to satisfy demands, leading to implementation of the 25% tariffs after March 4 but before April 1

The search results indicate that both the U.S. and Mexican governments were actively negotiating and had reached a temporary agreement[3][5]. The specific metrics Mexico needed to meet were not detailed in the available information, making it difficult to assess whether Mexico would likely satisfy U.S. demands.

Since we're looking backward from May 2025 to April 2025, and considering the strong status quo bias (changes happen slowly), it's more likely that some form of agreement was reached to further delay or cancel the tariffs, especially given the significant economic stakes for both countries and the history of using tariff threats as negotiating tools.

Probability: 40%
