(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.
- Today is March 11, 2025. The lowest price will be determined before April 1, 2025; thus, there are approximately 20 days remaining until the outcome is known.

(b) The outcome if nothing changed.
- If nothing changed from the current state, bitcoin's lowest price would be about $95,630, as that is its current level[1][2].

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued.
- If the ongoing consolidation and mild pullback continue, bitcoin may fluctuate around current levels with potential for slightly lower lows. Some short-term forecasts suggest a possible minor dip, but models remain bullish or neutral in the immediate term, projecting prices in the $94,000–$95,000 range over the month[1][2].

(d) The expectations of experts and markets.
- Expert forecasts for March 2025 anticipate a possible dip before a strong recovery. One authoritative forecast places the possible low at $84,103 for March, with the lower bound of expert estimates mostly clustering in the low-to-mid $80,000s[3]. Other projections highlight a possible support zone between $77,600 and $84,440 as the lowest likely area, but consensus is that a sharp drop much below $80,000 is unlikely in the absence of a dramatic new event[4][3]. Overall sentiment is cautious but not bearish, with expectations that any further dip will be temporary.

(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome.
- A sudden, severe regulatory crackdown—such as a major jurisdiction announcing a ban on crypto trading or bitcoin ETF withdrawals—could trigger panic selling, briefly pushing bitcoin below the $80,000 mark before buyers step in.

(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome.
- Should a central bank unexpectedly cut interest rates or announce quantitative easing in response to deteriorating economic data, demand for bitcoin could surge, causing any dip to be very shallow and keeping prices above $90,000 for the rest of March.
