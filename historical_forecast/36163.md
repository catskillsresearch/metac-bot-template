(a) Time left until outcome is known:  
The outcome date is March 30, 2025. Today is May 6, 2025. Thus, the outcome date has passed by about 37 days, so the outcome should already be available on Reddstats or will be available for resolution immediately.

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed:  
The latest detailed subscriber count publicly cited is from 2019 with about 115,000 subscribers, which is far outdated and much lower than current projections. So if truly nothing changed since 2019 (which is very unlikely), the number would remain around 115,000 subscribers. This is a baseline minimum but clearly an unrealistic scenario.

(c) Outcome if current trend continued:  
The "datascience" subreddit is known for consistent, steady growth over recent years with no disruption reported. The open bounds provided ([2,627,333; 2,800,000]) suggest that by March 2025, the subscriber count is expected in the range of about 2.6 to 2.8 million subscribers. This is consistent with the subreddit’s growth trajectory and community prominence in data science. Assuming linear or modest exponential growth continuing into early 2025, a figure in this range is the most plausible "current trend continued" scenario.

(d) Expectations of experts and markets:  
No direct expert forecasts for this subreddit’s subscriber count were found, but Reddit itself is bullish on growth, according to analyst reports citing increased advertising and international expansion in 2025, implying growing user engagement on popular subreddits[5]. Experts in data science communities recognize r/datascience as the top data science hub on Reddit and expect steady growth aligned with the overall platform’s expansion. Hence, the market and expert expectation aligns with continued growth in millions of subscribers, likely near the higher end of the given bounds.

(e) Unexpected low outcome scenario:  
A major unexpected event such as a Reddit platform ban, a drastic policy change reducing subreddit visibility, or mass user exodus due to a controversy or alternative community emerging could lead to a low outcome well below expectations, potentially causing a sudden drop or plateau in subscriber count far below 2.6 million.

(f) Unexpected high outcome scenario:  
A viral surge in data science interest due to a global event, breakthrough innovation, or Reddit’s introduction of new features boosting subreddit memberships, combined with aggressive marketing and international language expansion, could push subscriber numbers beyond the upper bound, possibly exceeding 3 million subscribers by late March 2025.

## Final Forecast Using 90/10 Confidence Interval

Percentile 10: 2,600,000  
Percentile 20: 2,650,000  
Percentile 40: 2,700,000  
Percentile 60: 2,750,000  
Percentile 80: 2,780,000  
Percentile 90: 2,820,000  

This range reflects steady growth with modest uncertainty on either side, accommodating unforeseen growth moderation or acceleration. The final resolution should be checked on Reddstats for the exact count on or near March 30, 2025.
