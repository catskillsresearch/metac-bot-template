(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
There are approximately 44 days remaining until January 1, 2025, when the question will resolve.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
iRobot has not filed for bankruptcy as of mid-November 2024. Under current conditions—ongoing operating losses but with $99.4 million in cash on hand as of September 28, 2024, plus $41.1 million in restricted cash—the company is implementing aggressive cost-cutting and restructuring efforts. Unless a sudden financial shock occurs, the company appears positioned to avoid bankruptcy filing before January 1, 2025[1][3][5].

(c) **Scenario that results in a No outcome:**  
iRobot continues with current restructuring efforts, manages cash judiciously, and avoids any major negative surprises (e.g., severe holiday sales shortfall, unexpected legal or debt issues). Even with anticipated operating losses in Q4 2024, cash reserves and improving gross margins allow iRobot to remain solvent through year-end 2024, and no bankruptcy petition is filed[1][5].

(d) **Scenario that results in a Yes outcome:**  
iRobot faces a sudden cash crisis—such as a sharp drop in holiday sales, creditors demanding immediate repayment, or uncovering liabilities not previously disclosed—which depletes its liquidity faster than expected. The company runs out of accessible cash, cannot arrange emergency financing, and is forced to file for bankruptcy protection before January 1, 2025. There is currently no evidence of such immediate risk, though the company is under financial stress[1][5].

## Rationale

iRobot is in a precarious financial situation, with several years of operating losses, declining revenue from its 2021 peak, and continued negative cash flow. However, recent results show some stabilization: revenue grew modestly in Q3 2024 compared to Q3 2023, gross margin is improving, and significant cost reductions have been made via layoffs and other restructuring[1][3][5]. The cash balance, while declining, remains substantial relative to near-term needs, and the company is taking visible actions to avoid a liquidity crisis.

Historically, most firms in similar situations do not file for bankruptcy abruptly without a clear, acute trigger—particularly when they are still actively managing costs, have runway cash, and see a path to improved performance. Management projects year-over-year growth potential in 2025, indicating intent and some room to navigate.

The main bankruptcy risk within the next 44 days would be an unforeseen event that rapidly accelerates cash burn or restricts access to liquidity. However, no such catalyst is evident in available information.

Given financial pressures but also stabilizing measures—and based on the status quo bias (the world changes slowly most of the time)—the likeliest outcome is that iRobot does **not** file for bankruptcy before January 1, 2025.

**Probability: 8%**
