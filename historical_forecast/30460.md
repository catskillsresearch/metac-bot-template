(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
Zillow updates its housing data for November 2024 on December 12, 2024. Today is November 25, 2024, so the outcome will be known in approximately 17 days.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
Recent data from Zillow (as of November 2024) shows the Dallas, TX Zillow Home Value Index (ZHVI) at $369,778, with a year-over-year change of -0.3%[2]. This indicates home prices in Dallas are slightly lower than one year ago. If this trend persists through November, the year-over-year change will remain negative.

(c) **Scenario for a No outcome:**  
If Zillow's reported ZHVI for Dallas, TX in November 2024 remains lower than the ZHVI in November 2023, the year-over-year change will be negative. For example, if November 2023’s ZHVI was about $370,889, as implied by the -0.3% figure, and November 2024’s ZHVI is $369,778 or lower, the outcome will be No—prices did not increase year-over-year[2].

(d) **Scenario for a Yes outcome:**  
If there is an unexpected late-year rebound in Dallas home prices such that the November 2024 ZHVI equals or exceeds the November 2023 figure (so that the year-over-year change is ≥0.0%), then the outcome will be Yes. This would require a month-over-month increase sufficient to erase the current negative annual gap, which is small but real[2].

## Rationale

- The most recent and closest-to-November data shows Dallas ZHVI down -0.3% year-over-year[2].
- Projections for major Texas cities in early 2024—including Houston, Austin, and San Antonio—were for declines of around 2%, a pattern that seems regionally consistent so far[3].
- No evidence in the search results suggests a recent reversal or price surge in Dallas that would push year-over-year appreciation above zero by November 2024.
- North Texas suburbs are resilient, but Dallas proper is not standing out as an outperformer, ranking 59th among U.S. markets[5].
- The status quo—slightly declining year-over-year prices—is likely to persist, especially given broader regional and state trends[1][2][3].

## Final Forecast

Probability: **25%**

This figure reflects a small but nonzero chance of a late uptick nullifying the small current year-over-year decline, but the most likely outcome is that Dallas home prices, as measured by Zillow’s Home Value Index, will still show a slight year-over-year decrease in November 2024.
