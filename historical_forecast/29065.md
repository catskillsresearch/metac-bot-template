(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  
The outcome will be determined after the 2024 U.S. presidential election and certification of the popular vote, which typically occurs by late November to early December 2024. As of October 22, 2024, this is approximately 1–2 months away.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
The current RCP average as of October 17, 2024, shows a Trump vs. Harris spread of -1.583 percentage points for Trump. If the actual popular vote margin matches the expectations implied by the current RCP average—meaning polls are relatively accurate—then the polling bias would remain near zero. However, if Trump continues to perform slightly better than his polling, as in past presidential elections, the polling bias would likely be negative, possibly within the -2.0pp to -1.0pp range.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
A "No" would result if Trump's actual margin differs from the final RCP average by more than -2.0pp or less than -1.0pp. This could happen if either:  
- Polls significantly underestimate Trump’s support (e.g., Trump outperforms polls by more than 2.0pp, bias < -2.0pp), or  
- Polls are much more accurate, or even overestimate Trump (bias > -1.0pp), potentially reflecting improved polling methods or an atypical turnout.

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
A "Yes" would result if RCP’s polling bias for Trump is between -2.0pp and -1.0pp, inclusive of the endpoints. This would occur if Trump outperforms his polling average by about 1.0 to 2.0 percentage points—similar to the pattern seen in 2016 and 2020, when RCP’s average underestimated Trump by 1.8pp and 2.7pp respectively[1].

## Rationale

- **Historical precedent:** In 2016 and 2020, the RCP average underestimated Trump by 1.8pp and 2.7pp, respectively[1]. If this pattern continues, and Trump’s actual margin exceeds his RCP polling by about 1–2 points, the bias will indeed fall between -2.0 and -1.0pp.
- **Recent deviations:** However, the 2022 midterms saw polls *overestimating* Republican performance, a reversal from the previous presidential cycles, suggesting that polling bias is not reliably persistent in direction or magnitude[1][5].
- **Poor predictive power of past bias:** Statistical analyses show that using previous polling bias to predict future bias is unreliable—since 1998, the direction of polling error has been mispredicted in half of cycles, and the correlation between bias in consecutive cycles is actually mildly negative[5].
- **Methodological changes:** Pollsters have likely adjusted their methods post-2020 to better capture "shy" or underrepresented voting blocs, but it's unclear if these changes will fully correct, overshoot, or leave new errors[1][5].
- **Current environment:** The October 17 RCP average of -1.583pp fits squarely within the target range. Given the tendency toward slow change and the inertia of polling methods, a moderate polling error like that of recent cycles is plausible.

Given these considerations, while the history of a small to moderate negative bias for Trump is the best available guide, the genuine unpredictability of polling bias means this is far from certain. Still, the expected value remains anchored in the status quo of a moderate negative polling bias.
