(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
Today is May 6, 2025. The question concerns December 2024 temperatures. The outcome should already be known, as the entire month and the verification period have passed.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
In recent years, the lowest December temperatures at the downtown San Francisco weather station were 40°F (December 2022) and 46.13°F (December 2023). The long-term December average low is around 45°F[5]. December lows below 40°F are rare, and most recent years have stayed above that threshold.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
If, throughout December 2024, the downtown San Francisco station (SFOC1) never records a daily low below 40°F on the official Iowa State Mesonet page, the answer will be No. This would occur if typical Pacific storm patterns, urban microclimate effects, and ocean moderation keep nighttime lows in the mid-40s or higher, as in December 2023.

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
If at least one daily low is reported below 40°F for SFOC1 during December 2024 on the Iowa State Mesonet page, the answer will be Yes. This would likely require a strong, dry, cold air outbreak from the continent, clear skies, and calm winds allowing radiational cooling—conditions that have occurred occasionally in the past (e.g., December 2013 cold snap).

## Rationale

- **Climatological Averages:**  
  The average daily low in December is typically between 45°F and 49°F[5]. It is uncommon for the city to dip below 40°F, with oceanic moderation usually preventing extreme cold.
  
- **Recent Trends:**  
  December 2022 had a single low of exactly 40°F, and December 2023 did not approach that mark, staying well above (lowest of 46.13°F). These recent patterns suggest that sub-40°F lows are becoming less frequent[5].
  
- **Historical Extremes:**  
  While it is not unprecedented (e.g., record lows in the 1930s), these are rare exceptions rather than the rule.

- **Forecasting Principles:**  
  Forecasters give extra weight to the status quo and base rates unless there are clear drivers toward change. Persistent oceanic influence, urban heat island effects, and general climatic warming all reduce the probability of a sub-40°F low.

- **Current Long-Range Forecasts and Averages:**  
  No evidence from available sources suggests that December 2024 experienced record or near-record cold in San Francisco. Available December climate summaries for similar years and forecasts indicate expected lows in the mid-40s or above[2][3][5].

## Probability Estimate

Given the rarity of sub-40°F lows in downtown San Francisco in December, the fact that this threshold was only barely reached in 2022 and not in 2023, and the lack of evidence for an extraordinary cold snap in December 2024, the most prudent estimate strongly favors the status quo.

**Probability: 10%**  

This reflects a low, but nonzero, chance based on historical precedent—but the recent trend and climatological averages make a No outcome (no low below 40°F) much more likely.
