(a) Time left until outcome: The 36th Annual GLAAD Media Awards ceremony was scheduled for March 27, 2025, which is 21 days from today (May 6, 2025). However, based on the search results, the ceremony has already taken place on March 27, 2025, and Doechii was announced as the winner of the Outstanding Music Artist award for her album "Alligator Bites Never Heal."

(b) Status quo outcome: According to the search results, Doechii has already won the 2025 GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Music Artist. This information appears in search result [4], which states: "Outstanding Music Artist · Doechii, Alligator Bites Never Heal (Top Dawg ..."

(c) Unexpected outcome scenario: An unexpected outcome would be if there was a mistake in the reporting or documentation of the winner. For example, if the Wikipedia entry cited in search result [4] contained an error or was prematurely updated before the official announcement. Another possibility would be if GLAAD discovered voting irregularities after the ceremony and decided to revoke and reassign the award, though this would be highly unusual.

Looking at the available information, several factors support Doechii as the winner:

1. Search result [4] explicitly lists Doechii as the winner in the Outstanding Music Artist category for the 36th GLAAD Media Awards.

2. Search result [1] includes a photo showing Doechii with the award, described as "Doechii, winner of the Outstanding Music Artist award."

3. The ceremony has already taken place on March 27, 2025, as confirmed by multiple search results.

The GLAAD Media Awards evaluate nominees based on fair and inclusive representation of the LGBTQ community, boldness and originality, cultural impact, and overall quality. Doechii's album "Alligator Bites Never Heal" likely excelled in these criteria.

While I'm highly confident in this outcome based on the search results, I'll maintain small probabilities for other nominees to account for potential reporting errors or other unexpected circumstances.
