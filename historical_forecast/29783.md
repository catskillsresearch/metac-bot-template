(a) Time left until the outcome is known:  
The 2024 World Chess Championship match is scheduled from November 25 to December 13, 2024. The question about whether the champion will be decided within the first 10 classical games can only be resolved once those games are completed (or earlier if one player reaches 7.5 points sooner). Hence, the outcome will be known by mid-December 2024, approximately 1 to 1.5 months from November 8, 2024.

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changes:  
Historically, recent world chess championships, including Ding Liren’s 2023 title match, tend to be very close with many draws and typically go the full length of the scheduled games or require tiebreaks to decide the winner. Both Ding and Gukesh have very solid and resilient playing styles, with a high draw tendency at this elite level. Therefore, it is highly likely the match will not be decided before game 11 under normal conditions.

(c) Scenario resulting in a No outcome:  
If after the first 10 classical games neither player reaches the 7.5 points winning threshold (for example, if the score is something like 5-5, or 6-4 with many draws), the champion will not be decided within those 10 games, resulting in a No.

(d) Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:  
If one player wins enough games and/or draws to reach the 7.5 points threshold before or by game 10—such as winning 5 games and drawing at least 1, or any combination totaling at least 7.5 points—then the championship will be decided inside 10 games. Alternatively, a rare event such as a forfeit or disqualification before game 11 would also cause a Yes.

**Rationale:**

- The match format is best of 14 classical games with a 7.5 point threshold to win. Given the high incidence of draws in elite classical chess and the specific history of recent championships, early decisive victories sufficient to decide the match before game 11 are uncommon.

- Ding Liren’s past unbeaten streak and defensive skill, combined with Gukesh’s strong, resilient play and youthful energy, indicate a closely contested match with many draws.

- Recent championships, such as Ding Liren’s own 2023 win and Magnus Carlsen’s matches, were decided at or beyond game 11, often requiring tiebreaks or results in the final classical games.

- No current indications suggest an abnormal termination of the match (forfeit, disqualification, illness) that could cause an early decision.

- Although theoretically possible, the likelihood of one player accumulating enough wins plus draws to clinch the title before game 11 is low.

Taking these factors into account, the status quo outcome — the match extending beyond 10 games without an early winner — carries the greatest weight.

**Final answer:**  
Probability: 15% that the 2024 World Chess Champion will be decided within the first 10 games.
