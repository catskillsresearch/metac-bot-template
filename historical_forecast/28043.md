(a) Time until outcome: The Brandenburg state election is scheduled for September 22, 2024, which is 46 days from today (May 6, 2025). However, since we're answering from May 2025, the outcome is already known.

(b) Status quo outcome: Based on polling data from September 2024, AfD was polling at around 24% in Brandenburg, which is below the 30-32% threshold specified in the question.

(c) Scenario for No outcome: AfD's support in Brandenburg remains consistent with polling (around 24%) or experiences only modest growth, failing to reach the 30% threshold. This could happen if Brandenburg voters behave differently than those in Thuringia and Saxony, perhaps due to different local issues, stronger performance by competing parties like SPD or CDU, or effective opposition campaigns against AfD.

(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: AfD experiences a significant late surge in support in Brandenburg, similar to their performance in Thuringia (32.8%) and Saxony (30.6%). This could be driven by mobilization of previously undecided voters, increased turnout among AfD supporters, or last-minute campaign developments that shift voter sentiment toward AfD.

In approaching this forecast, I need to carefully consider the available evidence. The most recent polling data from September 2024 showed AfD at approximately 24% in Brandenburg, which is significantly below the 30-32% threshold in question. This represents a gap of at least 6 percentage points that would need to be closed for the outcome to be "Yes."

While AfD did perform strongly in the recent Thuringia and Saxony elections (32.8% and 30.6% respectively), there are important differences to consider. Brandenburg has its own distinct political landscape and voter demographics. The polling in Brandenburg showed a more competitive race with the SPD, CDU, and BSW all polling between 17-19%, suggesting a more fragmented political environment than in the other eastern states.

The gap between polling and actual results would need to be unusually large for AfD to exceed 30% in Brandenburg. While polls can certainly be inaccurate, a 6+ percentage point underestimation would represent a significant polling error. Additionally, the fact that AfD was polling at around 24% in Brandenburg - much lower than their polling in Thuringia and Saxony before those elections - suggests different dynamics at play.

It's worth noting that incumbency may play a role here. Unlike in Thuringia, where AfD was already the strongest party, Brandenburg had been governed by an SPD-led coalition. This incumbent advantage might limit AfD's potential gains.

While there's certainly a chance that AfD could outperform polling expectations, the evidence suggests it would be unlikely for them to reach precisely the 30-32% range specified in the question. They would either fall short of 30% (more likely based on polling) or potentially exceed 32% if there were a truly dramatic surge (less likely).

Considering all these factors and giving appropriate weight to the status quo outcome reflected in polling, I assess that there is a low probability that AfD's vote share would fall exactly in the 30-32% range.

Probability: 20%
