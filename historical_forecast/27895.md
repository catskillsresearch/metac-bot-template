(a) **Time Left Until Outcome:**  
There are approximately four weeks remaining until October 1, 2024.

(b) **Status Quo Outcome if Nothing Changed:**  
Alexandre de Moraes remains a minister of the Supreme Federal Court of Brazil. He continues in office, as there is no resignation, removal, or confirmation of a successor[1][2][3][4].

(c) **Scenario Leading to a No Outcome:**  
The impeachment petition against de Moraes, announced by far-right parliamentarians and slated to be filed on September 9, 2024, either fails to meet procedural thresholds or is not rapidly considered by the Senate. Even if filed, the process to investigate and potentially remove a Supreme Court minister in Brazil is complex and time-consuming, making it virtually impossible for him to be removed, resign, or otherwise leave office before October 1, 2024[1].

(d) **Scenario Leading to a Yes Outcome:**  
Only an extraordinary and unexpected event—such as indisputable evidence of misconduct surfacing immediately, compelling de Moraes to resign, or an expedited impeachment and removal by the Senate, or an unforeseen health crisis—would result in him leaving office before October 1, 2024. There is no credible indication of such a scenario currently developing[1][2][3][4].

## Rationale

The current evidence points overwhelmingly toward Alexandre de Moraes remaining in his position at least through the relevant date. The impeachment process, even if initiated swiftly after September 9, is procedurally complex and typically drawn-out. Removal of a Supreme Court justice in Brazil requires not only a substantial legal basis but also significant political will and Senate action, none of which are present or imminent as of early September 2024[1][2].

Furthermore, there are no credible reports of imminent resignation, forced retirement, or other circumstances that would lead to a sudden, voluntary exit. His current age (55) precludes mandatory retirement, and despite political controversy and high-profile disputes (including the recent suspension of X), Moraes continues to act from a position of institutionally entrenched authority. While political dynamics can be volatile, especially in Brazil, the momentum and formal requirements for such a drastic change are not evident within the remaining four-week window[1][2][3][4].
