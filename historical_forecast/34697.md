(a) **The time left until the outcome to the question is known.**  
There is no time left. The acceptance window for the Fork in the Road deferred resignation offer closed on February 6, 2025, and today is February 8, 2025. However, no official numbers have been reported as of this date, so the final outcome remains unknown and unresolved.

(b) **The outcome if nothing changed.**  
If nothing changes—meaning no official acceptance numbers are reported—the outcome of this question will be annulled, as per the resolution criteria.

(c) **The outcome if the current trend continued.**  
If the current trend (absence of credible public reporting) continues, there will be no reported data on how many federal employees accepted the offer, so the resolution will remain annulled.

(d) **The expectations of experts and markets.**  
Given the unprecedented and controversial nature of the Fork in the Road program, expert commentary has highlighted widespread confusion, skepticism, and legal uncertainty among federal employees[1][2][3]. The offer's statutory and administrative legitimacy was questioned, and worker advocacy groups cautioned employees against responding. Market and expert consensus likely expects a very low acceptance rate due to:

- Unclear legal standing and funding of the offer[3]
- Lack of precedent for such a program
- Confusion about whether the offer is legitimate or binding[1][2]
- The risks of giving up federal employment and associated benefits

(e) **A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome.**  
If post-hoc investigations or whistleblowers reveal that virtually no federal employees trusted or accepted the offer—perhaps due to overwhelming skepticism, union or legal warnings, or technical failures in the email system—the outcome could approach the minimum possible value (very close to zero, but not zero per instructions).

(f) **A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome.**  
If, despite doubts, a large segment of employees (perhaps those close to retirement or with independent means) decided the offer presented an exceptional financial opportunity, and if OPM later released surprise data showing mass voluntary resignations, the outcome could approach the upper bound (though this is regarded as extremely unlikely by all available expert commentary).

(The units for the answer, by inference from the question's constraints, are the fraction of the total—i.e., if no information is reported, the answer is 1.0 per the status quo in a binary "annulled" scenario.)
