(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
StatCounter's January 2025 global search engine market share data is typically published in early February. Since today is May 6, 2025, the required data has already been available for several months.

(b) **Outcome if nothing changed:**  
If Google's global search engine market share had remained at its last observed value (from December 2024: 89.73%[5]), the January 2025 value would also be 89.73%.

(c) **Outcome if the current trend continued:**  
Over the last three months of 2024, Google's share fluctuated narrowly:  
- October 2024: 89.34%  
- November 2024: 89.99%  
- December 2024: 89.73%[5]  

If this trend continued, the January 2025 value would likely remain within this range, possibly centering around 89.7%–90.0%.

(d) **Expectations of experts and markets:**  
Industry observers note a sustained, though modest, downward trend in Google's market share, with particular reference to growing competition in Asia and the rise of alternative AI-powered search engines (though these are not directly captured by StatCounter)[1][4][5]. However, most forecasts expect stability in the high 89% to low 90% range, barring any major disruption.

(e) **Unexpected scenario (low outcome):**  
A technical or regulatory setback in one of Google’s large markets, or an abrupt consumer shift to a new AI search engine not traditionally measured by StatCounter, could temporarily reduce Google’s measured market share to below 89%.

(f) **Unexpected scenario (high outcome):**  
A technical outage or failure affecting a major Google competitor—even briefly—could artificially inflate Google’s global market share above 90% for January 2025. Alternatively, a methodological change by StatCounter reclassifying certain search traffic could push the value higher.
