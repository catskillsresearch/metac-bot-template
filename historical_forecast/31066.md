(a) **Time until outcome is known:**  
The BEA typically releases state GDP data for Q3 in December of the following year. Since today is May 6, 2025, and the relevant Q3 2024 data was released in December 2024, the outcome is already available, but for the sake of this exercise, we are forecasting based on data as of December 18, 2024.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
Current data from reputable sources indicate Texas had the highest real GDP growth rate among the three states in Q3 2024, with a 4.2% annualized rate. California experienced sub-par growth (below the national average), and no evidence suggests Illinois outperformed either[3][5].

(c) **Scenario resulting in an unexpected outcome:**  
An unexpected outcome could occur if California or Illinois had a significant positive revision to preliminary GDP data due to, for example, a previously undercounted burst of tech sector activity in California or an unreported recovery in a major Illinois industry. Alternatively, a subsequent shock to Texas’s energy sector (possibly not reflected in initial data) could result in a downward revision for Texas, narrowing the gap or flipping the order. However, there is no current evidence supporting these scenarios as probable based on the available data.

## Rationale

Texas stands out as the clear leader for Q3 2024 real GDP growth among the three states:

- **Texas**: Confirmed growth of 4.2% in Q3 2024, described as "on the high side" for large states[3].
- **California**: Projected by the UCLA Anderson Forecast to have a "full year of sub-par growth" in 2024, with Q2 already trailing the national average, and no indication of an acceleration in Q3[5].
- **Illinois**: No evidence from recent data or economic commentary that Illinois outperformed either Texas or California, with editorial voices sounding the alarm on its struggling economy.

Given the strong, specific figure for Texas, the “status quo” outcome is that Texas had the highest Q3 2024 growth. However, revisions, data corrections, or unexpected one-off events could modestly boost the probabilities for California or Illinois.

**Good forecasting practice** means giving most weight to the status quo outcome and leaving a modest probability for surprises, as economic data are sometimes revised and unforeseen events occasionally benefit lagging states.

## Final Probabilities

Texas: 88%  
Illinois: 5%  
California: 7%
