(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
From February 13, 2025, there are approximately 1.5 months until April 1, 2025. The window for Trump to visit Israel is therefore about 45-47 days from the reference date.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
As of February 13, 2025, Donald Trump has *not* visited Israel since the question was launched. All recent high-level meetings with Israeli officials have taken place in Washington, DC, including a major summit with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House[1][3][5]. If current trends persist and no further information emerges about future travel, the outcome would remain **No**.

(c) **Scenario that results in a No outcome:**  
Trump conducts all key diplomacy and negotiations with Israeli leaders remotely or on U.S. soil throughout February and March, and does not travel to Israel before April 1, 2025. Ongoing discussions regarding his Gaza plan continue through envoys or virtual means, and public focus remains on actions in Washington and not on any direct visit to Israel.

(d) **Scenario that results in a Yes outcome:**  
Due to intensifying diplomatic efforts over Gaza or other regional issues, Trump decides to make a high-profile visit to Israel before April 1, 2025. Such a trip could be prompted by the need to announce a new peace framework, solidify U.S.-Israel cooperation in person, or respond to regional crises. There would typically be media coverage and official announcements ahead of such a visit.

## Rationale

Recent events indicate robust diplomatic engagement between Trump and Israeli leadership, highlighted by Netanyahuâ€™s visit to Washington in early February 2025[1][3][5]. Trump is actively promoting his Gaza plan and corresponding with Israeli officials, but all interactions so far have occurred in the United States. There is no public indication or pre-announcement of Trump planning a trip to Israel in the near term.

Diplomatic trips of this magnitude are usually announced at least several days in advance. With about 1.5 months remaining, a visit is possible, especially given the active nature of U.S.-Israel discussions. However, historically, such sudden high-level travel is rare without clear signals in advance, and the tendency is for leaders to meet in Washington unless there is a specific reason for an in-region visit.

While the dynamic situation in Gaza or a breakthrough in U.S.-Israel relations could prompt a last-minute visit, no concrete evidence or planning for such a trip is available as of February 13, 2025. Consequently, the status quo outcome, where Trump does *not* visit Israel before April 1, carries more weight.

**Probability: 15%**
