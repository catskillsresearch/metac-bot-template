(a) **Time left until the outcome to the question is known:**  
From March 3, 2025, as of the date of this forecast, there are just under one month left before the April 1, 2025 checkpoint.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
The current situation, as of late February 2025, is that "Ignite" general access tickets (aligning with "FYRE IGNITE") are available for sale at $1,400 each and no signal of rapid sellout or overwhelming demand has been reported[2][3][4][5].

(c) **Scenario that results in a No outcome:**  
Tickets in the "FYRE IGNITE" class become unavailable before April 1, 2025, due either to selling out unexpectedly, the ticket class being removed/renamed without maintaining the original access benefits, ticket sales being paused or halted (e.g., due to regulatory, logistical, or credibility crises), or the festival itself being canceled or postponed before that date.

(d) **Scenario that results in a Yes outcome:**  
"FYRE IGNITE" tickets (or an equivalent ticket class with the required festival access benefits) remain listed and purchasable at the official ticket website on April 1, 2025.

## Rationale

- **Sales Pace and Demand Uncertainty:**  
  Tickets have only recently gone on sale (February 24, 2025), and there has been no indication of especially high demand. In fact, the initial Fyre Festivalâ€™s catastrophic reputation, combined with a lack of a confirmed performer lineup as of late February 2025, makes it less likely that there will be a rapid sellout of entry-level tickets[2][3][4][5].

- **Market Skepticism and Reputation:**  
  The overwhelming negative legacy of the 2017 event is likely causing many potential buyers to hesitate or avoid purchasing tickets altogether[3][4][5]. This would, in general, slow the pace of sales for the most basic tickets.

- **Supply and Capacity:**  
  The festival reportedly aims to limit attendance to around 3,000 people[5]. Even if every attendee bought the cheapest ticket, 3,000 tickets is not a high bar for major festivals, but given the negative publicity and public skepticism the probability of a mass sellout in the first 5 weeks of sales seems low.

- **No Evidence of Scarcity:**  
  None of the sources mention that tickets are nearly sold out or that there is any rush. The media coverage mostly focuses on skepticism and the lack of details (such as lineup and logistics)[2][3][4][5].

- **Status Quo Bias:**  
  In forecasting, the most reliable baseline is that things are likely to continue as they currently are, barring strong signals otherwise. With no evidence of rapid sales, imminent disaster, or overwhelming demand, and considering the festival's past, it is most probable that tickets will still be available on April 1, 2025.

### Wildcards

- A surge of "ironic" or novelty buyers could drive sales abnormally high.
- Legal, logistical, or public relations crises might force the suspension or cancellation of ticket sales.
- A sudden announcement of major headliners or a viral social media trend could boost demand unexpectedly.

None of these have occurred as of March 3, 2025, nor are there signs they are imminent.

**Probability: 85%**

Tickets in the "FYRE IGNITE" class will still be available for Fyre Festival 2 on April 1, 2025.
