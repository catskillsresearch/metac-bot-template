(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**
About one week remains until the 2024 US elections are held on November 5, 2024.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**
As of late October 2024, the expected outcome is that Republicans are favored to win the presidency (Donald Trump) and hold or gain the House of Representatives. Multiple forecasting sources, including political science analysts and prediction markets, indicate that the status quo expectation is for a divided government[1][4][5].

(c) **Scenario for a No outcome:**
A No outcome occurs if Democrats win either only the White House or only the House, or neither. This is the scenario currently considered most likely: Republicans win the White House (Trump as president) and either hold or win the House majority, preventing Democrats from controlling both[1][4][5].

(d) **Scenario for a Yes outcome:**
A Yes outcome requires both the Democratic presidential nominee (now Kamala Harris) winning the presidency and the Democratic Party winning control of the House of Representatives. This would likely require strong Democratic turnout, successful persuasion of swing voters, and favorable outcomes in dozens of close House racesâ€”outcomes for which there is limited polling evidence as of now[1][3][4].

## Rationale

Election forecasts as of late October 2024 consistently point to a very competitive presidential race, but with expectations tilting toward a Republican (Trump) victory[1][4]. Although some polls in August and September briefly showed Kamala Harris gaining ground after becoming the Democratic nominee, public sentiment and citizen forecasting surveys in October still favored Trump[4]. The party favored to win the House remains unclear due to a lack of high-quality, district-level polling, but the consensus among forecasters and betting markets is that Republicans are more likely to hold the majority[1][2][5].

It is critical to note that the question requires Democrats to win both the presidency and the House, a "double" that is historically more difficult, especially in a cycle where polling and expectations do not show clear Democratic momentum. Furthermore, recent cycles have shown polling error and late shifts, but barring a very strong late Democratic surge, the status quo (Republicans at least holding one chamber) is expected to persist. Good forecasting practice gives extra weight to this status quo and the aggregate of historical election fundamentals.
