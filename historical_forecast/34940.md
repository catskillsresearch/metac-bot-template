(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
The 2025 German federal election will be held on September 28, 2025. As of today (May 6, 2025), there are approximately 4 months and 3 weeks until the final seat counts are confirmed and this question is resolved.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
All major polling aggregates and model-based seat projections indicate:
- CDU/CSU is firmly in first place for seats.
- Alternative for Germany (AfD) is projected to win the 2nd highest number of seats.
- The Social Democratic Party (SPD) is expected in third, with the Greens and other parties trailing further.

Specifically, YouGov’s latest MRP model (Feb 2025) projects CDU/CSU at 207 seats, AfD at 142, SPD at 95, and Greens at 80[4]. POLITICO’s poll aggregations place CDU/CSU at 208, AfD at 152, SPD at 120, and Greens at 85[3]. Thus, if current conditions persist, AfD will finish with the second highest seat total in the Bundestag.

(c) **Scenario for an unexpected outcome:**  
A plausible scenario for a change in second place would involve a major polling shift against the AfD or in favor of the SPD. This could be triggered by:
- A major scandal or legal action affecting AfD leadership or campaign.
- Surge in tactical voting among centrists to block AfD, benefiting the SPD.
- A dramatic last-minute campaign event shifting voter preferences, such as a CDU/CSU scandal depressing their turnout and indirectly boosting SPD at AfD’s expense.
- A polling error or turnout anomaly, especially if the AfD's support is overestimated in rural East Germany or undercounted for SPD in large cities.
- Minor parties unexpectedly clearing the 5% threshold, fragmenting the seat distribution and lowering AfD’s total.
However, there is currently no concrete public evidence for these developments, and the overall polling and seat projections have been stable for months.

**Rationale:**  
Well-calibrated forecasters emphasize the “status quo” when the environment has been stable, as is the case with months of consistent polling and modeling across outlets[4][3][1]. Still, some moderate probability should be allotted to surprising developments, as elections can feature late swings or polling errors, but these probabilities are low given the present data.

## Final Probabilities

- CDU/CSU: 0% (Cannot place second if they finish first)
- Alternative for Germany: 86% (Strong, stable second in all projections[3][4][1])
- Social Democratic Party: 11% (Chance of late SPD surge, AfD collapse, or polling error)
- Social Democratic Party (duplicate): 0% (Already listed above)
- Another party: 3% (Greens, The Left, or another party unexpectedly surging, highly unlikely but within possibility[1][3])
