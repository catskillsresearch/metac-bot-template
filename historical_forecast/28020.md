(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  
The resolution date is October 1, 2024. Today is September 10, 2024, which means there are approximately 21 days (three weeks) remaining until the cutoff.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
As of early September 2024, the Boeing Starliner Commercial Crew Program has not been canceled by NASA or withdrawn from by Boeing. The program is experiencing major technical and reputational setbacks (notably, the current Crew Flight Test capsule will return to Earth without astronauts, and the astronauts have been reassigned to SpaceX), but official cancellation or withdrawal has not occurred[3][5].

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
NASA and Boeing continue with the current Starliner program status: investigating flight test failures, planning for the uncrewed return of the Starliner capsule in September, and publicly framing efforts as ongoing with intent to resolve technical issues and proceed with future missions[2][3][4][5]. No announcements are made before October 1, 2024, about program cancellation or withdrawal.

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
A major new issue or internal assessment leads NASA to publicly remove Starliner from the Commercial Crew Program, or Boeing decides before October 1, 2024 to withdraw from the program—likely citing unresolved engineering, financial, or contractual challenges. This would happen via a formal announcement by either NASA or Boeing.

## Rationale

The Starliner program is facing its most severe crisis to date, with the Crew Flight Test extending far beyond its intended duration due to persistent and serious propulsion problems[5]. NASA’s unprecedented decision to bring home the astronauts via SpaceX, leaving Starliner to return uncrewed, signals a lack of confidence in the vehicle’s safety for crewed return on this flight[3]. This is a severe blow to Boeing’s credibility and the perceived reliability of its spacecraft.

However, no public statements from NASA or Boeing indicate that the program is being canceled or that Boeing is withdrawing from the Commercial Crew Program as of September 10, 2024[3][4][5]. The narrative from both organizations continues to emphasize troubleshooting, learning from failures, and moving forward with the program[4][5]. The Starliner-1 operational mission, while almost certainly delayed, is still planned by both NASA and Boeing[4]. NASA has also not formally required a new demo flight or signaled contract termination.

Institutional inertia is significant: NASA requires two providers for ISS access for redundancy, and canceling Starliner would leave SpaceX as the sole crewed provider, something NASA has historically avoided. Boeing retains substantial motivation—financial, reputational, and contractual—to avoid an abrupt withdrawal, and NASA typically moves slowly in programmatic decisions, giving contractors opportunities to solve issues before taking drastic measures.

While the severity of the recent problems raises the longer-term risk of cancellation or sharp curtailment, it is unlikely that either NASA or Boeing will make such a momentous decision within the next three weeks. Rapid program cancellations are rare, and the likely path over the coming weeks is further investigation, public statements of commitment, and gradual reassessment rather than rapid cancellation.

**Probability: 10%**

The likelihood that the Boeing Starliner Commercial Crew program will be canceled, or Boeing will withdraw from it, *before October 1, 2024*, is low. The most probable outcome is that the program continues in a damaged but not canceled state through the resolution date, with Boeing and NASA continuing public efforts to remedy the failures and plan for eventual return to operational flights[2][3][4][5].
