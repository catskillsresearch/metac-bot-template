(a) Time left until outcome is known:  
The question will be resolved once the cumulative rainfall data for December 2024 (from December 1 to December 31) is fully available from the INMET weather station [83377] BRASILIA - DF. Data availability is expected in early January 2025, and if not available by January 7, 2025, the question will be annulled.

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed:  
Historically, Brasília receives well over 200 mm of rain in December, with long-term averages ranging approximately from 207 mm to 253 mm, and typically around 21 rainy days[1][3][5]. The status quo, based on climatology, is that December rainfall exceeds 200 mm.

(c) Scenario resulting in a No outcome (less than or equal to 200 mm):  
If the recent extreme drought and record-breaking heat of 2024 delay or inhibit the normal rainy season pattern, December precipitation could be suppressed. For instance, if the rainy season starts late or is interrupted due to atmospheric instability or persistent dry conditions linked to the drought, total rainfall could fall below the 200 mm threshold despite December's usual wetness.

(d) Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome (rainfall exceeding 200 mm):  
If the rainy season recovers normally after the drought breaks in October, December—being the wettest month historically—will likely receive its typical rainfall or even an anomalous surge due to the accumulation of moisture and post-drought atmospheric conditions. This could lead to rainfall totals comfortably exceeding 200 mm.

**Rationale:**

Brasília’s December rainfall climatology strongly favors exceeding 200 mm, with multiple independent sources reporting averages well above this threshold (207 mm to 253 mm)[1][3][5]. The recent drought ending in October 2024 and the record heat introduce uncertainty. The drought’s 167 dry days could have delayed the onset of the rainy season, but once the rains begin, they often intensify to "make up" for the dry period, especially in a historically wet month like December. 

The anomalously high temperatures in 2024 could have two opposing effects:  
- Suppression or delay of rainfall due to disrupted atmospheric circulation and soil moisture deficits, resulting in less rain (scenario for No).  
- Enhanced convection and atmospheric instability leading to heavy rainfall events when the rainy season arrives (scenario for Yes).

Given the strong climatological pattern and the onset of rain in October, the balance of probability leans toward rainfall exceeding 200 mm in December 2024, albeit with more uncertainty than in a normal year. This forecast relies heavily on historical norms but adjusts slightly for 2024's unique conditions.
