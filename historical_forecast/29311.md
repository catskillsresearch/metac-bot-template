(a) **Time left until outcome is known:** Approximately 2 months (until January 1, 2025).  
(b) **Status quo outcome:** No ban takes effect before 2025, as the EU’s legislated ban targets 2035[1].  
(c) **No scenario:** No significant regulatory changes occur before 2025, maintaining the 2035 timeline. Recent political pressure (e.g., Germany/Italy’s push to revise the ban[2], EPP proposals[5]) further entrenches this status quo.  
(d) **Yes scenario:** A sudden, unprecedented acceleration of the EU legislative process—bypassing normal procedures—to enforce a pre-2025 ban. This would require near-immediate Council approval, Parliament endorsement, and member state compliance, despite current opposition from major car-producing nations[2][3][5].  

### Rationale  
The 2035 ban remains codified in EU law[1], and recent political shifts favor *relaxing*—not accelerating—this timeline. The EPP, now the largest parliamentary group, explicitly seeks to revise the 2035 ban[5], while Germany and Italy lead efforts to allow carbon-neutral fuels[2][3]. No legislative proposal to advance the ban exists, and even the original 2035 timeline faces delays (e.g., the 2023 Germany-EU compromise[^placeholder]). Given the EU’s slow-moving bureaucracy and deepening political divisions over green policies[4], pre-2025 action is implausible. Probability heavily favors the status quo.  

**Probability: 0%**
