(a) Time until outcome: Approximately 2-3 weeks. According to the information provided, Zillow housing data is updated on the 12th of each month, so November 2024 data should be released on December 12, 2024, which is about 17 days from the current date (November 25, 2024).

(b) Status quo outcome: If current trends continue, the outcome would likely be No. The October 2024 rent report indicates slowing rent growth and high levels of concessions, with an expectation that November will show "continued high levels of concessions and slow year-over-year rent growth."

(c) No outcome scenario: Rental market in Orlando continues to experience the cooling trend seen in recent months. Supply remains high, landlords continue offering concessions to attract tenants, and year-over-year rent growth stays below the 1.0% threshold as part of the broader market correction after previous rapid increases.

(d) Yes outcome scenario: An unexpected surge in rental demand occurs in Orlando, possibly due to seasonal factors, migration patterns, or economic developments specific to the region. This demand outpaces the available supply, allowing landlords to reduce concessions and push rents just above the 1.0% year-over-year growth threshold.

When forecasting the probability of year-over-year rent increase in Orlando, FL being greater than or equal to 1.0% in November 2024, I need to carefully analyze the available data and trends.

## Current Rental Market Trends

The most recent information from Zillow's October 2024 rent report indicates that the rental market is experiencing a significant slowdown. The report specifically mentions that multifamily rents increased by only 2.3% year-over-year, while single-family rents increased more substantially at 4.3%[1]. This suggests that different property types are experiencing different growth rates.

More importantly, the report explicitly states that "November will likely show continued high levels of concessions and slow year-over-year rent growth"[1]. This direct prediction from Zillow themselves is particularly relevant to our forecast.

## Historical Context

Looking at broader rental market trends, we can see that rent inflation has been volatile in recent years. The Zillow Observed Rent Index (ZORI) showed significant increases in early 2023, with month-to-month jumps of 0.6% in April 2023, translating to an annualized increase of 7.4%[5]. However, the more recent October 2024 report suggests this trend has cooled considerably.

## Regional Factors

Orlando's rental market position can be partially understood by examining its price-to-rent ratio. According to the available data, Orlando has a price-to-rent ratio of 15.7, ranking it 22nd among major U.S. cities[2]. While this doesn't directly tell us about year-over-year rent increases, it does suggest Orlando has a relatively balanced market compared to other cities.

For Southeast Florida more broadly (which may have some relevance to Orlando's market), data from May 2024 showed asking rents were rising, driven by a healthy economy, sustained migration, and seasonal demand[4]. However, this data is from six months ago, and the more recent October 2024 Zillow report indicates a cooling trend nationwide.

## Forecasting Considerations

Given the status quo bias that good forecasters should maintain, I need to put significant weight on the current trend of slowing rent growth. Zillow's explicit prediction about November 2024 is particularly compelling evidence.

Several factors make a "No" outcome more likely:
- The explicit prediction from Zillow about November showing "slow year-over-year rent growth"
- The general cooling in the rental market nationwide
- The high levels of concessions being offered to renters

Factors that could support a "Yes" outcome:
- Historical data showing that single-family rents are still growing at 4.3% year-over-year
- Potential seasonal factors in Orlando that might drive demand in November
- Orlando's position as a growing metropolitan area that could experience continued migration

However, the weight of evidence, particularly Zillow's own forecast for November, suggests that the rent increase is more likely to fall below the 1.0% threshold than above it.

Probability: 35%
