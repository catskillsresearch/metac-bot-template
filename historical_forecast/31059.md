(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  
As of December 20, 2024, the relevant New York Times Best Sellers list (cover date January 5, 2025) is expected to be published around December 27, 2024. This means the outcome will be known in approximately 1 week.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
Looking specifically at the prior year, the lists immediately around the turn of the year (December 31, 2023, and January 7, 2024) had 0 and 1 new entrants, respectively. Over the most recent 20 weeks, the number of “New this week” entries on the Hardcover Fiction list has ranged from 1 to 8, with most weeks showing between 3 and 6 new entrants. However, a distinct post-holiday dip is apparent, with near-zero new books for late December and early January in the previous year[2]. If the status quo persists, the most likely number of new entrants is at the low end—either 0, 1, or 2.

(c) **Scenario for an unexpected outcome:**  
While the status quo suggests low turnover, an unexpected outcome could result from several factors:
- A surge in post-holiday releases, either from a major publisher’s new strategy or a clustering of anticipated titles.
- A high-profile author’s embargoed release, which is not typical but not impossible.
- Editorial or methodological changes by The New York Times staff (though no such changes have been reported as of December 20, 2024).
Such events could result in 4, 5, or even more books being tagged “New this week,” though recent history and industry practice make this unlikely[2].

**Rationale:**  
The empirical data for the relevant timeframe—late December and early January—shows far fewer new entries than the average week. The list is partially editorialized, but no announcements suggest a policy shift[1][2]. The list’s inertia and the typical publishing lull around major holidays—when publishers tend to avoid launching new titles—support a strong bias toward the “0-2” option. However, since there is always a non-zero chance of publication anomalies or editorial changes, probabilities should reflect a moderate chance for higher outcomes but put most weight on the low end.

**Final Probabilities:**  
0-2: 70%  
3: 15%  
4: 8%  
5: 5%  
6 or more: 2%
