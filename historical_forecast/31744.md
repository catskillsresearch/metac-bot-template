(a) Time left until outcome: Approximately 1 month and 7 days (from today, May 6, 2025, until the resolution date after February 28, 2025)

(b) Status quo outcome: Based on the search results, the recall appears to have been expanded in October 2024, but its current status is not explicitly stated. If nothing changed, the resolution would depend on whether the recall has already been closed or remains active.

(c) No outcome scenario: The recall remains active beyond March 1, 2025, possibly due to ongoing compliance issues, additional affected products being discovered, or administrative delays in processing the closure of the recall by FSIS.

(d) Yes outcome scenario: The recall was successfully closed before March 1, 2025, after Pork Dynasty Inc. completed all necessary corrective actions, removed affected products from the market, and FSIS verified compliance with recall requirements.

Looking at this forecast question, I need to determine whether the Pork Dynasty Inc. recall of pork skin products initiated on September 27, 2024, was closed before March 1, 2025.

Based on the available search results, I can see that Pork Dynasty Inc., a Houston-based company, recalled approximately 469 pounds of ready-to-eat fried pork skin products due to misbranding and an undeclared soy allergen[1]. The recall was announced by the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) on September 27, 2024[1][2].

According to search result [4], Pork Dynasty Inc. expanded this recall in October 2024 to include shipments to Oklahoma retailers that were not listed in the original recall. This expansion suggests active management of the recall process by the company.

Several factors support the likelihood that this recall was closed before March 1, 2025:

1. **Nature of the recall**: This was a recall due to misbranding and an undeclared allergen, not bacterial contamination or other health hazards that might require extensive investigation[1]. Such labeling issues are typically resolved more quickly than recalls involving pathogen concerns.

2. **Size of the recall**: The recall involved only approximately 469 pounds of product[1], which is relatively small in scale, suggesting easier tracking and retrieval.

3. **Timeframe**: The recall was initiated in September 2024, giving the company approximately 5 months to complete all necessary actions before the March 1, 2025 deadline.

4. **No reported adverse reactions**: The USDA noted that there were no confirmed reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of these products[1], which typically facilitates a faster resolution.

However, I must also consider factors that could have extended the recall:

1. **Recall expansion**: The fact that the recall was expanded in October 2024[4] could potentially have delayed the closure process, as additional product needed to be tracked and removed.

2. **Administrative processes**: FSIS has specific verification procedures that must be completed before a recall can be officially closed, which can sometimes extend timelines.

The search results do not provide explicit information about whether this recall was closed before March 1, 2025. The most recent information in the search results is from December 2, 2024[2][5], which does not indicate the final status of this specific recall.

Given the relatively minor nature of the recall (undeclared allergen), the small amount of product involved, and the typical timeline for such recalls, it seems more likely than not that this recall was closed before March 1, 2025. However, without explicit confirmation, I must acknowledge uncertainty in this forecast.

Probability: 75%
