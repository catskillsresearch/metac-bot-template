(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  
As of October 24, 2024, there are just over two months remaining until January 1, 2025, when the question will resolve.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
The British Museum has not returned any Benin Bronzes to Nigeria to date, citing legal constraints and institutional policy. If current conditions persist, the status quo is that no Benin Bronzes, let alone 200, will be physically transferred from the British Museum to Nigeria before the deadline[1][5].

(c) **Scenario for a No outcome:**  
Legal, institutional, and political obstacles persist. The British Museum continues to cite the British Museum Act (1963), which generally prohibits the permanent removal or transfer of collection items. No new legislation or urgent policy directive enabling large-scale repatriation emerges. Internal disagreements within Nigeria over custodianship, as well as Western concerns about museum standards in Nigeria, further slow or halt negotiations[1][2]. As a result, fewer than 200—indeed, zero—British Museum Benin Bronzes are physically sent to Nigeria before January 1, 2025.

(d) **Scenario for a Yes outcome:**  
A dramatic and rapid shift occurs—perhaps a sudden political or diplomatic agreement, new UK legislation affecting the British Museum’s legal constraints, or an extraordinary policy intervention. The British Museum not only agrees to repatriate but also physically transfers at least 200 Benin Bronzes to Nigeria, with all legal and logistical hurdles swiftly overcome. This would likely require coordinated action at the highest levels of both the UK and Nigerian governments, as well as an unprecedented change in museum governance and law within a very short timeframe.

## Rationale

The overwhelming weight of evidence supports the *status quo* outcome. The British Museum continues to refuse the return of the Benin Bronzes, explicitly citing legal limitations[1][5]. Other institutions have initiated or completed returns, but the British Museum stands apart due to the unique legal and institutional constraints it faces, acknowledged as recently as mid-2023, with no public sign of imminent change[1]. Current UK law restricts the Museum's ability to permanently deaccession and repatriate items in its collection.

Furthermore, the broader political, legal, and diplomatic landscape is moving slowly. Even as international and ethical pressure mounts, actual returns of Benin Bronzes—when they occur—are typically in small numbers and from museums or institutions with more flexibility than the British Museum. No credible reports suggest a move toward a mass transfer, let alone the return of 200 objects, is underway[1][2][5]. Meanwhile, internal debates within Nigeria and concerns raised by some western institutions regarding the fate and management of returned objects further complicate the negotiation process[2].

Given the short time window, the entrenched legal and institutional position of the British Museum, and the lack of any signal of an imminent large-scale return, the probability of at least 200 Benin Bronzes going from the British Museum to Nigeria before January 1, 2025, is extremely low.

Probability: 1%
