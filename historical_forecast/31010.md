(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
Today is May 6, 2025. The tweet counts for December 21–30, 2024, will be drawn from Social Blade at some point after December 30, 2024. Since this period has already passed, the outcome can be known as soon as Metaculus Admins access and confirm the Social Blade figures.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
Elon Musk (@elonmusk) is overwhelmingly likely to send out more tweets in the 10-day period from December 21–30, 2024, than either The New York Times (@nytimes) or The Economist (@TheEconomist). Musk averaged about 101 tweets per day between October and November 2024, a rate vastly higher than the typical frequency of institutional accounts like The New York Times or The Economist, which are generally more restrained in posting[1]. There is no evidence of a slowdown or changes in Musk's posting behavior and no platform policy changes affecting any of these accounts. If all three accounts continue on their observed trajectories, Musk’s volume in this period will far exceed either of the media organizations[1].

(c) **Scenario for an unexpected outcome:**  
An unexpected outcome could plausibly occur if Elon Musk deactivates or suspends his account, takes a digital break, or otherwise stops posting during this time due to personal, legal, or business reasons. For example, if Musk unexpectedly decides to take a 10-day hiatus—whether due to technical issues, a self-imposed digital detox, or external pressures like regulatory intervention—this would sharply reduce his tweet count. Alternatively, if X undergoes a major outage or implements a sudden platform-wide change restricting high-frequency users, this could also affect the result. Conversely, The New York Times or The Economist could dramatically increase their tweet volume due to a major global news event requiring rapid coverage, potentially narrowing the gap.

## Rationale

Historical patterns and recent data overwhelmingly favor Elon Musk. He posts at a rate (roughly 101 tweets per day) an order of magnitude higher than the institutional accounts in question[1]. Good forecasters heavily weight the status quo, as change tends to be incremental and sudden reversals in social media behavior without warning are rare. However, all forecasts must retain moderate probability weight for outlier events—platform disruptions, policy changes, or personal decisions that could dramatically reduce Musk’s tweet volume or, less likely, spike that of the New York Times or The Economist.

## Probabilities

Elon Musk: @elonmusk: 94%  
The NY Times: @nytimes: 4%  
The Economist: @TheEconomist: 2%
