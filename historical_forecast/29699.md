(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  
There are approximately 24 days remaining before the December 1, 2024, deadline for this forecast to resolve.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
In the 2022 midterms, Adam Gray did not concede until December 3—after the December 1 cutoff—due to the extremely close vote count and slow process of finalizing California election results[1]. As of November 7, 2024, this year’s contest between John Duarte (R) and Adam Gray (D) is again “too close to call,” with the vote count ongoing and the district known for tight results and drawn-out tabulation[1][2].

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
If the race remains tight, as in 2022, and the vote count is not clearly decisive for either candidate before December 1, both Duarte and Gray are likely to avoid conceding. This outcome is especially likely if margins remain slim and key votes (such as late-arriving mail-in ballots) are still being tallied when the deadline arrives[1].

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
If, in contrast, the margin of victory becomes clearly decisive for one candidate within the first few weeks after Election Day (for example, if a wave of vote counts provides an insurmountable lead for either Duarte or Gray), then the losing candidate may concede before December 1. Such a scenario generally requires a result clearly outside the margin of a recount or challenge[1].

## Rationale

California’s 13th Congressional District has an established pattern of slow and close election outcomes, driven by a high share of mail-in ballots, complex vote processing, and recent history of razor-thin margins[1][2]. Both 2022 and 2024 feature the same major party candidates, a rematch between Duarte and Gray, and the same competitive dynamics.

Given the result in 2022—when concession occurred after December 1—and the district’s ongoing “too close to call” status as of November 7, plus California’s notoriously lengthy vote tabulation process, the default expectation should be that concession will again occur after December 1 barring a dramatic change in the result’s clarity. Rapid concession before December 1 does occur in less competitive districts, but all available evidence suggests CA-13 will likely mirror its most recent precedent.

Therefore, extra weight must be placed on the status quo—slow counting and a late concession. While a landslide or unexpectedly rapid count is possible, there is no current evidence to suggest this is developing in 2024[1][2].
