(a) **Time until outcome is known:**  
Approximately 6 weeks remain until September 30, 2024.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changes:**  
No large-scale riot (as defined: 50+ deaths, or 10,000+ arrests, or $1B+ property damage in a single local event over 14 days) occurs. Such incidents are extremely rare in recent U.S. history, and despite recent high-profile civil unrest (e.g., January 6, 2021), none have met the outlined criteria.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
Major political events—the Republican and Democratic national conventions—proceed with strong security presence, protests occur but remain within historical norms (some violence/arrests, but far below threshold). Extremist chatter does not materialize into mass violence; law enforcement manages to prevent escalation. No triggering event (e.g., high-profile assassination, terrorist attack, legal verdict with nationwide outrage) catalyzes collective action of the necessary scale.

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
A highly polarizing event (e.g., assassination of a prominent political figure, large-scale terror attack, provocative legal verdict involving Donald Trump) ignites a violent response. In a single metro area—likely Milwaukee or Chicago around convention time—protest and counter-protest spiral into days of sustained rioting. Security forces respond forcefully, leading to dozens of deaths and/or mass arrests and/or mass property destruction with credible damages eclipsing $1 billion, all within a 100km radius over less than 14 days. News agencies and government confirm threshold numbers.

## Rationale

Recent expert analysis consistently signals heightened risk of political violence in the U.S. during the late summer of 2024 due to:
- High-profile party conventions in Milwaukee (July) and Chicago (August)
- Ongoing legal proceedings involving Trump
- Intensified polarization and rhetoric about potential violence if certain political outcomes materialize[2][3][5]

Federal agencies, including the FBI and DHS, have issued warnings about potential for coordinated attacks or flashpoints catalyzed by the election cycle[2][3].

However, there are several factors making a "large-scale riot" (by the strict definition) unlikely:
- The January 6, 2021 Capitol attack (a recent high-water mark for modern political violence) did not reach any single outcome threshold for a "large-scale riot" as defined here.
- Urban-rural polarization and fragmentation of extremist groups limit the capacity for coordinated, sustained violence in a single locality[2].
- Law enforcement across the U.S. is on elevated alert and is preparing for these dates well in advance, decreasing the odds of situation spiraling out of control.
- While increased threats and intimidation are likely (especially at conventions and perhaps at polling locations later in the year), most expert assessments expect "some level of violence" but not to the level of a 1992 LA Riots-scale event[2][3][5].
- Historical precedent is a powerful guide: only a handful of U.S. riots in history have ever reached such extreme death, arrest, or property damage thresholds, and none have occurred in recent decades.

Taken together, the base rate for such a large event is extremely low, and even with elevated triggers and risk factors, the probability of a single qualifying event remains modest.

## Final Answer

Probability: **5%**

- This reflects a small but non-negligible chance, given the convergence of risk factors, but is anchored in the rarity of prior qualifying events and the preparedness of law enforcement for these specific threats[2][3][5]. The most likely outcome is protests and isolated violence, but not an event that meets any of the strict "large-scale riot" thresholds.
