(a) **Time until earnings outcome is known:**  
Nvidia is scheduled to announce Q4 FY2025 earnings on February 26, 2025. Today is May 6, 2025, so the announcement occurred 69 days ago. The official outcome should already be public, but for contest timing purposes, assume the outcome was unknown as of February 17, 2025. Thus, from that date, the time left was approximately 9 days.

(b) **Outcome if nothing changed:**  
If Nvidia’s Q4 FY2025 diluted EPS simply matched Q3 FY2025’s result, the figure would be $0.78[2][5].

(c) **Outcome if current trend continued:**  
EPS in recent quarters grew rapidly:
- Q1 FY2025: $0.61
- Q2 FY2025: $0.68 (up 12% QoQ)
- Q3 FY2025: $0.78 (up 15% QoQ)[2][5]

If Q4 followed a similar sequential growth, applying ~12% QoQ growth to $0.78 yields approximately $0.87.

(d) **Expectations of experts and markets:**  
- Analyst consensus for Q4 FY2025 GAAP diluted EPS is $0.79–$0.89, with market-implied medians around $0.87[5].
- Revenue consensus is $32.5 billion, though some bullish outliers exist (e.g., $39.3 billion)[4][5].
- The Metaculus forecasting community median as of February 4, 2025, was $0.873, with a 25th–75th percentile range of $0.836–$0.91[5].
- Most experts expect robust results, but there is some caution due to recent concerns over Chinese AI competitors and the exact timing of Blackwell GPU revenue impact[4][5].

(e) **Unexpected scenario resulting in a low outcome:**  
A low-end surprise could result from:
- Major shipment delays, supply chain disruptions, or inventory corrections by hyperscale customers, leading to missed revenue and margin targets.
- An unexpected shift in accounting or a large one-time expense (e.g., legal settlement, regulatory fine).
- Faster-than-anticipated inroads by Chinese AI rivals leading to order cancellations or severe pricing pressure late in the quarter.
In such a case, EPS could drop to around $0.82–$0.84, nearer the bottom end of consensus but still above prior-year comps, barring outright disaster.

(f) **Unexpected scenario resulting in a high outcome:**  
A high-end surprise would result from:
- Exceptionally strong upside in Data Center revenue, with hyperscalers front-loading AI capex and Blackwell GPU revenue recognized earlier or in greater volume than expected.
- Materially higher-than-expected gross margins due to product mix or lower input costs.
- Favorable tax or accounting adjustments.
This could push GAAP EPS to $0.92–$0.94, at or slightly above the high end of expert ranges.

## Final Forecast

Given the strong uptrend, consensus forecasts, and potential for both positive and negative surprises, a reasonable 90/10 distribution is:

Percentile 10: 0.83  
Percentile 20: 0.84  
Percentile 40: 0.86  
Percentile 60: 0.88  
Percentile 80: 0.90  
Percentile 90: 0.92
