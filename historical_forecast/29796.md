(a) **Time left:**  
As of November 8, 2024, there are just under eight weeks (about 54 days) until January 1, 2025, when the question's outcome will be definitively known.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
Matt Eberflus remains the Chicago Bears head coach through January 1, 2025. The Bears have not historically fired head coaches midseason, and recent reporting strongly indicates management plans to keep him for the rest of the 2024 season[1][4].

(c) **Scenario that results in a No outcome:**  
Eberflus stays on as head coach through January 1, 2025. This is the expected scenario if the team maintains its current course, regardless of win-loss record, and the front office sticks to its recent statements of backing Eberflus until season’s end[1][4].

(d) **Scenario that results in a Yes outcome:**  
Eberflus is removed before the new year due to an extreme sequence of poor performances, a dramatic incident (e.g., a locker room revolt, scandal), or a significant organizational shift that leads ownership or GM Ryan Poles to break with precedent and make an in-season coaching change.

## Rationale

Multiple credible reports as of early November 2024 indicate the Chicago Bears front office intends to retain Matt Eberflus as head coach at least through the remainder of the current season[1][4]. General manager Ryan Poles is reported to have made a “final decision” to keep Eberflus, and speculation about Eberflus’s five-year contract further supports a front office preference for stability and honoring existing deals[1][2][4][5].

The organization has *never* fired a head coach midseason in its history—a strong status quo bias reinforced by the Bears’ tradition and ownership culture. Concerns about paying multiple head coaches concurrently are likely minimized by the franchise’s commitment to “doing things the right way,” as recent comments suggest money is not a critical factor[5].

While Eberflus’s record (e.g., 3-17 on the road, 14-27 overall) and fan frustration are noteworthy[3], the reporting consensus is that he will be evaluated after the season rather than during it. The only plausible path to an early dismissal would require a catastrophic on- and off-field breakdown, which—while possible in the NFL—is rare for this organization[1][4].

Given how forecasts should respect inertia and organizational precedent unless confronted with overwhelming contrary evidence, the probability of Eberflus being fired before January 1, 2025 remains low.

**Probability: 10%**
