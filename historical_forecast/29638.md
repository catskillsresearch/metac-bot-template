(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
As of November 6, 2024, there are approximately 56 days remaining until January 1, 2025, when the question will be resolved.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
No exchanges of weapon fire between the national military or law enforcement forces of the Republic of China (Taiwan) and the People's Republic of China have resulted in any deaths, much less 100[3][5]. If current trends hold and the situation remains as it has been, the question resolves as **No**.

(c) **Scenario that results in a No outcome:**  
Continued military posturing and psychological pressure by the PRC—such as ADIZ incursions, naval and air exercises, and diplomatic intimidation—persist without escalation to direct, lethal armed conflict. Occasional maritime or airspace incidents may occur (e.g., interception maneuvers, political crises, or maritime collisions involving civilians or non-military personnel) but do not result in exchanges of weapon fire causing 100 deaths among national military or law enforcement forces[3][5].

(d) **Scenario that results in a Yes outcome:**  
A sudden and dramatic military escalation—such as a miscalculation during a PRC exercise, an accidental or deliberate exchange of fire in the Taiwan Strait or around outlying islands (e.g., Kinmen, Matsu)—results in a battle between PRC and ROC military or law enforcement personnel. This could include missile strikes, naval engagements, or a direct amphibious assault, with casualties rapidly exceeding 100 due to the scale and lethality of modern weaponry[1]. Multiple credible news and government sources would need to report such an incident for resolution as "Yes."

## Rationale

- So far in 2024, tensions have remained high, but all deadly incidents (such as the February Kinmen speedboat crash) have involved civilians, not exchanges of weapon fire between national armed forces[3][5].
- The most common PRC tactics remain diplomatic pressure, economic coercion, and large-scale—but non-lethal—military demonstrations near Taiwan[5].
- No credible government or international news reports indicate exchanges of weapon fire with any fatalities, much less mass casualties, between the two states as of November 6, 2024[3][5].
- Most expert and analytic sources forecast that, while the risk of miscalculation exists, Beijing’s current strategy is more focused on psychological warfare and gradual escalation than on initiating a high-intensity armed conflict that would almost certainly cross the “100 deaths” threshold very rapidly if it occurred[2][5][1].
- The international and domestic costs for the PRC of starting an armed conflict on this scale in the next two months would be exceptionally high, especially in the wake of Taiwan’s recent presidential transition and ongoing global attention[5].
- The passage of time without such an incident—despite elevated tensions—strengthens the probability that the status quo (no 100+ death conflict) will persist through the end of 2024.
