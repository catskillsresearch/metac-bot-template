I'll analyze this forecast question carefully.

(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known: Approximately 10 months and 25 days (from May 6, 2025 to April 1, 2025). However, since the question is asking about events before April 1, 2025, which is in the past relative to the current date (May 6, 2025), the outcome should already be determined.

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed: Based on the search results, there is no indication that the US has accused China of blockading Taiwan before April 1, 2025. The outcome appears to be "No."

(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome: The US continued to observe China's military exercises, gray-zone tactics, and provocations around Taiwan but did not formally characterize any of these actions as a "blockade" of Taiwan's seaports before April 1, 2025.

(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome: If China had escalated its military activities from exercises to actually preventing commercial or military vessels from accessing Taiwan's seaports, and the US government had publicly labeled this action as a "blockade" before April 1, 2025.

Looking at the available evidence, I see no indication that the United States has accused China of blockading Taiwan's seaports before April 1, 2025. The search results provide information up to January 24, 2025, and there is no mention of an actual blockade or US accusations of a blockade.

While tensions have remained high in the Taiwan Strait, the information available shows that China's actions have primarily consisted of:

1. Military drills and exercises that simulate blockades, but are not actual blockades themselves[2][3].
2. Incidents involving undersea cables to Taiwan's offshore islands[3].
3. Budget cuts imposed by Taiwan's KMT-led legislature that might affect Taiwan's defense capabilities[3].
4. Continued "gray zone" pressure tactics that fall short of a formal blockade.

US military and intelligence officials have expressed concerns about China's capabilities and intentions regarding Taiwan, with some assessments suggesting China could be ready for military action as early as 2025[4]. However, there is no evidence in the search results that China actually implemented a blockade of Taiwan's seaports or that the US formally accused China of doing so before April 1, 2025.

The Pentagon has warned China about the potential costs of a blockade, with Assistant Secretary Ely Ratner stating in October 2023 that "The cost for Beijing looks very high, and the risk looks very, very high"[2]. This suggests the US was trying to deter such action rather than responding to an actual blockade.

Given that we are now past the resolution date (April 1, 2025) and no evidence has been presented that the US accused China of blockading Taiwan before that date, the forecasting question resolves to "No."

Probability: 1%

(I assign a very low but non-zero probability to account for the small possibility that such an accusation occurred but was not captured in the search results provided.)
