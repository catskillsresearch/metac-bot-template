(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  
There are approximately 1.5 months (mid-February to April 1, 2025) remaining before the question’s resolution date.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
As of the current date (February 13, 2025), neither Donald Trump nor Donald Trump Jr. has made plans or announcements about visiting Greenland after Donald Trump Jr.’s visit on January 7, 2025[1]. If no new visits occur, the question would resolve as **No**.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
Neither Donald Trump nor Donald Trump Jr. travels to Greenland before April 1, 2025, and no official or media reports confirm such a visit. Travel schedules remain unchanged, and no private or public trips materialize.

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
Either Donald Trump or Donald Trump Jr. undertakes a trip to Greenland before April 1, 2025. This could be for official, political, or private reasons, and the visit is confirmed by credible sources such as government statements or major news outlets.

## Rationale

- The **status quo** heavily favors a No outcome, as there have been no announced plans or credible indications of an imminent visit by either individual since the January trip by Donald Trump Jr.[1].
- Presidential and high-profile private travel tends to generate advance notice, especially for controversial or geopolitically sensitive destinations like Greenland. No such reports have surfaced[1].
- While last-minute, privately arranged travel is possible—especially for Donald Trump Jr., as demonstrated in January—such trips are rare and hard to predict.
- The January visit by Donald Trump Jr. appeared isolated and not part of a series, further lowering expectations of another quick return[1].
- President Trump’s strategic interest in Greenland remains, but this has not yet translated into known travel plans.
- The time window is now short (about 6 weeks), so every day without relevant announcements or public signals further decreases the likelihood of a visit.

## Final Forecast
