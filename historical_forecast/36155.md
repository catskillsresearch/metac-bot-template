(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
The current date is May 6, 2025. The search results do not confirm that the 36th Annual GLAAD Media Awards ceremony has occurred or that winners have been announced[1][2][4]. The most recent information is about submissions closing in November 2024 and no winner announcement is referenced. Therefore, the outcome is **not yet known** and will be determined at the 36th GLAAD Media Awards ceremony, at a date yet to be announced[1].

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
Historically, Max (formerly HBO Max) titles have been frequent nominees for the Outstanding Comedy Series award, and for the 36th GLAAD Media Awards, Max has three strong contenders: *Hacks*, *The Sex Lives of College Girls*, and *Sort Of*. However, there is no precedent or guarantee that a Max show will win, as other networks and streaming platforms also compete and have won in the past[2]. The status quo is that a Max show is 'one of the favorites' but not the default winner.

(c) **Scenario that results in a No outcome:**  
A **No** outcome occurs if the winner of Outstanding Comedy Series is a show that is not on Max. This could easily happen if, for example, a show from Netflix, Hulu, ABC, or another network/platform is judged by GLAAD’s voters and review panel to offer a more impactful, bold, or culturally resonant LGBTQ representation in line with the award criteria[2][5].

(d) **Scenario that results in a Yes outcome:**  
A **Yes** outcome occurs if *any* Max show (e.g., *Hacks*, *The Sex Lives of College Girls*, or *Sort Of*) is announced as the winner. This would mean GLAAD’s voters and review panel found the Max show to best meet the criteria of fair and inclusive LGBTQ representation, boldness and originality, cultural impact, and overall quality.

## Rationale

Max is well-represented, with three nominees in the category, giving it a numerical edge over most rivals at the 36th GLAAD Media Awards. However, the winner selection process is competitive and subject to GLAAD’s multifactor evaluation (representation, originality, impact, quality), and other platforms are also historically strong contenders. Since as of this date there is no announcement of the winner, the outcome remains uncertain. Historically, being a nominee is not a guarantee of a win, and GLAAD has recognized shows from a variety of networks.

Given the plurality of Max nominations, the platform has a higher chance than most single competitors. But with the award's competitive nature and the possibility of a standout show from another network, it's not a certainty. Traditionally, forecasters overweight the status quo, and the default should not be that a Max show wins unless evidence shows an overwhelming advantage or a winner announcement.

**Probability: 50%**
