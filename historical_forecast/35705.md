(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
There are approximately 25 days remaining until April 1, 2025, when this forecast question will resolve.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changes:**  
Donald Trump has not visited Russia since the launch of this question, and there are no public announcements or reports of any planned trip to Russia before April 1, 2025[3][5]. If this situation remains unchanged, the outcome will be No.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
Trump continues to engage with Russia predominantly through phone calls, intermediaries, and delegations. No official visit is announced or takes place in Russia before April 1, 2025. Instead, diplomatic efforts focus on remote negotiations and summits in third countries[2][5].

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
A sudden change in diplomatic necessities or a breakthrough in Ukraine peace talks leads Trump to make a last-minute, high-profile visit to Russia. This would be publicly announced and widely reported by global media. Currently, there is no sign of such a scenario unfolding[3].

## Rationale

Recent months have seen heightened diplomatic activity between the U.S. and Russia, mostly related to Ukraine and resource deals[2]. However, this engagement has primarily taken the form of phone calls between leaders[5], talks led by envoys, and reports of negotiations through intermediaries, not face-to-face presidential summits on Russian soil. Trump recently denied rumors of an upcoming visit to Moscow, specifically dismissing reports he would travel for the May 9 Victory Day Parade[3]. There have been no subsequent public reports or credible leaks indicating a scheduled Russia visit before April 1.

The status quo is for presidents to avoid unannounced, abrupt trips to major rival powers, especially when high-stakes negotiations are ongoing and the optics are closely watched. While unforeseen events could alter these calculations, the absence of evidence for a trip—combined with Trump's explicit denial[3]—makes a visit highly unlikely in the remaining time frame.

## Final Answer

Probability: 3%
