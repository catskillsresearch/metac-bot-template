Based on the available information, I'll analyze when Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin are likely to meet in person.

(a) Time left until the outcome is known:
The outcome will be known when Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin actually meet in person, which has not happened yet as of May 6, 2025. There is no definitive timeline established, so we are still waiting for this event to occur.

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed:
The status quo is that Trump and Putin have had one phone call on February 12, 2025, where they discussed potential future meetings, but no specific date has been set. Trump mentioned he "might meet" Putin in Saudi Arabia but emphasized continuing phone contact in the meantime. If nothing changes, the meeting would not happen in the immediate future.

(c) Scenario resulting in an unexpected outcome:
An unexpected outcome would be a meeting occurring very soon, perhaps in May 2025. This could happen if there is a sudden diplomatic breakthrough regarding Ukraine that necessitates immediate face-to-face negotiations, or if a major international crisis emerges that requires direct coordination between the US and Russia. In such a scenario, the logistics of arranging a high-level summit might be expedited beyond the typical timeframe.

## Rationale for Forecast

Looking at the evidence available as of February 12, 2025 (the cutoff date for the information), we can see that Trump and Putin have only recently established communication after Trump took office. Their first phone call occurred on February 12, where they discussed Ukraine settlement, prisoner exchange, and other bilateral issues[1][2].

During this call, Putin invited Trump to Moscow, and Trump later told reporters he might meet Putin in Saudi Arabia, potentially with the Saudi crown prince present[2]. However, Trump did not specify a timeline and explicitly stated he would "deal with Putin on the phone in the meantime"[2]. This strongly suggests that no immediate in-person meeting was planned as of mid-February.

The Kremlin's readout confirms both leaders "agreed to maintain personal contact in the future, involving in particular in-person meetings"[1]. The phrasing indicates intent but not immediacy.

Considering that high-level diplomatic meetings between world leaders, especially those with complex relationships like the US and Russia, typically require:
- Extensive advance planning (often 1-3 months minimum)
- Detailed agenda setting
- Security arrangements
- Diplomatic groundwork

It would be unusual (though not impossible) for such a meeting to materialize within just a few weeks of initial contact.

Since we're now in May 2025, we already know that February and March 2025 have passed without a meeting. The status quo suggests continued communication by phone, with an in-person meeting likely occurring only after substantial diplomatic preparation.

As a good forecaster, I acknowledge that the status quo typically continues, but I must also account for unexpected developments. The thawing relationship between the US and Russia, evidenced by the prisoner swap and phone call, could accelerate plans for a meeting.

## Final Probabilities

February 2025: 0%
March 2025: 0%
Not before April 2025: 100%
