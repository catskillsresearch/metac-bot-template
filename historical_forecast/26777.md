(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
The outcome will be determined after the third quarter concludes on September 30, 2024, and once EPA data is available (likely by October 2, 2024). As of today (August 1, 2024), there are precisely two full months left in Q3, so about 2 months until resolution.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
As of July 29, 2024, there has been 1 day in Q3 with AQI above 150 (July 5, AQI 166). If no further days above 150 AQI occur, the total will remain at 1 day, and the answer will be "No" to the question of whether there are **2 to 5 days** above 150.

(c) **Scenario for a No outcome:**  
A "No" would occur if either:
- There is only 1 or 0 days with AQI >150 (i.e., no further major wildfire smoke events reach the surface in the Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue metro area during August and September), or
- There are 6 or more days with AQI >150 (requiring an unusually severe smoke season with prolonged events, exceeding the 2–5 day window).

(d) **Scenario for a Yes outcome:**  
A "Yes" would occur if, between now and the end of September, there are 1 to 4 more days with AQI above 150 (since 1 day is already recorded, reaching a total of 2–5 days in Q3). This would generally require 1–2 moderate smoke events or a handful of days with more intense smoke, both of which are possible given the region's wildfire susceptibility in August and September.

## Rationale

The Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue area’s history shows that Q3 regularly has between 2 and 5 days with AQI over 150, although there’s considerable variability with years well above and below this range. Notably, in 7 of the last 10 years, there have been *at least* 2 days above 150 AQI in Q3. The outlier years (0 days in 2014, 2019) were ones with unusually low fire activity or favorable weather patterns.

**Wildfire and Smoke Outlook for 2024:**  
The 2024 wildfire outlook suggests a *slightly more active than normal* season for Washington and British Columbia, with the highest risk period still ahead—August and September[2]. This aligns with the historical pattern: most high-AQI days happen late in summer, and the bulk of wildfire smoke events typically occur after July.

**Recent and Short-Term Developments:**  
- As of August 1, another plume of wildfire smoke is expected to reach Seattle as soon as Friday, August 2, 2024[3]. The severity is uncertain; meteorologists note that whether smoke impacts AQI at ground level will depend on atmospheric conditions. If the smoke stays aloft, impacts will be minor. If it mixes down, AQI could quickly rise above 150, even for one or two days[3].
- Forecasting beyond a few days remains inherently uncertain due to the variable nature of wildfires and wind patterns[2][3].

**Long-Term Trends:**  
2024 is part of a multi-year trend of worsening wildfires and more frequent poor air quality episodes in the region[1][5]. This increases the background probability of more than one AQI>150 event in late summer.

**Role of Status Quo:**  
With 1 day already logged and the peak fire season ahead, the *status quo* (no further AQI>150 days) is unlikely. Historical precedent—coupled with ongoing smoke risks—suggests 1–4 more such days are plausible, but a string of clear, wind-favorable, or rain-prone weeks could keep totals at or near 1.

## Final Probability Estimate

Given:
- The normal distribution of 2–5 high AQI days during Q3 in recent years,
- The regional fire outlook indicating elevated risk for late summer smoke,
- The fact that only 1 day is logged thus far and most high-AQI days historically occur in August and September,
- Short-term smoke episodes are forecast in early August, with further risk throughout the season[2][3],

**Probability: 65%**

This reflects the higher likelihood that 1–4 more days with AQI>150 will occur, but also accounts for the real possibility that favorable weather or a less severe fire season leads to no further such days. The risk of exceeding 5 days is lower but not negligible, especially in an unusually severe fire year, but is less likely given outlooks and past frequencies.
