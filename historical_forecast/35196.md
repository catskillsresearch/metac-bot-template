(a) **Time left until the outcome is known**:  
From the current date (May 6, 2025) to the resolution date (April 1, 2025), the outcome would already be known if reviewing contemporaneously. But as this is a forecast made using only information available up to February 20, 2025, the time until the outcome would be approximately 1.5 months from that reference point.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed**:  
As of the latest pre-February 20, 2025 sources, nitroglycerin injection is *listed as in shortage through at least April 29, 2025* on some major U.S. drug shortage monitoring services[1]. Historically, nitroglycerin injection has been prone to periodic shortages[3].

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome**:  
A No outcome occurs if, by April 1, 2025, the FDA has determined that the nitroglycerin injection shortage has resolved—likely due to new supplies entering the market, ramped-up production, or new manufacturers becoming available, and thus the drug is *not* listed as "Currently in Shortage" on the FDA database on that date.

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome**:  
A Yes outcome occurs if, on April 1, 2025, the FDA lists nitroglycerin injection as "Currently in Shortage." This could be due to ongoing manufacturing, supply chain, or raw material issues that have not been resolved, continuing historical patterns of shortage, or other disruptions in supply[1][3].

## Rationale

Nitroglycerin injection has a history of intermittent shortages, often due to manufacturing delays, discontinuation by certain suppliers (e.g., Hospira), or raw material constraints[3]. The most recent public data, as of February 2025, show that nitroglycerin injection is projected to be in shortage at least through April 29, 2025[1]. Although drug shortages can sometimes resolve faster than expected, the inertia in pharmaceutical supply chains generally means that status quo conditions—especially for drugs with documented, persistent supply issues—often persist for several months.

Given that:
- The most current shortage report (as of February 2025) anticipates the shortage continuing through late April 2025[1].
- There is no evidence, as of February 2025, suggesting a rapid resolution or new manufacturer entering the market.
- Industry-wide drug shortages are considered especially severe at this time, increasing the risk for continued shortage[3].

The weight of evidence is on the status quo—continued shortage—persisting through April 1, 2025.

Probability: **90%**  
Nitroglycerin injections will be in shortage according to the FDA on April 1, 2025[1][3].
