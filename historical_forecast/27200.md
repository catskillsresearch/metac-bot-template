As a professional forecaster, I'll analyze this question systematically:

(a) Time left until the outcome is known: 17 days (from May 6, 2025 to August 23, 2024 - this appears to be a past date from our current perspective)

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: No cases of Clade I mpox have been reported in U.S. residents as of the available information.

(c) Scenario for No outcome: Travel restrictions, enhanced screening, and public health measures effectively prevent any infected individuals from entering the U.S., or cases remain undetected/unconfirmed until after August 23, 2024.

(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: An infected traveler from one of the affected regions in Africa enters the U.S., develops symptoms, seeks medical attention, and the CDC confirms the case as Clade I mpox through laboratory testing before August 23, 2024.

Based on the available search results, I can provide a comprehensive analysis of the likelihood of the CDC confirming a case of Clade I mpox in a U.S. resident before August 23, 2024.

## Current Status of Clade I Mpox Spread

As of the available data, Clade I mpox has been primarily contained within central and eastern Africa. The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) reported multiple provincial-level outbreaks between January 1, 2023, and April 14, 2024, with 19,919 suspected cases and 975 deaths (4.9% fatality rate)[1]. This is significantly more severe than the Clade II variant that was responsible for the 2022-2023 global outbreak.

In April 2024, confirmed Clade I mpox cases were reported in the Central African Republic (CAR) and Republic of Congo (ROC), and by late July 2024, cases were confirmed in Rwanda and Uganda[3]. This geographical expansion is concerning as it shows the virus is spreading to new countries in the region.

## U.S. Mpox Situation

In contrast to Clade I, the United States has only experienced Clade II mpox cases. Between October 1, 2023, and April 30, 2024, a total of 1,802 probable and confirmed mpox cases (Clade II) were reported to the CDC from 42 states and other jurisdictions[2]. The CDC explicitly states that "no cases of clade I MPXV have been reported" in the United States[2].

By June 30, 2024, the U.S. had reported a cumulative total of 33,235 mpox cases and 59 deaths since the beginning of the 2022 outbreak[5]. These were all Clade II cases.

## Risk Factors and CDC Response

The CDC has recognized the threat posed by Clade I mpox and has taken preparedness measures. The agency is supporting the DRC's response and has initiated public health preparedness activities in the U.S.[1][4]. This includes alerting healthcare providers to be vigilant for potential cases, especially in patients who have recently traveled to affected regions.

Several factors would need to align for a Clade I mpox case to be confirmed in a U.S. resident by August 23, 2024:

1. An infected individual would need to travel from an affected region to the U.S.
2. The infection would need to be detected and correctly identified as Clade I (rather than Clade II)
3. The CDC would need to confirm the case through their official channels
4. All of this would need to happen within the specified timeframe

## Probability Assessment

The status quo is that no Clade I mpox cases have been reported in the U.S. While the geographical spread within Africa is concerning, several factors reduce the likelihood of a U.S. case in the short term:

- Enhanced awareness and surveillance at entry points
- The relatively limited timeframe (just over two weeks)
- The fact that Clade I had not spread outside Africa as of the latest information

However, factors increasing the risk include:

- Unprecedented scale of the current outbreak in DRC
- Geographic expansion to multiple neighboring countries previously unaffected
- International travel connections between affected regions and the U.S.

Given the status quo of no cases in the U.S., the relatively short timeframe until August 23, 2024, and the current geographic containment within Africa, while acknowledging the concerning spread pattern and the CDC's preparedness actions, I assess that a U.S. case by August 23, 2024 is possible but not highly likely.

Probability: 25%
