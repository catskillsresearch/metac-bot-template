(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  
As of the last available data (March 31, 2025), the resolution date—January 1, 2025—has already passed. However, if evaluating as of October 23, 2024 (the data cutoff for this forecast), the time remaining until January 1, 2025, would be about 2 months and 1 week.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
BigBear.ai would not file for bankruptcy before January 1, 2025, based on its then-recent liquidity, operational improvements, and management's guidance.

(c) **Scenario that results in a No outcome:**  
BigBear.ai manages to operate through the rest of 2024 without filing any petition for bankruptcy protection in U.S. courts. The company's substantial cash reserves and recent cost management enable it to meet obligations, and no severe, unforeseen negative event forces an urgent insolvency petition.

(d) **Scenario that results in a Yes outcome:**  
A rapid, unexpected negative event occurs (such as the loss of a major contract, a substantial legal judgment, inability to raise further capital, or a dramatic acceleration in cash burn) that exhausts BigBear.ai’s liquidity runway and compels a bankruptcy filing prior to January 1, 2025.

## Rationale

- **Financial Position:**  
  As of March 31, 2024, BigBear.ai held $81.4 million in cash, a strong position relative to its quarterly losses and likely sufficient to cover several quarters of operations even amid continued losses[2]. The company also raised an additional $54 million from the exercise of warrants in Q1 2024[2].

- **Operating Trends:**  
  While BigBear.ai continues to operate at a net loss (with a net loss of $61.99 million reported in Q1 2025[5]), cost-cutting efforts are ongoing, and the company has shown improvement in adjusted EBITDA. Management has reported positive cash flows from operations for the first time in late 2023 and affirmed continued positive adjusted EBITDA into 2024[3].

- **Strategic Initiatives:**  
  The acquisition of Pangiam and continued innovation in AI and vision technologies signal active efforts to expand the company’s market reach and improve future prospects[3].

- **Fundamental Risk:**  
  Although the Altman Z-Score and Piotroski Score (which assess bankruptcy and financial distress risk) are not provided in detail, the fundamental risks remain elevated due to unprofitability and declining revenues. However, the core cushion is the cash balance and the absence of any signals indicating imminent liquidity collapse through Q1 2024.

- **No Public Bankruptcy Filings:**  
  As of all available reporting before October 23, 2024, there is no evidence of any bankruptcy petition filed by BigBear.ai[1][2][3][5].

**Professional forecasters typically assign extra weight to the status quo, especially when the company has recently bolstered its cash reserves and public filings suggest stabilization rather than crisis. Given the company’s liquidity position and absence of any clear, acute crisis, the odds of bankruptcy by January 1, 2025, appear low, barring an unforeseen catastrophe.**
