(a) **Time until outcome known:**  
The question will be resolved on or after April 1, 2025, when Metaculus checks the NUFORC link for pilot UFO reports in March 2025. As of May 6, 2025, this date has already passed, so the outcome could be known at any time now, pending NUFORC's updates.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changes:**  
Historically, California leads the U.S. in total UFO reports, with Florida usually ranking second in absolute totals. There is no evidence of a sudden shift or Florida-specific event to disrupt this established pattern. Pilot-specific reports are a subset, but these broader trends tend to have inertia[2][3].

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
Florida ties with or falls behind any other state—most likely California—in the number of pilot UFO reports for March 2025. This is the status quo scenario, given California's historical dominance and the lack of evidence for an unusual spike in Florida[2][3].

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
Florida receives more pilot-reported UFO sightings than any other state in March 2025, as recorded by the National UFO Reporting Center. This would require either an anomalous spike in Florida pilot reports or an unusual lull elsewhere, particularly in California. There is no indication such an event or policy change has taken place[2][3].

## Rationale

Florida is consistently among the top two states for overall UFO sightings, but it almost always trails California in total numbers of reports. There is no evidence of an event or pattern shift that would lead to Florida overtaking California for pilot-specific reports in March 2025. While pilot reports can deviate somewhat from general trends, the sheer size of California's airspace, population, and flight activity creates a strong baseline advantage for that state[2][3]. There are no recent policy announcements, local phenomena, or NUFORC procedural changes pointing toward a sudden increase in Florida pilot reports[2][3].

Given the status quo, the historical trend is likely to persist unless disrupted by rare and unpredictable events (such as mass pilot sightings or widely publicized incidents focused on Florida), none of which are currently suggested by the data. The outcome will resolve as Yes only if Florida is the clear, stand-alone leader—not simply tied for first[2][3]. Good forecasting practice suggests weighting the status quo scenario most heavily, as major shifts in reporting patterns are rare and typically driven by highly visible events or structural changes, neither of which have occurred for Florida.
