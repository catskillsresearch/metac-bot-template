Based on the search results and the current date (May 6, 2025), I can provide a retrospective analysis of the March 4, 2025 address by President Trump to a joint session of Congress.

(a) The time until outcome: The outcome is already known, as the joint session address occurred on March 4, 2025, which was 63 days ago from today's date.

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed: The status quo would have been that Trump addressed Congress without mentioning "Biden."

(c) A scenario resulting in a No outcome: President Trump focused exclusively on his administration's accomplishments and future agenda without referencing his predecessor by name, instead using terms like "previous administration" or "my predecessor."

(d) A scenario resulting in a Yes outcome: During his speech, Trump explicitly mentioned "Biden" when contrasting his policies with those of the previous administration or when discussing the transition of power.

According to the search results, President Donald Trump did deliver an address to a joint session of Congress on March 4, 2025, as scheduled[1][2]. The address took place in a sharply divided Congress, where Trump touted his work to reshape the federal government[3].

The search results provide confirmation that the event occurred, but they do not provide a complete transcript of the speech that would allow me to definitively determine whether Trump mentioned "Biden" during his address. 

From historical precedent, new presidents often reference their predecessors when discussing policy changes, especially when there has been a transition between different political parties. The search results indicate that Trump was discussing his vision and the reshaping of the federal government, which might have included comparisons to the previous administration.

However, without explicit evidence from the speech transcript showing that Trump said "Biden," I cannot confirm that he mentioned his predecessor by name. The search results don't provide this level of detail about the content of the speech.

Given the limited information available in the search results and the retrospective nature of this analysis (as we're now past the date of the speech), I would have to conclude that there is insufficient evidence to determine whether Trump mentioned "Biden" during his March 4, 2025 address.

Probability: 50%
