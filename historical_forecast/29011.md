(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  
Veterans Day 2024 falls on Monday, November 11. The relevant five-day period is Friday, November 8, through Tuesday, November 12. TSA typically posts passenger volume data within days, so the outcome should be known by mid-November 2024—about three weeks from today (October 21, 2024).

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
The five-day total for Veterans Day weekend 2023 was 11,870,141 passengers. If recent year-over-year growth patterns (roughly 5–6.4%) persist, the 2024 total would exceed this threshold. If, instead, passenger volumes remain flat, the answer would be No.

(c) **Scenario for No outcome:**  
Passenger volumes could fall short of a year-over-year increase if an unexpected negative shock occurs between now and Veterans Day weekend. Examples include a sudden deterioration in economic conditions (e.g., job losses, rising inflation), large-scale flight disruptions due to severe weather, or a significant geopolitical event that reduces consumer confidence or disrupts travel plans. Absent these, a No outcome would also occur if the strong year-over-year growth observed in summer and fall 2024 suddenly stalls, and numbers align with or drop below 2023 levels.

(d) **Scenario for Yes outcome:**  
A Yes outcome occurs if TSA passenger volumes for the five-day period November 8–12, 2024, exceed 11,870,141. This is most likely if the growth trends that have characterized 2024 continue through Veterans Day. The 2024 summer saw checkpoint volume increases of about 6.4% over 2023[1][5], and the first half of the year featured multiple record high travel days, with monthly growth continuing into the autumn[2]. Additionally, with Veterans Day in 2024 providing a three-day weekend (Monday holiday instead of Saturday), demand for leisure travel is likely to be higher, supporting further volume increases.

## Rationale

- **Growth Trend:** The US air travel sector has experienced consistent growth in 2024, with TSA and airline industry projections indicating ongoing strong demand. TSA reported a 6.4% year-over-year increase for summer 2024 checkpoint volumes and anticipated summer days exceeding previous record highs[1][5].
  
- **Calendar Effect:** Veterans Day 2024 falls on a Monday, creating a natural three-day weekend. Such calendar alignments typically promote higher leisure travel volumes versus a holiday falling on a Saturday, as in 2023. This increases the likelihood of surpassing 2023’s total.

- **Seasonal Patterns:** The busiest travel days are generally associated with holiday weekends, and so far in 2024, both daily and weekly passenger counts have continued to climb, with several days already surpassing pre-pandemic levels[2][3].

- **Risks:** While exogenous shocks can't be ruled out (economic, weather, geopolitical), there is no current evidence of a reversal in travel demand or a disruptive event on the horizon. The main risk to a Yes outcome would be a rapid, unexpected decline in consumer willingness to travel or a major airline operational crisis.

- **Historical Precedent:** Averages in 2023 were about 2.4 million passengers per day[4], with certain holiday periods (like summer, July 4th, and Thanksgiving) seeing sustained increases year-over-year into 2024.

With approximately three weeks left until Veterans Day weekend, the status quo strongly favors continued growth. Weighting recent year-over-year trends and the favorable calendar setup, the probability that 2024’s five-day total will exceed 2023’s 11,870,141 is notably high.

**Probability: 85%**
