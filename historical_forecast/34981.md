(a) Time left until outcome: Approximately 1 month and 24 days (from today, May 6, 2025, until April 1, 2025). However, since today's date is May 6, 2025, which is after the deadline of April 1, 2025, the outcome should already be known.

(b) Status quo outcome: The United States does not formally recognize Nicol√°s Maduro as the President of Venezuela. As of January 2025, the US had not recognized Maduro as President since 2019 and rejected the National Electoral Council's announcement that Maduro won the presidential election, considering it fraudulent.

(c) Scenario resulting in No outcome: The US maintains its position of not recognizing Maduro's government, continues to recognize opposition figures as legitimate representatives of Venezuela, and maintains diplomatic and economic pressure on the Maduro regime.

(d) Scenario resulting in Yes outcome: The US changes its longstanding position due to geopolitical considerations, engages in direct diplomatic negotiations with the Maduro government, and issues an official statement through the State Department or White House formally recognizing Maduro as President of Venezuela.

Since today's date (May 6, 2025) is past the resolution date (April 1, 2025), I need to analyze whether the US formally recognized Maduro between January 2025 and April 1, 2025.

Based on the search results provided, there is no evidence that the United States changed its position on Maduro between January and April 2025. The most recent information available from January 2025 indicates that the US continued to not recognize Maduro as President of Venezuela[1][2]. The search results show that as of January 10, 2025, "The United States has not recognized Maduro as the President of Venezuela since 2019" and "The United States rejects the National Electoral Council's fraudulent announcement that Maduro won the presidential election."

The search results do not provide any information about a change in this position between January 10, 2025, and April 1, 2025. Given the strong historical stance against recognizing Maduro (since 2019), the explicit rejection of the election results as fraudulent, and the lack of any evidence indicating a policy change, it is reasonable to conclude that the US did not formally recognize Maduro before April 1, 2025.

Additionally, there is specific mention that the US recognized opposition leader Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia as Venezuela's president-elect according to the query background information, further supporting that there was no recognition of Maduro.

Status quo tends to persist in international relations, especially regarding formal recognition policies, which typically change only with significant shifts in circumstances or administration priorities. The search results do not indicate any such shifts before April 1, 2025.
