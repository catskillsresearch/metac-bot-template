(a) **Time Left Until Outcome Known:**  
The outcome window is August 15 to September 15, 2024. Today is August 8, so there are 7 days until the forecast window opens and 39 days until it closes.

(b) **Status Quo Outcome If Nothing Changed:**  
The current record high for Chinese aircraft violating Taiwan’s ADIZ in a single day is 56, most recently on July 10, 2024[4]. No day in the historical record has exceeded 60. Without any major new trigger or escalation, the likely outcome is that the 60+ threshold will *not* be breached in the specified period.

(c) **Scenario for a No Outcome:**  
If there are no major political events, provocative visits, or escalations between China, Taiwan, or third parties (such as the US or Japan), Chinese activity will likely continue at elevated but not unprecedented levels. Daily ADIZ violations will stay below the 60-aircraft mark, maintaining the current trend of high-frequency, moderate-scale pressure operations[2][3].

(d) **Scenario for a Yes Outcome:**  
A “Yes” would require either a significant triggering event—such as a senior US or Western official visiting Taiwan, a new defense pact or arms deal, or a strongly worded pro-independence statement from Taiwan’s leadership—or a deliberate PRC decision to escalate for signaling or deterrence value. In these cases, China has previously coordinated “reactionary” surges (e.g., post-Pelosi visit in August 2022 and post-inauguration drills in May 2024), where single-day totals have spiked near the required threshold, but never surpassed it[3][4].

## Rationale

- **Trend:** The baseline level of Chinese ADIZ violations has trended upward, with recent months setting new monthly and daily records[3][4].
- **Threshold Analysis:** Despite repeated surges for political signaling, no available record shows China has sent more than 60 aircraft in a single day. The closest was 56, both in October 2021 and July 2024.
- **Event-Linked Surges:** Previous spikes coincided with major provocations (e.g., Pelosi’s visit, presidential inauguration), but even these have not breached the 60-aircraft mark in a single day[3].
- **Escalation Risks:** The probability of a new spike is nontrivial—Beijing could orchestrate a new show of force if triggered by outside events. However, in the absence of a known upcoming event of this magnitude, historical inertia favors a “No.”
- **Resource and Signaling Constraints:** Large surges require significant logistics, carry signaling risks, and may be deliberately scaled just below a psychological threshold for strategic ambiguity[3].

Given that the observed maximum to date is still just under 60, and given most surges are carefully calibrated, the base rate remains below the line—favoring the status quo outcome.

**Probability: 25%**

- This forecast assigns modest weight to the upward trend and the possibility of a new political trigger, but gives extra weight to the historical cap in daily numbers and the lack of a known imminent provocation. It is substantially possible but not likely under normal diplomatic conditions.
