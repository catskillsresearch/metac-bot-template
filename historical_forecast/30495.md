(a) Time until outcome is known: The outcome will be known in December 2024, which is approximately 7 months from now (from May 6, 2025).

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: Based on recent trends, the status quo would be temperatures not falling below 25°F in December 2024, as December 2023 only reached 25°F at its coldest but did not go below that threshold.

(c) Scenario resulting in a No outcome: Continued warming trends influenced by climate change and a developing La Niña pattern could lead to another warmer-than-average winter in NYC, keeping temperatures from dropping below 25°F throughout December 2024.

(d) Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome: A strong cold snap or nor'easter during December 2024 could bring temperatures below 25°F, especially in the latter half of the month when NYC historically experiences colder temperatures.

Looking at the available data, I need to make a careful assessment of whether New York City will experience temperatures below 25°F in December 2024.

New York City winters have been showing a clear warming trend in recent years. The winter of 2023-2024 was the fourth warmest on record, while 2022-2023 was the second warmest[5]. December in New York is typically very cold with temperatures ranging between 33°F and 41°F according to historical data[3]. However, the winter forecast for 2024-2025 suggests we'll likely see above-average temperatures in the NYC area[5].

The development of La Niña conditions for winter 2024-2025 is a significant factor. According to meteorologist Nick Gregory, this pattern suggests a winter with average to slightly below-average temperatures for New York City and surrounding regions[5]. La Niña could create a rain/snow battle line right across the NYC area, potentially bringing colder temperatures.

Historical patterns would suggest that December in New York typically includes periods cold enough to drop below 25°F, especially in the latter half of the month. However, climate change has been affecting these patterns significantly. NYC now experiences approximately 15 more days above average during winter compared to 1970, and cold snaps have shortened considerably.

December 2023 only reached 25°F at its coldest but did not go below that threshold. This is particularly notable because that December was unusually warm overall, ranking as the second warmest December for NYC in 154 years of record-keeping.

While nor'easters are still expected during winter in NYC (Gregory notes "NYC will always see a nor'easter during winter"), the question is whether they'll coincide with cold enough temperatures to push readings below 25°F[5].

Given the strong warming trend in NYC winters, with seven of the top ten warmest Decembers occurring since 1990, the status quo appears to be warmer winters. However, year-to-year variability remains significant, and weather patterns can still bring occasional cold snaps even within an overall warming climate.

The forecast for winter 2024-2025 indicates "above average temperatures this winter along with more snow than last year"[5]. This suggests that while precipitation may increase, temperatures might not drop as low as they historically have.

Putting extra weight on the status quo of warming winters, but acknowledging the historical possibility of cold snaps and the influence of La Niña, I believe there's a moderate probability that temperatures will dip below 25°F at some point in December 2024, but it's less likely than it would have been in previous decades.

Probability: 45%
