(a) **Time until the outcome is known:**  
The winners of the 45th Golden Raspberry Awards will be announced on March 1, 2025, so as of today, February 24, 2025, there is about 5 days left until the Worst Picture winner is revealed.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changes:**  
Based on the current data, "Joker: Folie à Deux" leads in Razzie nominations with seven, the highest among all nominees for Worst Picture, and it has been widely acknowledged as a major critical and commercial disappointment compared to its predecessor. It is also strongly correlated with multiple Razzie categories, suggesting broad negative reception. This makes "Joker: Folie à Deux" the most likely to win Worst Picture under the current trends and voting patterns.

(c) **Scenario for an unexpected outcome:**  
An unexpected scenario could unfold if the Razzie voters decide to focus on another film due to factors like cult backlash, surprise negative public sentiment, or a campaign by fans or critics pushing a different nominee. For instance, although "Megalopolis" was once a betting favorite due to its large budget and poor box office, it received mixed reviews (46% on Rotten Tomatoes) and may split votes with other films. Additionally, smaller films like "Reagan" or "Madame Web" could rally enough negative sentiment or novelty factor to clinch the award despite lower nominations. Finally, Razzie voters sometimes choose based on perceived "bad faith" projects or high-profile failures regardless of nomination counts, which could shift the verdict.

## Rationale

- **Nominations and Critical Reception:** "Joker: Folie à Deux" leads with seven Razzie nominations and suffered both critical and box office disappointment (grossing $206M on $200M budget vs. over $1B for the original)[5].  
- **Historical Voting Patterns:** Winners tend to come from films with the most Worst Picture nominations and high-profile negative reception[1].  
- **Betting Odds and Expert Commentary:** Some early betting favored "Megalopolis" due to its budget and flop status, but recent nomination counts and widespread negative attention pivot towards "Joker: Folie à Deux"[4][5].  
- **Other Nominees:** "Borderlands," "Madame Web," and "Reagan" also have six nominations each, but none match the poor reception and high-profile backlash that "Joker: Folie à Deux" has generated[1][3][5].  
- **Razzie Voter Base:** With over 1,200 voters including critics and enthusiasts, the outcome typically reflects a consensus of critical and public disappointment[3].

## Final Probability Estimates

- Borderlands: 15%  
- Joker: Folie à Deux: 60%  
- Madame Web: 10%  
- Megalopolis: 10%  
- Reagan: 5%  

"Joker: Folie à Deux" holds the majority probability due to its nomination count, critical failure, and Razzie voting trends, but moderate probabilities are left for other nominees to account for potential surprises or shifts in voter sentiment.
