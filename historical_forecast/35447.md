Based on the information provided, I'll approach this forecasting question methodically:

(a) Time left until outcome: Approximately 2 months and 1 week (from February 25, 2025 to March 4, 2025)

(b) Status quo outcome: No - There is no indication in the available information that Trump plans to mention "Trudeau" in his address.

(c) Scenario for No outcome: President Trump focuses his March 4 address entirely on domestic priorities such as border security, energy policy, and tax reform as suggested by the "America First" agenda mentioned in Speaker Johnson's invitation. Foreign policy receives minimal attention, and Canada-U.S. relations are not addressed specifically.

(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: A significant U.S.-Canada issue emerges before March 4 (perhaps related to trade, border security, or a diplomatic incident), making it relevant for Trump to specifically mention Prime Minister Trudeau during his address to Congress.

Looking at this forecasting question analytically, several key factors suggest a low probability of Trump mentioning "Trudeau" during his March 4 address:

First, the invitation from Speaker Johnson explicitly frames the address as an opportunity for Trump to share his "America First vision"[1][3]. This suggests a domestic policy focus rather than international relations.

Second, the early congressional addresses by presidents typically focus on outlining their domestic agenda and vision for the country[4]. While international relations may be mentioned, specific foreign leaders are less commonly referenced unless there's a particular diplomatic situation requiring attention.

Third, the available information shows Republican leaders are meeting with the president to discuss "an ambitious legislative agenda" focused on "border security, energy and taxes, among other things"[4]. This further reinforces a likely domestic focus.

There is no indication in the search results of any current or developing tensions or special relationships with Canada that would warrant mentioning Prime Minister Trudeau by name. While U.S.-Canada relations are always important due to shared borders and trade relationships, without a specific issue at hand, it seems unlikely that Trump would single out Trudeau by name in this particular address.

As a forecaster, I must consider that the status quo often continues - presidents typically focus these addresses on their domestic agenda early in their terms. Without evidence suggesting Canada or Trudeau will be specifically relevant to Trump's first congressional address, and acknowledging the limited timeframe for major diplomatic situations to develop, I assess the probability as low.

Probability: 15%
