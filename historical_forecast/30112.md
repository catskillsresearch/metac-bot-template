(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
Approximately 1.5 months remain until January 1, 2025, when the outcome will be determined.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changes:**  
No UN member state will have changed its official name by January 1, 2025. This is based on established patterns, as country name changes are infrequent and generally well-publicized in advance[1][2][3][4][5].

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
The governments of all UN member states take no action to officially change their country's name before the deadline. Any ongoing discussions (such as in India about "Bharat") remain unresolved or do not reach the stage of an official declaration within the timeframe[5].

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
A UN member state formally issues an official declaration changing its country's name before January 1, 2025. This could occur either through a sudden political directive, legislative action, or a government decree, with the change clearly publicized and verified before the cutoff date. However, as of now, no country has an active, imminent process at this stage[5].

## Rationale

- **Historical pattern:** Country name changes are rare and typically follow protracted periods of national debate, legislative procedures, or political negotiation. Recent examples like Turkey (Türkiye), North Macedonia, Eswatini, and Czechia were preceded by months or years of discussions and announcements before the official change[1][2][3][4][5].
- **Current developments:** As of November 15, 2024, there are no official declarations or legislative processes in progress that would plausibly result in a new country name by January 1, 2025. High-profile cases, notably potential renaming discussions in India ("Bharat"), have not advanced to the stage of imminent government declaration[5].
- **Monitoring and reporting:** Authoritative sources such as government lists, international news, and expert commentary have not reported any pending name changes scheduled to take effect before the deadline[1][2][3][5].
- **Status quo bias:** Given the world’s relatively stable trajectory in this domain, and that such changes are both rare and slow-moving, the status quo forecast should be heavily weighted.

## Final Answer

Probability: **2%**

This estimate reflects the extremely low likelihood, as of mid-November 2024, of any UN member state officially changing its name before January 1, 2025, absent any current announcements or visible processes to that effect[1][2][3][4][5].
