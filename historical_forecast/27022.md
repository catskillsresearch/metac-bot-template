I'll analyze whether astronauts Williams and Wilmore will be back on Earth by September 15, 2024, based on the available information.

(a) Time left until outcome: Approximately 4 months and 9 days from the date of the search results (May 6, 2025) until September 15, 2024. However, I notice there's a discrepancy in the dates - the search results show information from 2024, while the current date shows 2025. Based on the search results, I'll analyze this from the perspective of June-July 2024, looking forward to September 15, 2024.

(b) Status quo outcome: As of the latest information in the search results, Williams and Wilmore remain aboard the ISS with their return delayed beyond the original schedule, with technical evaluations of the Starliner spacecraft ongoing.

(c) No outcome scenario: If technical issues with Starliner's propulsion system (five known helium leaks) prove too complex to resolve safely, NASA might determine that returning on Starliner poses unacceptable risks. They could decide to keep the astronauts aboard the ISS longer while exploring alternative return options, potentially beyond September 15.

(d) Yes outcome scenario: NASA and Boeing complete their technical evaluations, determine Starliner can safely return despite the issues, and schedule a return before September 15. Based on the search results showing a previously planned June 26 return date, this remains technically feasible if the propulsion system is cleared for reentry.

Looking at the specific evidence available in the search results:

The Starliner mission with Williams and Wilmore launched on June 5, 2024, and docked with the ISS on June 6[1][3]. While originally planned as a one-week mission, their stay has been extended due to technical issues with the spacecraft's propulsion system, specifically five known helium leaks[5].

As of June 18, 2024 (the most recent date in the search results), NASA had announced a plan to return Starliner on June 26, 2024[5]. The search results indicate: "Wilmore and Williams will undock from the space station's forward port at 10:10 p.m. EDT on June 25 and fire the ship's aft-facing thrusters to drop out of orbit early the next day, setting up a parachute-and-airbag-assisted landing at White Sands, N.M., at 4:51 a.m. EDT."[5]

Additionally, Steve Stich, NASA's Commercial Crew Program manager, stated that "the Starliner can safely carry Wilmore and Williams back to Earth as is if some issue crops up that requires an immediate departure."[5]

The search results do not indicate any insurmountable technical barriers to returning, and in fact show that as of June 18, a specific return date of June 26 had been planned. While this date may have been subject to change after the latest search result, there's strong evidence that NASA and Boeing believed a safe return was feasible.

Given the status quo bias and the fact that the planned June 26 return date would place both astronauts on Earth well before September 15, and considering NASA's explicit statement about Starliner's ability to safely return even with the known issues if necessary, the probability of both astronauts being on Earth by September 15 appears quite high.

Probability: 95%
