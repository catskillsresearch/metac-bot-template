(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
As of October 23, 2024, there are about 5 weeks (approximately 39 days) until December 1, 2024.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
The recall remains *Active* according to the USDA FSIS recall status page[1]. If there are no new developments, the recall status would likely still be *Active* when checked after November 30, 2024.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
- The recall remains open through December 1, 2024, either because the USDA keeps the status *Active* due to:
  - The shelf life of the last recalled products (sell-by date as late as October 17)[1][3]
  - Ongoing risk of listeriosis cases emerging (due to long incubation period)
  - Pending or incomplete investigation/remediation at the Jarratt facility[5]
  - Precautionary public health monitoring, especially given the severity of the outbreak

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
- The USDA closes the recall before December 1, 2024, which would most likely occur if:
  - All corrective actions at the plant are completed and verified
  - There are no new cases emerging beyond the expected incubation period
  - Disposal or removal of all affected products from the market is confirmed
  - USDA determines that public health risks are resolved swiftly after October 17, 2024 (the latest sell-by date of any recalled product)[1][3]

## Rationale and Probability Assessment

The most heavily weighted factor is the **status quo bias**: regulatory and food safety agencies tend to move conservatively, especially with severe outbreaks. The recall's scope (over 7 million pounds, 71 products, and nationwide distribution)[1], the ongoing investigation, plant closure, and the seriousness of the outbreak (nine deaths, dozens hospitalized)[3][5], all suggest that the USDA will be cautious in closing the recall.

**Timeline considerations:**
- The latest *sell by* date on recalled product is October 17, 2024[1][3].
- Listeria symptoms can appear up to 70 days post-consumption.
- Regulatory precedent is to keep recalls *Active* until both all potentially contaminated product is likely out of circulation and no new cases are appearing linked to the recall.

Given that some product could remain in consumer refrigerators after October 17 and that safety officials often wait for at least one full incubation cycle beyond the last exposure, it is likely that the recall will remain active into December. The closure of the Jarratt plant and indefinite halt to liverwurst production[5] indicate Boar’s Head is taking action, but USDA is unlikely to move quickly to close a recall with such a significant public health impact.

**Rapid closure scenario:** This would require unusually swift confirmation that all tainted product is gone and the facility is fully remediated. Given probable lags for incident reporting and USDA review, this is unlikely but not impossible—especially if all needed steps are completed before late October.

**Conclusion:**  
Based on regulatory caution, outbreak severity, and typical recall timelines, the *most probable* outcome is that the recall remains Active on December 1, 2024.

**Probability: 80%**
