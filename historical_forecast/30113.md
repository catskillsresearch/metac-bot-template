(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
As of November 15, 2024, there are approximately 6.5 weeks remaining until the end of December 2024, when the resolution window for this question closes.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
If current trends hold and the ICC continues at its present pace, with no public announcement of new arrest warrants issued after November 11, 2024, the outcome would be *No*—no new warrants issued in November or December 2024.

(c) **Scenario for a No outcome:**  
The ICC Pre-Trial Chamber continues its deliberations on the high-profile applications for arrest warrants related to the Israel-Hamas conflict and does not issue or publicly disclose any new arrest warrants before January 1, 2025. No other ICC investigations result in the issuance or public disclosure of new arrest warrants during this period.

(d) **Scenario for a Yes outcome:**  
The ICC Pre-Trial Chamber approves and publicly announces at least one new arrest warrant—potentially for Israeli or Hamas leaders, or in another ongoing investigation—at any time between November 11 and December 31, 2024. The warrant must be either for someone not previously subject to a public ICC warrant, or a new warrant for a different situation, and the issuance must be confirmed by credible official sources within the resolution window.

## Rationale and Forecast

### Recent Context

- On November 7, 2024, the ICC unsealed an arrest warrant for Edmond Beina, but this warrant was originally issued in 2018 and its unsealing does not count as a new warrant issuance for this prediction market’s criteria[1].
- As of November 15, 2024, there are no credible reports of new warrants issued after November 11, 2024.

### Pending High-Profile Applications

- ICC Prosecutor Karim Khan has applied for arrest warrants for five individuals in the context of the Israel-Hamas conflict (Netanyahu, Gallant, Sinwar, Deif, Haniyeh), with these applications pending since May 2024[4][5].
- Given the ICC’s typical pace and the political and evidentiary complexity of these cases, Pre-Trial Chamber decisions often take months, and there is no official timeline for issuance.
- The ICC does issue warrants with some regularity—there are currently 27 suspects at large with outstanding warrants[2]—but the public announcement of new warrants, especially in high-profile or politically sensitive cases, is unpredictable.

### Likelihood Assessment

- **Extra weight to status quo:** The ICC’s deliberative process is generally slow, especially for politically charged cases. Unless there is a leak or an accelerated decision, high-profile warrants may not be issued within a 6-week window.
- **Recent pattern:** Unsealing of old warrants, not issuance of new ones.
- **Pending but plausible triggers:** The possibility remains that the ICC could move to issue one or more warrants—especially given the high-profile nature of the applications and international attention—but as of mid-November, no signals indicate an imminent public announcement.

### Risk Factors and Uncertainty

- The sudden escalation of major international events or additional evidence could prompt urgent ICC action, but such developments are not visible as of now.
- The ICC could issue a warrant under seal and then unseal it within the resolution window, but this scenario would still require public disclosure prior to January 1, 2025 to count.

**Probability: 35%**

There is a significant chance that no new warrants will be issued or disclosed by the ICC before the end of December 2024, given the slow pace and procedural rigor of the court. However, the presence of high-profile, pending warrant applications and ongoing global attention means a non-negligible probability remains that at least one warrant could be issued and publicly announced within the window.
