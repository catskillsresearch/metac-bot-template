(a) **Time left until the outcome is known**: As of November 1, 2024, the election is just a few days away, and the outcome will likely be known by early November.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed**: The current law restricts abortion after 12 weeks, aligning closely with Initiative 434, which also restricts abortions after the first trimester with specific exceptions. Therefore, if nothing changes, Initiative 434 might have a slight advantage due to its alignment with existing law and societal familiarity with such restrictions.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome**: Initiative 439, which expands abortion rights to fetal viability, might struggle to gain more votes if the majority of Nebraskans lean towards maintaining or strengthening existing restrictions, as is suggested by Initiative 434 aligning closely with current state law. Additionally, if voter confusion leads to a conservative voting trend favoring known restrictions over expanded rights, Initiative 434 could receive more votes.

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome**: Initiative 439 could receive more votes if Nebraskans perceive it as an essential step towards ensuring reproductive rights and removing what some might see as overly restrictive abortion policies. This would require a strong turnout and support from those favoring expanded reproductive rights, potentially influenced by discussions around women's health and personal freedoms highlighted during the campaign.

Given the available information and the general tendency for voters to lean towards known and familiar policies (like the current restriction), the polling indicating a plurality of support for both measures but without specific figures for each, and potential voter confusion, the prediction is challenging. However, the status quo generally holds unless there is significant momentum for change.

**Probability: 45%**
