(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
From February 9, 2025, to April 1, 2025, is about 52 days.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
If no changes are made, the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) Official Transportation Map continues to display "Gulf of Mexico."

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
FDOT retains "Gulf of Mexico" as the name of the body of water west of Florida on the MyFlorida Transportation Map without adopting, referencing, or mentioning "Gulf of America" anywhere on the map during the relevant period.

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
Before April 1, 2025, FDOT’s official map is updated such that the body of water west of Florida is labeled "Gulf of America" or includes both names (e.g., "Gulf of America, formerly known as Gulf of Mexico").

## Rationale

While there has been high-level political attention to rebranding the Gulf of Mexico as the "Gulf of America"—including public statements by Florida Governor DeSantis and a federal announcement by President Trump[1][4]—there is no concrete evidence as of February 9, 2025, that FDOT has updated, or is imminently updating, the name on its official transportation map. The CBS News report and other sources indicate the use of "Gulf of America" in speeches and executive actions, and some digital mapping services (Google Maps) have announced intentions to change the label in response to federal direction[1][4]. However, traditional adoption of such changes by state agencies, particularly those responsible for official cartographic products, tends to be cautious and often subject to established review processes and lag behind political rhetoric.

As of the latest available data, recent FDOT documents and maps either do not reference the Gulf by name or have not been updated to reflect a new designation[3]. The predominant status quo remains "Gulf of Mexico" in official usage. There is no public documentation or press release from FDOT or the Florida Governor’s office confirming a forthcoming map update to "Gulf of America" for the MyFlorida Transportation Map before April 1, 2025.

Given the short lead time and the slow pace of bureaucratic adoption for such name changes—despite the possible top-down pressure and digital mapping precedent—the most likely outcome is that FDOT will maintain the Gulf's traditional name on its official map through the resolution date. While a sudden change cannot be absolutely ruled out, the historical inertia of official cartographic products and the absence of clear indications of an imminent update mean the status quo should be heavily weighted.
