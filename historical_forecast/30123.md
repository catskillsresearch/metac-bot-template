(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
Approximately 7.5 months remain until January 1, 2025, the cutoff date for this forecast.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
As of May 2024, the US has not enacted export controls specifically targeting generative AI software. Export controls have focused primarily on hardware (especially advanced AI chips) and certain high-risk use cases, while comprehensive controls on generative AI software remain under discussion but not implemented[1][3][4].

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
No legislative or regulatory export controls specific to generative AI software are enacted before January 1, 2025. For example, the ENFORCE Act, introduced in May 2024 to amend export control statutes to cover AI systems (including generative AI software), fails to advance swiftly or is delayed in Congress, or regulatory agencies like BIS do not issue new rules targeting generative AI software specifically. The US maintains its current approach, focusing on hardware and selected high-risk uses, with no explicit, actionable export controls on generative AI software before 2025[1][3][4].

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
The ENFORCE Act or similar legislation passes quickly and is signed into law, or the executive branch (e.g., BIS) uses existing authority to issue formal export control rules covering some generative AI software (e.g., restrictions on export of certain models, weights, or applications for security reasons). These rules go into effect before January 1, 2025, specifically restricting exports of generative AI software based on defined criteria[2][4].

## Rationale

The status quo weighs heavily toward no specific generative AI software export controls being in effect as of mid-2024. Legislative and regulatory machinery in the US, especially on high-stakes technology issues, typically moves slowly—major bills often take many months to clear both houses and be implemented, and subsequent rulemaking can be time-consuming.

Evidence of active legislative intent—the May 2024 introduction of the ENFORCE Act—does indicate increasing momentum and political will to address AI software exports[2]. However, the introduction of a bill, even a bipartisan one, is only an initial step. There is no public evidence as of May 2024 that the bill has passed or that the Commerce Department has enacted new rules targeted exclusively at generative AI software. Regulatory agencies have broadened hardware controls and considered risks, but have so far stopped short of applying comprehensive export controls to generative AI software products themselves[1][3][4].

Furthermore, several obstacles—such as potential legal challenges, the need for international coordination, likely industry pushback, and the time needed for regulatory implementation—complicate the enactment of controls on a short timeline[4]. While export control authorities arguably have the legal basis to impose some restrictions immediately, doing so unilaterally, especially for a broad category like generative AI software, would be a significant step, and there is no indication such action is imminent.

Given these factors and the well-documented inertia in export control policymaking, the base rate strongly favors the status quo continuing—meaning no broad, formal export controls on generative AI software will be enacted before January 1, 2025, unless a major policy shift or external shock accelerates the process.

## Probability Estimate

**Probability: 30%**

- The chance of substantive, actionable US export controls on some generative AI software before 2025 is notably higher than it would have been a year ago, due to clear legislative efforts and increased regulatory scrutiny[2].
- Nevertheless, the slow pace of US policymaking, the absence of current controls, and the substantial procedural and legal hurdles mean that the likelihood remains below even odds.
- A status quo outcome (no export controls on generative AI software before 2025) is still the most probable scenario barring a rapid and unusual acceleration in policy action.
