(a) **Time until outcome is known:**  
From September 18, 2024, there are 12 calendar days until the market close on September 30, 2024, when the outcome will be determined.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
If Tesla's price on September 13, 2024 ($230.29) holds steady through September 30, the closing value would remain at or above $230, resulting in a **Yes** outcome[5].

(c) **Scenario for a No outcome:**  
In a "No" scenario, Tesla's stock declines below $230 and remains there through September 30. This could be triggered by negative sentiment, disappointing Q3 delivery rumors, broader tech sector weakness, or macroeconomic shocks (such as higher interest rates, global market selloffs, or negative industry news)[2][5].

(d) **Scenario for a Yes outcome:**  
A "Yes" outcome occurs if Tesla's shares hold at or above $230 through September 30. This could be supported by positive momentum ahead of the Robotaxi unveiling, favorable market conditions, or continued investor optimism and anticipation about Tesla’s future products and technological advancements[5].

## Rationale

Tesla closed at $230.29 on September 13, 2024, narrowly above the threshold[5]. Over the past month, the share price has shown some bullish momentum, and multiple technical analysts see $240 as a nearby resistance level, with some even forecasting potential for $280–$300 if momentum continues[5]. Additionally, OpenAI's o1 model and some human analysts see upside into the end of 2024, although this does not guarantee holding above $230 in the near term[5].

On the downside, broader sentiment is mixed. Some analysts remain skeptical and highlight risks, including Tesla’s history of overpromising and industry-wide EV challenges[5]. Still, the fact that shares have already crossed $230 and are showing short-term strength suggests the current trajectory is positive.

**Good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo:**  
Because stocks more often drift than lurch, and with only two weeks left and no clear imminent negative catalyst, the probability is skewed toward a "Yes" resolution—provided general market conditions remain stable and no major negative news emerges.

## Probability Estimate

**Probability: 70%**

- The "Yes" scenario is somewhat more likely, as Tesla is already above $230 with positive anticipation for the October Robotaxi event and some bullish technical momentum[5].
- The risk of dropping below $230 remains real due to Tesla’s volatility and mixed analyst sentiment, but no immediate negative catalyst is apparent.
- The short time frame and upward recent movement bias the odds in favor of status quo continuation.
