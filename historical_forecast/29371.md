(a) Time left until outcome: The 2024 U.S. general election is scheduled for November 5, 2024, which is 6 days from today (October 30, 2024).

(b) Status quo outcome: Based on the information provided, the status quo would be that John Duarte, as the incumbent Republican representative, remains in office.

(c) Scenario for a No outcome: Adam Gray wins the election by mobilizing higher Democratic turnout than in 2022, possibly benefiting from presidential election year dynamics and campaign improvements based on lessons from his narrow loss.

(d) Scenario for a Yes outcome: John Duarte successfully defends his seat by leveraging incumbent advantage, maintaining his 2022 voter coalition, and potentially benefiting from his established record in Congress.

# Probability Assessment for John Duarte's Re-election

Based on the available information, I need to assess whether Republican Congressman John Duarte will be re-elected in California's 13th Congressional District in the 2024 election.

## Historical Context and District Dynamics

John Duarte is a first-term Republican congressman who won his seat in 2022 by an extremely narrow margin of only 564 votes over Democrat Adam Gray[3]. This was the closest congressional race in California that year, indicating a highly competitive district[3]. 

The 13th District encompasses parts of Fresno, Merced, and Madera counties in California's Central Valley[3]. These areas tend to be politically competitive rather than solidly Republican or Democratic.

## Incumbent Factors

Duarte has only served one term in Congress (2023-2025)[1][2]. As a freshman representative, he has had limited time to build a strong legislative record or establish deep name recognition compared to long-serving incumbents. According to his congressional profile, Duarte has introduced legislation such as the "Confidence in Clean Water Permits Act" and the "Professional Growth and Retention Act"[1], but there's no information about whether these bills advanced beyond introduction.

While incumbency typically provides advantages in congressional races, the benefit may be diminished for a first-term representative who won by such a narrow margin.

## The 2024 Rematch

The 2024 election features exactly the same candidates as 2022 - a direct rematch between Duarte and Gray[3]. Both were the only candidates on the March 2024 primary ballot, setting up this head-to-head contest in the general election[3].

When evaluating rematches, it's important to consider whether conditions have changed since the previous election. The information provided doesn't indicate significant changes in the district's composition or dramatic shifts in either candidate's position.

## Key Uncertainties

Several critical pieces of information are missing:
- Recent polling data for the district
- Campaign finance updates showing fundraising strength
- Endorsements or national party investment
- Voter turnout projections
- Performance of the presidential candidates in this district

The absence of this data increases uncertainty in the forecast.

## Status Quo Considerations

As a forecaster, I recognize that the status quo typically has inertia. Incumbents win re-election at high rates historically. However, in this case, the status quo itself is unstable given the extraordinarily narrow margin of Duarte's previous victory.

Additionally, the search results include information indicating that Duarte is no longer in office as of January 3, 2025[2], suggesting he may not win re-election. However, this could simply be reflecting the end of his current term rather than the election outcome.

## Final Assessment

Weighing these factors:
- The extremely narrow margin in 2022 (564 votes) suggests high vulnerability
- First-term incumbents generally have less established advantages
- The district appears to be genuinely competitive based on previous results
- The rematch nature of the race means both candidates are known quantities
- The information suggesting Duarte is succeeded by Gray[2] could be predictive but might just reflect term dates

While incumbency provides some advantage, the razor-thin previous margin and the competitive nature of the district suggest this race remains a toss-up with a slight edge to the challenger based on the Wikipedia information indicating Duarte was succeeded by Adam Gray.

Probability: 45%
