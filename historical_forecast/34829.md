(a) **Time Remaining Until Outcome**  
The question will be resolved on April 1, 2025. As of today (February 6, 2025), there are approximately 54 days (just under 8 weeks) left until the outcome is known.

(b) **Status Quo Outcome if Nothing Changed**  
Currently, DeepSeek is ranked above ChatGPT in the App Store’s Top Free iPhone Productivity Apps list in the US and many other countries. If all trends remain unchanged, DeepSeek would be ranked higher than ChatGPT on April 1, 2025[1][2][3][4][5].

(c) **A Scenario Resulting in a No Outcome**  
If DeepSeek were to lose its lead—due to factors like a sustained drop in interest, poor user retention, negative publicity, or the implementation of new restrictions (e.g., limiting international signups or technical issues that degrade the experience)—it could fall below ChatGPT in the rankings. Additionally, OpenAI could release a major update, new features, or an aggressive marketing campaign that restores ChatGPT’s dominance[2].

(d) **A Scenario Resulting in a Yes Outcome**  
If DeepSeek maintains its high user growth, favorable user feedback, and technical edge—especially with its free, high-performing models—while avoiding major technical or regulatory setbacks, it should remain ranked higher than ChatGPT. The broad global adoption, strong word of mouth, and superior accessibility (no ads, no paywall for advanced features) further support this scenario[2][3][4].

## Rationale

DeepSeek’s rise to #1 on the App Store was driven by several factors:
- Superior model performance and benchmarks, especially in reasoning and coding[3][4].
- An entirely free offering for advanced features, unlike ChatGPT which requires a subscription for full access[3][2].
- Broad accessibility, including to international users without onerous registration requirements[3].
- Extremely rapid download growth and positive user sentiment, leading to high rankings in 57 countries (and Top 10 in 111)[2].

While App Store rankings can be volatile, the current status quo is highly favorable for DeepSeek. There is no evidence in the available data that suggests a sudden reversal is imminent. Risks exist—especially if DeepSeek restricts international access or if OpenAI launches an aggressive counteroffensive—but these would need to be both severe and sustained to erase DeepSeek’s momentum in less than two months. 

Given how tech adoption and app store rankings usually show some inertia, and that DeepSeek’s offering is not just a passing novelty but is backed by benchmark-proven technology and user enthusiasm, the default scenario is for its lead to persist in the near term. 

Therefore, weighting the status quo heavily, but acknowledging the volatility and competitive pressure in the generative AI space, the likelihood that DeepSeek will be ranked higher than ChatGPT on April 1, 2025, remains high.
