(a) **Time left until outcome**: The winners of the 67th Annual Grammy Awards will be announced at the ceremony scheduled for Sunday, February 2, 2025. Given today is May 6, 2025, the outcome is now known, but as of the date cut-off (February 3, 2025), the results had not yet been announced.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed**: Historically, Beyoncé wins multiple Grammys with high nomination counts. She leads the 2025 nominations with 11, and her track record shows strong performance in both major and genre-specific categories. While she’s been snubbed for Album of the Year in the past, her win rate typically yields 2–4 trophies per multi-nomination year[1][4].

(c) **Unexpected outcome scenario**: One unexpected scenario would be Beyoncé getting shut out despite her dominance in nominations, winning only zero or one Grammy. This could occur if voters split between high-profile artists in major categories or if the Academy reacts against expectations, as has occasionally happened in prior years—especially in highly competitive fields[3][4]. Conversely, a sweep in all major and genre categories, resulting in a haul well above four, would also be surprising given the historical precedent and current competition.

## Rationale

- Beyoncé’s 11 nominations make her the most-nominated artist this year, reflecting wide support across genres and top categories, including Album, Record, and Song of the Year[4].
- She currently holds the record for most Grammy wins (32), and her multi-nomination years often result in three or more wins, though this is not guaranteed[1][4].
- Predictive articles from music journalists and critics lean toward multiple wins for Beyoncé, especially in the context of her widely acclaimed "Cowboy Carter" album and the Academy’s apparent openness to recognizing her overdue triumph in major categories[1][4].
- However, the unpredictability of Grammy voting, genre preferences, and the possibility of being snubbed in top categories—particularly Album of the Year, which she has never won—introduce some risk for a lower outcome[3][4].

## Final Probabilities

Option_0 or 1: 10%  
Option_2: 20%  
Option_3: 35%  
Option_Greater than 3: 35%  

This reflects significant likelihood for three or more wins (consistent with nomination volume and critical consensus), but with some probability left for a surprisingly low total, given historical voting unpredictability and strong competition in 2025.
