(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  
Approximately 1.5 months remain until September 30, 2024, the deadline for the event window.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
The bridge has remained intact since the last successful attack in July 2023. Despite frequent threats and several unsuccessful attempts, it has not been struck in 2024. The status quo, therefore, is that the bridge does *not* get hit.

(c) **Brief scenario for a No outcome:**  
Russian defenses—such as increased deployment of air-defense systems, underwater barriers, and constant surveillance—successfully prevent any Ukrainian (or other) attack from striking the bridge. Ukrainian priorities may shift, given that Russia now uses the bridge less for military logistics, reducing its strategic importance. Although attacks may be attempted, none physically strike the bridge or meet the threshold of a credible threat to its integrity before September 30[4][5].

(d) **Brief scenario for a Yes outcome:**  
Ukraine, or another actor, manages to breach Russia's layered defenses and successfully strikes the bridge with missiles, drones, or explosives. The strike is confirmed by credible sources to have physically hit the bridge or its immediate approaches, posing a plausible threat to its structural integrity. This could be motivated by political symbolism, timing with key events, or a shift in the operational/tactical situation[1][3].

## Rationale

The balance of evidence as of August 13, 2024, includes:

- **Clear Ukrainian Intent:**  
Ukrainian officials have repeatedly declared their desire and plans to attack the Crimean Bridge, with some statements suggesting operations were planned for the first half of 2024[1][3]. The bridge continues to be seen as a symbolically important target, with political and morale value to both sides[1][3][4].

- **Russian Defensive Measures:**  
Russia has heavily fortified the bridge following earlier successful attacks. These measures include underwater barriers, increased air-defense deployments, construction cranes for rapid repairs, and frequent traffic stoppages during alerts[1][5]. The defensive buildup makes a successful strike more difficult[5].

- **Change in Strategic Value:**  
Recent intelligence and Ukrainian military statements indicate that the bridge is now far less important for Russian military logistics, as alternative routes for supply have become established. This potentially lowers Ukraine's incentive to expend limited resources on attacking the bridge[2][4][5].

- **Attack Feasibility and Uncertainties:**  
While intent remains, successfully breaching Russian defenses is challenging. Previous attacks required both extensive planning and favorable circumstances. The possibility remains for a symbolic or political strike—especially if Russia shifts military logistics back to the bridge or a significant date approaches—but the probability of overcoming current defenses within the short remaining window is lower than earlier in the war[4][5].

- **Recent Activity:**  
While there have been reports of attacks against other targets in Crimea, as of mid-August 2024, there are no credible reports that the bridge itself or its immediate approaches have been struck or damaged by weapons fire since the question window began[5].

- **Status Quo Bias:**  
Given that the world often changes slowly and the bridge has not been hit despite declared intentions and ongoing war, the scenario where no successful attack occurs should be given substantial weight.

## Final Assessment

While Ukrainian intent, historical precedent, and the high symbolic value of the Crimean Bridge continue to make it an attractive target, the combination of greatly enhanced Russian defenses, a reduced military necessity, and no credible recent strikes during the question window points toward a *lower* probability of a successful attack before September 30, 2024. However, the possibility of a symbolic or opportunistic strike cannot be fully ruled out, especially given Ukraine's past creativity in operational planning.

**Probability: 30%**
