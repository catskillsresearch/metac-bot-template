(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
As of August 19, 2024, there are two days until the start of the resolution window (August 21–September 11, 2024), and 23 days until it concludes.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
If geomagnetic activity remains at current or typical levels for this solar cycle, and no new significant Earth-directed solar events occur, the strongest Kp index during the period will likely remain below 6, resulting in a "No" outcome.

(c) **Scenario for a No outcome:**  
No major Earth-directed coronal mass ejections (CMEs) or exceptionally strong solar flares occur during the period, or any geomagnetic storms that do occur remain at G2 (Kp = 6) or lower intensity. This outcome would arise if solar activity wanes or if CMEs are not Earth-directed, which is typical during intervals of non-peak activity.

(d) **Scenario for a Yes outcome:**  
One or more Earth-directed CMEs or strong solar flares, possibly from a persistent or returning active sunspot region (like AR3697), trigger geomagnetic storms that reach Kp > 6 but ≤ 7, i.e., a strong (G3) geomagnetic storm. This scenario requires either a return to, or continuation of, the elevated solar activity witnessed earlier in August, with at least one event reaching this precise Kp range.

## Rationale and Analysis

- **Current Activity:**  
August 2024 has seen substantial solar and geomagnetic activity, including a recent G4 (Severe, Kp=8) storm on August 12, showing the sun's capability for strong disturbances[2].
- **Sunspot Regions:**  
Active Region AR3697, previously responsible for major CMEs and storms (including May’s historic storm), remains a region of interest as it continues to rotate and evolve[1][2][5]. However, at the time of the last available observations, solar activity had dropped to *moderate* after M-class flares, with several active regions displaying less complex magnetic configurations[1].
- **Forecast Uncertainty:**  
Forecasters cannot reliably extend predictions for specific geomagnetic storm intensities more than a few days in advance, especially within the narrow Kp range of >6 to ≤7. While significant activity is possible given the current solar maximum phase and recent events, the baseline expectation should default to lower activity unless triggered by new, unexpected Earth-directed solar eruptions.
- **Historical Context:**  
Solar maximum periods, such as the present phase, are more likely to produce storms in the Kp=7+ range, but most periods still do not see frequent G3+ (Kp > 6) events. Kp values in the 6–7 range are less common than either lesser (quiet) or more extreme (Kp=8–9) storms during periods of extreme activity.
- **Status Quo Weight:**  
Professional forecasters place extra weight on the “no change” or status quo outcome because large space weather events, while possible, are rare even during solar maximum. The baseline odds remain against a Kp in the precise 6 < Kp ≤ 7 window unless evidence for another imminent storm emerges.

## Probability Estimate

Given ongoing heightened solar activity, the presence of AR3697, and recent major geomagnetic storms, there is an elevated—but still minority—chance that the interval will see a geomagnetic storm with Kp > 6 and ≤ 7. However, absent specific, imminent forecasts for major CMEs timed for August 21–September 11, and defaulting to the status quo, the likelihood remains below 50%.

**Probability: 35%**
