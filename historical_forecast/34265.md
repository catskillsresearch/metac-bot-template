(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  
There are about 2 months left until April 1, 2025, when the outcome will be determined.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
As of January 29, 2025, Republika Srpska has *not* officially scheduled or announced a date for an independence referendum. If no further action is taken, the outcome will be No.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
The leadership of Republika Srpska continues making statements regarding independence and potential referenda but does not officially announce or set a specific referendum date before April 1, 2025. This continuation of past behavior, where symbolic or provocative gestures occur without concrete scheduling, results in the question resolving as No[1][2][3].

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
A person or authority in Republika Srpska—most likely President Milorad Dodik or the National Assembly—publicly and officially announces a specific date for an independence referendum before April 1, 2025. This could be triggered by new developments, such as political opportunity, perceived threat to RS autonomy, a shift in international context (e.g., U.S. policy, European events), or internal political calculations[2][4].

## Rationale

Republika Srpska, under Milorad Dodik, has a long history of suggesting, threatening, or considering an independence referendum, but repeatedly falls short of officially scheduling one[1][2]. The recent record maintains this pattern: as of June 2024, Dodik had said a referendum "will be held on a date to be determined," explicitly stating that no date had yet been set and that further analysis was necessary[2]. The most recent reliable update (January 2025) confirms there is no announced date for an independence referendum, though commemorative referenda (such as the one on the RS holiday) have occurred in defiance of central authorities[3].

Dodik has connected the possibility of a referendum to external events, such as Donald Trump’s return to the U.S. presidency[4], and to watching how other independence movements navigate their own referenda (Scotland, Catalonia)[5]. Nevertheless, even with these developments, no evidence points to official scheduling as of late January 2025.

The international environment remains uncertain, but the process for a major political move like announcing a referendum date typically involves significant buildup, and to date, all indications are that preparations remain incomplete[2]. Given the limited time remaining, the inertia of the status quo, and Dodik’s habitual reliance on rhetorical threats over concrete action, the odds favor that no official date will be set before April 1, 2025.
