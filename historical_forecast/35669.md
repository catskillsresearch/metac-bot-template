(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
Today is May 6, 2025, and the outcome will be determined on or after March 31, 2025. The event in question is therefore **already in the past**; in real time, the outcome could be known as of now.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
According to the CEO of Kalshi’s tweet, as of the recent past, Kalshi is “back in top 10” of the iPhone Top Free Finance Apps chart in the US. If their position stabilizes or the app remains popular without significant surges or drops, the status quo expectation is that Kalshi would finish **within the top 10** on March 31, 2025.

(c) **Scenario describing an unexpected outcome:**  
An unexpected outcome would occur if, for example, a major technical failure, regulatory issue, or negative press coverage caused a rapid drop in downloads or reviews, pushing Kalshi well outside the top 10, or even out of the top 50. Conversely, a viral marketing campaign or unforeseen event driving a huge surge of user interest could briefly propel it to the very top rank or keep it unusually high for this segment.

## Rationale:

Well-established finance apps like Rocket Money, Acorns, Chime, and Binance dominate the rankings and have sustained large user bases and strong feature sets[1][2][3][4]. These apps historically show little short-term ranking volatility unless affected by major events. However, the CEO’s tweet indicates Kalshi was “back in top 10” very recently, suggesting both a drop and a subsequent resurgence—a sign of rank volatility possibly linked to market dynamics or marketing efforts.

The finance app category is highly competitive and subject to rapid fluctuations, but most apps remain within a typical band unless disrupted by major external factors (e.g., regulatory attention, viral trends, or technical outages)[1][3]. Since prediction markets (Kalshi’s segment) can be niche, a brief surge may not be as durable as long-term dominance, but the CEO’s confidence and recent return to top 10 status increases the likelihood that, barring negative surprises, Kalshi will remain highly ranked.

Because market conditions can change rapidly, it’s prudent to reserve meaningful probability for both small drops and the chance of unusual volatility (good forecasters always allow room for the unexpected).

## Probabilities

- **0-10**: 55%  
  Kalshi’s recent position in the top 10 and strong forward-looking statements from the CEO indicate a high likelihood of remaining here by March 31, 2025.
- **11-20**: 20%  
  Some likelihood of a minor drop-off due to category volatility, but still likely to remain prominent.
- **21-30**: 10%  
  Allows for a moderate unexpected decline, possibly due to new competitors or a temporary slowdown.
- **31-40**: 5%  
  Unlikely barring a significant negative event or surge in competitor momentum.
- **41-50**: 3%  
  Only plausible if there is a brief, sharp negative incident or misclassification.
- **Not in top 50**: 7%  
  Very unlikely, but retains a nonzero chance for catastrophic technical, regulatory, or reputational events.
