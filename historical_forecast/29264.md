(a) Time left until outcome: 8 months (May 2025 to January 1, 2025)
(b) Status quo outcome: No new COVID-19 VOC designation
(c) Scenario for No outcome: Current variants continue to circulate but none meet the strict VOC criteria; COVID-19 remains manageable with existing vaccines and treatments
(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: A new variant emerges with significantly increased severity, immune escape, or health system impact, prompting WHO to designate it as a VOC

Based on the current information available through April 2025, I need to assess the likelihood of the WHO designating a new COVID-19 Variant of Concern (VOC) before January 1, 2025.

According to the most recent data, WHO is currently tracking several SARS-CoV-2 variants, including two Variants of Interest (VOIs): BA.2.86 and JN.1, and seven Variants Under Monitoring (VUMs): JN.1.7, JN.1.18, KP.2, KP.3, KP.3.1.1, LB.1, and XEC[5]. As of September 24, 2024, a new variant named XEC, which is a recombinant of KS.1.1 and KP.3.3, was classified as a VUM[5].

## Historical Context

The last time WHO designated a new VOC was in November 2021 with Omicron. Since then, despite the emergence of numerous sublineages and variants, none has been elevated to VOC status. This represents over three years without a new VOC designation, suggesting a high bar for meeting VOC criteria.

In March 2023, WHO updated its tracking system and working definitions for variants of concern, variants of interest, and variants under monitoring[2]. Despite this update, the criteria for VOC designation remain stringent, requiring evidence of:
- Detrimental change in clinical disease severity, OR
- Substantial impact on health systems requiring major public health interventions, OR
- Significant decrease in vaccine effectiveness against severe disease

## Current Variant Landscape

The most prevalent variant globally is JN.1, reported by 140 countries and accounting for 16.0% of sequences in week 37 of 2024, down from 19.4% in week 34[5]. While variants KP.3.1.1 and XEC are showing increasing prevalence globally, there is currently no evidence that any circulating variant meets the criteria for VOC designation.

Importantly, there are "currently no reported laboratory or epidemiological reports indicating any association between VOIs/VUMs and increased disease severity"[4]. This absence of evidence for increased severity is a significant factor weighing against the likelihood of a new VOC designation in the near term.

## Surveillance Considerations

It's worth noting that "declining rates of testing and sequencing globally make it increasingly challenging to estimate the severity impact of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants"[4]. This surveillance challenge could theoretically delay the identification of a potentially concerning variant, but it doesn't change the fundamental criteria required for VOC designation.

## Status Quo Analysis

The status quo strongly suggests that no new VOC will be designated before January 1, 2025. Several factors support this:

1. The high threshold for VOC designation has not been met by any variant in over three years
2. Current variants show no evidence of increased disease severity
3. The global trend indicates decreasing, not increasing, prevalence of most variants
4. Health system impacts remain manageable without major new interventions

While viral evolution is unpredictable and a new concerning variant could theoretically emerge at any time, the historical pattern and current data suggest this is unlikely in the timeframe specified.

## Probability of Disruption

For a new VOC to be designated, a variant would need to emerge or evolve that demonstrates significant changes in severity, immune escape, or health system impact. Given the relatively short timeframe (approximately 7 months from the most recent data to January 1, 2025), and the absence of any current variants trending in that direction, this appears unlikely.

The most recent WHO COVID-19 Epidemiological Update from September 2024 shows that hospitalization numbers are relatively low (26,730 new hospitalizations globally during the 28 days from August 19 to September 15, 2024)[5], suggesting that current variants are not causing the level of health system impact that would trigger VOC designation.

Probability: 15%
