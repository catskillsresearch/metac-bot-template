(a) Time left until outcome known: From July 11 to September 30, 2024, there are about 2.5 months remaining for the ICC Pre-Trial Chamber to decide whether to issue an arrest warrant for Yoav Gallant.

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changes: As of July 11, 2024, the ICC Prosecutor has formally applied for an arrest warrant for Gallant, but the Pre-Trial Chamber has not yet issued any warrant. Without new developments, no warrant has been publicly released by the ICC.

(c) Scenario resulting in a No outcome: The Pre-Trial Chamber declines to issue an arrest warrant for Gallant before September 30, 2024, possibly due to insufficient evidence, political and diplomatic pressure (notably from the US and G7), or procedural delays. Alternatively, the warrant decision is postponed beyond the deadline, or the ICC pursues alternative investigative measures such as summons rather than an arrest warrant.

(d) Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome: The Pre-Trial Chamber reviews the Prosecutor’s May 2024 application and publicly issues an arrest warrant for Yoav Gallant before September 30, 2024. This would likely be accompanied by an official ICC announcement and confirmation by credible sources, making the warrant publicly known.

**Rationale:**

- The ICC Prosecutor’s application for an arrest warrant against Yoav Gallant was made public on May 20, 2024, establishing the basis for a warrant but not guaranteeing issuance[1].

- The ICC Pre-Trial Chamber has sole authority to approve such warrants after reviewing evidence. Their deliberations are confidential, and there is no set deadline for their decision[1].

- Historical precedent shows arrest warrant decisions can take considerable time, especially for high-profile figures such as Vladimir Putin, where weeks or months elapsed after an application[1].

- Strong political and diplomatic efforts by the US and G7 to dissuade the ICC from issuing warrants against Israeli officials introduce uncertainty and may delay or influence the Chamber’s decision[1][2].

- Given the complexity, political sensitivity, and no public announcement by mid-July 2024, the status quo suggests the likelihood of no warrant issued before September 30 is somewhat higher than warrant issuance.

- However, the Prosecutor’s public request and the serious nature of the allegations mean that an arrest warrant could still be issued within the 2.5-month window.

Taking these factors into account, while issuance is possible, the cautious tendency of the ICC combined with diplomatic pressure makes a warrant issuance before the deadline less likely than not.

**Final answer:** Probability: 30%
