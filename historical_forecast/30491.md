(a) Time left until outcome: 35 days (from today, November 26, 2024, until December 31, 2024)

(b) Status quo outcome: Currently, Waymo has rider-only service available to the general public in 3 US states: Arizona (Phoenix), California (San Francisco and Los Angeles), and Texas (Austin).

(c) Scenario for No outcome: Waymo maintains service in only the current 3 states through the end of 2024, with the planned Atlanta, Georgia expansion still on schedule for early 2025, not accelerating. Alternatively, Waymo could experience expansion beyond 4 states if they rapidly deploy in multiple new markets before year-end.

(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: Waymo accelerates its planned Atlanta expansion from early 2025 to late 2024, allowing them to have service in exactly 4 states (Arizona, California, Texas, and Georgia) by December 31, 2024.

Based on the available information, I need to forecast whether exactly 4 US states will have Waymo's rider-only ride-hailing service by December 31, 2024.

## Current State of Waymo's Operations

Waymo currently operates its rider-only service that's available to the general public in three states:

1. **Arizona** - Waymo operates in the Phoenix metropolitan area covering 315 square miles, following an expansion of 90 square miles in June 2024[1].

2. **California** - Waymo operates in both San Francisco and Los Angeles. The company has also applied for expansion to more areas within California, including the San Francisco Peninsula[3].

3. **Texas** - Waymo has launched service in Austin, where it's accessible through the Uber app (announced in September 2024)[4].

## Announced Future Expansions

The most relevant announced expansion is:

- **Georgia** - Waymo and Uber announced that they will bring autonomous ride-hailing to Atlanta "beginning in early 2025"[4]. This is explicitly scheduled for after the December 31, 2024 cutoff date.

## Analysis of Probability

The current status quo is 3 states with operational service, and the announced plans suggest the next state (Georgia) won't launch until early 2025. For the outcome to be exactly 4 states, either:

1. Waymo would need to accelerate the Atlanta launch from early 2025 to before December 31, 2024, or
2. Waymo would need to announce and launch in a completely different, previously unannounced fourth state.

Several factors suggest these scenarios are unlikely:

- The Uber-Waymo partnership announcement for Atlanta in September 2024 explicitly stated "early 2025"[4], indicating a deliberate timeline that likely accounts for necessary preparations, regulatory approvals, and technical readiness.

- Launching autonomous ride-hailing services requires significant preparation including mapping, testing, acquiring regulatory approvals, and establishing operational infrastructure. The explicit announcement of "early 2025" suggests these processes are scheduled with this timeframe in mind.

- With only 35 days remaining in 2024, there is very limited time for Waymo to accelerate deployments or announce and launch in a new, unannounced location.

- Autonomous vehicle deployments typically face regulatory scrutiny, as evidenced by the California legislative considerations mentioned in the search results[3].

## Status Quo Bias Consideration

As a forecaster, I recognize that the status quo typically has significant inertia. Companies generally stick to their announced timelines for major operational expansions, especially when those timelines are recent and explicit. The "early 2025" timeline for Atlanta was announced in September 2024, making it relatively recent and likely well-considered.

Given the technological complexity, regulatory requirements, and operational challenges of launching autonomous ride-hailing services, sudden accelerations of timelines by several months are uncommon without specific catalysts, which are not evident in this case.

## Final Assessment

The publicly available information strongly suggests that Waymo will maintain service in exactly 3 states through the end of 2024, with the fourth state (Georgia) coming online in early 2025 as explicitly announced. No additional states have been announced for 2024 deployment, and the timeframe remaining in 2024 makes unannounced launches unlikely.

Probability: 15%
