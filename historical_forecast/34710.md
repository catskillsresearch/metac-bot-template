(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
There are approximately 19 days until February 28, 2025.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
Donald Trump’s net favorability rating on 538 is likely to remain negative. His approval and favorability ratings have historically been underwater, and as of early February 2025, there is no credible evidence of a recent or ongoing surge that would push him to positive net favorability[1][2][3].  

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
The most straightforward scenario for a No outcome is that Trump’s favorability remains as it has for most of his recent political career: more Americans view him unfavorably than favorably. This would result in a net favorability below zero, and thus, not “Favorable” by 538’s criteria on February 28, 2025.  

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
For Trump to have a positive net favorability by February 28, 2025, there would need to be a sudden, significant, and durable shift in public perception. This could arise from an unexpected national or international event that dramatically improves Trump’s standing, a major policy success with widespread appeal, or a collapse in confidence in his main political opponents. There is no indication in current polling or news coverage that such an event is imminent or underway[1][3].

---
**Rationale:**  
Historical and current polling data both suggest that Trump has a deeply entrenched favorability deficit. Gallup reports his approval and favorability numbers continue to be among the lowest for a sitting president in modern polling history[1]. 538’s latest averages, as of late January 2025, do not indicate any significant shift toward a positive net favorability[2]. Fundamental political conditions rarely shift rapidly absent a major, unexpected crisis or bipartisan rallying event, neither of which has been documented in available reporting up to this point[1][3]. Given the short window remaining and the lack of evidence for a dramatic shift, the most likely scenario is that Trump’s net favorability on 538 will remain negative on February 28, 2025.
