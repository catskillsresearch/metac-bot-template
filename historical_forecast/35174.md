Based on the available information, I'll provide a forecast for Snoop Dogg's Instagram followers on March 30, 2025.

(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known:
From the current date (May 6, 2025), the outcome date (March 30, 2025) has already passed. However, based on the search results and personalization restrictions to use information before February 18, 2025, I'll make a forecast from that perspective - which would be about 40 days until March 30, 2025.

(b) The outcome if nothing changed:
From the search results, we know that Snoop Dogg lost approximately 500,000 followers after his appearance at Trump's inauguration in January 2025[5]. If nothing changed from mid-February 2025, his follower count would remain at whatever level it was at that point.

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued:
The search results indicate a significant follower drop in late January 2025, but don't provide specific information about ongoing trends in February 2025. The initial loss occurred over a relatively short period after a specific event.

(d) The expectations of experts and markets:
The search results don't provide expert opinions or market expectations about Snoop Dogg's future Instagram follower count.

(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome:
Snoop Dogg makes additional controversial political statements or appearances that alienate more of his fanbase, leading to accelerated follower losses beyond the initial drop.

(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome:
Snoop Dogg releases highly popular new music or makes a public statement that resonates positively with his audience, counteracting the January follower loss and potentially attracting new followers.

Considering the question carefully, I notice the units are not explicitly stated, but the range constraints (between 1.0 and 1.0) suggest this is asking for a proportion or probability rather than an absolute follower count. However, the context of the question strongly suggests we're forecasting actual follower numbers. Since the constraints appear inconsistent with the question, I'll provide my forecast in terms of millions of followers, which seems most appropriate given the context.

Given that Snoop Dogg had a significant social media presence despite losing 500,000 followers in January 2025, and considering the limited information available up to February 18, 2025:

Percentile 10: 87.3 million
Percentile 20: 87.6 million
Percentile 40: 88.0 million
Percentile 60: 88.3 million
Percentile 80: 88.7 million
Percentile 90: 89.0 million
