(a) Time left until outcome: Approximately 2 months (from August 2, 2024 to October 1, 2024)

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: No - Apple has not yet officially announced any iPhone with stacked battery technology.

(c) Scenario resulting in a No outcome: Apple decides to delay the implementation of stacked battery technology due to production issues, cost concerns, or strategic repositioning, pushing it to a future iPhone generation. Alternatively, they could announce the iPhone 16 lineup after October 1, 2024, or announce the iPhone 16 on schedule but without including stacked battery technology.

(d) Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome: Apple announces the iPhone 16 Pro and/or iPhone 16 Pro Max in September 2024 (their typical announcement timeframe) and officially confirms these models include stacked battery technology.

## Analysis of Available Evidence

Based on the search results from August 2024, there are strong indications that Apple is planning to implement stacked battery technology in at least some of its iPhone 16 models, particularly the Pro versions. Multiple credible sources report this development:

The iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max are specifically expected to use stacked battery technology for increased energy density and prolonged lifespan[1]. This technology is already common in electric vehicles and medical devices but represents an emerging advancement for smartphones.

A report from March 2024 mentioned the possibility of this technology enabling faster charging capabilities - up to 40W wired charging (compared to the current 27W) and 20W MagSafe charging (up from 15W)[2]. However, this particular rumor was noted as less corroborated at that time.

By July 2024, additional sources were reporting that Apple could "potentially use stacked battery technology to increase energy density and prolong lifespan across the lineup"[3], suggesting this feature might extend beyond just the Pro models.

The most recent information from July 2024 states more confidently that "To address the increased power demands, Apple is also likely to use stacked battery technology to enhance energy density and lifespan"[4].

A separate source confirms that "the iPhone 16 models will incorporate a new stacked battery technology that will result in more capacity and longer lifespan"[5].

## Timing Considerations

Apple traditionally announces new iPhone models in early-to-mid September. The iPhone 15 lineup was announced on September 12, 2023, and the iPhone 14 lineup on September 7, 2022. Given this consistent pattern, it's highly likely that Apple will announce the iPhone 16 lineup in September 2024, well before the October 1, 2024 deadline.

A recent report explicitly mentions that the "iPhone 16 Series Is Less Than Two Months Away"[3], further supporting the expectation of a September announcement.

## Probability Assessment

Weighing the evidence:

1. Multiple independent sources consistently report the planned inclusion of stacked battery technology in iPhone 16 models, particularly the Pro versions.

2. The timing aligns well with Apple's established announcement schedule, giving high confidence that some iPhone 16 model will be announced before October 1, 2024.

3. The stacked battery technology appears to be a key feature for addressing power demands and improving battery life in the new models.

4. However, as with any unreleased technology, there remains some uncertainty until Apple makes an official announcement. The company could potentially encounter production challenges or make last-minute design changes.

5. Given the consistency of reporting across multiple sources and the proximity to the expected announcement date, the probability appears quite high that Apple will announce at least one iPhone model with stacked battery technology before October 1, 2024.

Considering the status quo bias (that the world changes slowly), I must note that while Apple hasn't previously implemented stacked battery technology in iPhones, the evidence strongly suggests this is a planned evolution rather than a revolutionary departure.
