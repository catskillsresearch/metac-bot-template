(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  
The exact date of the 2025 Canadian federal election has not been specified in the sources, but Canadian general elections are typically held in October. As of May 6, 2025, there are approximately five to six months remaining until the election results—and thus the answer to this question—are known.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
If the current trends persist, the Liberal Party will win the most votes nationally. Multiple respected polls from March and April 2025 show the Liberals maintaining a lead of 7-8 points over the Conservatives (e.g., Liberals at 46% vs. Conservatives at 38%[1], and Liberals at 44% vs. Conservatives at 39%[2]). In the most recent polling, even with some tightening, the Liberals hold a narrow but consistent advantage among likely voters (41% to 39%)[5]. This reflects demographic and regional strengths for the Liberals, particularly in the largest provinces (Ontario and Quebec) and with women and older voters[1][2].

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
A No outcome occurs if the Liberals win the most popular votes, as current polling suggests. This would continue recent patterns: the Liberals have built a strong lead in key regions and are benefiting from their new leader, Mark Carney, as well as factors like opposition to U.S. President Trump’s policies, which have rallied core constituencies. Unless there is a dramatic late-campaign shift, the Liberals' broad appeal and efficient regional support likely prevent a Conservative popular vote win[1][2][5].

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
A Yes outcome would require the Conservatives to overtake the Liberals in national popular vote. This could happen if:
- The campaign undergoes an unexpected shift (e.g., a major Liberal scandal or an unpopular government move).
- The Conservatives successfully expand their appeal, especially among women and urban voters, or benefit from a late-campaign surge.
- A drop in Liberal turnout or a surge in Conservative voter mobilization changes the likely voter landscape compared to current polling.
While possible, recent polls and demographic patterns do not show evidence of such a shift underway[1][2][5].

## Rationale

Historical trends in Canadian federal elections suggest that popular vote intention does not often shift dramatically in the final months of a campaign unless triggered by major political or economic events. The Liberals’ strong lead in the most populous provinces (Ontario, Quebec, BC) and among key demographic groups (especially women) translates efficiently into popular vote totals[1][2]. The Conservatives’ vote is heavily concentrated in Alberta and the Prairies, which inflates riding margins without boosting overall national share, creating an "inefficient" distribution for winning the popular vote[2].

While volatility is always possible, current evidence strongly favors a Liberal win in the national popular vote. As a professional forecaster, I must put extra weight on the status quo, especially given the historical stickiness of voting trends this late in the cycle, the broad and demographically diversified Liberal support, and the absence of clear momentum for the Conservatives.

**Probability: 15%**  
(The Conservative Party is unlikely to win the popular vote in the 2025 Canadian federal election, but late-campaign surprises cannot be entirely ruled out.)
