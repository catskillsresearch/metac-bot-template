(a) **Time left until outcome known:**  
As of November 14, 2024, there are about 47 days until December 31, 2024, when the determination will be made.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
As of late October 2024, Arkansas was experiencing significant drought in southern, central, and western regions, driven by several dry months. However, very heavy rainfall in early November alleviated drought in northern and western Arkansas[4]. The precise number of residents in drought as of mid-November is not provided, but the trend suggests improvement from late October's peak drought coverage. If no further major rainfall or drought development occurs, it is plausible that significant portions of Arkansas could still be in drought—especially the more populated central region, possibly keeping the affected population near or just below the 1 million threshold.

(c) **Scenario for a No outcome (fewer than 1 million residents in drought):**  
If the early November rainfall was sufficient to significantly shrink the spatial extent and severity of drought, especially in or near Arkansas's major population centers (such as Little Rock and surrounding counties), and if the climate outlook's prediction for above-average precipitation in November continues into December, then by December 31, drought would be limited mainly to sparsely populated southern and/or western areas. In this case, fewer than 1 million residents would remain in drought conditions at year-end[2].

(d) **Scenario for a Yes outcome (1 million or more residents in drought):**  
If the rainfall in November proved insufficient to fully alleviate drought in central Arkansas or if renewed dryness in December (possibly from La Niña-influenced weather) causes drought to persist or expand again into populous counties, then more than 1 million residents could remain affected[5]. This is especially plausible if the central corridor (including the Little Rock metro area) remains or returns to drought at the end of the year.

## Rationale

- **Recent Rainfall and Drought Relief:** The first week of November brought record-breaking rainfall to northern and western Arkansas, likely shrinking drought coverage in those regions[2]. This suggests a trend toward improvement, particularly in less densely populated areas.
- **Population Distribution Matters:** The critical factor is whether central Arkansas—including Pulaski County (Little Rock)—remains in drought, as it is home to a large share of the state’s population.
- **Climate Outlook:** The short-term outlook (November) favors above-normal precipitation, supporting continued drought alleviation[2]. However, the transition to La Niña introduces uncertainty: while southern states to Arkansas’s east are likely to be drier, the direct December outlook for Arkansas is ambiguous with a modest risk for below-average precipitation[5].
- **Pace of Change:** Given that drought tends to improve slowly (even after major rain events, residual drought may linger), status quo bias suggests drought could persist in at least some of the more populated areas, though the odds are tilting toward improvement given recent substantial rainfall.

**Summary**: The most likely outcome is that the number of Arkansas residents in drought will drop below 1 million by December 31, 2024, due to recent heavy rains and a near-term wetter outlook, but there remains a material risk that drought lingers or redevelops in populated areas, especially if December is drier than normal.

**Probability: 40%** (that Arkansas will have 1 million or more residents in drought on December 31, 2024)
