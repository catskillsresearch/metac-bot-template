I'll assess this forecasting question about potential Google/Alphabet layoffs being reported by Tech Crunch before the end of 2024.

(a) Time left until outcome is known: 55 days (from May 6, 2025 to December 31, 2024)
Wait, that's incorrect. Since today is May 6, 2025, the outcome to this question is already known since December 31, 2024 has passed.

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: No. If Tech Crunch did not report any new Google/Alphabet layoffs in October, November, or December 2024, the question resolves as No.

(c) Scenario resulting in No outcome: Tech Crunch continued tracking layoffs but Google/Alphabet managed to avoid further staff reductions in Q4 2024, perhaps due to improved financial performance, completion of earlier restructuring efforts, or strategic decisions to maintain workforce stability during the holiday season and year-end.

(d) Scenario resulting in Yes outcome: Google/Alphabet announced another round of layoffs in late 2024, perhaps due to continued cost-cutting measures, organizational restructuring, or shifting resources toward AI initiatives, and Tech Crunch documented this in their comprehensive layoff tracker before December 31, 2024.

## Rationale

Since I'm being asked this question in May 2025, the outcome is already determined, but I'll approach this as if I were making a forecast in November 2024 based on the information available then.

Looking at the historical pattern, Google has already conducted several rounds of layoffs throughout 2024, with reported cuts in January, May, and July. This suggests a consistent pattern of workforce adjustments throughout the year, though with decreasing frequency in the second half of the year (no reported layoffs in August or September).

The most recent layoffs reported by Tech Crunch occurred in July 2024, focused on Cloud teams. This represents a gap of several months before our assessment point in November. This slowing pattern could indicate that Google had largely completed its planned restructuring for the year.

CEO Sundar Pichai had warned employees in January 2024 that more layoffs would occur throughout the year, but emphasized they would be more targeted and smaller than 2023's cuts. The layoffs that occurred in the first half of 2024 appear consistent with this messaging, suggesting Google was following through on its announced plans.

The tech industry in general experienced significant layoffs in early 2024, with over 80,000 workers affected across the sector according to the search results. However, there's no clear indication of whether this trend continued at the same pace into the final months of 2024.

As a forecaster, I should give significant weight to the status quo outcome. The absence of reported Google layoffs in August through October suggests a possible stabilization. Tech companies often try to avoid major layoffs during the holiday season (November-December) due to morale and public relations considerations.

Given the pattern of decreasing frequency of layoffs throughout 2024, the significant time gap since the last reported layoffs, and the typical reluctance to conduct major layoffs in the final quarter of the year, I would lean toward a "No" outcome being more likely.

However, I must acknowledge that Google has demonstrated a willingness to make workforce adjustments throughout 2024, and economic conditions or strategic pivots could prompt additional cuts before year-end.

Probability: 30%
