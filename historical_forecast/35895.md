(a) Time until outcome is known: 18 days (from March 10, 2025 to March 28, 2025)

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: The frac spread count would remain around 214, which was the count at the end of February 2025.

(c) Unexpected outcome scenario: A sudden geopolitical event in a major oil-producing region could trigger an oil price spike, prompting US producers to rapidly increase fracking activity to capitalize on higher prices. This could push the count significantly above recent trends, potentially into the 228-234 or even Over 235 range.

As a professional forecaster, I need to analyze the US frac spread count trend and make a prediction for March 28, 2025. The frac spread count measures the number of crews actively performing hydraulic fracturing of shale in the US[3].

Looking at the historical data, I observe a clear downward trend throughout 2024. By December 27, 2024, the total frac spreads were at 201, which represented a decrease of 39 from the previous year when it was at 240[2]. This consistent decline suggests structural factors affecting the industry rather than just seasonal variation.

The research provided indicates that as of February 28, 2025, the count stood at 214. This represents a slight increase from the December 2024 numbers, but still reflects the broader downward trend compared to previous years. Without significant market changes, this gradual decline or stabilization pattern is likely to continue.

One relevant factor is the startup of the Matterhorn Express Pipeline in late 2024, which was expected to support Waha gas prices and potentially affect fracking activity. However, this effect would likely already be incorporated into the February 2025 numbers[4].

Another consideration is that according to industry projections, some Permian companies planned to frac approximately 3600 wells in 2025, using about 55 frac spreads[5]. This suggests some stability in planned activities in key production regions.

The absence of major policy changes or market shocks reported in early 2025 suggests that dramatic shifts in either direction are unlikely. However, as a forecaster, I must account for unpredictable events such as sudden price changes, weather disruptions, or operational adjustments that could cause short-term fluctuations.

Given the historical trend, current data, and absence of major disruptive factors, I believe the 211-219 range is most likely, with a slight bias toward the lower end of this range given the long-term downward trend. However, I must also assign some probability to unexpected outcomes in either direction.

My final probabilities for the US frac spread count for the week ending March 28, 2025:

Under 211: 25%
211-219: 55%
220-227: 15%
228-234: 4%
Over 235: 1%
