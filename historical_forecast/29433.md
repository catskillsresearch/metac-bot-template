(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
The outcome will be determined on Election Day, November 5, 2024, which is just a few days from the cutoff date of October 31, 2024.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
North Dakota voters have rejected recreational marijuana legalization twice recently: by 59.45% in 2018 and 54.94% in 2022. The political and social climate toward legalization has not seen any significant shifts as of October 2024, nor is there compelling polling to suggest a reversal. Therefore, if trends hold, the status quo outcome is that Measure 5 will be rejected[4][5].

(c) **Scenario that results in a No outcome:**  
Most likely, North Dakota voters continue their recent pattern of opposing recreational marijuana. If turnout and demographics are similar to 2018 and 2022, and absent a late-breaking campaign or surge in pro-legalization sentiment, a majority again vote “No,” keeping recreational cannabis illegal[4][5].

(d) **Scenario that results in a Yes outcome:**  
Measure 5 passes if there has been a significant, mostly undetected shift toward legalization among North Dakota voters, perhaps due to changing attitudes, generational turnover, or a last-minute, highly effective “Yes” campaign. Early voting or turnout among younger or more urban voters could drive the initiative over the 50% threshold required for passage[4][5].

## Rationale

- North Dakota voters have twice rejected similar recreational marijuana measures, though the margin narrowed in 2022.
- There is no public polling or reporting as of October 31, 2024, indicating a decisive swing in public opinion.
- The measure’s language and provisions are similar to prior failed proposals[4][5].
- No major political or policy developments suggest a major realignment of voter sentiment.
- Barring a late-breaking shift, the default expectation should be a continuation of recent voting trends.

**Good forecasters tend to assign extra weight to the status quo, especially when change is incremental, as it appears to be here.**
