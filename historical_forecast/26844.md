(a) **Time Left Until the Outcome Is Known:**  
There is one month remaining until the September 1, 2024 deadline by which Edmundo González must either concede or not for the forecast resolution.

(b) **Status Quo Outcome if Nothing Changed:**  
As of July 31, 2024, Edmundo González has not conceded the election to Nicolás Maduro. The opposition continues to explicitly reject the announced results and claim victory for González, presenting alleged evidence to support this claim[2][5]. If this situation persists and González does not issue an explicit and unambiguous public concession, the question will resolve as 'No'.

(c) **Scenario That Results in a No Outcome:**  
González maintains his and the opposition’s position of rejecting the official results, continues to claim victory, and does not make a public, explicit concession to Maduro before September 1, 2024. This could occur either because the opposition does not accept the results, fears legitimizing what it views as an illegitimate process, or is constrained by political, legal, or personal risk.

(d) **Scenario That Results in a Yes Outcome:**  
González publicly and unambiguously concedes the election to Maduro before September 1, 2024, acknowledging his defeat and Maduro’s victory. This could happen if there is significant international pressure, a credible negotiation results in guarantees for the opposition, or the opposition leadership alters its strategy to focus on future political participation rather than contesting the 2024 result.

## Rationale

The **status quo** is a strong predictor in this scenario. Historically, the Venezuelan opposition has refused to concede elections it considers fraudulent, particularly when facing widespread international condemnation of irregularities and significant domestic support for its claims[2][5]. 

Current opposition actions—publicly rejecting the results, refusing to acknowledge Maduro as the victor, and publishing alleged evidence of opposition victory—indicate an entrenched stance[2][5]. Multiple international actors, such as the Carter Center and the U.S. government, have highlighted serious irregularities and called for transparency, further supporting the opposition’s refusal to concede[2][5]. There is no evidence, as of July 31, 2024, that González or senior opposition figures are considering a concession.

The only plausible paths to a concession before September would require dramatic changes: unexpectedly strong international pressure with guaranteed incentives or safety for opposition figures, or overwhelming domestic pressures forcing a strategic change. Both are unlikely in the short available window, given the regime's historical intransigence and the opposition’s current public stance.

**Probability: 95%**

There is a very high likelihood that Edmundo González will not concede the 2024 Venezuelan election to Nicolás Maduro before September 2024, barring a dramatic and currently unforeseen development[2][5].
