As a professional forecaster interviewing for a job, I'll approach this question methodically to provide an accurate forecast of the maximum daily average CO₂ reported by the Mauna Loa Observatory for March 1-25, 2025.

(a) Time left until outcome is known:
The outcome will be determined when Metaculus assesses the data on March 28, 2025. Today is March 3, 2025, so there are 25 days remaining until the outcome is known.

(b) Status quo outcome:
Based on the search results, the daily average CO₂ level at Mauna Loa has already reached 430.60 ppm by March 7, 2025[2]. Since this falls within our target period (March 1-25), this represents the current known maximum.

(c) Outcome if current trend continues:
If the current seasonal upward trend continues, we can expect the maximum daily average to potentially exceed 430.60 ppm in the remaining days of March. CO₂ levels typically rise from September through May due to Northern Hemisphere seasonal patterns[2][4].

(d) Expectations of experts and markets:
The data shows that CO₂ levels have been increasing at an accelerated rate recently. The February 2025 monthly mean was 427.09 ppm, up 2.54 ppm from February 2024[4]. Additionally, 2023-2024 saw the largest two-year jump in CO₂ levels in the NOAA record[5]. This suggests experts would expect the trend of rapidly increasing CO₂ levels to continue.

(e) Unexpected scenario resulting in a low outcome:
An unexpected volcanic event near Mauna Loa could temporarily disrupt measurements or cause data collection issues. Alternatively, an unusual weather pattern could cause temporary decreases in local CO₂ concentrations, though this would be rare given Mauna Loa's elevation and isolation from local pollution sources.

(f) Unexpected scenario resulting in a high outcome:
A sudden spike in global emissions, perhaps from increased industrial activity or major forest fires in the Northern Hemisphere, could cause CO₂ levels to rise faster than expected. Additionally, unusual atmospheric circulation patterns could concentrate CO₂ at the measurement location, causing temporary higher readings.

Taking all factors into consideration, including the already observed 430.60 ppm on March 7, 2025, the ongoing seasonal rise, and the accelerated rate of CO₂ increase seen in recent years, I provide the following forecast:

Percentile 10: 430.60 ppm
Percentile 20: 430.90 ppm
Percentile 40: 431.30 ppm
Percentile 60: 431.70 ppm
Percentile 80: 432.10 ppm
Percentile 90: 432.50 ppm
