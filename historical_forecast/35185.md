Analyzing Tesla's Q1 2025 vehicle deliveries requires careful consideration of historical patterns, current trends, and potential disruptors. Let me work through this methodically.

(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known:
Tesla typically reports Q1 deliveries around April 2, which is approximately 11 months from now (from the current date of May 6, 2025). However, since the search results indicate this data should have already been reported (expected April 2, 2025), the outcome should already be known, but the information may not yet be available in the search results provided.

(b) The outcome if nothing changed:
If we take Tesla's Q1 2024 deliveries as a baseline, that would be approximately 387,000 vehicles[1].

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued:
Tesla delivered 495,570 vehicles in Q4 2024[2], but Q1 typically shows seasonal decline from Q4. Looking at historical patterns, we would expect some decrease from Q4 to Q1, possibly in the range of 15-20%, which would put Q1 2025 deliveries around 400,000-420,000 vehicles.

(d) The expectations of experts and markets:
The Metaculus prediction community estimated a median of 397,100 vehicle deliveries for Q1 2025, with a confidence interval ranging from 372,400 to 429,800 vehicles[4]. Researcher Troy Teslike expected Q1 2025 deliveries to fall below 400,000 units, citing limitations in ramping production of the refreshed Model Y, poor brand sentiment, and seasonal demand patterns[5].

(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome:
A significant production disruption at one of Tesla's major factories, particularly in Shanghai during or after Chinese New Year, combined with accelerated decline in consumer sentiment toward the brand could push deliveries down to the 350,000 range or lower. Additionally, supply chain disruptions or component shortages could severely impact production capacity.

(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome:
An unexpectedly strong reception to the refreshed Model Y, combined with new incentives in key markets and production efficiencies at Tesla factories, could push deliveries up to 450,000 or higher. If Tesla managed to accelerate production of its newer models while maintaining strong Model 3/Y output, they could break the typical Q1 seasonal pattern.

Considering all these factors and acknowledging the inherent uncertainty in forecasting, here is my confidence interval for Tesla's Q1 2025 vehicle deliveries:

Percentile 10: 360,000
Percentile 20: 375,000
Percentile 40: 390,000
Percentile 60: 405,000
Percentile 80: 425,000
Percentile 90: 440,000
