(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  
There are just over two months (about 10 weeks) until Friday, September 20, 2024, when the outcome will be determined.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
On July 5, 2024, the DEXCAUS (Canadian Dollar to U.S. Dollar spot exchange rate) was 1.3631, which is **above** the 1.3600 threshold. If the exchange rate remains at current levels or within the recent range (1.3493–1.3824), the status quo outcome would be **Yes**—above 1.3600.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
A "No" would occur if the Canadian dollar strengthens relative to the U.S. dollar, pushing the exchange rate to 1.3600 or lower by September 20, 2024. This could happen if:
- The Bank of Canada takes a more hawkish monetary policy stance (e.g., signals it will not cut rates further or even hints at hikes).
- Canadian economic data surprises to the upside (e.g., strong GDP or jobs growth, or surging oil prices).
- The U.S. economy unexpectedly shows signs of slowing, prompting the Fed to hint at faster or deeper rate cuts.
- Oil prices spike sharply, benefitting the Canadian dollar as a commodity currency.

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
A "Yes" would occur if the exchange rate is above 1.3600, meaning a relatively weaker Canadian dollar. This could occur if:
- The U.S. economy remains strong or surprises to the upside, keeping the Fed on hold or resulting in slower rate cuts, supporting the U.S. dollar[4].
- The Bank of Canada continues or accelerates rate cuts, or if Canadian economic data continues to underperform[3].
- Global risk aversion remains elevated, benefiting the U.S. dollar as a safe-haven.
- Oil and commodity prices weaken, putting downward pressure on the Canadian dollar.

## Rationale

- **Recent Range:** The rate has been consistently above 1.3600 in recent weeks, with a three-month range of 1.3493–1.3824, and as of July 5, is at 1.3631, just above the line[3].
- **Bank Forecasts:** Major institutional forecasts for Q3 and Q4 2024 are wide, but the consensus is that the USD/CAD will be volatile and potentially biased toward a stronger U.S. dollar. Bullish bank projections for Q3 and Q4 reach as high as 1.40, while the most bearish sit at 1.32[3].
- **Fundamentals:** Persistent U.S. economic strength and only gradual Fed easing provide tailwinds for the dollar[4]. The Bank of Canada has been more dovish, signaling potential further easing if domestic growth and inflation remain subdued[3].
- **Risks:** Key risks that could push the rate down (for a No outcome) include a sudden oil price rally or strong Canadian economic surprises.
- **Weight to Status Quo:** Since currency markets rarely see sharp, sustained moves without new catalysts, and the current level is above the threshold, the status quo outcome (Yes) deserves substantial weight.

## Final Probability

**Probability: 72%**

This estimate reflects strong but not overwhelming odds for the rate remaining above 1.3600, given current positioning, the macro backdrop, and the tendency for exchange rates to persist in established ranges unless jolted by new macroeconomic data or policy surprises[3][4].
