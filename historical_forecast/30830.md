(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
There are 25 days remaining until December 31, 2024.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
On December 5, 2024, Tesla’s stock closed at $403.84, which is well above the $340 threshold. If the stock price remained unchanged until December 31, 2024, the outcome would clearly be **Yes**[3][5].

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
A "No" outcome would occur if Tesla's stock price dropped below $340 by the close of trading on December 31, 2024. This could be triggered by unexpected negative developments such as a broader market sell-off, unfavorable company news (e.g., earnings miss, legal or regulatory troubles), or waning investor confidence—especially given Tesla’s well-documented volatility and the substantial range of analyst price targets, some as low as $135[3][4].

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
A "Yes" outcome occurs if Tesla’s closing price remains at or above $340 on December 31, 2024. This could result from the ongoing positive sentiment, continued momentum from the post-election rally, or favorable developments in the company or broader market that sustain current valuation. The latest analyst targets from Bank of America and Wedbush are notably bullish, with targets at $400 (12% above recent closes), highlighting optimism about Tesla’s growth potential[5].

## Rationale

The current price of $403.84 as of December 5, 2024, is substantially higher than the $340 threshold, and the post-election rally as well as Elon Musk’s political role have contributed to recent strength[3][5]. While forecasts from earlier in the year were bearish—with some sources projecting year-end prices well below $340[3][4]—recent momentum and upgraded analyst targets suggest market sentiment has shifted positively heading into year-end[5].

However, Tesla’s stock is historically volatile, and a swing of over 15% downward in 25 days is not unprecedented for the company. This is evidenced by mixed analyst views, with price targets ranging from $135 to $1,000, underlining the risk of sharp moves in either direction[3][4].

Good forecasters give extra weight to the status quo, as abrupt, large-magnitude changes are less common than gradual or stable trends—especially over short timeframes unless catalyzed by significant events. Given the current strong position above $340, only a significant negative shock would likely drop the price below that threshold before year-end.

**Probability: 87%**

This reflects a high likelihood that Tesla will close at or above $340 on December 31, 2024, but incorporates a meaningful risk of late-year volatility or market shocks that could push the closing price below the threshold.
