(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  
Roughly 2 months remain before January 1, 2025.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
If current conditions persist, the latest CDC IRAT assessment of an H5 virus would remain at "moderate" emergence risk (score of 5.79 for A/Texas/37/2024, as published August 9, 2024), well below the threshold for "high" (≥8.0)[1][2][3][5]. No H5 virus has been rated "high" by the CDC IRAT to date.

(c) **Scenario leading to a No outcome:**  
No significant change in the epidemiology, virology, or laboratory indicators (such as sustained human-to-human transmission, dramatic shifts in receptor binding, or clear evidence of population immunity loss) would result in no new IRAT assessment or an updated score remaining in the moderate range before the deadline. The IRAT process is systematic, and most H5N1 strains have repeatedly scored moderate, reinforcing this scenario[1][2][3][5].

(d) **Scenario leading to a Yes outcome:**  
A "high" emergence risk rating (score ≥8.0) could occur if compelling evidence emerges before January 1, 2025, that an H5 virus has considerably increased its capacity for efficient human-to-human transmission—e.g., a well-documented cluster demonstrating sustained spread, significant genetic adaptation, or alarming findings in animal models strongly predictive of pandemic potential. This would likely require not only new events but also time to gather, analyze, and publish that data and for the CDC to convene another IRAT panel, complete its review, and update the published risk score.

## Rationale

- **Historical and Current Score Trajectory:** No H5 virus has approached the "high" threshold in previous or current IRAT assessments, with all recent clade 2.3.4.4b H5N1 evaluations firmly in the moderate bracket[1][2][3][5].
- **Timing and Process Constraints:** The IRAT process involves expert panel review and often lags new outbreaks by weeks or months. With only about two months before the deadline, a new, major epidemiological signal would need to emerge, be verified, and drive the CDC through its full review and publication cycle.
- **Epidemiologic Status:** While monitoring is ongoing and research priorities remain high, the public and individual health risk of H5N1 in the US is currently assessed as "low," and no sudden, dramatic developments have been reported in the lead-up to this forecast[3][4][5].
- **Likelihood of Drastic Change:** While avian influenza viruses can evolve unpredictably, the odds of the CDC IRAT leaping from moderate to high within this tight timeframe—absent an unprecedented outbreak scenario—are low, especially given the CDC's typically cautious and data-driven approach to risk adjustment.
