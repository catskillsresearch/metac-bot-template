(a) Time left until outcome: Approximately 7 months from today (May 6, 2025) until the week of December 9, 2024.

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: Based on the most recent data from November 2024, the national average gas price is $3.04 per gallon.

(c) Scenario for a No outcome: If crude oil prices fluctuate significantly due to geopolitical tensions or if refineries experience unexpected disruptions, prices could move outside the narrow $3.020-$3.080 range. Additionally, if winter demand is higher than expected or if there are supply chain issues, prices could remain above $3.08 per gallon.

(d) Scenario for a Yes outcome: If seasonal patterns hold as forecasted, with prices typically declining in winter months due to lower demand and the switch to winter-blend gasoline, the national average could settle within the $3.020-$3.080 range. The expected continued decline in prices throughout 2024 supports this possibility.

The question asks whether the US national average retail price of regular gasoline will be between $3.020 and $3.080 (inclusive) for the week of December 9, 2024. Looking at the available data and forecasts, I need to assess how likely it is for prices to fall within this narrow range.

According to the search results, the most recent data shows that the national average gas price in November 2024 was $3.04[4], which falls directly within the target range of $3.020-$3.080. This represents the status quo as of the most recent available information.

Historical data and forecasts provide additional context. The search results indicate that gas prices have been on a general downward trend. According to the FRED data, prices were projected to be $3.181 in November 2024 and $3.145 in December 2024[3], showing a slight decreasing trend. The actual November 2024 price of $3.04[4] came in lower than these projections, suggesting the downward trend may be more pronounced than initially forecasted.

GasBuddy's 2024 Fuel Outlook (released in December 2023) predicted that gas prices would decline in 2024, with the yearly national average dropping from $3.51 per gallon in 2023 to $3.38 in 2024[5]. More specifically, they forecasted that prices could fall below $3 per gallon during winter 2024 before rising again in late February[5]. While this forecast is somewhat dated, it aligns with the observed decrease to $3.04 by November 2024.

Seasonal patterns also support the possibility of prices remaining within or near the target range in December. Gasoline prices typically decline during winter months due to lower demand and the switch to winter-blend gasoline, which is less expensive to produce[5]. December falls squarely within this winter period of typically lower prices.

The narrow price range of $3.020-$3.080 represents only a $0.06 window, which is quite tight given the volatility of gas prices. However, the fact that the current price of $3.04 already falls within this range is significant. With winter's typically stabilizing effect on prices, there's a reasonable chance the price will remain within this narrow band.

That said, gas prices are inherently volatile and subject to numerous factors that could push them outside this range, including:
- Unexpected geopolitical events
- Supply disruptions
- Weather events affecting refinery operations
- Changes in crude oil prices
- Shifts in consumer demand

Given that the current price is already within the target range, the seasonal tendency toward stable or slightly declining prices in winter, and the general downward trend observed throughout 2024, I believe there is a moderately high probability that the price will remain within the $3.020-$3.080 range for the week of December 9, 2024.

Probability: 65%
