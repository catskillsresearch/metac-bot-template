(a) **Time left until the outcome is known**:  
From today, January 31, 2025, there are 57 days until March 29, 2025.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed**:  
If there are no unexpected arrivals or departures, and current crew rosters remain steady, **10 people in space** (as reported on January 14, 2025) is the best estimate for March 29, 2025.

(c) **Scenario that results in an unexpected outcome**:  
A private mission, such as a SpaceX, Axiom Space, or Blue Origin flight, could be scheduled for late March, launching additional crew (e.g., a 4-person commercial flight overlapping ongoing station crews) and briefly raising the count above 10. Conversely, an unexpected early crew return, medical evacuation, or major delay/cancellation of a planned launch could bring the number below 10.

### Rationale

- **Status Quo:**  
Historically, the number of people in space fluctuates modestly, often pegged to the ISS and Tiangong’s scheduled staffing and the periodic overlap during crew rotations. The most common crew complement is 7 on the ISS and 3 on Tiangong, totaling 10. This “10” is a sticky number, and as of January 2025, there are no widely-publicized mission plans for late March that would dramatically alter this.

- **Less Than 10:**  
This scenario is less likely but not impossible. Crew rotations do occasionally result in a brief drop in occupancy, and there's a small chance of an early or delayed return, or a gap between outgoing and incoming crews.

- **Greater Than 10:**  
The surge above 10 almost always requires a cabin overlap (two station crews during rotation) *or* a private/space tourism mission. While private missions have become more frequent, they're not so common as to expect them **by default** in any random week, unless specifically scheduled. Still, there is a non-negligible chance of such overlap occurring for a short period.

Given the above and recognizing that good forecasters overweight the status quo but do not discount surprising outcomes completely:

---

**Probabilities**

- **Less than 10:** 18%
- **10:** 68%
- **Greater than 10:** 14%

---

**Summary**
- The most likely outcome is **10**—the status quo.
- Some moderate chance exists for drops (crew transitions or emergencies).
- Smaller, but real, chance of a temporary surge due to private/civilian launches or crew overlaps.
