(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**
The Steam Weekly Top Sellers chart for March 18–25, 2025, will be published shortly after March 25, 2025—about two weeks from today (May 6, 2025). The official resolution occurs when Metaculus or another third party accesses the chart after March 26, 2025.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**
Assassin’s Creed Shadows is set for worldwide release on March 20, 2025—within the measured week (March 18–25, 2025). Pre-order sales are reportedly strong and in line with Assassin’s Creed Odyssey, the franchise’s second most successful entry, and Ubisoft is making the game available on Steam on day one[4]. Major Assassin’s Creed games typically debut near the very top of Steam’s charts. Unless the launch is marred by technical or critical problems, the status quo expectation is a rank between #1 and #3 for its launch week.

(c) **Scenario leading to an unexpected outcome:**
An unexpected outcome could occur if:
- A globally anticipated, surprise release (e.g., a Valve or Rockstar game) launches in the exact same week, overshadowing AC Shadows.
- Major technical issues or widespread negative reviews suppress sales/interest after launch.
- Steam Deck hardware or a major live-service game (e.g., Helldivers 2, Path of Exile 2) experiences a sales surge, pushing AC Shadows lower despite solid numbers[1].

**Rationale:**
The conservative forecast puts extra weight on the status quo—AAA games with strong pre-orders and simultaneous Steam launch nearly always reach the top three (often #1) on launch week, even with only 4–5 days of sales counted. Only rare, high-profile competitors; controversy; or a disastrous, unplayable launch keep a major Assassin’s Creed from this bracket. The risk of a game like Steam Deck or another major title holding #1 exists (Steam Deck has topped previous charts around major launches[1]), so #1 is likely but not a sure thing.

Moderate probabilities should be left for positions #2–#3 and some for top 5–10, as unanticipated events (technical fiasco, overwhelming competitor, publisher mishap) sometimes disrupt major launches.

**Final Probabilities:**

- 1: 47%
- 2: 30%
- 3: 13%
- 4-5: 6%
- 6-7: 2%
- 8-9: 1%
- 10+: 1%
