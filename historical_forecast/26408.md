(a) Time left: 4 months and 24 days until September 30, 2024.

(b) Status quo outcome: No increase in minimum wage until the scheduled December 2024 review.

(c) No outcome scenario: The Turkish government maintains its stated position that there will be no interim minimum wage increase before December 2024, despite continued inflation and economic pressure on workers.

(d) Yes outcome scenario: The government reverses its position due to extreme economic deterioration, widespread protests, or political calculations, implementing an emergency minimum wage increase before September 30, 2024.

Based on the available information, I believe the probability of a minimum wage increase in Turkey before September 30, 2024, is very low for several key reasons.

First, Turkish government officials have repeatedly and explicitly ruled out an interim minimum wage increase. Most recently in June 2024, Labor Minister Vedat Işıkhan clearly stated, "We'll meet to determine the new minimum wage in December," and confirmed there would not be an interim increase[3]. This reaffirmed his April 2024 statement that the government had "no such agenda" for a second minimum wage hike in 2024[4].

This position is consistent with Turkey's return to a more traditional annual adjustment schedule. While the government did implement twice-yearly increases in 2022 and 2023, this was during periods leading up to major elections[3]. With no elections scheduled until 2028, the political incentive for wage increases appears to have diminished significantly[3].

The most recent minimum wage increase was substantial - a 49% raise that took effect on January 1, 2024, bringing the net monthly minimum wage to TRY 17,002.12[2][5]. This significant adjustment was likely intended to compensate workers through most of 2024, despite ongoing inflation.

A practical consideration is the timing - with less than five months remaining until the scheduled December review, a policy reversal becomes increasingly unlikely as each week passes. The administrative mechanisms for implementing a wage increase typically require time for announcement and implementation.

While high inflation (75.4% as of May 2024)[3] continues to erode the purchasing power of the minimum wage, and opposition leaders have called for increases, the government appears committed to its current stance. The minimum wage's value has declined from approximately $578 in December 2023 to $515 in June 2024[3], but this erosion alone doesn't appear sufficient to trigger a government reversal based on recent statements.

I acknowledge there are factors that could potentially lead to a reversal in the government's position:
- Extreme economic deterioration beyond current projections
- Widespread labor unrest or protests
- Unexpected political developments

However, given the explicit and repeated statements from government officials, the substantial increase already implemented in January 2024, and the approaching December review date, I assess that the likelihood of another minimum wage increase before September 30, 2024 is very low.

Probability: 10%
