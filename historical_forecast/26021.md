(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  
The men's 100m final at the Paris 2024 Olympics will take place during the Games in late July or early August 2024. As of July 11, 2024, the result will be known in less than one month.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
If current trends persist, the winning time will not break Usain Bolt’s Olympic record of 9.63 seconds. World-class winning times in recent years have not approached this mark; typical podium forecasts for Paris 2024 cluster around 9.80–9.85 seconds[1][4].

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
The winning time is 9.63 seconds or slower, which aligns with recent global championships and current form of leading contenders. This scenario is strongly supported by expert predictions, the lack of sub-9.63 performances in over a decade, and no extraordinary technological or regulatory changes affecting sprint performance[1][4].

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
A "Yes" occurs if an athlete wins with a time below 9.63 seconds. This would likely require a near-perfect race under ideal conditions, an exceptional performance beyond anything seen since 2012, or an unexpected breakthrough from a young or under-the-radar sprinter. No expert forecasts or recent results point to this happening[1][4][5].

## Rationale

Historical data weighs heavily against the Olympic record being broken in Paris:
- The fastest 100m times since 2015 have been 9.75 seconds or slower, well outside the record[4][5].
- Official Paris 2024 podium projections predict times around 9.80 seconds for the winner, and none of the top contenders—including Noah Lyles, Letsile Tebogo, Marcell Jacobs, and Christian Coleman—have personal bests or recent form close to 9.63[1][4][5].
- The event features remarkable depth—many of the fastest sprinters in history are active—but not a single one has demonstrated ability to approach Bolt’s Olympic record pace since his retirement[4].
- There have been no significant advances in technology (track surfaces, shoes) or changes to regulations that would make record-breaking more likely as of July 2024.
- Even elite sprinters regarded as favorites are not expected by experts or bookmakers to threaten the record[1][5].

Given that elite 100m performance tends to evolve incrementally, and the current field appears more competitive in depth than in earth-shattering speed, the status quo outcome (No) deserves significant weight.

## Final Probability

Probability: **2%**  
A sub-9.63 winning time at Paris 2024 is extremely unlikely, though not impossible if a perfect race or an unprecedented breakthrough occurs. Expert predictions and historical performance overwhelmingly favor the record standing[1][4][5].
