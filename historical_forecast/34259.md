Based on the search results and the interview scenario, I'll provide a professional forecast analysis for Google's global search engine market share in February 2025 according to StatCounter.

(a) Time left until the outcome to the question is known:
The outcome will be known when StatCounter releases February 2025 data, which would typically become available in early March 2025. From the current date (May 6, 2025), this data should already be available, but the question specifies that resolution may occur by April 7, 2025 at the latest.

(b) The outcome if nothing changed:
If nothing changed from December 2024's figure, Google's global search market share would be 89.73%[4].

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued:
Looking at October through December 2024 (89.34%, 89.99%, 89.73%), there's a slight fluctuation rather than a clear trend[4]. If we consider the broader trend of Google falling below 90% after maintaining 90-92% for nearly a decade, we might expect continued slight erosion, suggesting a figure around 89.6-89.7%.

(d) The expectations of experts and markets:
The search results don't contain explicit expert forecasts for February 2025. However, market observers have noted Google's gradual decline from its long-held position above 90%[1][4]. The consensus appears to be that Google is experiencing a slow erosion of its dominant position rather than a dramatic collapse.

(e) An unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome:
A significant expansion of AI-powered search alternatives like ChatGPT Search or Perplexity could accelerate Google's market share decline. Since StatCounter primarily tracks traditional search engines, these competitors might be drawing users away without being fully reflected in the data[4]. Additionally, a major privacy scandal or search quality issue could drive users to alternatives like DuckDuckGo or Bing more rapidly than anticipated.

(f) An unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome:
Google could reverse the trend and regain market share by launching significant improvements to its search algorithm or AI integration that resonates strongly with users. Additionally, technical or privacy issues with competing search engines could drive users back to Google. The company might also implement more aggressive tactics to maintain its market position, such as enhanced default positioning on devices or browsers.

Taking into account the historical data, recent trends, and potential scenarios, my forecast for Google's global search engine market share for February 2025 according to StatCounter is:

Percentile 10: 88.9%
Percentile 20: 89.2%
Percentile 40: 89.5%
Percentile 60: 89.8%
Percentile 80: 90.1%
Percentile 90: 90.3%
