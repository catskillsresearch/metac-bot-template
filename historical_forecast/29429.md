(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  
The outcome will be known after the November 5, 2024 general election—about 5 days from the current (stated) date of October 31, 2024.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
The amendment would *not* be approved, and the current constitutional language (“The legislature shall have the power to reserve marriage to opposite-sex couples”) would remain. This is because state constitutional amendments in Hawaii require affirmative votes from a majority of ballots cast on the amendment *and* a majority of all ballots cast, including blank and overvotes—a relatively high hurdle for passage[3].

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
Voter turnout is low, and/or a significant number of voters leave the amendment question blank (as is sometimes the case with technical or low-profile ballot measures), meaning the amendment fails to secure the required majority of *all ballots cast*. Additionally, opposition from traditional marriage groups or confusion about the amendment’s purpose could drive more “No” votes or abstentions, resulting in the measure’s defeat[3].

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
There is high voter engagement, with strong messaging from progressive organizations, elected officials, and media making the case for removing the discriminatory language. Voters who support same-sex marriage and equal rights are motivated to actively vote “Yes,” and the measure secures the necessary majorities in both votes cast specifically on the amendment and in the total ballot count[1][2][5].

## Rationale

- **Political climate:** Hawaii is a solidly Democratic and progressive state, with significant political and organizational support for the amendment. The Democratic Party, the governor, and advocacy coalitions are all behind its passage[1][5]. Public attitudes in Hawaii and nationwide have shifted dramatically in favor of same-sex marriage since 1998, and Hawaii has recognized same-sex marriage since 2013[2][5].

- **Opposition:** There is some opposition from traditional marriage advocates and concerns about “political bullying,” but the opposition appears less organized and vocal compared to the campaign in support[2]. No significant, well-funded opposition campaign has been reported in search results.

- **Voter behavior and risk:** The biggest risk to passage is the requirement that a majority of *all ballots cast* must be “Yes,” including those who skip the question or mark it incorrectly—raising the effective hurdle above a simple majority of those voting on the measure[3]. Historical precedent in Hawaii shows some ballot measures, even popular ones, can stumble on this technicality if voters are disengaged or confused.

- **National and local context:** After the Roe v. Wade reversal, there are heightened concerns in progressive states about legal vulnerabilities for rights like marriage equality. This may motivate turnout and “Yes” votes to remove obsolete or discriminatory constitutional language[4][5].

- **Recent polling:** No specific polling data on this ballot measure is available in the search results. However, strong political support, shifting social norms, and the absence of reported opposition funding suggest the “Yes” side is favored, though not guaranteed given the unique ballot hurdle.

Given these considerations, a skilled forecaster would put *extra* weight on the possibility that Hawaii’s technical majority requirement for constitutional amendments could cause close or even unexpected results—the so-called “blank vote problem.” Still, given the state’s political landscape and the momentum for LGBTQ+ rights, probabilistically, the “Yes” outcome remains most likely.
