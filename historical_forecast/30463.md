I'll analyze this forecasting question about Los Angeles rent increases by November 2024.

(a) Time until outcome is known: About 17 days (from May 6, 2025 to when Zillow publishes November 2024 data, which would have happened around December 12, 2024)

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: Based on the information provided, the status quo appears to be slow rent growth in Los Angeles that was below 2.0% year-over-year.

(c) Scenario resulting in No outcome: Continued increase in rental housing supply from multi-family construction creates competition among landlords, keeping rent growth below the 2.0% threshold. Landlords continue offering concessions to attract tenants in a softening market.

(d) Scenario resulting in Yes outcome: An unexpected surge in rental demand in Los Angeles outpaces new supply, perhaps due to migration patterns changing or economic factors improving substantially, pushing rent growth to or above 2.0% year-over-year by November 2024.

Given that I need to assess whether Los Angeles rent will increase by at least 2.0% year-over-year by November 2024, I need to analyze the available data and trends.

From the search results, we can see that rental markets have experienced significant fluctuations in recent years. Los Angeles was listed among the least affordable metro areas for rents with a rent-to-income ratio of 36.5% as of early 2024[2]. However, affordability concerns don't necessarily translate to high growth rates, especially in a market with increasing supply.

The search results don't provide specific recent year-over-year rent growth rates for Los Angeles, though they do mention that landlords were offering concessions and rent growth was slowing nationwide. Table 1 in search result [5] shows historical annual rent growth percentages across different data sources ranging from 2.4% to 4.1%, but this data appears to be from 2015-2019, well before our prediction period.

The fact that Los Angeles was experiencing a multi-family construction boom that would increase rental supply suggests downward pressure on rent growth. Increased supply typically leads to more competition among landlords and slower rent growth.

Additionally, the research assistant's report indicates that as of September 2023, median rents in Los Angeles County had actually declined by 1.5% year-over-year, reflecting increased vacancies and new supply. This suggests that the starting point for rent growth heading into 2024 was negative, making it less likely to reach or exceed 2.0% by November 2024.

Given that rental market trends tend to move relatively slowly and the status quo appeared to be below-2.0% growth or even negative growth, it seems unlikely that Los Angeles would have experienced a dramatic enough shift to reach 2.0% year-over-year growth by November 2024. The continued increase in rental housing supply would likely have continued putting downward pressure on rent growth.

As a forecaster, I need to be careful not to overreact to new information and to give appropriate weight to the status quo. The data suggests that rent growth in Los Angeles was below the 2.0% threshold, and there's limited evidence to suggest it would have increased dramatically by November 2024.

Probability: 25%
