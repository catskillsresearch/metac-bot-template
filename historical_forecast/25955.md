(a) **Time Until Outcome Is Known**  
There are approximately 83 days left until October 1, 2024.

(b) **Status Quo Outcome If Nothing Changed**  
No armed forces deaths as a result of direct conflict between China and Taiwan, the United States, the Philippines, or Japan. Tensions remain high with frequent military maneuvers, but lethal exchanges are avoided. All recent incidents have stopped short of escalation to deadly force.

(c) **Scenario Resulting in a No Outcome**  
China continues its current pattern of aggressive but non-lethal "gray-zone" tactics—military drills, ADIZ incursions, coast guard confrontations, and legal/political threats. The United States, Taiwan, the Philippines, and Japan respond with their own shows of force, diplomatic protests, and increased coordination, but none cross the threshold into intentional, lethal combat. The status quo of brinkmanship persists, and no credible reports of deaths among armed forces or paramilitaries from direct conflict emerge before October 1, 2024.

(d) **Scenario Resulting in a Yes Outcome**  
A significant incident escalates beyond recent patterns. Examples:  
- A naval or air confrontation spirals out of control—missile or gunfire is exchanged between Chinese and Philippine, Taiwanese, or US forces near disputed territories, resulting in armed forces casualties.  
- A “warning shot” or intended non-lethal action (such as ramming or boarding) miscalculates, leading to deaths on either side.  
- China launches a limited strike against a Taiwanese or Philippine outpost, ship, or aircraft, resulting in at least one military fatality.

## Rationale

Despite a marked escalation in military activity and belligerent rhetoric, the historical trend—and current evidence as of July 10, 2024—strongly favors the no-deaths scenario. China, Taiwan, the US, the Philippines, and Japan have all shown a preference for “gray-zone” strategies: applying pressure and demonstrating resolve without triggering open warfare or lethal exchanges[3][5].  
- No credible reports of deaths among military or auxiliary personnel have emerged from repeated confrontations, including the most recent high-profile incidents in the South China Sea and Taiwan Strait[3][4][5].  
- Both the scale of Chinese exercises and the participation of US/Japanese forces in high-profile drills like RIMPAC reflect deterrence and signaling, not imminent intent to cross the threshold into armed conflict with fatalities[2][4].  
- Authoritative foresight communities (e.g., Metaculus, Good Judgment Superforecasters) consistently assess the risk of major conflict this year as relatively low, with the likelihood rising incrementally in subsequent years[5].  
- While a miscalculation or accidental escalation remains possible, the overwhelming pattern is that all parties—despite tough rhetoric and brinkmanship—deliberately avoid actions likely to cause lethal confrontations[3][4][5].

Given the established track record and the absence of any fatal armed conflict to date, the base rate for such an occurrence before October 1, 2024, remains low. Good forecasters overweight this status quo, as the world tends toward inertia and gradual change, even in volatile regions.
