(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  
As of September 20, 2024, there are 10 days remaining until the October 1, 2024 deadline.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
If no further podcast episodes featuring any of the specified Democrats (Kamala Harris, Tim Walz, Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, or Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez) are released on the Lex Fridman podcast before October 1, 2024, the outcome will be **No**.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
No episode featuring any of the listed Democrats is published—meaning their names do not appear in red under an episode title on the Lex Fridman podcast episodes page in an episode released after #443 before the October 1, 2024 cutoff.

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
At least one of the specified Democrats appears as a guest on the Lex Fridman podcast (their name in red under an episode title on the official episode page) in a new episode published after #443 but before October 1, 2024.

## Rationale

Lex Fridman has demonstrated the ability to secure high-profile political interviews, most notably with Donald Trump in early September 2024[1][2]. His open invitation to leading Democrats, posted on September 4, 2024, indicates strong intent and an active effort to diversify the political voices on his podcast. However, as of the latest available episode listings, none of the specified Democrats have appeared post-#443[3].

Several factors lean toward the status quo (No) outcome:

- **Timing constraints:** Only 10 days remain before the deadline. Scheduling, recording, and producing a new episode with any major Democratic figure is logistically challenging in such a short window, especially during the peak of the presidential campaign season.
- **No public announcements:** There is no public evidence, via episode listings or announcements, that such an appearance is imminent or scheduled[3].
- **Historical precedent:** Although Fridman scored the Trump interview quickly, this does not guarantee parity from Democratic figures, who may evaluate the platform differently—especially after the high-profile Trump appearance and their own campaign media strategies.
- **Inertia:** The most likely outcome is that no sudden, major changes occur, especially given the lack of signals pointing to an upcoming Democratic guest.

While Fridman's outreach shows intent and possibility, the absence of any confirmation or announcement, combined with the time constraints and political context, means the probability of a Democratic appearance before the deadline remains low.

**Probability: 10%**
