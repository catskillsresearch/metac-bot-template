(a) **Time until outcome is known:**  
2 months remain until December 31, 2024, when Forbes' Real-Time Billionaires List will be checked for Sam Altman's net worth.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
As of October 2024, Altman's net worth is listed by Forbes as exactly $1 billion, primarily based on his private investments in companies like Stripe, Reddit, and Helion, and he owns no equity in OpenAI[1][2][4][5]. If there are no significant changes or announcements, his net worth will remain below the $1.1 billion threshold required for a "Yes" outcome.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
No major liquidity events, asset sales, or dramatic revaluations of his private company investments occur by the end of 2024, and Forbes continues to estimate his net worth at $1 billion or below. Given the lack of recent major financial developments and his investments being in private companies without imminent IPOs or large publicized funding rounds, this scenario appears most probable[1][2][4].

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
A significant positive development in one or more of Altman's private holdings occurs before December 31, 2024â€”such as Stripe or Helion raising capital at a much higher valuation, or a substantial, publicized liquidity event (such as an IPO or major secondary sale), and Forbes updates his estimated net worth above $1.1 billion[1][2][4]. Alternatively, a newly discovered asset or stake would need to be publicly verified and recognized by Forbes. No such events have been reported as of November 1, 2024.

**Rationale:**  
The world changes incrementally most of the time, and Altman's net worth has been stable at $1 billion since at least early 2024. His wealth is tied to illiquid, private investments, and there have been no reports of liquidity events or dramatic valuation changes in his known portfolio. He does not benefit from OpenAI's valuation increases, making further near-term increases to his net worth unlikely without extraordinary developments[1][2][4][5].  

Forbes bases its figures on public information and significant events. Absent a headline-worthy liquidity event or major revaluation in Altman's portfolio, Forbes is unlikely to make a substantial upward revision. Given no evidence of such events, the most probable scenario is that Altman's Forbes net worth remains at or below $1 billion at year-end.

**Probability: 10%**
