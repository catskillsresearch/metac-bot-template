(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  
As of September 12, 2024, there are 10 days until the Brandenburg state election takes place on September 22, 2024.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
Recent polling places AfD at around 29% in Brandenburg, just under the 32% threshold in question[5]. In the other two recent eastern state elections (Saxony and Thuringia), AfD’s vote share closely matched or modestly exceeded their polling: they won 30.6% in Saxony and 32.8% in Thuringia, both also polling around 30% before the election[2][3][4][5]. The status quo, based on current polling, thus points to AfD finishing slightly below 32% in Brandenburg.

(c) **Scenario for a No outcome:**  
AfD receives less than 32% of the vote. This could happen if:
- Their support remains stable and mirrors current polls (~29%), with no late surge.
- Voter turnout among AfD’s core is lower than expected.
- Tactical voting or late swings benefit rival parties, especially if centrist voters mobilize to block AfD gains.
- Another party, such as BSW, siphons protest votes from AfD in the final days[4][5].

(d) **Scenario for a Yes outcome:**  
AfD surpasses 32%. This might occur if:
- There is a late surge in AfD support, possibly driven by national or local controversies or last-minute dissatisfaction with mainstream parties.
- Polls have understated AfD's appeal, as sometimes happens due to social desirability bias or sampling errors.
- Voter turnout among AfD supporters is exceptionally high, mirroring or exceeding the recent Thuringia result (32.8%) and capitalizing on momentum in eastern Germany[2][3][4][5].

## Rationale

The **status quo** gives us a starting point around 29%—just below the threshold. AfD’s performance in recent comparable elections has often tracked closely with polling, occasionally modestly exceeding it (as in Thuringia)[2][3][5]. However, without new evidence of a late surge in Brandenburg, we should expect a similar pattern: AfD’s result will likely align with its polling, suggesting a final share just below 32%.

Structural factors supporting a strong AfD showing in Brandenburg—eastern location, dissatisfaction with the national government, and prior electoral momentum—are already baked into both polling and recent electoral outcomes. The entry of new competitors like BSW presents some additional uncertainty: BSW polling at 17% in Brandenburg could attract some protest voters who might otherwise choose AfD[4][5]. Meanwhile, no disruptive campaign news or sudden realignments are reported.

Given that polls in Saxony and Thuringia (both around 30%) were quite accurate (AfD scored 30.6% and 32.8%, respectively), the best forecast puts AfD’s final Brandenburg result close to current polling, thus just below or—at most—slightly exceeding 32%. The main risk to this outlook is an unpredicted late swing or polling error. However, as polling has been reliable in this context and status quo bias is appropriate this close to the election, the probability of AfD exceeding 32% remains less than 50%, but cannot be ruled out.
