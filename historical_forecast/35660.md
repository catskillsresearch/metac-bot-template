As a professional forecaster, I need to analyze the available data and trends to predict Capital Bikeshare trips for February 2025.

(a) Time left until outcome is known: 
February 2025 has already passed as today is May 6, 2025. However, the BTS data for February 2025 may not have been published yet, or it might have been recently published.

(b) Outcome if nothing changed:
If we assume February 2024 as our baseline, we would need an estimate for that month. Based on the system's growth pattern, February would typically be a lower ridership month compared to summer peaks like August's 614,639 rides[3]. A conservative estimate for February 2024 might be around 300,000-350,000 rides.

(c) Outcome if the current trend continued:
Capital Bikeshare experienced a 36.9% year-over-year increase in 2024[2]. If this growth rate continued into early 2025, we would expect February 2025 to be approximately 36.9% higher than February 2024, suggesting approximately 410,000-480,000 rides.

(d) Expectations of experts and markets:
The data shows that Capital Bikeshare has experienced 32+ consecutive months of year-over-year growth as of August 2024[3]. Experts would likely expect this trend to continue, particularly with the increasing popularity of e-bikes, which made up 58.6% of trips in recent months[3]. The system was on pace to surpass its 2023 record of 4,469,358 rides well before the end of 2024[3].

(e) Unexpected scenario resulting in a low outcome:
Severe winter weather conditions throughout February 2025 could significantly reduce ridership. Additionally, any major system outages, station removals, or bike shortages could restrict availability. A sudden policy change or price increase implemented in early 2025 might also dampen demand.

(f) Unexpected scenario resulting in a high outcome:
Unusually warm weather in February 2025 could drive exceptionally high ridership. A major expansion of the system completed in late 2024 or early 2025, particularly in high-demand areas, could dramatically increase capacity and usage. Special promotions, events, or fare reductions could also stimulate higher-than-expected demand.

As a humble forecaster, I recognize there are many unknowns that could affect the actual outcome. Setting wide confidence intervals is prudent given:
- Seasonal variability in bikeshare usage
- Unpredictable weather factors
- Potential changes in system capacity or policies
- The continued growth trend but uncertainty about its sustainability
