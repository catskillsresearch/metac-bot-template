(a) **Time until outcome is known:**  
There are 7 days until the recall vote on December 10, 2024. The outcome should be known before January 1, 2025.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
The status quo is that Mayor Candy Meehan remains in office. If the recall effort fails—meaning most voters oppose the recall—she will survive the vote and continue as mayor.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
A *No* outcome occurs if a majority of voters support the recall, resulting in Candy Meehan being removed from office as mayor.

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
A *Yes* outcome occurs if a majority of voters oppose the recall, allowing Candy Meehan to survive the vote and continue serving as mayor.

## Rationale

There is no available direct polling, expert analysis, or even qualitative reporting on the likely outcome of the recall or the prevailing political climate in Norwood, Colorado. No information has been uncovered about the reasons for the recall, the level of local mobilization, Meehan's popularity, or the composition and sentiments of the Norwood electorate. In the absence of recall-specific data or known controversies, and since most recall attempts in the United States do not succeed, historical precedent would suggest a default tilt toward incumbents surviving unless there is significant unrest or scandal—neither of which is documented here. The lack of evidence or notable political context means the prediction must lean toward the status quo, with significant uncertainty.

## Final answer

Probability: 60%

This moderate estimate reflects a slight incumbency and status quo advantage, offset by the absence of concrete information on political factors, voter sentiment, or campaign dynamics in Norwood.
