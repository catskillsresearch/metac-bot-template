(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
As of July 16, 2024, there are 76 days until September 30, 2024. The outcome will be determined at the end of that day, so a little over two and a half months remain.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
Currently, Kimberly Cheatle remains the Director of the United States Secret Service[1][2][5]. There has been no official announcement of her removal, suspension, or placement on administrative leave[1][2][5]. If no action is taken, she will remain in the role through September 30, 2024, resulting in a "Yes" resolution.

(c) **Scenario that results in a No outcome:**  
A "No" outcome would occur if, before October 1, 2024, there is an official announcement that Cheatle has been removed, has resigned, been placed on administrative leave, or replaced even temporarily as Director. For example, if after the July 22 congressional hearing, public and political pressure intensifies and the administration decides to remove or suspend Cheatle, and an Acting Director is appointed (even temporarily), this would resolve the question as "No".

(d) **Scenario that results in a Yes outcome:**  
A "Yes" outcome will occur if Cheatle remains Director, with no official removal, suspension, or replacement announcement, through September 30, 2024. This would be the case if investigations and oversight hearings do not lead to her ouster and she continues to have the support of President Biden and the relevant authorities.

## Rationale

Recent events—the failed assassination attempt on July 13, 2024—have brought unprecedented scrutiny to the Secret Service and its leadership. Cheatle is under significant pressure and faces an upcoming congressional hearing on July 22, 2024[2][5]. While public and political criticism is high owing to perceived security lapses, there are important factors supporting the status quo:

- **Historical Precedent:** Directors of the Secret Service have sometimes resigned or been removed after major lapses, but such changes usually come after investigations are complete, typically not in the immediate aftermath unless there is evidence of gross negligence or political imperative for swift action.
- **Presidential Support:** President Biden appointed Cheatle and initially expressed complete trust in her leadership. As of July 16, 2024, there is no public indication from the White House that he has withdrawn support or is seeking her replacement[2][5].
- **Investigations Underway:** The administration has directed Cheatle to review security procedures and cooperate fully with investigations, suggesting she remains trusted to oversee reforms in the short term[2][5].
- **Fluidity and Unknowns:** The situation is volatile; a disastrous performance in the July 22 hearing, or revelations of extreme misconduct or negligence, could accelerate her exit. Political considerations in an election year further increase uncertainty.

While the probability of removal is higher than usual due to the severity of the incident and degree of scrutiny, the base rate for the immediate firing or suspension of agency directors after such events remains low, especially before the completion of initial investigations and public hearings. The default in the US federal system is to await formal findings before making high-profile personnel changes—unless ongoing revelations sharply shift the political calculus.

## Final Answer

Probability: 70%  

This figure reflects the elevated risk of removal due to the extraordinary circumstances but gives extra weight to the historical inertia of the status quo pending completion of oversight and investigative processes[1][2][5].
