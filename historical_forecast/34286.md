I'll analyze this forecasting question carefully.

(a) The time left until the outcome is known: As of January 31, 2025, there are 2 months remaining until the April 1, 2025 deadline.

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed: Justin Trudeau remains Prime Minister of Canada until at least April 1, 2025.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome: Trudeau reconsiders his announced resignation under pressure from his party due to international crises (like the US tariff situation), delays the leadership transition, and remains in office beyond April 1, 2025.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome: The Liberal Party leadership race proceeds as announced, Mark Carney is elected leader in March, and Trudeau steps down as Prime Minister before April 1, 2025, as he has publicly committed to doing.

Looking at this question as a professional forecaster, I need to carefully assess the evidence available up to January 31, 2025, which is the date of this assessment.

Based on the search results provided, Justin Trudeau announced his intention to resign as Prime Minister and Liberal Party leader on January 6, 2025[2][3]. He stated that he would remain in office until a new party leader is selected, which is expected by March 24, 2025[1][3]. The leadership race timeline has been established, with the vote scheduled for March 9, 2025[3].

The primary factors supporting the likelihood of Trudeau ceasing to be Prime Minister before April 1, 2025 include:

1. Trudeau's public announcement of his resignation with a specific timeline ending before the April 1 deadline[1][2][5]
2. The formal establishment of a Liberal Party leadership race with Mark Carney, Chrystia Freeland, and others as candidates[3]
3. The scheduled leadership vote on March 9, 2025, allowing sufficient time for transition before April[3]
4. The strong internal party pressure that led to his resignation announcement[4][5]
5. Trudeau's own acknowledgment that party dissent would prevent him from campaigning effectively[3]

Factors that might potentially delay his departure include:

1. Unforeseen national crises requiring continuity of leadership
2. Potential complications in the leadership race process
3. Last-minute reconsideration by Trudeau or the Liberal Party

However, as a forecaster, I must acknowledge that the status quo has already shifted. The new status quo is that Trudeau has announced his resignation with a specific timeline. The formal mechanisms for leadership transition are already in motion, with clear deadlines established well before April 1, 2025.

While unexpected events could theoretically cause delays, there is no evidence in the search results suggesting any potential impediments to the established transition timeline. Even amid challenges like responding to US tariffs, the leadership transition process appears to be proceeding as planned[3].

Given the official announcement, established timeline, formal leadership race, and strong party pressure, there is very high confidence that Justin Trudeau will cease to be Prime Minister of Canada before April 1, 2025.

Probability: 95%
