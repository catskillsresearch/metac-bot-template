(a) The time left until the outcome is known: 9 days until the November 5, 2024 general election.

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed: Abortion is currently legal in Montana under the state constitution's right of privacy as established by the Montana Supreme Court in the 1999 Armstrong decision, but without an explicit constitutional protection.

(c) A scenario resulting in a No outcome: Conservative voter turnout in Montana significantly outpaces progressive turnout, particularly in rural areas. Opposition messaging successfully frames CI-128 as too expansive by focusing on concerns about "health exceptions" being too broadly defined. Anti-abortion organizations mobilize church communities and conservative voters who might otherwise not participate in the election.

(d) A scenario resulting in a Yes outcome: The initiative benefits from the national trend of abortion-rights ballot measures succeeding in other states. Montana voters, despite the state's conservative lean, prioritize personal liberty and privacy consistent with state values. The campaign successfully communicates that CI-128 primarily codifies existing protections that Montanans already support rather than expanding abortion access beyond current practice.

Montana's CI-128 presents an interesting forecasting challenge given the state's political dynamics. Based on the search results and broader context, here's my analysis:

## Current Status and Background

Constitutional Initiative 128 has successfully qualified for the November 2024 ballot in Montana. If approved, it would expressly add the right to abortion to Montana's constitution[1][3]. This would provide explicit protection for abortion rights that currently exist through judicial interpretation rather than constitutional text.

Currently, abortion remains legal in Montana based on the state Supreme Court's 1999 Armstrong decision, which determined that the state constitution's right to privacy protects abortion access before fetal viability[5]. The court has consistently upheld this precedent in recent years, including striking down laws requiring parental consent for minors and preventing advanced practice nurses from performing abortions[5].

## Factors Suggesting Approval

Several factors suggest Montana voters might approve CI-128:

**National Trends**: Since the 2022 Dobbs decision overturning Roe v. Wade, abortion rights ballot initiatives have consistently succeeded across the country, even in conservative-leaning states. Similar initiatives in other states including Arizona and Missouri will also appear on November ballots[2].

**Organized Support**: The sponsor group "Montanans Securing Reproductive Rights," which includes Planned Parenthood Advocates of Montana, has demonstrated organizational capacity by successfully gathering the required signatures[2][5]. Martha Fuller of Planned Parenthood has indicated they are building a "serious field and media campaign" to inform voters about the importance of the initiative[2].

**Status Quo Preservation**: CI-128 would primarily codify existing protections rather than expanding access beyond current practice. Montanans might be more inclined to support a measure that maintains the current legal framework rather than one that appears to create new rights.

## Factors Suggesting Rejection

Other factors indicate the initiative might face challenges:

**State Political Environment**: Montana leans conservative in recent elections, having voted for Republican presidential candidates consistently and electing mostly Republican officials at the state level. This general conservatism could affect voters' reception to an abortion rights amendment.

**Rural-Urban Divide**: Montana has a significant rural population that typically votes more conservatively on social issues, while support for abortion rights tends to be stronger in urban areas. The state's demographic makeup could create headwinds for the initiative.

**Messaging Challenges**: The initiative's language addresses complex medical determinations around "fetal viability" and includes exceptions for the "health of the pregnant patient"[1][5]. Opposition campaigns might focus on these aspects to generate uncertainty among voters who support some abortion access but are uncomfortable with broader protections.

## Status Quo Considerations

As a forecaster, I must give significant weight to the status quo. In this case, the status quo is somewhat complex:

1. The legal status quo is that abortion is protected in Montana through judicial interpretation of privacy rights.

2. The constitutional status quo is that there is no explicit mention of abortion, which CI-128 would change.

3. The electoral status quo suggests that ballot measures explicitly protecting abortion rights have been successful in multiple states since Dobbs, including in states with similar or more conservative political profiles than Montana.

Given that similar ballot initiatives have succeeded in other states and that CI-128 would largely formalize existing protections rather than create new ones, there's reason to believe Montana could follow this pattern. However, Montana's conservative political environment creates uncertainty about whether it will follow the national trend.
