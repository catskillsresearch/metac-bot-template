(a) Time left until outcome: 83 days (May 6, 2025 to September 30, 2024)

(b) Status quo outcome: No formal agreement between the US and India regarding nuclear submarines.

(c) No outcome scenario: The US maintains its historical reluctance to share nuclear propulsion technology with India, while India continues pursuing its indigenous nuclear submarine program and finalizes conventional submarine deals with European manufacturers.

(d) Yes outcome scenario: Rapidly deteriorating security conditions in the Indo-Pacific prompt an emergency US strategic pivot, leading to an unprecedented nuclear submarine technology sharing agreement with India similar to AUKUS.

Based on the information available, I'll assess the probability of the US offering India a nuclear submarine before September 30, 2024.

Looking at the current situation, there's no evidence that the United States is in negotiations with India regarding nuclear submarines. India is currently focused on several submarine acquisition initiatives:

1. Indigenous nuclear submarine development through the Arihant program, with the second submarine (Arighat) expected to be commissioned by the end of 2023 and a third submarine scheduled for completion around 2024[2].

2. Project-75I for conventional submarines, where Germany and Spain are competing for a $5 billion-plus deal to provide six submarines. Both Thyssenkrupp Marine Systems (Germany) and Navantia (Spain) have partnered with Indian firms and are in the final stages of evaluation[5].

3. India has previously leased nuclear submarines from Russia and has been in negotiations for additional leases[2].

The historical context strongly suggests against a US-India nuclear submarine deal. The United States has traditionally been extremely restrictive with sharing nuclear propulsion technology. When the AUKUS deal with Australia was announced in 2021, it was seen as an exceptional case, with Indian naval experts noting that "For years, the US has been telling India that American laws make it impossible to share nuclear-propulsion tech with anyone, including allies."

The AUKUS submarine deal itself is structured for long-term delivery, with Australia set to receive Virginia-class submarines beginning in 2032[4], suggesting that even if negotiations began today, actual delivery would be years away.

Furthermore, with only 83 days remaining until the deadline, there simply isn't enough time for the complex negotiations, congressional approvals, and other bureaucratic processes required for such a significant military technology transfer. The AUKUS deal took considerable time to negotiate and finalize, and there are no indications that similar discussions are underway with India.

India's continued reliance on Russian military hardware (60% of inventory as mentioned in the background) and its ongoing indigenous nuclear submarine program further reduce the likelihood of a dramatic shift toward US nuclear submarine technology in the immediate future.

While geopolitical situations can change rapidly, the established patterns of US-India defense cooperation, India's existing submarine procurement strategies, and the extremely short timeframe make a formal agreement by September 30, 2024, highly improbable.

Probability: 3%
