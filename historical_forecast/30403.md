(a) Time until outcome: The outcome will be known after December 20, 2024, when both films are released, with box office figures typically posted the Monday after opening weekend (December 23, 2024). This means there are approximately 7 months and 14 days until the outcome is known from today's date (May 6, 2025).

(b) Status quo outcome: Based on the most recent tracking data from November 2024, Mufasa: The Lion King is slightly favored with forecasted opening weekend box office of approximately $57 million, compared to Sonic the Hedgehog 3's forecasted $56 million, though both films' ranges overlap substantially[1]. The status quo suggests Mufasa would narrowly win the opening weekend battle.

(c) Scenario for a No outcome: Sonic the Hedgehog 3 could outperform Mufasa if it continues the franchise's growth trajectory (from $58M to $72M in the first two films) while Mufasa suffers from prequel fatigue and diminished interest compared to the 2019 Lion King remake. Strong word-of-mouth for Sonic, particularly with the introduction of Shadow, could drive stronger-than-expected attendance among both families and gaming fans[2].

(d) Scenario for a Yes outcome: Mufasa could decisively outperform Sonic if Disney's marketing machine successfully leverages nostalgia for The Lion King franchise, which has historically been one of Disney's strongest properties. With the 2019 film opening to $191M, even a significantly reduced performance would still potentially outpace Sonic. Positive critical reception and the holiday release window could particularly benefit the Disney property[1][4].

In analyzing this forecasting question, I need to carefully consider both the historical performance of these franchises and current tracking data.

The Lion King (2019) was an extraordinary box office success with a $191 million domestic opening weekend, ranking among the top 10 openings of all time. However, as a prequel, Mufasa is widely expected to perform below this benchmark. Industry analysts predict diminished returns are "virtually inevitable" compared to the 2019 film[1].

Meanwhile, the Sonic franchise has demonstrated consistent growth, with the original film opening to $58 million and the sequel improving to $72 million. This upward trajectory suggests strong potential for the third installment, particularly with the introduction of Shadow, a popular character from the games[2].

The most recent tracking data from November 2024 places both films in a remarkably close race, with Mufasa forecasted at around $57 million and Sonic 3 at $56 million[1]. This narrow gap suggests either film could realistically come out on top.

Several factors favor Mufasa:
- Disney's powerful marketing machine and dedicated fan base
- The Lion King's stronger brand recognition across multiple generations
- Positive social media sentiment following recent trailer releases
- The holiday release window traditionally benefits family films

Factors favoring Sonic 3:
- Consistent franchise growth across the first two films
- The introduction of Shadow has generated significant fan excitement
- Lower expectations could be easier to exceed
- The franchise has proven its ability to appeal to both families and gaming enthusiasts

While forecasting box office performance involves considerable uncertainty, I must give weight to the status quo outcome based on the most recent tracking data. The slight edge currently goes to Mufasa, but the race is described as "very close on either side of the coin"[1].

The forecast range for Sonic 3 is $53-62 million with a midpoint of $56 million[1]. While Mufasa's specific range isn't provided in the search results, it's described as having "the advantage" with a projected opening around $57 million[1].

Given the close tracking numbers, franchise trajectories, and time remaining until release, I assess this as a close contest with a slight advantage to Mufasa.

Probability: 55%
