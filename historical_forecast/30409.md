(a) Time left until outcome: About 38 days (from November 22, 2024 until January 1, 2025)

(b) Status quo outcome: The Boeing Starliner program continues as part of NASA's Commercial Crew Program into 2025, though without completing its first operational flight before January 1, 2025.

(c) Scenario for No outcome: Boeing and NASA determine that the technical issues discovered during the Crew Flight Test are too severe to resolve safely, leading to Boeing withdrawing from the Commercial Crew Program before the end of 2024 to cut financial losses.

(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: Despite technical challenges, NASA and Boeing remain committed to the Starliner program through the end of 2024, continuing development work toward future operational flights scheduled for 2025 or beyond.

The Boeing Starliner program has faced significant challenges throughout its development, with the most recent Crew Flight Test highlighting serious technical issues. Based on the available information, I'll analyze the likelihood of the program continuing into 2025.

## Current Status of Boeing Starliner

The Boeing Starliner program has experienced multiple setbacks during its development. The most recent Crew Flight Test, launched on June 5, 2024, encountered significant problems that resulted in an extended mission duration[4]. What was planned as an approximately eight-day mission turned into a much longer stay for astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams at the International Space Station[4].

The technical issues were serious enough that NASA made a critical decision on August 24, 2024: the astronauts would not return on the Starliner but would instead be reassigned to SpaceX's Crew-9 Dragon, scheduled to return in February 2025[5]. Meanwhile, the Starliner was planned to return to Earth uncrewed in early September 2024[5].

## Technical Challenges and NASA's Response

The primary issues with the Starliner involved helium leaks and thruster anomalies that compromised the spacecraft's reliability[4]. Mark Nappi, Boeing's Vice President and commercial crew program manager, acknowledged in a July 25, 2024 news conference that these weeks had been focused on understanding the helium and thruster anomalies and how to address these problems for future flights[4].

Despite these challenges, there are several indicators that the program will continue into 2025:

1. NASA and Boeing have been working collaboratively to understand the technical issues rather than immediately canceling the program.

2. Boeing representatives have explicitly discussed "future flights" in their public statements, indicating an expectation that the program will continue[4].

3. The Starliner-1 operational mission is currently scheduled for no earlier than August 2025, showing continued planning beyond the immediate challenges[5].

## Financial Considerations

Boeing has already invested significantly in the Starliner program, including absorbing approximately $410 million for the second orbital flight test. While these costs are substantial, canceling the program entirely would mean writing off all investment with no potential for future return. This financial reality creates a strong incentive for Boeing to continue the program if there's any viable path forward.

## Status Quo Momentum

Organizations tend to continue existing programs unless there are overwhelming reasons to cancel them. As of the most recent available information (August 2024), neither NASA nor Boeing had announced any plans to cancel the Starliner program. The fact that they were still actively working on solutions for the technical problems suggests a commitment to continuing the program.

NASA's decision to return the astronauts on a SpaceX vehicle while returning the Starliner uncrewed demonstrates a pragmatic approach to the immediate challenges rather than an abandonment of the program itself. This indicates NASA is still working within the framework of the Commercial Crew Program with Boeing as a partner.

## Risk Factors for Cancellation

Despite these positive indicators, there are significant risks that could lead to cancellation before 2025:

1. If the uncrewed return of Starliner revealed additional critical failures, NASA might lose confidence in the platform entirely.

2. Boeing could decide that the financial burden of fixing all identified issues exceeds the potential return on investment.

3. NASA's budget constraints or shifting priorities could lead to a reevaluation of the need for two commercial crew providers.

However, none of these scenarios appears to have materialized as of the latest available information. The status quo continues to be that Boeing and NASA are working to address the technical issues with an eye toward future missions.

## Probability Assessment

Considering all available information and the status quo bias, the most likely outcome is that the Boeing Starliner program will continue into 2025, though not as an operational system by that time. The technical challenges are significant but not catastrophic, and both NASA and Boeing have demonstrated a commitment to working through these issues rather than abandoning the program.

While it's clear that the first operational flight (Starliner-1) will not occur before January 1, 2025, the criteria for a "Yes" outcome include the program simply not being canceled before that date, which seems more likely than cancellation based on current trajectories.

Probability: 75%
