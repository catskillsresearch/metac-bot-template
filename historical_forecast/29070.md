(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
There are just over two months remaining until January 1, 2025. The question will resolve once Spirit Airlines files for bankruptcy (if it happens before that date), or otherwise as "No" on January 1.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
As of October 22, 2024, Spirit Airlines has not filed for bankruptcy. The company is operating under severe distress but remains in active negotiations with creditors. If current conditions persist—creditors continue to cooperate, no sudden liquidity crisis occurs, and no unexpected revenue shocks materialize—Spirit will not file for bankruptcy before January 1, 2025[1][2][3].

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
Spirit successfully negotiates debt extensions or out-of-court restructuring with its bondholders and creditors, securing enough liquidity to cover obligations through the end of 2024. Cash flow, though negative, is managed by reducing routes and capacity, and there is no sudden trigger (like loss of credit card processing or major defaults) forcing an immediate filing[1][2][3].

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
Negotiations with creditors collapse, or a key stakeholder (such as a credit card processor or lessor) withdraws support due to perceived risk, leaving Spirit unable to meet near-term liabilities. A liquidity crisis triggers a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing before January 1, 2025. This could be sudden, given the $3.3 billion debt load and over $1.1 billion in secured bonds maturing within a year, some with deadlines as early as October 2024[1][2][3].

## Rationale

- **Financial Position:** Spirit is operating at a significant loss, burning cash, with a heavy debt burden and no profitability since before the pandemic[1][3]. 
- **Imminent Risks:** The company faces pressing refinancing deadlines. There have been reports of negotiation for both bankruptcy and out-of-court restructuring, and the firm is aggressively cutting capacity to preserve cash[1][3].
- **Signals from Management and Creditors:** Management continues public negotiations and cost-cutting, suggesting a preference for avoiding bankruptcy if possible, but Fitch and other analysts rate the risk of default as extremely high[2].
- **Market Precedent and Inertia:** Despite severe distress and obvious risk factors (failed merger, regulatory setbacks, engine issues), there is a tendency for companies in similar positions to delay bankruptcy as long as possible in hopes of new financing, improved market conditions, or successful restructuring.
- **Probability Models:** Quantitative bankruptcy risk models and credit agencies indicate an elevated—though not certifiably imminent—chance of filing[2][3]. Macroaxis estimates over 80% probability of distress, but that covers a generic timeline, not specifically before January 1, 2025.

In summary, while the risk of bankruptcy before January 1, 2025, is meaningfully elevated (given debt maturities, failed merger, negative cash flow, and public bankruptcy talks), the default status quo outcome is "No bankruptcy filing" by that date—unless negotiations break down or a liquidity crisis emerges.

**Probability: 45%**
