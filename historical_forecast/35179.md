(a) **Time until outcome is known:**  
Today is May 6, 2025. The outcome will be determined on March 31, 2025. Therefore, the outcome is already known, as March 31, 2025 has passed.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changes:**  
As of the last available data (May 2, 2025), Lockheed Martin’s stock price was $472.80[1]. The all-time high was $618.95, and there is no evidence in the supplied search results that the price exceeded $618.95 between October 21, 2024 (when it last peaked at $606.30) and the present[1][3]. Forecasts and historical prices provided do not show an intraday or closing price above $618.95 during that window.

(c) **Scenario that results in a No outcome:**  
A No outcome would have occurred if at any point from now until March 31, 2025, Lockheed Martin’s stock price (intraday or at the close) exceeded $618.95. This could have been triggered by unexpected major defense contracts, extreme geopolitical events leading to a surge in defense stocks, or a broader market rally that disproportionately affected Lockheed Martin.

(d) **Scenario that results in a Yes outcome:**  
A Yes outcome occurs if Lockheed Martin’s stock price never exceeded $618.95—at any point, even intraday—during the period leading up to and including March 31, 2025. This would reflect a continuation of the recent trend, with the stock remaining significantly below its all-time high. The status quo, with price targets and analyst forecasts all well below the record high, supports this scenario[1][5].

## Rationale

The world tends to change slowly, and defense stocks like Lockheed Martin are generally stable unless affected by extraordinary events. Analyst price targets for 2025 ranged from $485 to $570, all below the $618.95 threshold[5]. The most recent high prediction for 2025 is $570.46, still materially under the all-time high[5]. The historical price data confirms that the highest closing price reached was $606.30 on October 21, 2024, and the 52-week high is $618.95, with no evidence of a breach since then[1][3]. 

In summary, all forecast data and actual recorded prices support the conclusion that Lockheed Martin’s stock did not breach the all-time high of $618.95 through March 31, 2025. Unless there was some event or price action absent from the provided data, the logical, status quo outcome is that the stock stayed below its all-time high.
