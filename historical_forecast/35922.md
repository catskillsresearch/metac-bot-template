As a professional forecaster, I'll analyze whether Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez will have a higher approval rating than Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan on April 1, 2025.

(a) Time until outcome: Approximately 26 days from today (May 6, 2025) until the resolution date (April 1, 2025). Wait, that's incorrect - the resolution date has already passed. The outcome should already be known, but I don't have that specific data in the provided information.

(b) Status quo outcome: Based on the latest available data from January 2025, Erdoğan had an approval rating of 34% and a disapproval rating of 57%[5]. I don't have Pedro Sánchez's approval rating from the same time period or source for direct comparison. Without more current data, I can't definitively state what the status quo outcome would be.

(c) Scenario for No outcome: If Erdoğan's domestic support strengthens due to his strong stance on international issues like Palestine, which he has been vocal about[3][4], while Sánchez continues to face challenges with his fragile coalition government, Erdoğan could maintain a higher approval rating.

(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: Sánchez's support for Palestine, which has been praised by Erdoğan himself[3], could boost his domestic popularity, especially if his economic policies show positive results. Meanwhile, Erdoğan's approval could decline further due to Turkey's ongoing issues with authoritarianism and corruption[5].

## Current Data Analysis

According to data collected between January 21-27, 2025 by Morning Consult, we have a snapshot of world leaders' approval ratings[1]. While the graphic mentioned in the search results doesn't explicitly state the exact ratings for both leaders, we do have some information about Erdoğan from another source.

As of July 2024, Erdoğan had an approval rating of 34% and a disapproval rating of 57%, placing him as the 11th most disliked leader among those measured[5]. However, I don't have comparable data for Sánchez from the same source or time period.

## Historical Context

Turkey under Erdoğan has seen "increased authoritarianism, corruption, and suppression of dissent" with people being arrested for insulting the president[5]. This suggests a political environment that could continue to affect his popularity negatively.

Sánchez has been working to strengthen Spanish-Turkish relations, as evidenced by the eighth intergovernmental summit between the two nations in June 2024, which resulted in at least 13 bilateral agreements[3]. Sánchez described Turkey as a "key economic partner" during this meeting.

## Recent Developments

Both leaders have taken strong positions supporting Palestine in the Gaza conflict. Erdoğan praised Sánchez for his country's support of Palestine during his visit to Madrid in June 2024[3][4]. Spain joined South Africa's case at the International Court of Justice against Israel over allegations of war crimes in Gaza[3].

## Analysis of Factors That May Affect Approval Ratings

1. **Economic Performance**:
   Economic issues typically have significant impacts on approval ratings. While specific economic data wasn't provided, Spain described Turkey's "structural fundamentals" as likely to keep it "growing in economic weight" in the coming decades[3].

2. **International Relations**:
   Both leaders have positioned themselves as supporters of Palestine, which could affect their domestic approval depending on their citizens' views on the issue[3][4].

3. **Domestic Governance**:
   Erdoğan's leadership style has been characterized by increasing authoritarianism[5], which could continue to affect his approval negatively.

## Forecast Limitations

The most significant limitation is the lack of recent, comparable approval rating data from the same source for both leaders. The Morning Consult data from January 2025 was mentioned but specific numbers for Sánchez weren't provided in the search results[1].

Additionally, approval ratings can fluctuate based on domestic and international events, making predictions challenging without more current trend data.

Considering that Turkey has seen increased authoritarianism under Erdoğan's leadership and his relatively low approval rating of 34% as of mid-2024, while recognizing that we lack specific data for Sánchez from the same source, I must weigh the limited available evidence carefully.

Probability: 55%
