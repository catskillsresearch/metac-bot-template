(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  
The 2024 World Series begins October 25, 2024, and if it goes to six games, it would likely conclude by early November 2024. As of October 23, 2024, the outcome should be known within about two weeks.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
The outcome is not yet determined—the series has not started, so there is no default or assumed winner or game count.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
Any of the following would resolve the question as "No":
- The Dodgers win the World Series.
- The Yankees win the World Series, but not in exactly six games (i.e., in four, five, or seven games).
- The series is shortened, extended, canceled, or unresolved by January 1, 2025, and the Yankees have not won in exactly six games[1][2].

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
The New York Yankees win the 2024 World Series in exactly six games played—meaning they defeat the Los Angeles Dodgers 4-2, as reported by Major League Baseball and other credible outlets[1][4].

## Rationale

Expert predictions before the series start slightly favor the Yankees to win, with several forecasters specifically suggesting a 4-2 win in six games[1][4]. The Yankees' strengths—offense, bullpen, and postseason momentum—plus the Dodgers' significant injury issues, make 4-2 a plausible scenario[1][3][4]. However, multiple credible experts also point out the Dodgers' formidable offense and bullpen depth, indicating the Series could well go to seven games or the Dodgers could prevail[1][2].

Despite these predictions, the actual result is unknown prior to the Series. Baseball best-of-seven series are inherently volatile due to matchup-dependent performance, random variance, and managerial decisions. Historically, a 4-2 outcome is common—but not the default—and predicting the exact number of games is notably harder than simply picking the winner. The “status quo” at this point is genuine uncertainty.

Good forecasters recognize that most often, the world changes slowly, so absent strong evidence for a specific scenario (like a sweep or a crisis), the most likely outcome is “No” (i.e., the Yankees do not win in exactly six games), since there are more ways for this not to happen (Dodgers win, Yankees win in 4/5/7, series delayed/canceled) than for it to occur.
