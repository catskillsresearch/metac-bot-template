(a) Time left until outcome: 24 days (from May 6, 2025 to April 1, 2025)
(b) Status quo outcome: No announcement has been made yet, so the status quo is "No"
(c) No scenario: The interim government continues its reform process without announcing a specific election date, adhering to their timeline of elections in late 2025 or early 2026
(d) Yes scenario: Political pressure or accelerated reforms lead the interim government to finalize and announce a specific election date before April 1, 2025

Based on the available information, I need to assess the probability that Bangladesh will announce a general election date before April 1, 2025. Let me analyze the current situation carefully.

The interim government of Bangladesh, led by Muhammad Yunus, has consistently indicated that elections will be held in late 2025 or early 2026. In December 2024, Chief Adviser Yunus specifically stated that "the election date can be set between the end of 2025 and the first half of 2026"[5]. This timeline has been reinforced by multiple sources, including the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) which mentioned December 2025 as the expected election timeframe[4].

Several prerequisites for holding elections have been outlined by government officials:
- Completion of electoral reforms
- Preparation of a flawless voter list
- Formation of a proper election commission
- Building national consensus among political parties[1][5]

The interim government has established a Consensus Building Commission to engage with political parties and develop implementation strategies for reforms. This commission was expected to begin work in early 2025[5]. The deliberate, step-by-step approach suggests that the government is not rushing to announce an election date.

Dr. Asif Nazrul, an advisor to the interim government, emphasized that "elections are very important policy decisions" and that the timing "will be fixed under the leadership of the chief adviser"[1]. This indicates centralized decision-making regarding the election timeline.

The historical context is important here. The previous election in January 2024 was controversial, with the Awami League winning amid low voter turnout and opposition boycotts[3]. The interim government that took power in August 2024 has prioritized reforms to ensure the next election is free and fair. Rushing to announce an election without completing these reforms would contradict their stated objectives.

Given the consistent messaging about elections in late 2025 or early 2026, the ongoing reform processes, and the need for political consensus, it appears highly unlikely that Bangladesh will announce a specific election date before April 1, 2025. While political situations can change rapidly, there is no indication in the available information that the timeline is being accelerated.

Status quo bias is relevant here - government processes, especially those involving electoral reforms and consensus-building, typically move slowly and according to established timelines. The interim government has been consistent in its messaging about the election timeframe, giving us no reason to expect a sudden change in plans.

Probability: 10%
