(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
As of July 25, 2024, there are approximately 68 days (a bit over two months) until October 1, 2024, when the CDC case count will be referenced for this question.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
As of July 12, 2024, the CDC has reported a cumulative total of five human H5 cases in the United States since 2022, with four occurring in 2024 and one in 2022[2][3]. The current monthly rate for new case reporting in 2024 is about one per month[3]. If this trend continues without acceleration, the United States would report approximately seven total cases by October 1, 2024—well below the 12–20 range in question.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
If the H5N1 situation in dairy cattle and poultry remains similar to recent months—with only sporadic, isolated animal-to-human transmission, no evidence of efficient human-to-human transmission, and no major changes in surveillance or viral behavior—the cumulative case count will likely remain below 12 by October 1. This would yield a “No” outcome and aligns with the current trend[1][2][3].

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
A “Yes” outcome would require a sudden and significant change, such as:  
- A notable increase in zoonotic spillover events, for instance, due to an unrecognized surge in undetected cases among farm workers, or  
- A shift in viral properties leading to increased transmissibility to humans, or  
- Drastic expansion of targeted surveillance or diagnostic policies that begin detecting multiple previously-missed or mild/asymptomatic cases in at-risk populations[5].

There is no current evidence for these developments as of late July 2024[2][3][5].

## Rationale

Recent and historical CDC data show that all U.S. human H5 cases have occurred in individuals with direct animal exposure, mainly dairy and poultry workers, without signs of ongoing human-to-human transmission[2][3]. Surveillance of exposed individuals is active and robust, having monitored over 9,000 people since 2022[1]. The CDC continues to assess the risk to the general public as low, and no significant changes in the epidemiological trend, surveillance intensity, or policy have been announced that would be expected to sharply alter the rate of newly detected cases by October 1[1][2][3].

While some experts highlight that mild or asymptomatic cases could be underdetected, there is no indication that an abrupt surveillance expansion or a major outbreak is imminent before October 1, 2024[5]. Wastewater and serological data might suggest wider circulation, but the official CDC case count, which is the metric that resolves this forecast, is unlikely to reflect such hidden infections unless diagnostic criteria change or a major outbreak occurs—neither of which is in evidence as of now[5].

Given the steady, low rate of case accrual, the history of animal-associated but not community transmission, and absence of strong drivers for change, extra weight should be placed on the status quo as good forecasting practice.

## Final Answer

Probability: **8%**
  
A sharp increase to 12–20 CDC-reported human H5 cases by October 1, 2024, is unlikely barring an unforeseen outbreak, new transmission pattern, or major surveillance change[1][2][3][5].
