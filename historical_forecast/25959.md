(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known: 11 days (July 21, 2025 is when the Tour de France 2024 concludes)

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed: Either Tadej Pogačar or Jonas Vingegaard will win the Tour de France 2024, as they have collectively won the last four editions of the race.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome: Pogačar maintains his current lead in the general classification through the remaining stages, or Vingegaard continues his resurgence and overtakes Pogačar to claim his third consecutive title.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome: One of the other top contenders like Primož Roglič or Remco Evenepoel capitalizes on a moment of weakness from both Pogačar and Vingegaard, or either of the favorites suffers a crash, illness, or disqualification that removes them from contention.

Based on the information available as of July 10, 2024, I assess that the probability of someone other than Tadej Pogačar or Jonas Vingegaard winning the 2024 Tour de France is relatively low.

## Historical Dominance

Pogačar and Vingegaard have established themselves as the preeminent riders in recent Tour de France history. The last four Tours have been won exclusively by these two cyclists, with Pogačar taking victories in 2020 and 2021, while Vingegaard claimed the yellow jersey in 2022 and 2023[3]. This pattern of dominance suggests a continued duopoly at the top of cycling's most prestigious race.

## Current Race Dynamics

As of July 10, 2024, the race appears to be developing into another chapter of the Pogačar-Vingegaard rivalry. Despite Vingegaard's significant crash in April that raised questions about his form, Stage 11 showed he is recovering strongly and potentially gaining momentum[2]. Pogačar initially attacked on the Puy Mary climb, gaining about half a minute on Vingegaard and Roglič, but Vingegaard subsequently began reducing that gap[2]. This dynamic suggests both riders remain the strongest in the race.

## Potential Challengers

While Pogačar and Vingegaard are the clear favorites, the 2024 Tour does feature an unusually strong field that includes all four of cycling's top GC riders[5]:

1. Primož Roglič - A former Grand Tour winner who recently demonstrated strong form by winning the Critérium du Dauphiné[4].
2. Remco Evenepoel - Making his Tour debut, he's a world-class time trialist who could benefit from the final time trial stage[5].

However, despite their credentials, these challengers have not yet demonstrated the ability to consistently match Pogačar and Vingegaard in the mountains during this Tour.

## Unforeseen Circumstances

The most likely path to someone else winning would be through unforeseen circumstances. Cycling is inherently unpredictable, with crashes, illness, and mechanical issues potentially derailing even the strongest contenders[5]. Pogačar's attempt at the Giro-Tour double (not achieved since 1998) could potentially lead to fatigue in the final week[4]. Vingegaard's recovery from his April crash introduces another variable[4].

## Status Quo Bias Consideration

As a forecaster, I must acknowledge that the status quo typically has strong predictive power. The established pattern of Pogačar and Vingegaard dominating the Tour de France represents a strong prior that should be given significant weight. While upsets can and do happen in cycling, they remain relatively rare in determining the overall winner of Grand Tours when clear favorites are present and performing well.

Based on the historical dominance of these two riders, their current form as demonstrated through Stage 11, and the relative strength of the field, I assess that there is a low probability that someone else will win the 2024 Tour de France.

Probability: 15%
