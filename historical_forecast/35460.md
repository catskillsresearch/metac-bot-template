(a) **Time until resolution:**  
From February 26, 2025, to April 1, 2025, is just over 5 weeks. This is a relatively short window for complex political and legislative processes such as impeachment.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
If the situation remains unchanged—meaning no significant procedural acceleration or shift in political alignment—the Chamber of Deputies will *not* approve articles of impeachment against President Milei by the required two-thirds majority before April 1, 2025. The impeachment commission is effectively stalled without a designated president and has not met yet this year[4]. Historically, the commission has only rarely advanced impeachment proceedings to a successful vote[4].

(c) **Scenario leading to a No outcome:**  
Impeachment requests remain in committee due to procedural gridlock (no commission chair, no meetings). The opposition continues to push, but lacks the numbers and procedural tools to force a floor vote. The Chamber is unable to schedule, debate, or move the impeachment articles to a two-thirds vote in time, regardless of ongoing investigations or public outcry. Most recent precedent and the slow historical pace of such proceedings support this scenario[4].

(d) **Scenario leading to a Yes outcome:**  
Political outrage over the $LIBRA scandal intensifies, causing a rapid coalescence of opposition and wavering coalition deputies. The commission quickly resolves its leadership, meets, and fast-tracks the impeachment process. Scandal revelations or new evidence dramatically erode Milei’s support and trigger mass defections, enabling the opposition to secure the two-thirds majority necessary to pass articles of impeachment in the Chamber by April 1, 2025. This would require breaking historical precedent with an unusually swift and united parliamentary response[4][1].

## Rationale

- **Procedural Barriers:** The impeachment process is currently stalled by the lack of a commission chair and has yet to even formally begin the investigative phase in 2025[4]. Historically, progress on such issues is slow.
- **Political Numbers:** The opposition does not currently command two-thirds of the deputies, and even a scandal of this magnitude may not produce rapid enough realignments to achieve the necessary majority within five weeks[1][4].
- **Historical Precedent:** Successful impeachments are extremely rare, with none in over two decades at the national level for similarly high-ranking officials[4].
- **Scandal Severity:** While the $LIBRA collapse caused significant losses and public outrage, the president has attempted damage control, including ordering an investigation and denying direct involvement[1][3]. Unless stronger evidence of wrongdoing emerges or political dynamics shift dramatically, the path to a rapid impeachment is unlikely.
- **Time Pressure:** There is insufficient time for the commission to organize, investigate, report, and for the full Chamber to debate and achieve a two-thirds vote on impeachment articles before April 1, 2025[4].

Given all factors, and weighting the status quo appropriately, the likelihood that the Chamber of Deputies will impeach (i.e., approve one or more articles of impeachment with the required two-thirds majority) President Milei before April 1, 2025, is very low.

**Probability: 6%**
