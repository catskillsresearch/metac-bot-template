As a professional forecaster, I'll analyze whether an OpenAI model will maintain its #1 ranking on the LMSYS Chatbot Arena Leaderboard at the end of Q4 2024.

(a) Time until outcome is known: Approximately 2 months (from May 6, 2025 to January 1, 2025, when Metaculus will check the leaderboard).

(b) Status quo outcome: OpenAI models (specifically "chatgpt-4o-latest" and "o1-preview") are currently ranked #1 as of September 30, 2024.

(c) No outcome scenario: A competitor like DeepSeek, which currently shows strong performance with models like DeepSeek-V3-0324 and DeepSeek-R1 having high Elo ratings (1372 and 1359 respectively), could release an improved model that overtakes OpenAI in the rankings[1].

(d) Yes outcome scenario: OpenAI maintains its lead by continuing to improve its existing models or releasing new versions before year-end, keeping them ahead of competitors in the Elo rankings.

## Current Leaderboard Analysis

Looking at the most recent data available from the search results, the LMSYS Chatbot Arena leaderboard shows several strong open-source models at the top of the rankings. DeepSeek-V3-0324 has an Arena Elo of 1372, followed by DeepSeek-R1 with an Elo of 1359[1]. Other high-performing models include Qwen3-235B-A22B and Gemma-3-27B-it (both with Elo ratings of 1342)[1].

Interestingly, the search results don't specify the exact current Elo ratings for OpenAI's models. The information that OpenAI's "chatgpt-4o-latest" and "o1-preview" were ranked first as of September 30, 2024 comes from the background information, not the search results.

## Competitive Landscape

The competitive landscape has evolved significantly in 2024. Open-source models have made remarkable progress, with several models now achieving very high Elo ratings:

1. DeepSeek models (DeepSeek-V3-0324 and DeepSeek-R1) have Elo ratings of 1372 and 1359 respectively[1]
2. Qwen3-235B-A22B has an Elo of 1342[1]
3. Gemma-3 models from Google have also shown strong performance[1]

This indicates that OpenAI is facing substantial competition from both commercial and open-source alternatives.

## Evaluation Methodology

The LMSYS Chatbot Arena uses a crowdsourced approach where users ask questions and get answers from two anonymous LLMs, then vote for the model that delivers the preferred response[3]. This data is used to compute Elo ratings, similar to chess rankings[5]. The platform has gathered over 100,000 pairwise votes, which provides a robust dataset for evaluation[3].

The methodology includes several metrics:
- Arena Elo ratings (computed from user preferences)
- MMLU scores (measuring multitask accuracy on 57 tasks)
- Arena-Hard-Auto (an automatic evaluation tool)[1]

## Factors Affecting the Forecast

**1. Recent Model Releases and Improvements**

The leaderboard indicates significant advancements from various companies. DeepSeek, Qwen, and Google's Gemma models have shown impressive performance[1]. These developments suggest that the gap between OpenAI and its competitors has narrowed.

**2. Evaluation Criteria**

The LMSYS team continues to refine their evaluation methodology, including more efficient sampling algorithms and better quality assessment of human feedback[3]. Any changes to the evaluation method could affect rankings.

**3. Historical Precedent**

While OpenAI has historically maintained strong positions on the leaderboard, the rise of competitive models suggests this dominance isn't guaranteed. The fact that non-OpenAI models currently show high Elo ratings indicates the landscape is becoming more competitive[1].

**4. Timing of Model Releases**

With just under two months until the end of Q4 2024, there's limited time for major model releases. However, companies often time their releases strategically, and we could see last-minute updates before year-end.

## Weighing the Evidence

The status quo shows OpenAI in the #1 position as of September 30, 2024. However, the latest leaderboard data suggests very strong competition from other models, particularly from DeepSeek.

Given the high Elo ratings of models like DeepSeek-V3-0324 (1372) and DeepSeek-R1 (1359), it appears that OpenAI may already be facing significant challenges to its #1 position[1]. The fact that these open models have such high ratings suggests they may already have surpassed OpenAI's models since the September 30 data point.

Additionally, Kalshi is offering markets on which LLM will be ranked #1 on the LMSYS Chatbot Arena Leaderboard at the end of the year, indicating uncertainty about the outcome[2].

## Additional Considerations

The Chatbot Arena is continuously evolving its methodology, including the introduction of more efficient sampling algorithms and better assessment of human feedback quality[3]. These refinements could potentially impact model rankings.

The platform's crowdsourced nature means that rankings reflect human preferences, which may not always align with technical capabilities. This adds another layer of uncertainty to the forecast.
