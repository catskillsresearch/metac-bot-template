I'll approach this forecasting interview question methodically by analyzing the available data and providing a reasoned prediction.

(a) Time left until the outcome is known:
The outcome will be known after March 7, 2025. Today is February 13, 2025, so there are 22 days remaining until the outcome is known.

(b) The outcome if nothing changed:
If the current earthquake activity completely stopped today, there would be 0 earthquakes of magnitude ≥4 near Santorini in the first week of March 2025.

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued:
Based on the search results, during the peak period of February 1-6, 2025, there were 94 earthquakes of magnitude ≥4, averaging approximately 15.7 such earthquakes per day[4]. If this trend continued unabated until the first week of March, we could expect around 110 earthquakes of magnitude ≥4 during that week (15.7 × 7 = 109.9).

(d) The expectations of experts and markets:
Experts indicate this seismic sequence could persist for months[2]. Greek seismologist Akis Tselentis specifically compared it to the Arkalochori earthquake in Crete which was preceded by four months of seismic buildup[2]. Similar volcanic-seismic activity was recorded in 2011 and lasted for 14 months before ending without major issues[4]. The state of emergency declared by Greece is set to last until March 3, 2025[3], suggesting authorities anticipate continued significant activity at least until then.

(e) Unexpected scenario resulting in a low outcome:
The seismic activity could rapidly decline if the stress along the fault line is suddenly released through one or two larger earthquakes before March, or if the underlying tectonic or magmatic processes driving the swarm quickly stabilize. This would result in very few or potentially zero magnitude ≥4 earthquakes during the first week of March.

(f) Unexpected scenario resulting in a high outcome:
If the current activity represents just the beginning phase of a much larger seismic crisis, possibly involving the nearby Kolumbos submarine volcano (which had a major eruption in 1650)[2], we could see a dramatic increase in both frequency and magnitude of earthquakes. This could result in 20+ magnitude ≥4 earthquakes per day during the first week of March.

When considering my forecast, I need to account for several key factors:

1. Earthquake swarms typically follow a pattern of increasing activity, peak, and then gradual decline, but the timeframe varies widely.

2. By March 1, the swarm will have been active for over 5 weeks (since January 24), suggesting some potential for decline from peak activity.

3. As of February 10, over 12,800 earthquakes had been recorded in the Santorini-Amorgos zone since February 1[2], with the strongest (M5.3) occurring on February 10, indicating the swarm remained highly active.

4. The fault line involved is approximately 120 kilometers long, but only the southern part between Santorini and Amorgos has been activated so far[4], suggesting potential for continued or expanded activity.

5. The state of emergency expires on March 3, but the seismic activity may continue beyond that date.

Given all these considerations and the significant uncertainty inherent in earthquake swarm prediction, here is my forecast:

Percentile 10: 20
Percentile 20: 35
Percentile 40: 55
Percentile 60: 75
Percentile 80: 95
Percentile 90: 110
