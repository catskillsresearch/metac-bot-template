(a) Time left until outcome: About 7 months (May 6, 2025 to January 1, 2025)
(b) Status quo outcome: No public health emergency declared for Marburg virus disease in the US
(c) No outcome scenario: The Marburg outbreak in Rwanda remains contained or gradually decreases with effective international support, no cases appear in the US, and existing monitoring measures prove sufficient without requiring a formal emergency declaration.
(d) Yes outcome scenario: The Marburg outbreak spreads to multiple countries including those with direct travel links to the US, or a case is detected within US borders, prompting HHS to declare a public health emergency to mobilize additional resources and coordination.

As a professional forecaster, I need to assess the likelihood that the US Department of Health and Human Services will declare a public health emergency for Marburg virus disease before January 1, 2025, based on the available information.

## Current Status of the Outbreak

The Marburg virus disease (MVD) outbreak in Rwanda was first reported on September 27, 2024, marking the country's first experience with this disease[1]. As of October 9, 2024, Rwanda had reported 58 confirmed cases including 13 deaths[2][5]. The case fatality rate is approximately 31%[1][4]. 

A concerning aspect of this outbreak is that healthcare workers constitute over 70% of the confirmed cases, primarily from two health facilities in Kigali[1]. The outbreak has spread to seven or eight of Rwanda's 30 districts, with most cases concentrated in the capital region of Kigali[1][4][5].

## Response Efforts

Rwanda has implemented several response measures with support from the WHO and other international partners. On October 5, 2024, the Sabin Vaccine Institute provided 700 doses of an investigational vaccine against Marburg virus, and vaccinations for healthcare workers in Kigali began on October 6 as part of a Phase 2 rapid response study[5].

Other measures implemented by Rwandan authorities include increasing awareness of personal hygiene practices, issuing guidelines to avoid contact with symptomatic individuals, and banning hospital visits[5].

## Risk Assessment for the United States

The CDC has acknowledged the outbreak in Rwanda and is aware of the confirmed cases[3]. Based on the search results, there are currently no confirmed cases of Marburg virus disease in the United States, and the CDC has previously stated that the risk of infection in the US is low.

## Factors Affecting Likelihood of a US Public Health Emergency Declaration

Several factors would influence the likelihood of a PHE declaration:

1. **Geographic Spread**: Currently, the outbreak is contained within Rwanda. For the US to declare a PHE, the disease would likely need to spread beyond Rwanda to countries with more direct travel links to the US.

2. **Case Detection in the US**: A PHE would be much more likely if even a single case were detected within US borders.

3. **Rate of Spread**: The outbreak appears to be growing, with cases increasing from 26 on September 29[1][3] to 36 by October 2[4] and 58 by October 9[2][5]. However, this rate does not yet suggest uncontrollable spread.

4. **International Assessment**: The WHO has assessed the risk as "very high at the national level, high at the regional level, and low at the global level"[1]. This assessment suggests limited international concern at present.

5. **Existing US Measures**: The CDC is likely implementing enhanced screening for travelers from affected regions, but no extraordinary measures have been announced that would suggest an imminent emergency declaration.

## Historical Precedent

Public health emergency declarations for emerging diseases typically occur when:
- Cases are detected within US borders
- There is significant international spread with high likelihood of US introduction
- The disease demonstrates high virulence and transmission rates

For example, COVID-19 received a PHE declaration after cases were already detected in the US. Ebola, which is similar to Marburg, received a PHE declaration in 2014 when the outbreak in West Africa was much larger than the current Marburg situation and had already spread to multiple countries.

## Forecasting Rationale

The status quo strongly suggests that a PHE declaration is unlikely in the near term. For several reasons:

1. The outbreak is geographically limited to Rwanda, with no confirmed spread to other countries yet.
2. There are no direct commercial flights between Rwanda and the US, limiting direct exposure pathways.
3. No cases have been detected in the US, which would be a significant trigger for a declaration.
4. The current outbreak, while serious, has not reached the scale that prompted previous PHE declarations for similar viral hemorrhagic fevers.

However, several factors could increase the likelihood:
1. The outbreak is relatively recent (just over a month old) and appears to be growing.
2. Healthcare worker infections suggest potential difficulties in infection control.
3. The case fatality rate of approximately 31% indicates high virulence.
4. There are cases unlinked to known transmission chains, suggesting undetected spread.

Given the time horizon (approximately 7 months until January 1, 2025), there is sufficient time for the situation to evolve significantly. However, for a PHE declaration to occur, we would likely need to see one or more of the following:
- Significant international spread beyond Rwanda
- Cases appearing in countries with direct travel links to the US
- Detection of at least one case in the United States

Considering all these factors and giving appropriate weight to the status quo, I assess that a US public health emergency declaration for Marburg virus disease before January 1, 2025 is unlikely but not implausible.

Probability: 15%
