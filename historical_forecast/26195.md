(a) **Time Remaining Until Outcome Is Known:**  
Today is July 16, 2024. The question concerns whether more than 300 measles cases will have been reported by September 30, 2024. Therefore, there are approximately 2.5 months (about 11 weeks) remaining before the outcome is known.

(b) **Status Quo Outcome if Nothing Changed:**  
As of July 15, 2024, the CDC has reported 167 measles cases for the year, with biweekly updates[1][3]. By December 31, 2024, the final CDC count reached 285 cases for the entire year[1][3]. If current trends and reporting rates from July onward continued, the number of cases reported by September 30, 2024, would not exceed 300.

(c) **Scenario Resulting in a No Outcome:**  
Under the most likely scenario based on year-to-date data and recent historical patterns, the number of reported cases would rise gradually, remaining below the 300-case threshold by the end of September. In fact, since only 285 cases were reported by the end of the entire year, the number on September 30 would have been even lower, ensuring a “No” outcome[1][3].

(d) **Scenario Resulting in a Yes Outcome:**  
A “Yes” outcome would require a dramatic and unprecedented surge in measles cases—well over 130 new cases (from 167 as of July 15) within just 11 weeks, and before the annual total hits 285 by year’s end. This would necessitate several large, sustained outbreaks in multiple jurisdictions, which did not occur in 2024 according to CDC surveillance[1][3].

## Rationale

CDC surveillance confirmed only 285 cases for all of 2024, with most cases linked to outbreaks but without evidence of major surges in late summer or early fall[1][3]. The majority of recent U.S. measles trends have shown occasional clusters but not explosive, sustained growth outside of rare years. Reporting lags and retroactive updates are possible, but CDC’s final year-end count, updated with lags accounted for, is still below 300[1][3].

Given the status quo, there is strong evidence that more than 300 cases had not been reported by September 30, 2024. Exceeding 300 by that date would have required an anomalously large uptick in cases that is unsupported by any available data for 2024.
