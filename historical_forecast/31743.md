I'll analyze the February 2025 rainfall forecast for Brasília, Brazil as a professional forecaster.

(a) Time left until outcome is known: Approximately 9 months from now. The outcome will be the measured rainfall in February 2025, which will be fully known after February 28, 2025, with official data from INMET station [83377] BRASILIA - DF.

(b) The outcome if nothing changed: Based on historical averages from multiple sources, Brasília typically receives between 121 mm and 217 mm of rainfall in February[3][5]. Averaging these sources suggests around 190 mm would be the status quo expectation.

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued: Brasília recently experienced a record-breaking drought with 167 consecutive days without rain in 2024 and the hottest September on record. If drought conditions persist or the climate continues to show extreme behavior, rainfall might be below the historical average.

(d) The expectations of experts and markets: No specific expert forecasts for February 2025 are available yet. Historical data from meteorological institutes shows February typically has 17-23 days of rainfall in Brasília with precipitation ranging from 121-217 mm[3][5]. Weather2Travel data suggests an average of 217 mm rainfall over 23 days with some rain in Brasília in February[5].

(e) An unexpected scenario resulting in a low outcome: A persistent high-pressure system could develop over central Brazil, blocking weather fronts and moisture transport from the Amazon. This, combined with continued effects of climate change and potential influence from a strong La Niña event, could result in significantly reduced rainfall, perhaps below 80 mm for the month.

(f) An unexpected scenario resulting in a high outcome: Conversely, the development of a strong El Niño pattern, combined with unusual atmospheric river conditions, could funnel excessive moisture to the region. This could result in intense convective storms and rainfall exceeding 300 mm, potentially causing localized flooding in Brasília.

As a forecaster, I recognize that climate patterns can be unpredictable, especially in an era of climate change and following extreme drought conditions. Historical averages provide a baseline, but recent climate anomalies suggest we should account for significant variability.
