(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
February 2025 ends in 5 days (from February 24, 2025).

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
Donald Trump has already granted executive clemency to more than two individuals in February 2025 because the January 20, 2025, blanket clemency action covers approximately 1,500 people and is publicly disclosed[1][2]. This meets the resolution criteria.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
A No outcome would only be possible if the January 20, 2025, blanket clemency was not considered to have occurred or was not publicly disclosed, or if its scope was revised such that it did not qualify as clemency for more than two individuals. This appears highly unlikely given current public records and reporting[1][2].

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
The Yes outcome is already secured: the blanket clemency order has been issued, covers far more than two individuals, is public, and is being implemented by the Justice Department[1][2][5]. Even if no further clemency is granted in February 2025, the criteria are met.

## Rationale

The resolution is driven by the January 20, 2025, executive clemency proclamation, which is both a wide-reaching, publicly disclosed action and applies to a group vastly exceeding the threshold of two individuals[1][2]. Major news outlets, legal records, and government releases all confirm the scope and effect of this order[2][5]. Only a highly improbable reversal or retraction could change this outcome, but there is no evidence or reporting to suggest such a reversal is underway or even contemplated.

## Final Answer

Probability: 100%
