(a) **Time until known outcome:**  
The official NOAA tornado count for March 2025 will be published after March ends, with NOAA’s climate summary page scheduled for release on April 8, 2025[4]. This means the outcome will be known in approximately 2 months from the current date (February 7, 2025).

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
The long-term average (1991–2020) for March tornadoes in the U.S. is approximately 80. However, actual annual March counts have varied between roughly 30 and 120 in the last decade. Most recent years have clustered in the 55–79 range, with some outlier years higher or lower. If typical conditions prevail, one would expect a count in the 55–79 range as the median, given recent climatology.

(c) **Unexpected outcome scenario:**  
A scenario that could yield an unexpected outcome is the failure of the forecasted La Niña to impact the U.S. in its typical way. For example, if a blocking pattern develops over the U.S. or the Gulf of Mexico remains unusually cool (cutting off the moisture supply), March 2025 could see a dramatic suppression of tornado development, resulting in a notably low count, possibly in the 30–54 or even 0–29 bin. Conversely, a sudden intense outbreak (like those in 1974 or 2011) could drive totals above 80, especially if La Niña strengthens and the jet stream repeatedly aligns with warm, moist air in the South[5].

## Rationale and Probabilities

- Given the moderate to strong La Niña conditions expected through March 2025, historical patterns favor above-average severe weather in the southern U.S.[5].
- Recent Marches under ENSO-neutral or weak La Niña have seen moderate activity, but strong La Niña years (such as 2011) have occasionally produced significantly higher counts[5].
- The climatological mean is around 80 for March, so the highest-probability bin should reflect the tendency for tornado reports to cluster near this average, but with some allowance for the inherent variability and the possibility for both suppressed and outbreak-heavy seasons.

## Final Probabilities

Option_0 to 29: 5%  
Option_30 to 54: 20%  
Option_55 to 79: 45%  
Option_80 and above: 30%  

These probabilities reflect a central tendency toward the 55–79 range, with a meaningful tail toward an active season (given La Niña), and a smaller but real chance of a suppressed season due to unpredictable atmospheric or regional anomalies.
