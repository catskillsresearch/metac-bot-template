(a) **Time left until the outcome is known**: Approximately 38 days, until September 20, 2024.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed**: Given the absence of substantial new information or unexpected events, it's reasonable to lean towards a continuation of recent market trends. However, without specific historical data, the status quo isn't clearly defined beyond the recent uptick in volatility.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome**: A scenario where market stability increases due to positive economic indicators, clear central bank communication, and reduced geopolitical tensions could lead to lower volatility expectations, making the VXVCLS on September 20, 2024, lower than in 2023.

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome**: If recent volatility trends persist or intensify—due to economic uncertainty, potential monetary policy changes, or increased geopolitical tensions—this could result in higher market volatility expectations, leading to a higher VXVCLS on September 20, 2024, compared to the previous year.

Given these scenarios, while there is some indication of increased volatility in recent months, forecasting volatility indices like the VXVCLS is inherently challenging due to their forward-looking nature and sensitivity to unforeseen events. However, the recent uptick in volatility observed in July 2024 could suggest a slight leaning towards higher volatility if these trends continue.

Final Answer:  
**Probability: 55%**
