(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
Today is November 1, 2024. The outcome will be checked after November 15, 2024, so there are approximately 15 days until the result is determined.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
The recall is currently listed as *Active* on the FSIS recall database. If no status change occurs by November 15, the status remains *Active* and the outcome will be **No**.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
- FSIS continues to detect substantial quantities of recalled product remaining in commerce or in consumers’ possession.
- Additional consumer reports or evidence of the contaminated product being found or consumed arise.
- Perdue or FSIS does not complete closure procedures or necessary investigations by the deadline.

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
- The product is swiftly removed from stores and most consumers promptly return or dispose of affected items.
- No further reports of contamination, injury, or illness are recorded.
- FSIS determines there is minimal risk remaining, Perdue demonstrates corrective measures, and the recall is formally closed, updating the status to *Closed* on the website before November 16, 2024.

## Rationale and Forecast

Historically, recall closure timelines vary with the nature and severity of the issue, the distribution footprint, and the effectiveness of communication to consumers. This Perdue recall involves a large volume (over 167,000 pounds) and wide national distribution[3][4], but is classified as "Class I" only if there is a reasonable probability that eating the food will cause serious health problems or death. In this case, the contamination is with "very thin strand[s] of metal wire," which, while hazardous, has so far resulted in *no confirmed reports of illness or injury as of mid-August 2024*[3][4].

FSIS recall closures commonly happen within several weeks to a few months provided:
- The recall is voluntary and the manufacturer acts quickly.
- There is no evidence of ongoing or widespread harm.
- The contamination is traceable and contained to a known batch.
- Public communication is effective and product removal is confirmed.

Processing a recall of frozen products can sometimes take longer, as products can persist in consumer freezers well past purchase. FSIS explicitly expressed concern that the recalled items could remain in home freezers[4]. In cases where products are ready-to-eat and widely distributed, recalls can remain open for several months, especially if there is uncertainty about the scope of consumer compliance.

No information in the search results points to additional complications or extension of the recall period, and no new incidents have been reported since the initial announcement[3][4]. However, the large volume and the FSIS statement about products remaining in home freezers are consistent with recalls that sometimes last into the 3- to 6-month range, especially when products have a long shelf life (as with frozen foods).

**Given the status quo and weighting for persistence, the most likely outcome is that the recall remains Active as of November 16, barring strong evidence of rapid consumer compliance or a focused campaign to speed closure.**

**Probability: 35%**

This reflects that closure before November 16, 2024 is possible, especially since it will have been three months since the recall, but the practical barriers (frozen product longevity, national scope, FSIS caution) lead the status quo—an Active recall—to be the most probable outcome.
