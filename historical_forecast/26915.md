Based on the search results and current information, I'll analyze the question about Kamala Harris's net favorability rating being higher than -8 by September 1, 2024.

(a) Time left until outcome: The outcome will be known in approximately 27 days from today (May 6, 2025 to September 1, 2024).

(b) Status quo outcome: Based on the most recent data available, Harris's net favorability appears to have improved from earlier measurements. According to the ABC News/Ipsos poll from July 28, 2024, Harris had a 43% favorability rating and a 42% unfavorability rating[3], giving her a slight net positive favorability of +1. This represents a significant improvement from her previous ratings.

(c) Scenario for No outcome: Harris's favorability could decline if there are campaign missteps, poor debate performances, or negative news stories that gain traction before September 1. Additionally, if economic conditions worsen or immigration issues (which previously hurt her ratings[1]) return to the forefront of public discourse, her favorability could drop below the -8 threshold.

(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: The momentum from Biden dropping out of the race appears to have given Harris a significant boost in favorability[3]. If she continues to consolidate Democratic support, maintains her improved standing with independents (where she saw a jump from 28% to 44% favorable[3]), and runs an effective campaign through August, her net favorability should remain above the -8 threshold.

Now for my rationale:

The available search results suggest that Harris's favorability has been experiencing a positive trend. In the most recent poll data from late July 2024, Harris had a favorable rating of 43% and an unfavorable rating of 42%[3], giving her a net favorability of +1. This represents a significant improvement from earlier ratings.

The improvement coincided with Biden's withdrawal from the race, which led to Harris becoming the presumptive Democratic nominee. This event created a notable bounce in her ratings, especially among independents, where her favorability jumped from 28% to 44%[3].

Additional polling data from Minnesota in October 2024 shows Harris with a consistent lead over Trump, averaging about 7 percentage points in that state[5]. While state-level polling doesn't directly measure favorability, it suggests that Harris maintained or potentially improved her standing through the campaign.

Historically, Harris's approval ratings were tied to Biden's[1], but her recent independent candidacy appears to have allowed her to establish a more positive personal image. The ABC News/Ipsos poll indicates that Americans feel more enthusiasm for Harris (48%) than for Trump (39%)[3], which could translate to sustained favorability.

The timeline is relatively short (27 days from today to September 1), and significant shifts in public opinion typically require major events or developments. While campaign dynamics can change quickly, the status quo suggests Harris has established a more favorable position than the -8 threshold.

Given that Harris's most recent measured net favorability was positive (+1) according to the July poll[3], and Minnesota polling data from October suggests she maintained strength through the campaign[5], there would need to be a substantial negative shift to bring her below the -8 threshold.

Probability: 85%
