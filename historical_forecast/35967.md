(a) **Time left until resolution**: Less than 1 month, as the outcome must be published by AnimeJapan’s official accounts before April 7, 2025.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed**: If attendance held steady at the 2024 figure, the outcome would be **132,557 visitors**.

(c) **Outcome if current trend continued**: The 2024 attendance (132,557) was a strong bounce from 2023 (implied at ~100,430), but still lower than the pre-pandemic peak (152,331 in 2018). From 2014-2018, annual growth averaged about 8%. If 2025 sees a modest recovery, perhaps in line with pre-pandemic growth (~7%), attendance could reach around **141,000–143,000 visitors**.

(d) **Expectations of experts and markets**: The global anime industry continues rapid growth, with a projected 9.8% CAGR and expanding international interest[1][3]. Still, convention attendance is constrained by local factors, venue size, and post-pandemic behavior. Expert expectation would suggest continued recovery toward—but not necessarily exceeding—pre-pandemic highs in 2025. Thus, the consensus expectation for 2025 is likely **slightly above 2024, but likely below the 2018 peak (i.e., 135,000–150,000)**.

(e) **Unexpected low scenario**: A sudden rise in COVID or other infectious outbreaks, natural disasters, transportation disruptions, or abrupt policy changes (such as travel or crowd restrictions) could sharply reduce attendance—potentially pushing it back toward 2023 levels (around **100,000 visitors** or even below).

(f) **Unexpected high scenario**: Exceptional global or domestic hype (example: a major anniversary, blockbuster anime premiere, unprecedented international outreach, or relaxation of any lingering restrictions), combined with effective marketing and broader travel availability, could drive record or near-record turnout—potentially exceeding the 2018 high and reaching **155,000–160,000 visitors**.
