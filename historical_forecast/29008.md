(a) Time until outcome: 9 days (from October 21, 2024 to October 30, 2024)

(b) Status quo outcome: Based on the available information, the CBOE S&P 500 3-Month Volatility Index (VXVCLS) appears to be trending higher than its October 30, 2023 value of 20.80. The volatility index has shown elevated levels in 2024.

(c) Scenario for No outcome: A significant reduction in market uncertainty could occur in the final days of October 2024. This might happen if there's unexpected positive economic news, clear signals from the Federal Reserve about future rate cuts, or resolution of geopolitical tensions. Such developments could calm markets and drive the VXVCLS below the 20.80 benchmark from October 30, 2023.

(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: Continued or increased market uncertainty related to the upcoming U.S. presidential election (November 2024) could maintain or elevate volatility levels. The "October effect," which historically shows higher volatility in this month, combined with election year patterns, could keep the VXVCLS above the benchmark of 20.80 from the previous year.

As a professional forecaster, I recognize that the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) and related measures like the 3-Month Volatility Index (VXVCLS) are key indicators of market sentiment and expected turbulence. Looking at the question of whether the VXVCLS will be higher year-over-year on October 30, 2024, I need to carefully consider current market conditions and historical patterns.

## Market Volatility Context

The VIX index, often called the "fear gauge," tends to be higher in election years with a peak typically occurring in October[2]. This seasonal pattern is referred to as the "October effect," which in 2024 – a presidential election year – could mean an explosive move in volatility[1]. The proximity of October 30, 2024, to the November presidential election is particularly significant, as uncertainty about election outcomes often translates to higher volatility in financial markets.

## Current Trends and Status

As of mid-October 2024, volatility indicators have been showing elevated levels. While the standard VIX has declined to around the 20 level[1], this still represents significant expected volatility in the market. The fact that we're in an election year, which is "anything but a typical year" according to market observers, supports the likelihood of sustained or increasing volatility as we approach Election Day[1].

## Historical Comparisons

Looking back at the benchmark from October 30, 2023, when the VXVCLS stood at 20.80, we need to consider that 2023 showed relatively low volatility levels. The VIX fell to levels not seen since the early days of the pandemic, hitting a 2023 low of 12.82 in September of that year[5]. By comparison, 2024 has experienced more market turbulence, with the relative stability of 2023 giving way to increased uncertainty.

## Factors Influencing Near-Term Volatility

Several factors suggest elevated volatility through late October 2024:

1. **Election Proximity**: With the presidential election just days away on November 5, market uncertainty typically peaks.

2. **Federal Reserve Policy**: The market has been fixated on Fed policy throughout 2024[4]. Any uncertainty about future rate cuts could maintain volatility levels.

3. **Seasonal Patterns**: The "October effect" often results in higher volatility during this month, a pattern that tends to be amplified during election years[1][2].

Given these considerations and the status quo of elevated volatility levels in 2024, the most likely outcome is that the VXVCLS will remain above its October 30, 2023 level of 20.80. While a sudden market calming could occur in the final days of October, this would be counter to both seasonal patterns and the typical election-year dynamics. The weight of evidence suggests continued elevated volatility through the election period.
