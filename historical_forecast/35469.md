(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known: Approximately 1 month (until April 1, 2025)

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed: Yes - Wilmore and Williams are currently scheduled to return to Earth in late March 2025 aboard a SpaceX Dragon spacecraft.

(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome: Further technical issues with the SpaceX Dragon spacecraft or delays in the Crew-10 mission launch/docking could push the return date beyond April 1, 2025. Weather or operational constraints at splashdown sites could also cause delays.

(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome: The current schedule holds, with Wilmore and Williams returning as planned in late March 2025 on the SpaceX Dragon with the Crew-9 mission.

Based on the information available as of May 6, 2025, Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams were originally scheduled to spend only about a week in space when they launched aboard Boeing's Starliner spacecraft in June 2024. However, due to technical problems with the Starliner, including issues with its propulsion system and helium leaks, NASA made the decision to return the Starliner to Earth without astronauts in early September 2024[1].

The two astronauts were integrated into the International Space Station crew and NASA announced they would continue their work as part of Expedition 71/72 through February 2025, with plans for them to return aboard a SpaceX Dragon spacecraft with Crew-9 mission members[1]. This represented a significant extension from their originally planned one-week mission to potentially over eight months in space.

In December 2024, further delays were announced, pushing their expected return to "late March 2025 or early April 2025"[4]. This timeline suggests they would be cutting it very close to the April 1, 2025 deadline specified in the question.

A January 2025 report indicated some political attention to the situation, with SpaceX founder Elon Musk claiming that then-President Trump had asked SpaceX to bring the astronauts home "as soon as possible"[2]. However, NASA leadership maintained that the astronauts were not "stranded" but rather that the decision not to use Starliner for their return was based on safety considerations.

Looking at the current date (May 6, 2025) and the information in the search results, I must acknowledge that we're now past the April 1, 2025 deadline. However, since the search results only go up to December 2024/January 2025 information, I don't have confirmation of whether they actually returned before April 1, 2025 or if there were further delays.

Based on the most recent information available, the status quo plan was for Wilmore and Williams to return in late March 2025, which would satisfy the criteria for a "Yes" outcome. While there was mention of the possibility of early April, the official schedule pointed to a March return.

Given the repeated delays they had already experienced and the complexity of space operations, there was a non-trivial chance of further delays pushing their return beyond April 1. However, with the high-level attention this situation was receiving (including from political leadership) and the fact that they had already been in space much longer than planned, there would have been significant pressure to adhere to the March timeline.

Considering all these factors, and giving weight to the status quo outcome (which was a planned March 2025 return), I would have assigned a high probability to their return before April 1, 2025.

Probability: 75%
