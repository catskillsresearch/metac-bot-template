(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  
The resolution depends on whether Andrew Cuomo appears as "running" on the NYT mayoral candidate tracker before April 1, 2025. As today is February 28, 2025, there is just over one month (about 32 days) until the final outcome is known.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
As of now, Andrew Cuomo has *not* declared his candidacy and is *not* listed as running on the NYT tracker. Therefore, if nothing changed, the outcome would be **No**.

(c) **Scenario for a No outcome:**  
Cuomo ultimately decides not to run, possibly due to family concerns, political calculations, or the weight of past controversies. He either publicly declines to enter the race or simply never files the necessary paperwork, and the NYT tracker never updates to list him as running before April 1, 2025.

(d) **Scenario for a Yes outcome:**  
Cuomo decides to run, holds the anticipated family meeting, receives the required support, files the necessary paperwork, gathers petition signatures, and makes his public candidacy announcement. The NYT tracker is updated before April 1, 2025, to list him as running for mayor.

## Rationale

- **Strong Evidence for Serious Consideration:**  
Andrew Cuomo is taking tangible steps consistent with a potential run: meeting with family to discuss the race, circulating campaign-style videos, and strategizing with key figures[1][3][4].
  
- **Polling and Political Environment:**  
He is viewed as the likely frontrunner in polls and commands a significant lead over other candidates. Incumbent Mayor Eric Adams faces legal troubles and declining political strength, making a Cuomo entry potentially attractive[1][2].

- **Unresolved Decision:**  
Despite the apparent momentum, as of the last update in February 2025, Cuomo is publicly "undecided" and has not announced a run[3][4]. He has missed no hard deadlines yet—the window for petitioning continues until April 3, 2025[1]—but no definitive step has been taken.

- **Forecaster’s Weighting:**  
Experienced forecasters recognize that, absent concrete action, the *status quo* (in which Cuomo does not run) is more likely, though the probability can shift quickly if new evidence emerges. Politicians often consider runs and float the idea publicly, but many ultimately choose not to enter for various reasons (personal, strategic, or unforeseen developments).

- **Key Timelines:**  
Cuomo’s decision is expected sometime in early March after his family meeting[1]. This makes a "Yes" outcome plausible—but until an official move is made and reflected on the NYT tracker, the more likely outcome remains "No".

**Probability: 60%**

This reflects that Cuomo is genuinely considering a run and conditions are favorable, but as of now, he remains officially undecided and unannounced. The probability is notably above 50%, but not overwhelming, reflecting substantial but not conclusive evidence that he will run. There is significant inertia and personal/political uncertainty that could keep him out. If he takes decisive action in early March, this probability would sharply increase; if more time passes with no announcement, it drops rapidly.
