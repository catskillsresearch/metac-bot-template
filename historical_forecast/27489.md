(a) **Time Left Until Outcome Known:**  
The official August 2024 core CPI data will be released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics on September 11, 2024, which is approximately three weeks from today.

(b) **Status Quo Outcome if Nothing Changed:**  
The most recent core CPI prints were 0.2% month-over-month in July 2024 and 0.1% in June 2024. The professional forecast consensus and nowcasting services project an average monthly increase of around 0.2% for Q3 2024[1][3][4]. If current trends persist, the most likely outcome is a 0.2% MoM increase for August.

(c) **Scenario for a No Outcome (MoM ≠ 0.1%):**  
Core CPI comes in above or below 0.1%, likely 0.2%, as implied by current consensus forecasts[1][3]. This outcome would result if shelter inflation remains sticky, and other core components (such as services and insurance) do not decelerate significantly. This would align with minor progress on disinflation, but not enough for the print to round down to 0.1%.

(d) **Scenario for a Yes Outcome (MoM = 0.1%):**  
The August core CPI rounds to 0.1% due to a weaker-than-expected rise in shelter costs and broader cooling in services, potentially reflecting softer demand amid rising recession concerns. For this to materialize, there would likely need to be a surprise drop in shelter and/or non-shelter core categories, accelerating the pace of disinflation compared to July[4].

## Rationale

Professional forecasts for Q3 2024 core CPI average to about 0.21% per month, which rounds to 0.2% under BLS conventions[1]. Recent months have shown progress on disinflation, but the main components (esp. shelter) are proving resilient, and typical volatility means that month-to-month prints rarely deviate far from the established trend. No major forecaster currently predicts a 0.1% MoM print for August. However, the previous two months included a 0.1% (June) and a 0.2% (July), suggesting the probability of a repeat 0.1% is not zero—especially if disinflation surprises.

Given these points, the status quo (0.2%) is the favored scenario. Nonetheless, continued moderation or a statistical quirk could produce a 0.1% result, but it is less likely than not based on the available data and trend.

**Probability: 25%**
