(a) Time until outcome: Approximately 50 days (from today, May 6, 2025, until January 5, 2025, when the question will be evaluated)

(b) Status quo outcome: Bitcoin dominance was at 60% as of October 31, 2024, and had reached a local peak of 60.0% on November 13, 2024, which is below the 63.0% threshold.

(c) Scenario for No outcome: Bitcoin's dominance remains below 63% as altcoins like Dogecoin, Raydium, and TRON outperform Bitcoin in November-December 2024. Investors rotate profits from Bitcoin into altcoins, reducing Bitcoin's relative market share. The peak of Bitcoin dominance for this cycle may have already occurred, with the trend now moving toward greater diversification in the crypto market.

(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: Strong institutional investment continues flowing into Bitcoin following Trump's re-election and his pro-crypto policies. The effects of the May 2024 halving continue to drive Bitcoin prices upward while supply remains constrained. Economic uncertainty drives investors toward Bitcoin as a store of value rather than riskier altcoins, pushing dominance above 63% in late November or December 2024.

Looking at the available data, Bitcoin dominance was on an upward trajectory in late 2024, reaching 60% by the end of October with a nearly 5% increase in the Bitcoin Dominance Rate during that month alone[4]. This strong momentum suggests continued growth was likely, but reaching 63% would require an additional 3 percentage point increase in a relatively short time.

Several factors supported increased Bitcoin dominance during this period. The approval of Bitcoin spot ETFs earlier in 2024 had led to significant capital inflows[5]. Donald Trump's re-election created expectations of pro-crypto policies, potentially driving further institutional adoption[3]. Additionally, the Bitcoin halving that occurred in May 2024 reduced new Bitcoin supply, which historically precedes price increases and could support higher dominance[5].

However, there were also counterbalancing forces. Several altcoins showed bullish formations that could potentially outperform Bitcoin in November 2024, particularly Dogecoin, Raydium, and TRON[4]. Some analysts had already suggested that Bitcoin dominance may have peaked for this cycle[1], which would imply a decline rather than further increases.

The historical patterns and cyclical nature of Bitcoin dominance suggested that if a peak were to occur in this cycle, November or December 2024 would be a likely timeframe[1]. This timing aligned with the typical post-halving price and dominance increases that Bitcoin has experienced in previous cycles.

Given that Bitcoin dominance had already reached 60% and showed strong momentum, but also considering the countervailing forces of altcoin competition and potential market rotation, I believe there was a significant but not overwhelming chance that Bitcoin dominance would exceed 63% on at least one day during November-December 2024.

Probability: 65%
