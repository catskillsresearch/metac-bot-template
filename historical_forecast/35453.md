As a professional forecaster, I'll approach this question methodically by analyzing the available data and providing a well-reasoned forecast for total likes on Bluesky on March 30, 2025.

(a) Time left until the outcome to the question is known:
The outcome will be known on March 30, 2025, which is approximately 32 days from the current date (May 6, 2025).

Wait, there appears to be an inconsistency with the dates. The query states today is May 6, 2025, but asks about forecasting March 30, 2025, which has already passed. I'll proceed assuming we need a retroactive analysis of what likely happened on March 30, 2025, given the data available up to February 2025.

(b) The outcome if nothing changed:
Based on the search results, as of April 2023, Bluesky had approximately 7.619 billion total likes across the platform[1]. This represents the cumulative total since the platform's inception, not daily activity. Without any changes in user behavior or growth patterns, we would expect daily likes to continue at their existing rate.

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued:
Bluesky experienced rapid user growth, reaching 30 million users by February 2025[4], up from 27.44 million in mid-January 2025[3]. This represents approximately 2.5-3 million new users per month. If this growth continued, Bluesky would have reached around 33-35 million users by March 30, 2025, potentially increasing daily like activity proportionally.

(d) The expectations of experts and markets:
The search results don't provide explicit expert predictions about like activity. However, there are indications that while Bluesky's growth remained strong through early 2025, some social media managers noticed engagement slowing down[5]. Compared to Threads' 275 million monthly active users, Bluesky's growth had begun to plateau[4].

(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome:
A sudden technical issue or outage on March 30, 2025, could significantly reduce platform activity. Alternatively, if a major competing platform launched a compelling new feature that day, it might draw users away temporarily, reducing engagement on Bluesky.

(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome:
A major news event or controversy on another platform (particularly X/Twitter) occurring on or just before March 30, 2025, could drive a sudden influx of users and engagement to Bluesky, similar to the post-election surge in November 2024. A high-profile celebrity or political figure migrating to Bluesky that weekend could also trigger unusually high engagement.

When forecasting daily likes for March 30, 2025, I need to consider:
- The platform had over 30 million users by March 2025
- Total cumulative likes were over 7.6 billion as of April 2023[1]
- March 30, 2025, was a Sunday, which typically has different usage patterns than weekdays
- The platform was well beyond its initial growth phase but still expanding steadily

Based on these considerations and accounting for the uncertainty inherent in forecasting social media engagement, here is my forecast for total likes made on Bluesky on March 30, 2025:

Percentile 10: 38 million
Percentile 20: 42 million
Percentile 40: 47 million
Percentile 60: 52 million
Percentile 80: 60 million
Percentile 90: 68 million
