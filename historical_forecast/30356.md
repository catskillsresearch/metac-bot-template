I'll approach this forecasting challenge systematically by analyzing the available data and considering various scenarios.

(a) Time until outcome is known: 40 days (from November 21, 2024, to January 1, 2025, when Metaculus will check the Dairy Recall Tracker)

(b) Status quo outcome: Based on the limited information available, there is insufficient data to establish a clear baseline for dairy recalls in December. The status quo appears to be relatively few recalls overall, with dairy recalls being a small subset of total food recalls.

(c) Scenario for No outcome: December 2024 experiences normal or below-average food safety issues in the dairy industry. Manufacturers maintain strict quality control procedures through the holiday season, and any potential contamination is caught before products reach the market. Any recalls that do occur are limited to a single incident or none at all.

(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: Heightened concerns about HPAI (bird flu) in dairy cattle lead to increased testing and monitoring, resulting in the detection of multiple contamination incidents. The holiday season production surge causes quality control lapses at multiple dairy facilities, leading to several recalls. Alternatively, a single widespread contamination issue affects products from multiple manufacturers, triggering separate recalls.

## Analysis of Available Evidence

The search results provide limited direct information about dairy recalls, particularly for forecasting December 2024. However, I can extract some relevant insights:

1. **Recent dairy recall example**: In September 2024, HP Hood recalled five SKUs of its 96oz Lactaid milk due to potential almond contamination[4]. This demonstrates that dairy recalls are still occurring in 2024.

2. **General recall information**: The FDA maintains a database of recalls, market withdrawals, and safety alerts[1], indicating an established system for monitoring and reporting food safety issues.

3. **No direct evidence of HPAI impact**: While the query mentions HPAI (bird flu) as potentially important for dairy recalls in 2024, the search results don't provide evidence of this connection.

4. **Limited seasonal data**: The search results don't provide information about seasonal patterns in dairy recalls that might help predict December specifically.

## Considering Base Rates and External Factors

Without specific data on dairy recalls by month, I need to consider broader factors:

1. **Holiday production**: December typically sees increased food production for holiday consumption, which could increase the risk of quality control issues.

2. **HPAI concerns**: The query indicates HPAI (bird flu) has taken on importance in 2024 for dairy recalls. If this virus is affecting dairy cattle, it could increase the likelihood of contaminated products and subsequent recalls.

3. **Recall threshold**: The question only requires more than one recall in December 2024, which is a relatively low threshold if there are any significant safety concerns.

4. **Surveillance systems**: Modern food safety systems include regular testing and monitoring, which could catch issues before they reach the market, potentially reducing recalls.

## Weighing the Status Quo

As a good forecaster, I should put extra weight on the status quo. While I don't have specific information on the typical number of dairy recalls in December, the overall food recall environment appears to be relatively controlled, with fewer than 100 annual USDA recalls in recent years.

The evidence of a recent dairy recall (Lactaid milk in September 2024) suggests that dairy recalls are occurring, but without knowing their frequency, it's difficult to determine if more than one in December is likely.

HPAI concerns could potentially increase the risk, but without firm evidence of its impact on dairy recalls, I shouldn't overweight this factor.

## Final Forecast

Given the limited information available, I need to balance:
- The relatively low threshold (more than one recall)
- The recent evidence of at least some dairy recalls occurring
- The potential risk factors (holiday production, HPAI concerns)
- The absence of clear baseline data for dairy recalls by month

While there's uncertainty, the combination of increased holiday production, ongoing safety concerns like HPAI, and the low threshold of "more than one" recall suggests a moderate probability of the condition being met.

Probability: 40%
