I'll approach this forecasting question by analyzing the available data and considering possible scenarios.

(a) Time left until outcome: The outcome will be known after November 2024 ends, which is approximately 6 months from now (May 2025 to November 2024).

(b) Status quo outcome: Based on historical patterns, President Biden issued 24 executive orders in 2023 and 29 in 2022, averaging about 2-2.5 per month[1][3]. If this pattern continues, we would expect approximately 2-3 executive orders in November 2024, which would make "Yes" the status quo outcome.

(c) Scenario for a No outcome: If fewer than 3 executive orders are issued in November 2024, perhaps due to reduced policy initiatives as the administration transitions, or if focus shifts to other priorities following the election cycle, we would see a "No" outcome. The administration might also delay some executive orders until December or early 2025.

(d) Scenario for a Yes outcome: If 3 or more executive orders are issued in November 2024, which aligns with historical monthly averages, we would see a "Yes" outcome. This could happen if there are pressing policy matters requiring immediate executive action, particularly following the election results, or if there's a backlog of prepared executive orders waiting to be signed.

Now for my rationale:

Looking at the historical data, President Biden issued 24 executive orders in 2023 and 29 in 2022[1][3]. This gives us a monthly average of about 2-2.5 executive orders. While monthly distribution can vary, this suggests that 3 or more executive orders in a month is certainly possible and has precedent.

The most recent data we have is from October 2024, which shows a continuation of a national emergency with respect to Sudan, though this was not a new executive order[5]. Without specific information about planned executive orders for November 2024, I need to rely on historical patterns.

In 2021, Biden issued 77 executive orders, which is significantly higher than subsequent years[2]. This was likely due to the first-year agenda setting of a new administration. The rate has stabilized in 2022 and 2023 to around 24-29 per year.

I also need to consider potential political factors. November 2024 follows the presidential election, which could influence executive order activity. If Biden is in a lame-duck period, there might be increased incentive to secure policy priorities through executive action before leaving office. Conversely, there might be reduced activity during a transition period.

Given the historical average of approximately 2-2.5 executive orders per month, there's a reasonable chance that November 2024 could see 3 or more executive orders. However, I need to be cautious about assuming this will definitely occur, as monthly variations exist and specific circumstances for November 2024 are unknown.

Probability: 65%
