(a) **Time left until outcome known:**  
As of July 10, 2024, there are 11 days remaining until the winner of the 2024 Tour de France is officially determined. The race concludes on July 21, 2024.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
Historically, Jonas Vingegaard is the two-time defending champion and one of the sport’s top general classification riders. However, entering 2024, he is recovering from significant injuries sustained earlier in the season, and his team support has diminished due to key departures. The status quo—assuming current health and form persist—suggests he may not be at full strength, and several experts expect him to fall short of a third consecutive win[4][5].

(c) **Scenario for a No outcome:**  
Vingegaard’s recovery from his crash is incomplete or he lacks peak form, causing him to lose time on key stages—especially against top rivals like Tadej Pogačar, who enters the race in strong condition. Coupled with reduced team support, Vingegaard is unable to defend attacks in the high mountains or during the crucial final time trial, ultimately failing to secure the yellow jersey[4][5].

(d) **Scenario for a Yes outcome:**  
Vingegaard demonstrates an exceptional recovery and regains his best form during the Tour. He withstands early challenges, benefits from key teammates like Sepp Kuss, and outclimbs or outlasts rivals such as Pogačar, Roglič, and Evenepoel. He maintains his advantage through the tough mountain stages and the final challenging time trial, securing overall victory[4][3].

## Rationale

Given Vingegaard’s track record and talent, he warrants status as a leading contender. However, the 2024 edition presents unusually stiff competition and unique challenges:
- Injury recovery introduces significant uncertainty about his physical readiness and resilience over three weeks[4].
- Team Visma-Lease a Bike has lost influential support riders, making it harder to control the race and protect Vingegaard in critical moments[5].
- Rivals, particularly Pogačar, arrive in better form and with more robust teams, motivated to avenge recent defeats[3][5].

Most expert commentary leans against Vingegaard winning this edition, citing his circumstances and the increased strength of his opponents. Nevertheless, his proven ability and potential for surprise cannot be discounted—if he is healthier than anticipated, he could still challenge for the win[4]. Good forecasting practice gives greater weight to the current trajectory and risks, rather than betting on full recovery and exceptional circumstances.
