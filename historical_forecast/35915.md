(a) **Time Left Until Outcome Is Known**

Metaculus will verify the leaderboard status on or after April 1, 2025. Given today’s date is March 12, 2025, there are approximately 20 days remaining until the question’s resolution.

(b) **Status Quo Outcome if Nothing Changed**

As of early March 2025, the highest-ranked Grok model (“Grok-2-08-13”) is not within the top positions and was last noted at #8 on December 25, 2024. The leaderboard is currently topped by DeepSeek-V3-0324 (#1) and Alibaba’s Qwen3-235B-A22B (#3), with no Grok model in the top three[1][2]. If current trends persist and no major breakthroughs for Grok are announced or observed, the outcome is “No”—a Grok model will not be ranked #1 overall at the end of Q1 2025[1][2].

(c) **Scenario for a No Outcome**

The ranking remains unchanged or only sees minor fluctuation; Grok models do not leapfrog to the top spot. DeepSeek, Qwen, or other leading models maintain their dominance due to established performance and continued user voting. There are no major Grok updates, releases, or community pushes that would catapult it to #1 before April 1, 2025[1][2][3].

(d) **Scenario for a Yes Outcome**

A “Yes” scenario would require either:
- A new, substantially improved Grok model is released and quickly gains traction, collecting enough positive pairwise votes on the Chatbot Arena to overtake all existing models.
- A sudden, large shift in community user behavior significantly boosts an existing Grok model’s win rate.
- A rating anomaly, bug, or unexpected external event disrupts the current order and places a Grok model at #1 when the leaderboard is checked[1][2]. There is currently no evidence to suggest any of these are imminent.

## Rationale

The Chatbot Arena leaderboard is characterized by stability at the top, with dominant models (currently DeepSeek and Qwen) maintaining high Elo thanks to both strong technical performance and large-scale crowd voting[1][2][3]. Movement into the #1 spot generally requires either a paradigm-shifting model release or a large public campaign, neither of which is evident for Grok as of March 2025. The Elo system and pairwise voting, while inherently dynamic, have not historically allowed for rapid, surprise shifts without significant underlying changes[1][2].

No recent news, leaks, or industry hints suggest that xAI is poised to launch a breakthrough Grok model that could climb six or more ranks in under a month. While sudden upsets are theoretically possible, the status quo is the high-probability path in competitive LLM rankings due to the slow nature of major technical advancements and the large base of user-generated rankings.

## Final Answer

Probability: 3%
