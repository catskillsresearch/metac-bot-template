(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
There are 21 days remaining until the outcome is determined on October 1, 2024.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
As of September 9, 2024, the Yankees and Orioles are tied with 82 wins each. If both teams continued to perform at exactly the same rate and finish with a tie, the question would resolve as **No**, since a tie is explicitly a "No" outcome.

(c) **Scenario leading to a No outcome:**  
A No outcome results if, between now and the end of the 2024 regular season, the Yankees and Orioles finish with the same number of wins—or if the Orioles finish with more wins than the Yankees.

(d) **Scenario leading to a Yes outcome:**  
A Yes outcome occurs if the Yankees finish the regular season with more wins than the Orioles according to the official MLB standings as of October 1, 2024.

## Rationale

Both teams are tied at 82 wins with roughly three weeks and around 20 games left to play. Recent results show neither team is playing dominant baseball: the Yankees have gone 6-13 and the Orioles 8-12 in their last 19 and 20 games, respectively. Their schedules, injury statuses, and forms are comparably uncertain[5].

Historical data indicates the Orioles have a slight edge in head-to-head matchups over the last three seasons (15-11), though the Yankees have recently closed gaps with key wins[1].

Given the even status, a high probability exists for either a tie or a very narrow margin separating the two teams. Since the most common outcome in highly competitive and evenly matched races is often continuation of the status quo (i.e., neither team pulling substantially ahead), and because a tie explicitly resolves to No, this slightly tips the odds against the Yankees finishing with more wins. However, the result is very close to a coin flip, with only a small edge to “No” due to the role of ties and the Orioles’ slight recent head-to-head and form advantage.
