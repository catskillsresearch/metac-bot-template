(a) Time left until outcome is known:  
5 days (from January 27, 2025, to February 1, 2025)

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed:  
0.5968085 (the highest average win rate as of January 25, 2025, by gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-exp-01-21)

(c) Outcome if the current trend continued:  
Over the past several months, top win rates have increased only gradually and have not exceeded 0.60. If this slow, incremental trend persists and no major model leap occurs, the highest win rate will likely remain just under or around 0.60, plausibly in a tight range such as 0.597 to 0.599[2][3].

(d) Expectations of experts and markets:  
Forecasters, traders, and technical analysts expect stability unless a disruptive model launches. There is no public indication that OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, or Meta will release a breakthrough model in the next week. Expert and market consensus points toward a continued status quo, with the top leaderboard win rate likely holding near 0.597[2][3][5].

(e) Unexpected scenario resulting in a low outcome:  
A major leaderboard methodology change, unexpected data corruption, or a newly discovered security flaw could temporarily suppress all win rates on the leaderboard, potentially resulting in a sharp drop well below current figures—though such a scenario is seen as unlikely given current governance and recent integrity upgrades[1].

(f) Unexpected scenario resulting in a high outcome:  
The sudden release and rapid leaderboard addition of a dramatically superior model (for example, "GPT-5", "Claude-Next", or an unexpected leap from Google or Meta) could push the top win rate modestly above 0.60. A disruptive model with clear, consensus-breaking human preference performance could see the displayed win rate briefly reach 0.61 or even 0.62, though the leaderboard’s conservative aggregation means such moves tend to be gradual[2][3][5].
