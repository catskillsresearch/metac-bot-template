I'll analyze the question of whether Eric Adams will be Mayor of New York City on April 1, 2025.

(a) Time left until outcome: Approximately 10 months and 25 days from today (May 6, 2025) until April 1, 2025.

(b) Status quo outcome: If nothing changes, Eric Adams remains Mayor of New York City on April 1, 2025.

(c) Scenario for No outcome: Adams resigns before April 1, 2025, due to mounting pressure from his federal corruption charges, particularly as his trial is set to begin on April 21, 2025. The proximity of the trial and potential political damage leads him to step down to focus on his legal defense.

(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: Adams continues to maintain his innocence, refuses to resign despite the pending trial, and remains in office through April 1, 2025, waiting for the trial to play out while continuing his mayoral duties.

## Analyzing the Likelihood

Based on the search results, Eric Adams is currently facing federal corruption charges with a trial date set for April 21, 2025[1][2]. This is a critical factor in this forecast, as the trial begins just three weeks after the date in question (April 1, 2025).

Several key considerations impact this forecast:

**Current Status and Statements**
Adams has pleaded not guilty to all charges and has explicitly stated that he has "no plans to resign"[4]. His legal team has been actively fighting to eliminate key charges, including a bribery charge[3], suggesting he intends to fight the case rather than step down.

**Trial Timing and Political Implications**
The April 21, 2025 trial date was actually a disappointment to Adams' defense team, who argued for an earlier trial date that would conclude before early April 2025[1]. His attorneys specifically stated concerns about the election cycle, noting "There is a point in early April when people know who is on the ballot... He's either running with this hanging over his head or he's running with this over"[2]. This indicates Adams is planning to remain in office at least through early April and potentially run for reelection.

**Administrative Impact**
Following Adams' indictment, there has already been a "flurry of federal activity" with many top officials within his administration either retiring or resigning[4]. This administrative instability could either pressure Adams to resign or, conversely, strengthen his resolve to maintain leadership continuity.

**Historical Patterns**
Looking at the status quo, it's important to note that Adams has maintained his position despite the indictment thus far and has explicitly stated he "can continue to lead the city effectively while fighting the charges"[3]. This demonstrated resilience suggests he may well continue in office through April 1, 2025.

## Weighing Probabilities

The key tension in this forecast is between Adams' stated intention to remain in office and the potential pressure that may build as his trial date approaches. The fact that his defense team specifically argued for a trial date before early April suggests they anticipated he would still be in office at that time.

Given the status quo bias (Adams is currently mayor and has stated he won't resign) and the timing of events (trial begins after April 1), it seems more likely than not that Adams will still be mayor on April 1, 2025. However, there remains significant uncertainty given the seriousness of federal corruption charges and the potential for political pressure to build.

Probability: 75%
