(a) Time left until outcome: 33 days (from July 29, 2024 to August 31, 2024)

(b) Status quo outcome: Gabriel Attal, who is from Macron's Together alliance, resigned on July 16, 2024, but he and his cabinet remain in place in a caretaker capacity until a new government is formed.

(c) No outcome scenario: President Macron, facing pressure from the New Popular Front (NFP) which won the most seats (182) in the recent elections, eventually appoints a Prime Minister from the left-wing coalition to reflect the election results and secure parliamentary support. The NFP resolves its internal disagreements and presents a unified candidate whom Macron reluctantly accepts.

(d) Yes outcome scenario: Macron uses his constitutional prerogative to reappoint someone from his Together alliance (perhaps Attal himself or another figure) as Prime Minister, arguing that a centrist government is needed to maintain stability, especially through the Olympics. The fragmented parliament fails to unite against this appointment, allowing a Together alliance member to remain in office.

Based on the available information, I need to assess the likelihood that the Prime Minister of France on August 31, 2024, will belong to Macron's Together coalition.

The resignation of Gabriel Attal on July 16, 2024, followed the legislative elections where Macron's alliance lost its position as the largest bloc in the National Assembly. While Attal remains in a caretaker role during the Olympic Games, a new government will need to be formed.

The election results created a challenging political landscape with three main blocs: the left-wing New Popular Front (182 seats), Macron's centrist Together alliance (168 seats), and the far-right National Rally (143 seats). No group has achieved the 289-seat majority needed to govern independently.

Several key factors influence this forecast:

First, while President Macron has the constitutional authority to appoint any Prime Minister, political reality constrains his choices. Any government must survive potential no-confidence votes in the National Assembly.

Second, the New Popular Front won the most seats and traditionally in France, the President appoints a Prime Minister who can command parliamentary support. However, the NFP has struggled to present a unified candidate, which complicates Macron's decision.

Third, Macron may be reluctant to appoint a Prime Minister from a coalition ideologically distant from his own, potentially leading him to prefer someone from his alliance despite the electoral setback.

Fourth, there's precedent for minority governments in France, but they typically face significant challenges in implementing policy.

The current situation remains fluid, with Attal's caretaker government remaining in place specifically to manage the Olympic Games period (July 26 - August 11, 2024). This suggests that major governmental decisions may be deferred until after the Olympics conclude.

Given that the NFP emerged with the most seats but lacks an outright majority, and considering Macron's preference for centrist governance, I believe there's a higher probability that Macron will eventually appoint a Prime Minister from outside his alliance to reflect the election results and secure parliamentary stability.

However, the status quo (Attal remaining in a caretaker capacity) could persist longer than expected if coalition negotiations remain deadlocked, especially with attention focused on the Olympics until mid-August. This would technically result in a "Yes" outcome if no new appointment is made by August 31.

Weighing these factors and giving appropriate weight to the status quo bias (that Attal or another Together member might remain in place through August 31), but also acknowledging the significant political pressure for change following the election results:

Probability: 40%
