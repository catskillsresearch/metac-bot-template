Based on the information available from the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), I'll analyze whether Russia will start a second formal mobilization wave before October 1, 2024.

(a) Time left until outcome is known: Less than 5 months (from May 6, 2025 to October 1, 2024 - this question is actually past its resolution date since we're in May 2025)

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: No formal second mobilization wave, continued reliance on crypto-mobilization

(c) Scenario for No outcome: Russia continues its current crypto-mobilization strategy, which has proven sufficient to generate needed troops without the political risks of formal mobilization, while maintaining its offensive operations through summer 2024.

(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: Russian casualty rates become unsustainable through crypto-mobilization alone, forcing Putin to announce a formal mobilization despite political costs, in order to meet aggressive military objectives in Ukraine and maintain offensive momentum.

## Analysis of Russia's Force Generation Strategy

Russia has been relying heavily on "crypto-mobilization" rather than formal mobilization to sustain its operations in Ukraine. According to ISW reporting, Russia's ongoing crypto-mobilization efforts have proven capable of sustaining Russia's current offensive efforts in Ukraine despite heavy losses and could potentially support the formation of limited operational reserves[4]. This approach allows Russia to backfill losses without taking significant operational pauses between offensive efforts.

In early May 2024, Ukrainian officials noted that Russian forces intended to generate approximately 100,000 additional personnel for offensive operations in June and July, with plans to recruit 300,000 more personnel by the end of 2024[5]. However, ISW assessed that Russia would likely fall short of these immediate and near-term goals, even when considering the upper limits of reported monthly Russian force generation[5].

## Current Military Situation and Casualty Rates

Russian forces have been sustaining higher casualty rates per square kilometer gained compared to Fall 2024[1]. Despite these significant losses, Russia has maintained the tempo of offensive operations by rapidly deploying forces to frontline units. This approach suggests a strategic commitment to maintaining battlefield pressure regardless of the cost.

ISW has not explicitly stated that Russia would need to initiate a formal second mobilization to sustain its current operations. Instead, they note that the likely resumption of US security assistance to Ukraine would represent a critical turning point[3], potentially affecting Russia's calculus regarding force generation.

## Equipment and Production Limitations

Russia's ability to equip newly mobilized forces would be a significant consideration in any decision about formal mobilization. ISW has noted that continued labor shortages will place limits on Russia's ability to further mobilize its defense industrial base in the near-to-medium term[5]. This constraint would likely influence any decision about initiating a large-scale formal mobilization.

## Political Considerations

While the search results don't explicitly address the political sensitivity of a second formal mobilization, they do suggest that Russia is attempting to achieve its military objectives through alternative means. The Russian objective of pushing Ukrainian forces back from the Belgorod Oblast border and approaching within artillery range of Kharkiv City[2] represents a significant but geographically limited goal that might be achievable without formal mobilization.

## Status Quo Weight and Final Assessment

The available evidence strongly suggests that Russia has been prioritizing crypto-mobilization over formal mobilization to meet its personnel needs. ISW's assessments indicate that while these efforts may not fully meet Russia's ambitious recruitment targets, they appear sufficient to sustain current operations and planned offensive efforts through summer 2024.

Given that:
1. Russia's crypto-mobilization has been sustaining operations despite heavy losses[4]
2. There is no explicit indication from ISW that Russia is planning or needs a formal second mobilization
3. The operational goals appear focused on limited territorial gains rather than massive offensives requiring substantially larger forces[2]
4. Russia faces limitations in its defense industrial capacity that would constrain its ability to equip a large number of newly mobilized troops[5]

Considering the status quo and available information from ISW, it appears highly unlikely that Russia would initiate a formal second mobilization before October 1, 2024.

Probability: 15%
