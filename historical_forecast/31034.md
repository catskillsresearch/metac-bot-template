As a professional forecaster, I'll analyze whether US airline passenger volume for the week of Christmas through New Year's Eve 2024 will exceed 19 million according to TSA data.

(a) Time until outcome: The outcome will be known on January 2, 2025, which is about 7 months from now, based on TSA reporting of December 31, 2024, passenger numbers.

(b) Status quo outcome: The 2023 total for December 25-31 was approximately 17.31 million passengers. Without any changes, we would expect a similar number.

(c) No outcome scenario: Economic concerns dampen travel enthusiasm despite earlier growth trends. The October 2024 slowdown (-1.4% year-over-year) continues or worsens through year-end, resulting in passenger volumes similar to or slightly above 2023 levels but still below 19 million.

(d) Yes outcome scenario: The strong travel growth seen throughout 2024 continues through the holiday period. The TSA's preparation for record passenger volumes materializes with the projected 6% increase extending to year-end travel, pushing the Christmas week totals well above 19 million.

## Analysis of Recent Travel Trends

The TSA and travel industry data show a clear trend of record-breaking travel in 2024. The TSA recently announced it's preparing for the busiest Thanksgiving travel period on record, projecting 18.3 million people will be screened from November 26 to December 2, 2024, representing a 6% increase from 2023[3]. Furthermore, passenger volumes have reached record highs in 2024, with an increase of 17% since 2022[3].

For the year-end holiday period, AAA projects 119.3 million people will travel 50 miles or more from home between December 21 and January 1, 2025, narrowly surpassing the previous record set in 2019[2]. Specifically for air travel, AAA expects 7.85 million passengers during this period, exceeding the previous record of 7.5 million[2].

## Factors Affecting Holiday Travel Volume

Several factors support the possibility of exceeding 19 million passengers:

**Calendar Configuration**: Christmas Day falls on a Wednesday in 2024, which AAA suggests will spread travel over two weekends (before and after the holiday), potentially increasing overall travel numbers[2]. This spread may result in more evenly distributed but higher cumulative passenger counts.

**TSA Preparation and Expectations**: The TSA is preparing for significantly higher travel volumes. For the Colorado Springs International Airport alone, they anticipate screening more than 100,000 people during the end-of-year holiday period, with the busiest days expected to be December 19, 20, and 26[5]. Nationwide, TSA anticipates screening more than 39 million people during the official holiday season (December 19, 2024, through January 2, 2025)[5].

**Historical Growth Patterns**: Based on TSA's published data for 2023, the seven-day total for December 25-31 was approximately 17.31 million passengers. To exceed 19 million, a 9.8% increase would be needed. While this exceeds the 6% growth projected for Thanksgiving travel, the overall 2024 trend of record-breaking travel suggests this is possible.

## Challenges and Limitations

Despite the positive indicators, there are reasons to be cautious:

**Slowing Growth**: As noted in the question background, year-over-year growth had slowed by October 2024, with numbers relatively flat compared to 2023. This could indicate a moderation in travel enthusiasm.

**Required Growth Rate**: The needed 9.8% growth rate to exceed 19 million is higher than the 6% growth projected for Thanksgiving. While not impossible, this represents a significant acceleration from recent trends.

**Economic Factors**: While not explicitly mentioned in the search results, economic conditions such as inflation and consumer confidence will play a role in travel decisions.

## Probability Assessment

Considering the status quo baseline (17.31 million in 2023) and the strong growth indicators throughout 2024, I believe there's a meaningful possibility of exceeding 19 million passengers. The TSA's preparation for record volumes and AAA's projection of record year-end travel support this view.

However, I must balance this against the October slowdown and the relatively high growth rate required. The status quo suggests we should expect numbers closer to 17-18 million unless substantial growth factors materialize.

Given the TSA's preparations for significantly higher volumes (39+ million over the broader holiday period) and the consistent pattern of record-breaking travel in 2024, I believe there's a reasonable but not overwhelming chance of exceeding 19 million.

Probability: 65%
