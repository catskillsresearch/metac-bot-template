(a) Time left until outcome: The question asks whether the UK will abolish the two-child benefit cap before October 1, 2024. Today's date is May 6, 2025, which means the outcome is already known, as the deadline has passed.

(b) Status quo outcome: The status quo would have been that the two-child benefit cap remained in place, as it was implemented in 2017 and had not been abolished as of July 2024 (based on the search results).

(c) Scenario for No outcome: The Labour government under Keir Starmer continues to prioritize fiscal responsibility and does not introduce legislation to abolish the two-child limit before October 1, 2024, despite pressure from anti-poverty organizations and some Labour MPs. The government might cite budget constraints or focus on developing a comprehensive child poverty strategy rather than taking immediate action on this specific policy.

(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: Facing mounting pressure from within the party and anti-poverty campaigners, the Labour government changes course and introduces emergency legislation to abolish the two-child limit before October 1, 2024. This could be triggered by new economic data showing worse-than-expected child poverty rates or a shift in public opinion that makes the policy politically untenable.

## Rationale

Based on the information available as of July 31, 2024, there were significant indicators pointing to the two-child benefit cap remaining in place beyond October 1, 2024:

First, the Labour government under Keir Starmer had explicitly stated it would not abolish the two-child limit, despite previously opposing it in earlier elections. According to the search results, Keir Starmer stated in July 2023 that Labour would not include a reversal of the policy in its election platform[3]. This represented a clear policy position that was unlikely to change in the short term.

Second, there was significant political cost associated with changing course. The search results indicate that Labour had suspended seven MPs who defied the party line by voting against the government on this issue, demonstrating the leadership's commitment to maintaining their position[5]. Such disciplinary action suggests the government was firmly against changing the policy.

Third, public opinion provided little political incentive for rapid action. According to the query background, 60% of the general public, including 50% of Labour supporters, opposed lifting the cap. Politicians typically avoid making unpopular policy changes, especially early in their term.

Fourth, the financial implications were substantial. Abolishing the two-child limit would have cost the government approximately Â£1.7-2.5 billion per year[1][2]. With a new government likely focused on fiscal responsibility and inheriting existing budget constraints, immediate major spending commitments would have been challenging.

Fifth, as of July 2024, there was no evidence of any legislative process underway that would result in the cap being abolished by October 1, 2024. The search results show an Early Day Motion from July 17, 2024, calling on the government to scrap the policy[5], but Early Day Motions rarely lead to immediate legislative action.

The status quo typically has strong inertia in policy matters, particularly for controversial policies with significant fiscal implications. While there was clearly growing pressure to abolish the policy from various organizations and some politicians, the official government position, public opinion, and financial constraints all pointed toward the policy remaining in place beyond October 1, 2024.

Given that we're now past the resolution date, and considering all the evidence available up to July 31, 2024, it was highly unlikely that the UK government would have abolished the two-child benefit cap before October 1, 2024.
