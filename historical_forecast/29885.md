(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  
From November 11, 2024, there are just under two months—specifically about 50 days—until December 31, 2024, when the number of Texas residents in drought will be observed by Metaculus.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
As of September 2024, approximately 40% of the Southern Plains region is in drought[3]. With Texas’s population around 30 million, if 40% of the state were in drought, that would correspond to roughly 12 million people—below the 15.0 million threshold. Current data from spring and summer 2024 also suggests drought coverage has fluctuated in the 23–45% range earlier in the year, generally translating to between 7 and 13.5 million affected[5]. Thus, if current trends hold steady, the outcome would likely be **No**: fewer than 15.0 million Texans in drought.

(c) **Scenario for a No outcome:**  
Drought coverage remains at or below current levels (about 30–40% of the state), with no significant deterioration through late 2024. Typical weather patterns persist, with no major drying trends or large expansions of drought into the populous eastern urban corridors (Dallas, Houston, Austin, San Antonio). Rain events or Gulf storms mitigate expansion. In this case, the population living in drought remains well under 15.0 million.

(d) **Scenario for a Yes outcome:**  
A strong late-year drying trend, driven by below-normal precipitation as forecasted for Gulf Coast Texas[1], causes drought conditions to expand rapidly through November and December. If drought expands into the heavily populated eastern Texas cities and the I-35 corridor, coverage could quickly rise over 50%, putting more than 15 million people in drought. This would require both geographic expansion and the inclusion of high-population-density regions in affected areas.

## Rationale

The status quo as of fall 2024 has a substantial portion of Texas in drought but remains below the 15.0 million threshold if translated directly from percentage-of-area to population[3][5]. Forecasts from NOAA and climate experts project drier-than-normal conditions for Texas through winter, with drought likely to persist or worsen, especially in the west, southwest, and Gulf Coast[1][2]. However, these forecasts do not specifically predict a sudden expansion into the most densely populated areas.

Texas’s population is not evenly distributed. The bulk of the state’s population lives in cities in the east and along the I-35 corridor. Unless drought coverage expands into these urban regions, hitting 15.0 million will be difficult even with worsening conditions in rural and western Texas.

Good forecasters assign significant weight to the status quo, recognizing that while rapid changes can occur, large-scale expansions into new regions require both adverse weather *and* unfortunate timing. There is a real risk for expansion due to the expected dry winter, but unless a pronounced shift occurs and encompasses major cities, the threshold is unlikely to be breached.

**Probability: 35%**  
(There is a meaningful risk of expansion, but the default expectation—based on current coverage and normal late-year variability—keeps the probability below even odds.)
