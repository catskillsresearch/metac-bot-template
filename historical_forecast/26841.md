(a) Time left until outcome: 55 days (from May 6, 2025 to October 1, 2024)
(b) Status quo outcome: If nothing changes, Spirit Airlines continues operating with severe financial difficulties but does not file for bankruptcy before October 1, 2024.
(c) No outcome scenario: Spirit Airlines secures emergency financing or implements drastic cost-cutting measures that allow it to extend its runway beyond October 1, 2024, despite ongoing losses.
(d) Yes outcome scenario: Spirit Airlines' financial condition deteriorates further, creditors become unwilling to provide additional support, and management determines a Chapter 11 filing is necessary to restructure operations and debt before October 1, 2024.

Based on the provided information, I need to assess the likelihood of Spirit Airlines filing for bankruptcy before October 1, 2024. This requires careful analysis of the company's financial condition and trends.

Spirit Airlines is facing severe financial distress according to multiple indicators. Fitch downgraded the airline to 'CCC' on May 7, 2024, indicating substantial credit risk[1]. The company reported significant losses of $214 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 and $495 million for the entire year[3]. These losses represent a continuation of financial struggles that have persisted since the COVID-19 pandemic began.

The airline's financial outlook is particularly concerning following the blocked merger with JetBlue. This merger was likely viewed as a potential lifeline for Spirit, and its failure has led to a dramatic decline in the company's stock price, which dropped from a 52-week high of $19.69 to $4.85 by March 8, 2024[3]. This represents a loss of approximately two-thirds of its value after the merger was blocked by federal regulators.

Credit rating agencies have explicitly highlighted bankruptcy concerns. Rapid Ratings has warned that Spirit has a "high default risk" and has advised vendors to "begin risk mitigation"[3]. Their assessment states that if current trends continue, "it would be logical to expect that Spirit Airlines Inc. will face serious default risk this coming year"[3]. Bloomberg has reported that Spirit's creditors are already preparing for a possible bankruptcy filing[3].

However, there are several factors that might delay a bankruptcy filing until after October 1, 2024:

1. Companies often try to exhaust all other options before filing for bankruptcy protection.
2. Spirit received a $69 million termination fee from JetBlue after the merger failed[4], which could provide some short-term liquidity.
3. Management may be pursuing alternative financing arrangements or strategic options that are not yet public.
4. Bankruptcy filings often take time to prepare, and the company might attempt to negotiate with creditors through the remainder of 2024.

Fitch's assessment that Spirit's financial metrics will remain problematic "at least through 2024 and likely 2025"[1] suggests the company might survive until the end of 2024 before a potential filing becomes necessary.

The company's announcement that it is proceeding with a "standalone recapitalization"[2] indicates that management is actively seeking alternatives to bankruptcy. However, the details and timeline of this recapitalization effort are unclear from the available information.

Considering the status quo bias and the fact that companies typically exhaust all alternatives before filing for bankruptcy, I believe there is a significant but not overwhelming chance that Spirit will file for bankruptcy before October 1, 2024.

Probability: 65%
