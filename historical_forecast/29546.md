(a) Time left until outcome: The outcome will be known shortly after the November 5, 2024 general election, which is tomorrow.

(b) Status quo outcome: The status quo would be a "No" outcome, as Oregon has historically rejected sales tax measures, with voters turning down similar proposals 10 times since 1910, typically with over 70% opposition.

(c) Scenario for "No" outcome: Oregon voters maintain their historical resistance to new broad-based taxes. Business groups strongly oppose the measure while even progressive organizations that typically support higher corporate taxes express concerns about the measure's design flaws. The complexity of the measure and its potential unintended consequences lead to its rejection at the ballot box.

(d) Scenario for "Yes" outcome: Despite historical resistance, voters are persuaded by the direct financial benefit of receiving approximately $1,600 annually. Economic anxiety and increasing cost of living pressures lead voters to support the measure despite opposition from various groups. The argument that it affects less than 2% of businesses while benefiting all Oregonians resonates with voters.

Based on the available information, I am forecasting that Oregon Measure 118 will not be approved by voters in the November 2024 election. This assessment is based on several key factors:

First and most significantly, Oregon has a strong historical pattern of rejecting sales tax measures. Since 1910, Oregonians have voted down sales tax proposals 10 times, with opposition rarely dropping below 70%[2]. While Measure 118 is technically structured as a corporate tax, it functions similarly to a gross receipts tax, which many economists and policy analysts view as a form of sales tax.

The measure proposes a 3% tax on businesses with Oregon sales exceeding $25 million, with the revenue (estimated at $6.5 billion annually) to be distributed equally among Oregon residents as a universal basic income of approximately $1,600 per person[3]. While this direct payment might appeal to voters, the structure of the tax has drawn criticism from multiple angles.

Notably, Measure 118 has created unusual political alignments, with opposition coming from both business groups and progressive organizations that typically support higher corporate taxes and basic income policies[3]. This broad opposition suggests fundamental concerns about the measure's design rather than merely ideological objections.

The measure is described as "the most divisive measure on the Oregon ballot" in 2024[3], indicating significant controversy and potential voter hesitation. When ballot measures face substantial criticism from diverse perspectives, they typically struggle to gain majority support.

Additionally, the complexity of the measure may work against it. Voters often reject proposals they find difficult to understand or that seem to have uncertain consequences. The Legislative Revenue Office analysis suggests significant implementation challenges and potential unintended economic effects[1].

While the promise of direct payments could be appealing in theory, Oregon's consistent rejection of new broad-based taxes suggests deeply ingrained voter resistance that would be difficult to overcome. The status quo bias in voter behavior further reinforces the likelihood of rejection.

As of my knowledge cutoff, there is no clear polling data indicating strong support for the measure. Without evidence of a significant shift in public opinion, the historical pattern of rejection remains the most reliable predictor of voter behavior.

Probability: 15%
