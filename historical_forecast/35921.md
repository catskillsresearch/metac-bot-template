(a) Time until outcome: 19 days (from March 13, 2025 to April 1, 2025)

(b) Status quo outcome: Based on the available data, we can see Albanese's approval ratings improving from January lows, with YouGov showing improved satisfaction levels by mid-March. However, we lack direct comparative data between Albanese and Trump from Morning Consult, which will be the resolution source.

(c) Scenario for No outcome: Trump's approval ratings could surge due to domestic policy successes or international developments that strengthen his position. Alternatively, Albanese could face new political challenges or scandals in the lead-up to the Australian federal election, causing his recently improving ratings to decline sharply before April 1.

(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: Albanese's positive trajectory continues as he positions himself against Trump's unpopular international policies, particularly regarding Ukraine and tariffs. The March 25 budget could be well-received, further boosting his approval, while Trump's contentious policies continue to draw international criticism.

Looking at the polling data available through March 13, 2025, we can see a clear trajectory for Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's approval ratings. In January 2025, Albanese recorded his worst-ever approval ratings with Newspoll showing only 37% satisfied with his performance and 57% dissatisfied, resulting in a net approval of minus 20%[3]. This marked a concerning low point for the Prime Minister heading into an election year.

However, by March 2025, YouGov polling (March 7-13) indicated that Albanese's "personal satisfaction levels have notably improved"[2]. The polling showed Labor consolidating a 51% to 49% lead over the Coalition, with Albanese tying Opposition Leader Peter Dutton in voter satisfaction for the first time in a year[2]. This suggests a recovery from his January lows.

The context surrounding this improvement is important. The polling indicates that 69% of Australians support Ukrainian President Zelensky in his disagreement with President Trump, with only 31% supporting Trump[2]. YouGov's Director of Public Data explicitly noted that Albanese's commitment to stand with Ukraine against Trump's position has contributed to his improved satisfaction levels[2].

Regarding Trump's position, the search results provide limited direct information about his current approval ratings. However, we can infer several points:
- Trump appears to have relatively low support in Australia specifically (31% on the Ukraine issue)
- YouGov notes that "Overseas leaders who've opposed Trump's policies have seen improvements in their polling results"[2]
- Trump's "recent 25% tariff decision" is mentioned as presenting an opportunity for Albanese to further improve his standing[2]

The Australian federal budget was scheduled for March 25, 2025[3], which falls within our forecast window. The reception of this budget could significantly impact Albanese's approval ratings by April 1.

Putting weight on the status quo is important for forecasting. While we see Albanese improving from January lows, we don't have direct Morning Consult data comparing the two leaders. The information suggests Albanese's ratings are on an upward trajectory while Trump faces some international challenges, particularly regarding Ukraine policy. However, Trump likely maintains strong support within his domestic base, and approval ratings of foreign leaders can be quite stable over short time periods.

Without direct comparative data from Morning Consult, which will be the resolution source, I must acknowledge significant uncertainty. The trend direction favors Albanese, but starting positions matter, and we lack this critical information.

Probability: 55%
