(a) **Time left until outcome:**  
There are approximately 27 days remaining until April 1, 2025, when the outcome will be determined.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
As of March 5, 2025, neither Donald Trump nor Elon Musk has posted on X (Twitter) using the exact phrase "diversity visa"[3][4]. If this remains unchanged, the outcome will be **No**.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
Trump and Musk continue to focus public commentary and social media activity on immigration topics like the H-1B visa, high-skilled workers, and broader immigration policy, but neither addresses or specifically posts about the "diversity visa" program using the exact phrase before April 1, 2025[1][3][4][5].

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
A news event, political controversy, or policy announcement suddenly elevates the Diversity Visa (DV) program in the public discourse—prompting either Trump or Musk to comment directly and use the exact phrase "diversity visa" in an X post before April 1, 2025. This would require a clear and deliberate shift in their messaging, as their current focus remains on high-skilled visa programs[3][4][5].

## Rationale

- The **status quo outcome** is heavily favored in forecasting due to the current absence of any mention of "diversity visa" by either Trump or Musk on X and the lack of evidence of changing focus in their immigration commentary[3][4][5].  
- Both Trump and Musk are currently engaged with the H-1B visa debate, which is distinct from the Diversity Visa program. Their statements and tweets over recent months reinforce this focus, and there is no indication that the Diversity Visa is gaining traction in their agendas[1][3][4][5].
- Immigration remains a dynamic political issue. While public figures’ attention can shift quickly in response to external events, such shifts toward the Diversity Visa would require an unlikely and significant new development within the next month.
- The **criteria require the exact phrase "diversity visa,"** making it less likely for a qualifying post to occur by chance. The potential for indirect references or alternative phrasing does not count toward resolution.
