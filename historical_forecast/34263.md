(a) The time left until the outcome is known is approximately 10 months and 25 days from now (from May 6, 2025 until March 31, 2025).

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be that Michael Jordan's net worth ($3.5 billion as of January 2025) would exceed Howard Schultz's net worth ($3.3 billion as of December 29, 2024).

(c) A scenario resulting in a No outcome: Howard Schultz makes successful new investments or his existing holdings significantly appreciate in value, while Michael Jordan experiences investment losses or depreciating assets, causing Schultz to surpass Jordan's net worth by March 31, 2025.

(d) A scenario resulting in a Yes outcome: Michael Jordan continues to receive substantial income from his Nike partnership and other business ventures, while his investments increase in value, maintaining or widening his current net worth advantage over Howard Schultz.

## Rationale

Based on the available information, Michael Jordan's net worth appears to be on an upward trajectory. As of January 2025, his net worth was reported at approximately $3.5 billion[2], representing an increase from the $3.2 billion reported in April 2024[5]. This demonstrates continued growth in his wealth.

Jordan's financial position benefits from multiple stable income streams. His partnership with Nike continues to be extremely lucrative, with the Jordan brand generating significant ongoing revenue for him[5]. The sale of his majority stake in the Charlotte Hornets in August 2023 for $3 billion (after purchasing it for $175 million in 2010) provided a substantial boost to his net worth[5].

Looking at historical trends, Jordan's net worth has demonstrated consistent growth. From October 2023 to April 2024, his wealth increased from $3 billion to $3.2 billion[4][5]. Then from April 2024 to January 2025, it further grew to $3.5 billion[2][3]. This pattern suggests continued appreciation of his assets and income streams.

While the search results don't provide detailed information about Howard Schultz's current business activities or the composition of his wealth, we know his net worth was reported as $3.3 billion as of December 29, 2024. This places him $200 million behind Jordan's reported $3.5 billion as of January 2025.

Given the status quo and the relatively short timeframe until March 31, 2025 (less than a year), major shifts in either individual's net worth would require significant business developments or market movements. The status quo currently favors Jordan maintaining his lead.

However, I must account for several uncertainties:
- Both individuals likely have diversified investment portfolios subject to market fluctuations
- Either person could make major business decisions in the coming months
- Forbes' valuation methodologies may not capture all assets or liabilities
- Private business dealings could significantly impact their respective wealth positions

Considering these factors and giving extra weight to the status quo (Jordan currently ahead by approximately $200 million), I believe Jordan is more likely than not to maintain his net worth advantage over Schultz by March 31, 2025.

Probability: 65%
