(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
The August 2024 U.S. unemployment rate will be published by the BLS on September 6, 2024. As of July 19, 2024, this is about seven weeks away[1].

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
Recent data and forecasts indicate the unemployment rate is hovering around 4.0%–4.1% as of mid-2024, with most official and private forecasts expecting only modest increases in the coming months[3][5]. If current conditions persist, the unemployment rate will remain at or just slightly above 4.1%.

(c) **Scenario for a No Outcome (unemployment rate 4.1% or below):**  
The labor market continues its recent trend of slow cooling, but avoids any negative shocks. Businesses, still reluctant to lay off workers, keep employment levels steady even as hiring slows. Labor force participation remains stable, and economic growth, while slower, is sufficient to prevent a marked increase in joblessness. Such a scenario results in the August 2024 unemployment rate remaining at or just below 4.1%[3][5].

(d) **Scenario for a Yes Outcome (unemployment rate above 4.1%):**  
Job growth slows further or turns negative due to weaker demand, financial conditions tighten more than anticipated, or unexpected shocks (such as a sudden drop in consumer spending or external uncertainty) push more workers into unemployment. This could push the unemployment rate over the 4.1% threshold for August[5].

## Rationale

Good forecasters give substantial weight to the status quo: the labor market has cooled but not cracked, and most major forecasts see only gradual increases in unemployment. The University of Michigan’s May 2024 outlook expects the unemployment rate to hover around 4.0% through late 2024, not rising sharply above 4.1% unless more significant weakness emerges[3]. JPMorgan’s economic outlook likewise anticipates the unemployment rate moving into the low-mid 4% range by late 2024, but the increases are expected to be modest and gradual[5]. The Federal Reserve’s projections as of June 2024 also show the median forecast for the fourth quarter unemployment rate remaining near 4.0%[4].

The data suggests that unless there is an unexpected negative development in the labor market between now and August—such as a sharper economic slowdown or a contraction in hiring—the unemployment rate will most likely be close to, but not materially above, 4.1%.

## Final Answer

**Probability: 45%**

There is a meaningful chance the rate will tick above 4.1%, but most baseline scenarios suggest it will be at or just below that threshold barring new negative shocks[3][5].
