(a) Time left until outcome: April 1, 2025 is approximately 26 days from today's date (May 6, 2025). However, since this date has already passed, the outcome should already be known.

(b) Status quo outcome: Based on the available information up to March 13, 2025, the status quo would be that Deftones had not yet released a new album.

(c) No outcome scenario: Deftones decided to take more time with the production and release of their album, pushing it beyond April 1, 2025, despite Chino Moreno's earlier statement that it was "getting very close." The band may have chosen to focus on their tour first and release the album later in 2025.

(d) Yes outcome scenario: Deftones released their new album in March 2025, shortly after beginning their North American tour with The Mars Volta, as hinted by Moreno's statement about having a record "sometime around that time [during the tour]."

Based on the search results and considering today's date (May 6, 2025), I need to assess whether Deftones released a new album between March 13, 2025 (the cutoff date in the query) and April 1, 2025.

From the available information, I can determine that as of February 25, 2025, Deftones had not yet released their new album, though Chino Moreno indicated it was "getting very close" to being ready[2]. The band began their North American tour on February 25, 2025, with no official announcement of a new album release at that time[2][4].

The search results do not provide any information about an album release between February 25 and April 1, 2025. Moreno's statement from December 2024 (published in February 2025) suggested the plan was to have a record "sometime around" their tour, but he also noted "perhaps a summer or fall release is more realistic" for the follow-up to 2020's "Ohms"[2].

Guitarist Stephen Carpenter had previously commented that the new album would sound like "a continuation of Ohms and Koi No Yokan," indicating the album was still in development[5].

The search results show no evidence of pre-release activities such as singles, pre-orders, or cover art announcements that would typically precede an album launch within the next few weeks.

Given the lack of any concrete release date announcement or pre-release marketing activity in the available information up to March 13, 2025, and considering that album releases typically involve significant promotional buildup, it appears highly unlikely that Deftones released a new album before April 1, 2025.

Probability: 5%
