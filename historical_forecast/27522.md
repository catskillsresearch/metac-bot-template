(a) Time until outcome: Approximately 40 days (from today, August 21, 2024, until October 1, 2024)
(b) Status quo outcome: No (medal remains with Romania's Ana Barbosu)
(c) No scenario: USA Gymnastics' appeal to the Swiss Federal Tribunal is delayed, rejected, or unsuccessful in overturning the CAS decision before October 1, 2024
(d) Yes scenario: USA Gymnastics quickly submits a compelling appeal to the Swiss Federal Tribunal, which expedites the case and rules in favor of Jordan Chiles before October 1, 2024

Based on the information available, I need to assess the likelihood that Jordan Chiles will regain her bronze medal in women's floor exercise before October 1, 2024.

## Current Situation

As of August 12, 2024, Jordan Chiles has been ordered to return her Olympic bronze medal in the floor exercise after the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) ruled that her coach's inquiry was filed outside the one-minute window allowed by gymnastics rules[1]. The medal has been reallocated to Romania's Ana Barbosu, who was initially placed third before Chiles' score was adjusted[3].

USA Gymnastics attempted to appeal the CAS ruling but was informed that CAS rules "do not allow for an arbitral award to be reconsidered even when conclusive new evidence is presented"[1]. In response, USA Gymnastics has stated they will "continue to pursue every possible avenue and appeal process, including to the Swiss Federal Tribunal"[1].

## Factors Affecting Probability

### Appeal Process and Timeline

For the decision to be overturned before October 1, 2024, several time-sensitive steps must occur:

1. USA Gymnastics must file an appeal with the Swiss Federal Tribunal
2. The Tribunal must agree to hear the case
3. The case must be reviewed and decided in favor of Chiles
4. The decision must be officially implemented

With only 40 days remaining until the October 1 deadline, this presents a significant timing challenge. The Swiss legal system is not known for rapid decisions, especially in complex international sports disputes.

### Historical Precedent

The track record for successful appeals against CAS decisions is extremely poor:
- Only five appeals against CAS arbitral awards have succeeded since the CAS was established in 1984
- In recent years (2009-2010), only about 1% of appeals were successful
- Overall, only 0.3% of all CAS decisions have ever been successfully overturned on appeal

This historical data strongly suggests that USA Gymnastics faces an uphill battle in their appeal efforts.

### Legal Grounds for Appeal

Appeals to the Swiss Federal Tribunal are typically limited to specific grounds:
- Procedural irregularities
- Violations of fundamental legal principles
- Jurisdiction issues

USA Gymnastics would need to demonstrate that one of these grounds exists, rather than simply arguing that the CAS made the wrong decision on the merits of the case. Their claim of having "conclusive new evidence" may not be sufficient, as appeals to the Swiss Federal Tribunal generally don't permit the introduction of new evidence that wasn't presented to CAS.

## Status Quo Bias and Inertia

As noted, good forecasters recognize that the status quo tends to persist in most situations. In this case, the status quo is that the medal has been reallocated to Barbosu, and CAS has already refused to reconsider its decision[1]. Overturning this status quo would require an exceptional and expedited legal process.

## Weighing the Scenarios

The most likely scenario is that either:
1. The appeal process extends beyond October 1, 2024
2. The Swiss Federal Tribunal declines to hear the case or rules against USA Gymnastics

For the "Yes" scenario to occur, we would need to see:
1. An unusually rapid filing and hearing by the Swiss Federal Tribunal
2. A ruling that finds substantial procedural errors in the CAS decision
3. Official implementation of a decision reversing the medal allocation

Given the historical success rate of appeals (0.3-1%), the limited grounds for appeal, and the tight timeline, the probability of the "Yes" scenario materializing before October 1 is very low.

Probability: 3%
