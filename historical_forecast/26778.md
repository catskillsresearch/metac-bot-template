(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
The outcome will be known after September 30, 2024, when EPA data for Q3 is complete and reviewed (about 2 months from August 1, 2024).

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
As of July 29, 2024, the Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue metro area has experienced 1 day in Q3 with AQI above 150—specifically, July 5 (AQI 166). If no further high-AQI days occur in August or September, the total will remain 1 day, well below the 6–10 day threshold for the question to resolve as "Yes"[1].

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
If wildfire activity and smoke intrusions remain limited through August and September—either because of favorable weather, effective fire suppression, or atmospheric conditions keeping smoke aloft rather than at surface level—Seattle records 5 or fewer days with AQI above 150 in Q3. This fits the pattern seen in 2014, 2015, 2016, 2019, 2021, and 2023, when <6 such days occurred[1].

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
A surge in wildfire activity in August or September, with persistent smoke settling at ground level due to atmospheric inversions, could rapidly increase high-AQI days. Years like 2017, 2018, 2020, and 2022 saw such late-summer wildfire smoke episodes, resulting in 7–11 AQI>150 days in Q3[1][2][5]. A major regional fire or sustained smoke influx could push the total to 6–10 days.

## Rationale

- **Historical baseline:** In the last decade, the Seattle area has exceeded 6 days with AQI above 150 only in four years (2017, 2018, 2020, 2022). Most years saw 3 or fewer days[1].  
- **2024 status:** Only 1 day above 150 reported as of July 29.  
- **Short-term outlook:** Some smoke is forecast to reach Seattle in early August, but current meteorological guidance suggests that initial smoke will mostly remain elevated in the atmosphere, perhaps causing haze and only moderate surface air quality deterioration, not necessarily pushing AQI above 150 for multiple days[3].  
- **Fire season forecast:** The 2024 outlook suggests a "slightly more active" wildfire season than normal in Washington and British Columbia, but with significant uncertainty and the most severe smoke impacts still depending on unpredictable fire and weather dynamics[2].  
- **Recent expert commentary:** While there is expectation of more "orange" days (AQI 101–150), days exceeding 150 remain sporadic, mostly tied to major smoke events[1].  
- **Seasonal pattern:** The risk of high AQI days is concentrated in August–mid September. A single large fire, or a series of fires with persistent unfavorable wind patterns, can cause rapid escalation. However, unless such events occur, achieving 5 or more additional AQI>150 days by end of Q3 appears unlikely from the present vantage point.

## Final Assessment

Given the current status (1 day), historical frequency, and the typical “slow-changing” dynamic in the absence of an active crisis, the probability that the Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue metro area will experience **6 to 10 days with an AQI above 150 in Q3 2024** is modest. While not impossible—late summer can quickly worsen with major wildfires—the base rate and current trends suggest it is not the most likely outcome.

**Probability: 20%**
