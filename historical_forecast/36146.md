(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
The winner of the 2025 GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Reality Competition Program has already been announced. The result was publicly confirmed on March 27, 2025, so as of May 6, 2025, there is no time left until the outcome is known—it is fully resolved[1][5].

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
The current, officially recognized outcome is that **RuPaul’s Drag Race** won the award for Outstanding Reality Competition Program at the 36th GLAAD Media Awards[1][5]. This outcome aligns with the show’s strong record at the GLAAD Awards and its significant cultural impact within and beyond the LGBTQ community.

(c) **Description of a scenario that results in an unexpected outcome:**  
An unexpected scenario would require a major procedural or factual error—such as a misannouncement, disqualification, or discovery of a tabulation mistake after the public reveal. For instance, if the review panel identified a violation of eligibility criteria or a mistake in the voting process after the ceremony, the award could, in theory, be reassigned to another nominee. However, no such controversies or corrections have been reported, and this kind of reversal is extremely rare for GLAAD Media Awards.

**Rationale:**  
Good forecasters assign the vast majority of probability to the official, status quo outcome because major awards rarely reverse their decisions after public announcement. However, a non-zero probability should remain for all other contenders to cover for the exceedingly unlikely chance of a retraction or procedural anomaly. This is standard in forecasting, even when the outcome appears settled.
