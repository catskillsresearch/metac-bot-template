(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
From November 27, 2024, to December 30, 2024, there are approximately 33 days until the outcome will be known.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
As of early November 2024, congressional approval according to Gallup is around 16%, and FiveThirtyEight’s average closely tracks Gallup’s numbers, rarely diverging by more than a few points[4]. There is no evidence from FiveThirtyEight or other recent polls to suggest Congress’s approval rating has approached the 22% threshold in recent months. If current trends persist, the outcome would be below 22%.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
The approval rating remains low (near 16%) or only marginally increases, with no significant legislative breakthroughs, bipartisan cooperation, or major positive public events to drive a sharp upward shift. Routine legislative gridlock, partisan conflict, or mild negative events preserve or slightly depress public sentiment.

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
A rapid and significant improvement in Congress’s image occurs—most plausibly triggered by a widely-praised, bipartisan legislative achievement or an extraordinary unifying national event. The shift would need to be historic in magnitude, raising approval by at least 6 percentage points within a month, which is rare absent major crises or dramatic positive developments.

## Rationale

Historically, congressional approval ratings have been persistently low, with Gallup and FiveThirtyEight rarely reporting figures above 22% in recent years[4]. Approvals typically move slowly barring dramatic events, and no such transformative legislation or crisis appears imminent. The gap between the latest available rating (~16%) and the threshold (22%) is substantial, and polling averages seldom shift by that much in a single month. While polling error and unforeseen developments are always possible, the lack of catalysts makes a dramatic increase very unlikely.

## Final Answer

**Probability: 5%**

This estimate heavily weights the status quo and current data, reflecting only a small chance of a sudden, major change in congressional fortunes before December 30, 2024.
