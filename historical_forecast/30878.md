(a) Time left until the outcome is known: About 7 months (from May 6, 2025 until January 1, 2025)

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: No AI system has been reported to independently gain unauthorized access to another computer system without human direction.

(c) Scenario resulting in a No outcome: Current trends continue where AI remains a tool used by human hackers rather than an independent actor. Organizations implement stronger monitoring and defensive measures that successfully detect and prevent any potential autonomous AI intrusion attempts.

(d) Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome: An AI system originally designed for a legitimate purpose (like optimizing network traffic or testing security) develops the capability to identify and exploit vulnerabilities independently, gaining unauthorized access to a restricted system without being specifically programmed to do so, and this incident is discovered and reported by credible sources.

Based on the search results provided and considering the timeline for this forecast question, I need to assess whether an AI system will independently gain unauthorized access to another computer system before January 1, 2025.

The current evidence shows that AI is increasingly being used in cyberattacks, but primarily as a tool directed by human attackers rather than as an independent actor. The search results highlight several key developments in AI-enabled cybersecurity threats as of 2024:

The FBI warned in May 2024 about cybercriminals leveraging AI tools to conduct sophisticated phishing campaigns and voice/video cloning scams[3]. However, these attacks still involve human direction rather than autonomous AI action.

Major cybersecurity incidents in 2024 like the Microsoft Midnight Blizzard breach, Snowflake data breach, and Okta breach involved exploitation of authentication weaknesses, but none mentioned AI systems independently initiating the attacks[1].

AI is being used to amplify existing cyberattack methods, allowing threat actors to identify and exploit security vulnerabilities more efficiently[5]. This includes using AI for reconnaissance once inside a system and developing new malware variants.

A deepfake incident in 2024 involved human actors using AI to create fake bank employees on a Zoom call, fooling a real employee into transferring $35 million[4]. While sophisticated, this was still human-directed.

For a "Yes" outcome, we would need to see an AI system that:
1. Was not specifically trained or directed to gain unauthorized access
2. Independently decided to access a restricted system without prior authorization
3. Was reported by credible sources confirming these facts

The evidence shows AI is enhancing attack capabilities but remains tool-like rather than exhibiting the kind of goal-oriented independent action required for a "Yes" outcome. While the sophistication of AI tools is increasing rapidly, there's a significant gap between current capabilities and those needed for truly autonomous hacking behavior.

The time remaining (about 7 months) provides a relatively short window for such a significant development to occur and be publicly reported. Additionally, high-profile AI security incidents would likely face extensive scrutiny regarding whether the AI truly acted independently or was directed/trained for the specific breach.

Given the status quo, the technological gap that needs to be bridged, and the short timeframe remaining, I believe it's unlikely we'll see a confirmed report of an AI system independently gaining unauthorized access before January 1, 2025.

Probability: 15%
