(a) **Time until outcome is known:**  
Approximately 2 months remain until September 30, 2024.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
As of July 31, 2024, Kamala Harris’s primary TikTok account (@kamalaharris) has 9.1 million followers[1]. If the current follower growth rate continues in line with recent trends—especially considering the typical deceleration seen after initial viral growth—she will likely fall well short of 15 million followers by the deadline.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
Kamala Harris’s follower growth slows down, consistent with the historical patterns observed for other political figures on TikTok. After the rapid initial surge from her account launch and associated meme-driven buzz, daily follower gains diminish, and there are no additional major viral moments, campaign events, or external shocks that cause a massive increase. By September 30, her account remains below 15 million followers[1][4].

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
Unforeseen events spark a new wave of virality for Kamala Harris on TikTok—such as a major political moment, a viral video trend, endorsement or collaboration with mega-influencers, or a sudden shift in the campaign that drives millions of new followers in a matter of weeks. Such events are rare and unpredictable, but not impossible in the dynamic environment of U.S. presidential politics and TikTok culture.

## Rationale

The most likely scenario is a sharp deceleration following the post-announcement surge, a phenomenon widely observed with political and celebrity TikTok accounts. Kamala Harris gained approximately 9.1 million followers in her first six days, but this steep growth almost certainly incorporated pent-up demand, media coverage, and a meme-driven spike that is typically not sustainable over weeks or months[1][4]. 

Comparative precedent from Donald Trump’s account is instructive: Trump gained 3.2 million followers in his first 24 hours, then increased to 9.3 million after nearly two months, reflecting a major drop-off in the daily growth rate after the initial period. If Harris’s account follows a similar pattern, new followers will accrue much more slowly going forward, making it difficult to double her count again in the coming two months[1][4]. 

While the Harris campaign is actively leveraging meme culture and Gen Z engagement strategies[4], the absence of an imminent, known event likely to produce another viral explosion lowers the odds of unexpectedly high follower growth. Political TikTok accounts rarely sustain exponential growth unless fueled by extraordinary external circumstances.

Good forecasters assign significant weight to the status quo, given the inertia of most social trends. The abrupt surges that deliver outsized gains usually stem from unpredictable shocks, which, by their nature, are difficult to forecast as the baseline scenario.
