(a) **Time until outcome is known:**  
As of today (May 6, 2025), the April 1, 2025 date is in the past. However, as of the last information available (February 21, 2025), there were a little over five weeks until the outcome date. The outcome is now knowable by checking the Weedmaps link for Delaware dispensaries as of April 1, 2025.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
As of February 21, 2025, Delaware had not opened any recreational marijuana dispensaries. Conditional licenses were awarded, the regulatory framework was finalized, and conversion of medical dispensaries was authorized by new legislation, but no recreational dispensaries were operational yet. The best public official predictions placed the opening of legal sales in "spring 2025," typically interpreted as April to June[4][3][1]. If nothing changed from this point, the status quo outcome would be **No**—no recreational dispensary would be open by April 1, 2025.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
- Administrative and logistical delays (e.g., licensing, build-outs, or local zoning obstacles) prevent conditional licensees or conversion applicants from opening by April 1.
- The state or local authorities delay final operational approvals until after April 1.
- Even with finalized regulations and issued licenses, no business completes all pre-opening requirements (inspections, security, product sourcing) by the target date.
- Conversion of medical dispensaries is intentionally delayed to ensure a synchronized market launch or to address supply/equity concerns[2][3].

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
- At least one medical marijuana dispensary successfully converts its license and begins recreational sales before or on April 1, 2025, after completing all necessary steps.
- Conditional licensees (whether new or converted from medical) rapidly complete all final regulatory and operational requirements, pass inspections, get local sign-off, stock product, and open doors by April 1.
- The state expedites the process to meet a political or market-driven goal, and Weedmaps reflects at least one recreational dispensary listing in Delaware by April 1, 2025.

## Forecaster Rationale

- As of February 21, 2025, Delaware had completed many necessary administrative steps: regulations were finalized, conditional licenses were awarded, pathways for medical conversions were established, and spring 2025 remained the target for launch[1][4][3].
- However, officials indicated ongoing uncertainty and emphasized a launch *window* (April–June) rather than a firm date[4][2][3].
- The conversion pathway for medical dispensaries, which could accelerate the opening of recreational stores, was only legislatively enabled in July 2024 and was "not yet active" as of February 2025[1][3]. Further, officials considered delaying conversions until other new retailers could also open for reasons of fairness and supply management[2][3].
- Local restrictions and logistical hurdles (e.g., zoning, buffers, municipal opposition) introduced additional potential for delays[4].
- No reporting or public statements by officials as of February 2025 indicated confidence in recreational dispensaries opening *on or before* April 1; the phrasing always points to "spring 2025" (April–June) with uncertainty about hitting the earliest part of that window[4][1][3].

Historically, new state-legal recreational marijuana markets often open later than initial projections, especially when substantial local, regulatory, and operational unknowns exist close to launch.

Given all this, the *status quo*—no recreational dispensaries open by April 1—should be weighted heavily unless there is clear evidence of a fast-track process already underway.

**Probability: 20%**

_A low but nonzero probability reflects the possibility of an early conversion or expedited process not visible as of February 21, 2025, but the strong consensus from official statements and progress reports as of that date point toward launch occurring after April 1 in most plausible scenarios._
