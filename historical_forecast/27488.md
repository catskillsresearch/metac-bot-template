(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
The August 2024 core CPI data will be released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics on September 11, 2024[2]. That is approximately three weeks (~20 days) from the current date (August 22, 2024).

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
The status quo, based on the most recent data and projections, is a modest but positive month-over-month (MoM) increase in core CPIâ€”most likely +0.2%, as seen in July 2024 and forecasted for Q3 2024[1][4]. Historically, a MoM reading of 0.0% or below is rare in core CPI, especially given persistent shelter inflation.

(c) **Scenario that results in a No outcome:**  
Core CPI for August 2024 is reported as a positive MoM change (e.g., +0.1% or +0.2%), continuing current trends. This would occur if shelter and other sticky components (like insurance and services) remain elevated and there are no significant price declines elsewhere[1][4].

(d) **Scenario that results in a Yes outcome:**  
Core CPI is reported as 0.0% or less MoM for August 2024. This could happen if there is a sudden deceleration in shelter inflation (e.g., broad rent or owner-equivalent rent decline), unexpected price drops in significant core categories, or a one-off statistical anomaly. Such scenarios typically require either an economic shock (e.g., abrupt drop in consumer demand), rapid adjustment in sticky prices, or unusual seasonal adjustment artifacts.

## Rationale

- **Recent Data & Trends:**  
  The core CPI rose 0.2% MoM in July and 0.1% in June 2024[4]. Forecasts for Q3 2024 put annualized core CPI at 2.6%, which translates to an average monthly pace of roughly 0.21%, all indicating continued, modest positive increases[1].

- **Structural Factors:**  
  Shelter costs (comprising over one-third of core CPI) remain robust and are a principal source of upward pressure, making a zero or negative MoM core number unlikely without a sharp, unexpected change[4].

- **Forecast Consensus:**  
  Professional forecasts (Philadelphia Fed, Cleveland Fed) and commentary suggest a "cooling but persistent" inflation backdrop; no major data or policy shocks in July or early August suggest a sharp drop[1][3][4].

- **Likelihood of 0.0% or Negative Reading:**  
  Month-over-month zero or negative readings in US core CPI are historically rare, especially in the absence of a macroeconomic shock, which is not currently evident. Recession risks are rising, but not acute enough to cause abrupt disinflation in the very short term.

## Final Assessment

- The baseline scenario is a modestly positive MoM increase in core CPI for August 2024.
- The probability of a 0.0% or negative MoM reading is low, barring unforeseen shocks in the coming weeks.
- Good forecasting practice puts extra weight on stable, ongoing trends, especially in sticky data series like core CPI.

**Probability: 8%**
