(a) Time left until outcome: There are approximately 25 days remaining until April 1, 2025 (from the current date of May 6, 2025). However, since the outcome period has already passed, we can assess the actual results based on available information.

(b) Status quo outcome: Based on the search results, the status quo as of March 13, 2025 was that no new tariffs specifically targeting India had been implemented, with announced tariffs scheduled to take effect on or after April 2, 2025.

(c) No outcome scenario: The United States maintains its announced timeline, with new tariffs on India only taking effect on or after April 2, 2025. Alternatively, the U.S. could delay implementation further or cancel the tariffs altogether following negotiations with India.

(d) Yes outcome scenario: The United States accelerates its timeline and officially announces and implements new India-specific tariffs before April 1, 2025, perhaps in response to deteriorating trade negotiations or as part of a broader trade strategy.

Looking at the available evidence, the United States has announced several tariff measures that would affect India, but none that specifically target India were scheduled to be implemented before April 1, 2025. 

According to the search results, the Trump administration announced a "Fair and Reciprocal Plan on Trade" on February 13, 2025, which noted that "India charges a 100% tariff on U.S. motorcycles, while we only charge a 2.4% tariff on Indian motorcycles"[3]. This suggests that India was being considered for potential tariff actions.

The most specific information comes from the "India-US Trade Relations Under Trump's Tariffs" article dated March 6, 2025, which outlines product-specific tariff announcements including:
- Agricultural products: Tariffs to be imposed from April 2, 2025
- Automobiles: A 25% tariff on auto imports starting April 2, 2025[5]

Additionally, we know that global steel and aluminum tariffs were expanded, with aluminum tariffs rising from 10% to 25%, effective March 12, 2025[5]. However, according to the resolution criteria, global tariffs that don't specifically target India would not count.

India has taken several pre-emptive measures to win U.S. approval, including changes to spectrum allocation that would benefit Elon Musk's Starlink and introducing schemes to attract Tesla investment in India[1]. These actions suggest India was attempting to mitigate potential tariffs, but don't indicate any acceleration of the U.S. tariff timeline.

The status quo bias is particularly relevant here. As of March 13, 2025 (the latest date in our search results), all announced tariffs specifically targeting India were scheduled for April 2, 2025 or later. For the outcome to be "Yes," the U.S. would have needed to accelerate its timeline or announce and implement new India-specific tariffs within those remaining 18 days before April 1. Without evidence of such a change, and considering typical bureaucratic processes involved in implementing tariffs, the most likely outcome was that the announced timeline would hold.

Probability: 10%
