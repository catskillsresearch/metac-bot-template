(a) **Time until outcome is known:**  
Less than two months remain until December 31, 2024, the cutoff date for this question.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changes:**  
Currently, there are *no US laws* requiring generative AI API providers to restrict access solely to US-based users[2][3]. If this persists, the outcome will be "No".

(c) **Scenario for a "No" outcome:**  
Congress does not pass legislation before the end of 2024 mandating geographic restrictions on generative AI APIs, and the executive branch does not issue enforceable rules or orders with this effect. Regulatory actions remain limited to guidance, research programs, and export controls on hardware or specific investments—not on API access or end-user location[2][3][4].

(d) **Scenario for a "Yes" outcome:**  
Congress rapidly advances and passes a law, or the executive branch (e.g., Department of Commerce or another agency) issues a legally binding rule before December 31, 2024, explicitly requiring at least some "powerful generative AI" systems to restrict API access only to US-located individuals (potentially including identity verification or IP checks).

## Rationale

- **US AI Regulation is Rapidly Evolving, but Focused Elsewhere:**  
  Most existing and proposed US generative AI regulations center on *transparency*, *copyright*, *privacy*, and *consumer protection*—not API access restrictions by geography[2][3][5]. Federal and state measures in 2024 address how AI is used and disclosed, not who can access APIs based on location.

- **No Known Legislative or Executive Action Targeting API Restrictions:**  
  Despite increasing federal and state attention on the risks posed by generative AI, there are no concrete legislative initiatives or executive directives mandating API geo-restrictions. The Biden administration's executive orders and Commerce Department initiatives in 2024 have emphasized evaluation and guidance—not enforced access controls[3][4]. State measures, like California's AI laws, address transparency and content labeling, not cross-border API controls[5].

- **Practical and Economic Barriers:**  
  Implementing such restrictions would be technically feasible but controversial and potentially damaging to US AI company competitiveness. There has been no sign of sufficient political or industry pressure to rush such a measure through in the remaining time window.

- **Speed of Regulatory Change:**  
  In the US, major regulatory changes, especially those with broad economic and technological impact, rarely occur within a few weeks or months barring a clear national emergency.

- **Status Quo is Likely to Persist:**  
  With less than two months left and no advanced legislative or regulatory activity suggesting imminent action on this front, the default outcome is that the US will *not* introduce such a restriction before 2025.

**Probability: 5%**

The probability that the US will restrict API access to some generative AI systems to only US-based users by December 31, 2024, is very low—around 5%—given the absence of relevant legislative or executive movement and the short remaining time window for such a change to occur[2][3][5].
