(a) Time until outcome is known: 21 days (from March 11, 2025 to April 1, 2025)

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: No, Jumaane Williams will not run for mayor of New York City

(c) Scenario for No outcome: Williams continues to focus on his Public Advocate re-election campaign, where he is currently being challenged by Jenifer Rajkumar. Mayor Eric Adams remains in office despite his political vulnerabilities, and Williams does not enter the mayoral race before April 1.

(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: Mayor Adams resigns due to political pressure from his corruption charges (even though they were dropped by the Trump DOJ), making Williams the acting mayor. Williams then decides to run for a full term as mayor, and the New York Times tracker updates to list him as a candidate before April 1.

Based on the available information, I need to determine the probability that Jumaane Williams will run for mayor of New York City before April 1, 2025, according to the NYT tracker.

From the search results, I can see that as of March 2025, Williams is not currently running for mayor. Instead, he is focused on his re-election campaign for Public Advocate, where he's facing a challenge from State Assemblymember Jenifer Rajkumar who "dropped her bid for New York City comptroller to challenge Williams, in hopes of giving voters a more moderate option."[2]

The search results indicate that the City Council Progressive Caucus Alliance has unanimously backed Williams for Public Advocate reelection, with Council Member Julie Won stating, "Jumaane has been a long-term champion of progressive values."[2] This suggests Williams is firmly committed to the Public Advocate race.

The information also shows that Williams would only likely run for mayor if Eric Adams were to resign or be removed from office, at which point Williams would become acting mayor. While Mayor Adams has faced significant political vulnerabilities, including federal corruption charges that were recently dropped by the Trump Justice Department, he appears to be continuing his mayoral campaign, running on delivering "a safer, more affordable city."[1]

There is no indication in the search results that Williams is planning to announce a mayoral run in the next three weeks before the April 1 deadline. The Progressive Caucus Alliance is still in the process of determining their mayoral endorsements, with Won saying "the alliance will invite candidates for interviews before determining a ranked-choice slate of endorsements."[2] This suggests Williams is not part of the current field of mayoral candidates they're considering.

As a professional forecaster, I should give significant weight to the status quo. The evidence strongly points to Williams continuing his Public Advocate re-election campaign rather than launching a mayoral bid in the next three weeks. For Williams to run for mayor by April 1, there would need to be a significant change in circumstances, such as Adams resigning, which there is no concrete evidence to suggest will happen imminently.

Probability: 5%
