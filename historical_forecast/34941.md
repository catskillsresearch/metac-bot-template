(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  
The outcome will be determined based on the Just Security tracker as accessed on or after February 28, 2025. As of today (May 6, 2025), that date has already passed, so the outcome is knowable now.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
As of January 29, 2025, the Just Security litigation tracker reported 225 legal challenges to Trump Administration actions[2][3][4]. The tracker’s methodology counts related lawsuits as one, excludes appeals and cases where the administration is the plaintiff, and has shown a consistent upward trend with no recent signs of a decrease or methodological overhaul. Therefore, if nothing changed, the status quo outcome would be:  
**Greater than 80** lawsuits.

(c) **Scenario resulting in an unexpected outcome:**  
An unexpected outcome could theoretically occur if the tracker underwent a drastic methodological change—such as retroactively consolidating a large number of related lawsuits or revising their criteria to exclude significant prior cases. Alternatively, a legal or editorial decision might lead to a substantial purge from the tracker (for instance, if a major class-action determination grouped hundreds of filings as a single case, or if systemic errors were discovered in the tracker’s historical compilation). However, there is no evidence in any recent coverage or editorial notes from Just Security indicating such changes[2][3][4]. Thus, while possible, this scenario is highly unlikely. Another possibility would be the sudden removal of lawsuits due to a change in the tracker’s purpose or a legal directive, but again, this is extremely improbable given the current trend and editorial rigor.

## Final Probabilities

Given the available evidence and historical trajectory, here are the probabilities for the number of lawsuits listed:

'33-40': 0.3%  
'41-50': 0.3%  
'51-60': 0.4%  
'61-80': 0.5%  
'Greater than 80': 98.5%

**Rationale:**  
The count as of late January 2025 was 225, far exceeding all other thresholds[2][3][4]. The tracker’s stable methodology and lack of evidence for any substantial downward revision or mass consolidation support overwhelming confidence in the “Greater than 80” category, with only a sliver of residual probability reserved for unexpected editorial or legal events.
