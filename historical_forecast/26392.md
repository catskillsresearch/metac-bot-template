(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  
Just over 2 months remain until September 30, 2024.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
As of July 22, 2024, OpenAI has not announced GPT-5. If this continues, the outcome will be **No**—there will be no qualifying public announcement before the deadline[2][3].

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
OpenAI continues to focus on GPT-4o and other enhancements, but does not publish any blog post, paper, video, or similar document announcing GPT-5, nor do they release any performance results or specifics about GPT-5 before September 30, 2024[2][3].

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
OpenAI unexpectedly publishes a blog post, research paper, video, or similar document specifically announcing GPT-5 or describing its performance results before September 30, 2024. This document must come directly from OpenAI (or a legal successor) and explicitly describe GPT-5’s existence or performance[1][5].

## Rationale

OpenAI has a historical pattern of major GPT releases roughly one year or more apart (GPT-4 in March 2023, GPT-4o in May 2024). While there were rumors of a possible GPT-5 release in summer 2024, as of July 22, there is no public announcement—only reports of internal demos to select customers and indications that training and safety testing are ongoing[1][2][5].

Recent credible articles and community posts also suggest a 2025 release is more likely, and OpenAI leadership have made statements hinting that the next major model may not even be called GPT-5, further reducing the probability of a qualifying announcement within the given window[2]. Additionally, OpenAI typically makes highly public and well-trailed announcements: there is no sign of such a campaign underway.

Given the large and eager audience, if a public announcement were imminent, signs—such as a scheduled major press event or clear public teasers—would likely be visible. None have materialized by late July.

The status quo is a strong baseline given OpenAI’s communication patterns and the absence of credible leaks about an impending announcement. While it is possible OpenAI could accelerate its timeline and surprise the public, this would be a departure from their usual careful, well-signaled approach.
