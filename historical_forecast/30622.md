Looking at this forecasting question carefully, I need to analyze the likelihood of Howard Marks outperforming any of the politicians tracked by Quiver Quantitative in 2024.

(a) Time left until outcome is known: About 7 months. The outcome will be determined after the close of trading on the final trading day of December 2024.

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: Based on limited information, we don't have clear data on either Howard Marks' current 2024 performance or the politicians' performance tracked by Quiver Quantitative. The search results don't provide current year-to-date figures for either party to establish a status quo.

(c) Scenario resulting in a No outcome: Howard Marks' investment strategy may face challenges in 2024, particularly if his focus on credit markets and commercial real estate underperforms. Meanwhile, politicians with diversified portfolios or those who have made fortunate trades in sectors that outperform in 2024 could achieve higher returns. Given that we need Marks to beat only one of eight politicians, all eight would need to outperform him for a No outcome.

(d) Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome: Howard Marks, as a professional investor with decades of experience, applies his expertise to navigate volatile markets successfully in 2024. Even if some aspects of his strategy face headwinds, his professional advantage allows him to outperform at least one of the eight politicians tracked by Quiver Quantitative, many of whom are not professional investors.

In evaluating this question, I need to consider several key factors:

First, Howard Marks is a legendary investor with decades of professional experience managing investments at Oaktree Capital Management. He has a demonstrated track record of success over many market cycles, though past performance doesn't guarantee future results.

Second, the question requires Marks to outperform just one of eight politicians. This significantly increases the probability of a Yes outcome, as he doesn't need to beat all of them, just the lowest performer among the group.

Third, while politicians may have access to information that could potentially inform their trading decisions, they are not professional investors with dedicated teams and resources focused solely on investment performance.

Fourth, the search results don't provide current performance data for either Marks or the politicians in 2024, making it difficult to establish a baseline for comparison.

Given these considerations, I would expect a professional investor like Marks to have a reasonable chance of outperforming at least one of eight non-professional investors, even in a challenging market environment. The requirement to beat just one politician, rather than all eight, substantially increases the likelihood of a Yes outcome.

However, without specific current performance data and considering that even professional investors can underperform the market sometimes, I need to be somewhat cautious in my forecast.

Probability: 65%
