(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  
There are about 12 days remaining until April 1, 2025 (from March 19, 2025), after which the question will resolve.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
Based on currently available forecasts, the highest projected temperature for Jacksonville, FL (Jacksonville International Airport) before April 1, 2025, is 86°F on March 31. No forecasts indicate a high of 90°F or above in this window. The status quo outcome, if the forecast holds, would be **No**—the temperature will not reach 90°F before April 1, 2025[3].

(c) **Scenario that results in a No outcome:**  
Jacksonville experiences typical weather for late March, with highs in the upper 70s to mid-80s, never surpassing the 89°F mark. No significant heatwave or anomalous warm air mass affects the region, and all daily highs remain below 90°F at Jacksonville International Airport.

(d) **Scenario that results in a Yes outcome:**  
An unexpected, anomalous heat event occurs in the last days of March—perhaps due to a strong southerly flow or an unseasonable ridge of high pressure. This event causes temperatures at Jacksonville International Airport to spike to 90°F or higher for at least one day, likely near the very end of March.

## Rationale

Climatologically, Jacksonville's average high in March is around 71°F[4], and even as April begins, the average climb is gradual, with typical highs in the high 70s°F to low 80s°F[5]. While occasional record highs have exceeded 90°F in late March in the city’s history, this is rare. The highest forecasted high before April 1, 2025, is 86°F[3], with no forecast model support for a 90°F day within the remaining time. Additionally, historical averages and the lack of any indications of a developing extreme heat event further support a **No** outcome.

The trend of slow changes, especially in climatologically stable periods, means the current forecast (status quo) should be heavily weighted. Abrupt, significant deviations in late March temperatures are uncommon, though not impossible.
