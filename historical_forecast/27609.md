(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  
From the current date (August 26, 2024) to the resolution deadline (October 1, 2024), there are approximately 36 days remaining.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
As of the latest reporting, Ukrainian forces have made significant incursions into Kursk Oblast but have not reached or been reported controlling Bolshoye Soldatskoye (B. Soldatskoe). If the frontline and reporting remain static, the outcome would be "No"—the settlement will not be marked as Ukrainian-controlled on the ISW map before October 1, 2024[1][2][3].

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
Russian defenses stabilize or slow Ukrainian advances, the incursion stalls short of Bolshoye Soldatskoye, and ISW does not update its map to reflect Ukrainian control or claimed control of that settlement before the deadline. This could stem from Russian reinforcements, logistical constraints on Ukrainian forces, or a Ukrainian decision to consolidate gains rather than stretch supply lines deeper into Russian territory[1][2].

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
Ukrainian forces maintain momentum, exploit weaknesses in Russian defenses, and advance north/northeast from current positions, capturing Bolshoye Soldatskoye before October 1, 2024. ISW then updates its map accordingly, marking the settlement as under Ukrainian control or claimed control. This scenario could also be supported if Ukrainian operational objectives shift toward deeper raids or if Russian defensive collapse continues[2][3].

## Rationale

- **Recent Advances:**  
Ukrainian forces have advanced up to 12–24 km into Kursk Oblast along a broad front, reportedly doubling their controlled territory in the first week of the offensive[2][3]. The operation has demonstrated surprise and some initial Russian disorganization.

- **Current Ukrainian Positioning:**  
While Ukrainian troops are confirmed to be operating near the border, including in and around settlements such as Korenevo, Otruba, and Tetkino, and have penetrated up to 24 km from the border, there is no evidence yet in ISW or other reporting that they are within striking distance or have chosen Bolshoye Soldatskoye as a priority target[2].

- **Distance and Terrain:**  
Bolshoye Soldatskoye is located significantly deeper into Kursk Oblast than the settlements confirmed under Ukrainian attack. There are no credible reports of Ukrainian troops operating within or immediately adjacent to Bolshoye Soldatskoye, nor is there public evidence of a Ukrainian axis aimed directly at the settlement[1][2].

- **Russian Response:**  
Although Russian defensive efforts have been criticized by milbloggers, there are signs of stiffening resistance and counterattacks in some sectors, and stabilization efforts are ongoing. Russian forces may prioritize defending larger administrative centers like Bolshoye Soldatskoye to prevent a deeper Ukrainian advance[1][2].

- **Momentum and Constraints:**  
While Ukrainian advances have been rapid, as they push deeper, they face mounting logistical challenges, greater exposure to counterattack, and the risk of overextending supply lines. Historical precedent in this conflict suggests initial breakthroughs are often followed by periods of consolidation and slower progress.

- **ISW Mapping Criteria:**  
The question resolves based on ISW mapping, not just military reality. ISW tends to lag behind events by a few days, and is conservative in assigning control; only clear, repeatable evidence or sustained reporting prompts map updates.

- **Status Quo Bias:**  
The world changes slowly most of the time, particularly in warfare. Despite initial dramatic advances, the status quo—i.e., B. Soldatskoye remaining under Russian control—is more likely unless clear evidence emerges of sustained Ukrainian advances directly toward and into the settlement.

## Final Forecast

Ukrainian forces have impressed with the breadth and pace of their Kursk incursion and may yet make additional gains. However, with no current operations known near Bolshoye Soldatskoye, increasing Russian resistance, and with the settlement sitting as a deeper objective with no direct Ukrainian axis established, the prudent forecast is that ISW will **not** mark B. Soldatskoye as Ukrainian-controlled before October 1, 2024. Current evidence, momentum, and reporting support a moderate-to-high likelihood of a "No" outcome.

**Probability: 25%**
