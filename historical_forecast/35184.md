(a) Time left until outcome: Tesla will likely report Q1 2025 results in late April or early May 2025, which is still approximately 2-3 weeks away from today (May 6, 2025).

(b) Status quo outcome: Based on recent performance trends, the status quo would be continuation of Tesla's strong growth in energy storage deployments. Q4 2024 saw a record 11.0 GWh deployment, suggesting Q1 2025 could be in a similar range, potentially between 10-12 GWh.

(c) Unexpected scenario: An unexpected outcome could result from supply chain disruptions affecting battery cell availability, construction delays at the new Shanghai Megapack factory, or a sudden shift in Tesla's production priorities away from energy products toward vehicle production to address declining EV sales reported in 2024.

Looking at Tesla's energy storage deployment history, I see a clear growth trajectory that helps inform my forecast. In Q1 2024, Tesla deployed 4.1 GWh of storage products[5]. This grew to a company record of 9.4 GWh in Q2 2024[4]. For the full year 2024, Tesla deployed a total of 31.4 GWh[1][2][3], with 11.0 GWh in Q4 alone[1][2]. This represents a dramatic 214% increase from 2023's 14.7 GWh deployment total[2].

Several factors support continued strong growth into Q1 2025:

1. Tesla has been expanding production capacity, including the Megapack factory in Shanghai which was reaching trial production status in early 2025[2].

2. Energy storage has become an increasingly important and profitable segment for Tesla, reaching 9.4% of the company's total revenue by Q3 2024[2].

3. The seasonal pattern shows Q1 is typically lower than Q4 of the previous year, but the overall trend is upward.

However, I must consider some counterbalancing factors:

1. Tesla reported declining EV sales in 2024 (down 1.1% from 2023)[2], which could potentially impact other business segments if the company shifts resources.

2. First quarters historically show some seasonal decline compared to the strong fourth quarters of the previous year.

3. Supply chain constraints or unexpected production issues could emerge.

Given these considerations, my forecast for Tesla's Q1 2025 energy storage deployments is:

Option_A: 0-8.0, inclusive: 10%
Option_B: >8.0 and <10.0: 20%
Option_C: 10.0-12.0, inclusive: 45%
Option_D: >12.0 and <14.0: 15%
Option_E: 14.0-16.0, inclusive: 7%
Option_F: >16.0 and <18.0: 2%
Option_G: Greater than or equal to 18.0: 1%
