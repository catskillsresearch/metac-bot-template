(a) **Time until resolution:**  
The outcome will be known on October 1, 2024, which is 36 days from August 26, 2024.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
As of the latest reports, Ukrainian forces have advanced into Kursk Oblast but remain significantly distant from the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant, which is about 60 kilometers from the international border. The ISW map has not marked the plant as under Ukrainian control or claim as of August 21, 2024. If current conditions persist, the outcome will be **No**—the plant will not be captured by Ukrainian forces by October 1[2][3][4].

(c) **Scenario for a No outcome:**  
Ukrainian advances slow as Russian defenses around key infrastructure—including the nuclear plant—are reinforced. Russia’s rapid deployment of reserves, construction of trenches, and concentration of security forces (noted by Rosatom’s actions) successfully halt further Ukrainian incursions. The front stabilizes well short of the power plant, and the ISW map never shows Ukrainian control of the site before the deadline[2][3][4].

(d) **Scenario for a Yes outcome:**  
Ukrainian forces maintain a sustained offensive pace, exploit Russian disorganization, and achieve a rapid breakthrough that enables them to reach the Kursk Nuclear Plant within 36 days. They are able to overcome both natural and prepared Russian defenses, take control of the plant and its surroundings, and the ISW map reflects this gain as Ukrainian-controlled or claimed before October 1[2][3].

## Rationale

- **Geography & Distance:**  
The Kursk Nuclear Plant is approximately 60 km from the Ukrainian border, and recent Ukrainian gains place them at least 24 km from the border—leaving a substantial distance to cover, especially given Russian defensive preparations[2][3].

- **Operational Complexity & Russian Defenses:**  
Russian authorities are deeply concerned about Ukrainian advances and have responded by constructing trench lines, deploying additional Rosgvardiya (National Guard) security forces, and beginning to withdraw staff from the plant, indicating high alertness and commitment to defend this critical site[2]. Any attempt to seize a nuclear facility is an escalation fraught with military, political, and (importantly) radiological risk, and such an operation would likely provoke the strongest possible Russian response[2][3].

- **Ukrainian Intent and Constraints:**  
While the seizure of the plant would provide Ukraine with extraordinary leverage, available analysis suggests it may not be the primary operational objective at present. Sustaining a high tempo of advance so far from existing supply lines and supporting arms is logistically challenging, especially with Russian forces beginning to refocus their attention on the area[3]. Additionally, international actors (such as the IAEA) have strongly warned against combat near nuclear facilities, which may influence Ukrainian operational planning[2][3].

- **Status Quo Bias:**  
Good forecasters recognize that, absent strong evidence of a continuing rapid advance, the status quo has extra predictive weight—especially over just 36 days. The current situation, with Ukrainian troops still far from the plant and Russian forces heavily fortifying the area, favors a No outcome unless clear signs of a breakthrough emerge[2][3][4].

- **Recent Trends:**  
Ukrainian advances in Kursk Oblast are now described as "marginal," suggesting that the initial momentum has slowed[4]. Without a major collapse of Russian defenses or a sudden operational shift, reaching and controlling the Kursk Nuclear Plant within 36 days is unlikely.

**Probability: 10%**

This reflects a low—but not zero—likelihood of Ukrainian forces capturing the Kursk Nuclear Plant and the ISW map crediting them with its control before October 1, 2024. The low probability is driven by the remaining distance, Russian defensive reactions, operational risks around nuclear infrastructure, and the tendency for abrupt offensives to slow after initial successes[2][3][4].
