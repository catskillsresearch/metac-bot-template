(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
As of October 29, 2024, there were about two months remaining before the January 1, 2025 deadline for this question’s resolution.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
No federal law has been enacted that specifically requires all U.S. actors in possession of powerful AI models to implement cybersecurity measures. The only relevant federal actions are proposed bills, guidance from NIST (which is non-binding), and state-level legislation that does not meet the federal requirement for this forecast[2][3][4][5].

(c) **Scenario that results in a No outcome:**  
Congress does not pass and the President does not sign into law any federal statute before January 1, 2025 that mandates cybersecurity measures specifically for powerful AI models. Continued activity is limited to state-level laws, non-binding federal guidance, and proposed bills stalled in committee or awaiting a floor vote[2][3][4][5].

(d) **Scenario that results in a Yes outcome:**  
A relevant federal bill—such as the legislation introduced by Representatives Ross and Beyer focused on AI security[3]—successfully passes both chambers of Congress and is signed into law before January 1, 2025. This law must specifically require U.S. actors in possession of powerful AI models to take cybersecurity measures intended to secure those models.

## Rationale

Recent history shows strong legislative momentum regarding AI at the state level, but the federal process has remained slow, despite bipartisan interest and the introduction of several relevant bills[2][3][4]. No such bill has reached final passage as of October 29, 2024, and there is no clear public reporting of imminent passage in the final weeks of 2024[2][3][4].

Federal legislation, especially on complex and contested issues like AI security, tends to move slowly. Given the current absence of federal law, the fact that the Ross-Beyer bill and similar proposals remain at the introduction or committee stage, and the lack of urgent signals from Congress or the administration, the status quo—no enacted law before 2025—remains the most likely scenario[2][3][4][5].

While it is plausible that Congress could act quickly in a lame-duck session, in practice, significant legislation especially on emerging technologies is rarely passed in a compressed timeframe at the end of a session, absent strong bipartisan consensus or a major catalyzing event. All recent authoritative trackers and legislative analyses confirm that as of late October 2024 there is no such law and only a short window remains to change that[2][3][4][5].

## Final Assessment

Probability: 10%  

The probability that the U.S. will have passed legislation requiring cybersecurity around powerful AI models before January 1, 2025, is very low, given legislative inertia, the lack of any law as of October 29, 2024, and the short remaining time window[2][3][4][5]. The most likely outcome is "No."
