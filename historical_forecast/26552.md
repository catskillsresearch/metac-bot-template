(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
As of July 24, 2024, there are approximately two months and one week until September 30, 2024.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
Currently, no senolytic therapy has been approved by the US FDA for commercial sale. No therapy is reported to have completed late-phase (Phase 3) clinical trials or submitted a New Drug Application (NDA) for FDA approval. If nothing changes, the outcome will be "No"—no approved senolytic therapy before the deadline[1][2][3][4].

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
All known candidate senolytic therapies remain in early-stage clinical trials (Phase 1/2), with no Phase 3 completion or regulatory submissions before September 30, 2024. The clinical development process continues at its current pace, precluding any possibility of FDA approval within the time frame[1][2][3].

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
For a "Yes" outcome, at least one developer of a senolytic therapy would need to have already completed pivotal Phase 3 trials, submitted an NDA, and received FDA approval before September 30, 2024. This scenario would likely require undisclosed fast-tracked trials or regulatory exceptions, which are not evidenced in current disclosures[1][2][3][4].

## Rationale

Senolytic therapies have shown promising results in laboratory and early clinical studies for various age-related conditions. However, the most advanced human trials of senolytic agents—such as dasatinib plus quercetin—remain at the Phase 1 proof-of-concept stage, focusing on safety and basic biomarker outcomes[1][2]. None have advanced to the large, controlled Phase 3 studies required for FDA approval as a new therapy for any age-related indication[1][2][3]. 

Moreover, there are no public records of any candidate senolytic therapies having completed the necessary efficacy trials, submitted applications for FDA approval, or being under review for approval as of July 24, 2024. Companies active in this space, such as Unity Biotechnology, continue to report early-stage development with no indications of imminent approval[1][4]. 

Given the slow and highly regulated nature of drug development—especially for first-in-class therapies targeting new mechanisms—it is highly unlikely that the remaining two months until September 30, 2024, could see both the completion of pivotal trials and FDA regulatory review for any senolytic agent[1][2][3][4]. The status quo is overwhelmingly likely to persist.

## Final Answer

Probability: 0% 

There is no credible pathway, as of July 24, 2024, for any senolytic therapy to achieve FDA approval for commercial sale before the specified deadline[1][2][3][4].
