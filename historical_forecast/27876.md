(a) **Time Left Until Outcome Known:**  
As of September 2, 2024, there are 29 days remaining until the resolution date of October 1, 2024.

(b) **Status Quo Outcome if Nothing Changed:**  
Pokrovsk remains under Ukrainian control as of late August 2024. Russian forces have advanced close to the city, having taken Novohrodivka and several nearby settlements, but they have not breached the final Ukrainian defensive line or entered Pokrovsk itself[3][4]. If current trends persist without major shifts, Russia will not control Pokrovsk before October 1, 2024[3].

(c) **Scenario Resulting in a No Outcome:**  
Russian forces continue the current pattern of gradual, attritional advances but encounter stiff resistance at the final Ukrainian defensive line on the city's outskirts. Ukrainian forces, though under pressure and forced to conduct tactical withdrawals, hold Pokrovsk through the end of September, preventing a Russian breach and maintaining control of the city on ISW and DeepStateMap by the cutoff date[3].

(d) **Scenario Resulting in a Yes Outcome:**  
Russian forces successfully exploit gaps in the Ukrainian defense created by recent withdrawals and firepower deficits, rapidly breach the final defensive line, and mount a coordinated assault on Pokrovsk. After heavy fighting and possible urban combat, Russian troops take control of the city center and are recognized as the controlling force on ISW's frontline map before October 1, 2024[3][4].

## Rationale

- **Russian advances have been steady and have eroded several Ukrainian defensive lines, with the most recent gains bringing them within approximately 8 kilometers of Pokrovsk[4].**  
- **Ukrainian troops in the area are under severe strain and have conducted tactical withdrawals, indicating weakening defenses but not wholesale collapse[3].**
- **However, open-source assessments and satellite imagery indicate one significant defensive line remains between Russian positions and the city proper as of late August[3].**
- **While there is growing pessimism about Ukraine's ability to sustain the defense long-term, no source indicates Pokrovsk is immediately on the verge of falling. Russian operational tempo remains "grinding" rather than rapid, and there are signs that resource constraints and the need to stabilize flanks could slow further advances[3][4].**
- **Historically, even when Russian forces seize adjacent settlements, urban strongpoints like Pokrovsk require complex assaults that can take weeks, especially when defenders are motivated and the ground is familiar.**
- **There are only 29 days left—less than a month—which places significant time pressure on Russian forces to capture and consolidate control, especially given their current pace.**

**Given these factors, and applying the forecaster's principle that the status quo is more likely to persist in the absence of evidence of a major imminent breakthrough, the status quo outcome is favored. The probability of Russia controlling Pokrovsk before October 1, 2024, is therefore less than even.**
