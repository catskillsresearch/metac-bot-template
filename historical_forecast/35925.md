(a) Time left until outcome: 26 days (from May 6, 2025 to April 1, 2025 - this is impossible as April 1 has already passed)

(b) Status quo outcome: GitHub is currently ranked #60 globally according to SimilarWeb as of March 2025, which means it would NOT be in the top 50 if nothing changed.

(c) No outcome scenario: GitHub's ranking improvement rate slows down or reverses due to competition from other major websites, or its traffic growth stagnates, keeping it outside the top 50 global websites.

(d) Yes outcome scenario: GitHub experiences an exceptional surge in traffic and user engagement in late March 2025, possibly due to a major software development event, new feature launch, or increased developer activity, pushing it up at least 10 positions into the top 50.

Based on the available data, I need to assess whether GitHub will reach the top 50 global websites according to Ahrefs by April 1, 2025. However, I first must note that there's a timeline issue in the query, as today is May 6, 2025, which is after the resolution date of April 1, 2025. Therefore, this is technically asking about a past event, but I'll proceed with the analysis based on the March 2025 data provided.

According to the most recent data from March 2025, GitHub is ranked #60 globally based on SimilarWeb metrics[3]. The ranking has shown improvement over the past three months, moving from #67 to #60, indicating positive momentum[3]. However, this improvement rate of approximately 2-3 positions per month would not be sufficient to reach the top 50 by April 1, which would require gaining at least 10 more positions within a short timeframe.

The traffic data shows conflicting information. One source indicates GitHub received 924.62 million visits in March 2025, with a significant 23.05% month-over-month increase[1]. Another source reports 474.6 million visits with a 5.57% decrease compared to the previous month[3]. This discrepancy creates uncertainty in projecting GitHub's near-term trajectory.

GitHub maintains strong user engagement metrics with average visit durations between 6:34 and 12:14 minutes, pages per visit between 5.19 and 6.10, and bounce rates between 36.2% and 47.26%[1][3]. These metrics indicate users find substantial value in the platform, which supports continued growth.

The status quo suggests GitHub would remain outside the top 50 by April 1, 2025. While GitHub has shown positive momentum in its ranking, the pace of improvement (about 7 positions over three months) suggests it would need more time to gain an additional 10+ positions to break into the top 50.

It's important to note that we don't have direct Ahrefs ranking data, which may use different methodologies than SimilarWeb. Additionally, rankings can be volatile, and unexpected events or changes in user behavior could accelerate or decelerate GitHub's position.

Given the strong status quo bias in forecasting and the significant gap between GitHub's current position (#60) and the target (top 50), combined with the limited timeframe, it appears unlikely that GitHub would reach the top 50 by April 1, 2025.

Probability: 15%
