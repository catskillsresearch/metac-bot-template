(a) Time left until outcome: The question asks about a deadline of April 1, 2025, which is approximately 11 months from the current date (May 6, 2025). However, since the deadline has already passed, the outcome should already be known.

(b) Status quo outcome: Based on the search results, there is no indication that Intuitive Machines successfully landed with fully working payloads on the Moon before April 1, 2025. The status quo outcome appears to be "No."

(c) Scenario for a No outcome: Intuitive Machines' IM-2 mission, which was targeting a Q1 2025 launch, experienced delays beyond April 1, 2025, or encountered landing difficulties similar to those in the IM-1 mission, preventing all payloads from working as intended for at least 24 hours.

(d) Scenario for a Yes outcome: Intuitive Machines successfully launched their IM-2 mission in February or March 2025, achieved a perfect landing on the Moon with the lander remaining intact and able to communicate with Earth, and all payloads functioned correctly for at least 24 hours following the landing.

Given that today's date is May 6, 2025, I can provide an assessment based on the information available in the search results about whether Intuitive Machines landed with fully working payloads on the Moon before April 1, 2025.

Looking at the search results, I can see that as of January 2025, Intuitive Machines was targeting a Q1 2025 launch for their IM-2 mission[3]. This would potentially allow for a landing before April 1, 2025. However, there is no concrete information in the provided search results confirming that such a landing actually occurred within this timeframe.

The search results also mention the IM-3 mission, which is planned for late October 2025[1][2], well after the April 1 deadline. Additionally, as of August 2024, the launch of IM-3 was expected to take place no earlier than October 2025[2], and more recent information from September 2024 confirms that Intuitive Machines expects the first spacecraft for their lunar communications network to launch on IM-3 "next year" (meaning 2025)[4].

The search results do not provide any specific information about a successful IM-2 landing before April 1, 2025. Given that the current date is May 6, 2025, and the search results don't mention any successful landing by Intuitive Machines between January and April 2025, it appears that the landing either didn't occur or wasn't successful according to the criteria specified.

Considering the tight timeline for the IM-2 mission (targeting Q1 2025), the technical challenges involved in lunar landings (as evidenced by the IM-1 lander tipping over), and the lack of any information confirming a successful landing before April 1, 2025, the most reasonable conclusion is that Intuitive Machines did not land with fully working payloads on the Moon before April 1, 2025.

Probability: 5%
