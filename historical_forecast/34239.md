(a) Time left until outcome: 6 days. The 67th Grammy Awards will take place on February 2, 2025, at the Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles[1][4].

(b) Status quo outcome: Based on confirmed information, Sabrina Carpenter has already won one Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album for "Short n' Sweet"[3]. Without any changes, she would fall into the "0 or 1" category.

(c) Unexpected outcome scenario: Sabrina Carpenter could experience a sweep similar to what other breakthrough artists have achieved in the past. If industry sentiment strongly favors her work and the voting committees recognize her cultural impact, she could win in multiple major categories, including Record of the Year for "Espresso," Song of the Year for "Please Please Please," and Best New Artist, potentially putting her in the "Greater than 3" category.

As a professional forecaster, I need to carefully analyze Sabrina Carpenter's Grammy prospects for 2025 based on the available information.

Sabrina Carpenter has received 8 Grammy nominations for the 67th Grammy Awards, with 6 credited directly to her and 2 credited to collaborative producers[4]. Her personal nominations span major categories including Record of the Year, Album of the Year, Song of the Year, Best New Artist, Best Pop Solo Performance, and Best Pop Vocal Album.

We know with certainty that Carpenter has already won Best Pop Vocal Album for "Short n' Sweet"[3], securing at least one Grammy win. This is a significant achievement, especially for an artist receiving her first Grammy nominations.

Looking at the competitive landscape, Carpenter faces strong competition in her remaining categories. Billie Eilish, an established Grammy darling with nine previous wins, has seven nominations this year[3]. Fellow breakthrough artist Chappell Roan has six nominations in many of the same categories as Carpenter[3]. Beyonc√© leads all nominees with 11 nominations[1], while Taylor Swift also received six nominations[2].

The Best New Artist category is particularly competitive, with Carpenter facing Chappell Roan, Benson Boone, Doechii, Khruangbin, RAYE, Shaboozey, and Teddy Swims[2]. This category often recognizes an artist's overall impact rather than comparing specific works.

Historical precedent suggests that even highly nominated artists rarely win in all categories. The Recording Academy often spreads recognition across multiple artists, particularly when several breakthrough performers are competing in the same year. However, Carpenter does have significant cultural momentum, with "Espresso" being one of the biggest hits of the year.

It's worth noting that Carpenter could make history if she wins both Record of the Year and Song of the Year with her different nominated songs, as she would be the first female artist to achieve this particular distinction[2].

Given the strong competition, industry voting patterns, and the fact that one win is already confirmed, I assess the probabilities as follows:

0 or 1: 45%
2: 30%
3: 15%
Greater than 3: 10%
