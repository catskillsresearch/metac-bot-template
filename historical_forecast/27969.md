(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
The 76th Primetime Emmy Awards are scheduled for September 15, 2024. From September 5, 2024, that is 10 days until the outcome will be publicly known.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
As of now, the Emmy voters’ decision is not public and all nominated shows remain in contention. The default is that no show has won yet.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
If another series—such as Baby Reindeer (Netflix), Lessons in Chemistry (Apple TV+), Ripley (Netflix), or True Detective: Night Country (HBO)—is announced as the winner of Outstanding Limited or Anthology Series at the ceremony, Fargo will not win. This would mean the question resolves "No"[2][4].

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
If Fargo is declared the winner of the Outstanding Limited or Anthology Series category during the Emmy Awards, it will satisfy the criteria for a "Yes" outcome[4].

## Rationale

Fargo is an established critical favorite and has received nominations in key acting categories, a factor that sometimes correlates with overall series wins[2][4]. FX, its network, is having a strong Emmy year and could make history if it sweeps the major scripted categories[2]. However, the competition is unusually fierce—Baby Reindeer, Ripley, and True Detective: Night Country all have major acclaim, high-profile talent, and significant industry buzz[2][4].

Recent Emmy trends often see newer or buzzier limited series (like Baby Reindeer) winning this category, especially those with significant cultural impact or streaming momentum. The presence of multiple recognized performances and strong network positioning does boost Fargo’s chances, but “status quo” in Emmy forecasting generally means the odds slightly favor the most buzzed-about or zeitgeisty contender unless critics' consensus or guild wins signal otherwise.

Given the available information, Fargo is a strong contender but not the favorite. Baby Reindeer, in particular, appears to have more widespread industry momentum leading up to the awards[2][4]. The outcome remains genuinely uncertain until the ceremony.

**Probability: 20%**
