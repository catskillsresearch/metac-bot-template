Here is a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to the question is known is uncertain, as it depends on various factors such as political developments, public opinion shifts, and policy changes. However, it's essential to consider the status quo outcome if nothing changed. In this scenario, the US government continues to implement its current immigration policies, including ongoing deportation efforts, increased border security measures, and attempts to reform the existing system.

A key factor that could influence the outcome is public opinion regarding immigration reform. A shift towards a more compassionate approach or increased pressure on policymakers to pass comprehensive legislation could lead to changes in the status quo. On the other hand, a continued focus on enforcement and deportation, driven by political pressure or perceived needs, could maintain the existing situation.

Another crucial aspect is the role of government policies and initiatives. The implementation of self-deportation measures, DNA testing proposals, or CBP HOME app could either facilitate or hinder the process of undocumented immigrants returning to their countries of origin voluntarily. The success of such programs depends on factors like public support, political will, and effective infrastructure.

Ultimately, the outcome is uncertain due to the complexity of immigration policies and the need for further developments before a final decision can be made. However, by considering the status quo, potential scenarios, and key drivers of change, we can provide a more informed forecast.
