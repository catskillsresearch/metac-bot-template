Based on the rationales from each forecast, a consistent rationale can be formed as follows:

The likelihood of a non-test ASAT weapon being used against a satellite before 2030 depends on various factors, including global politics, international agreements and regulations, technological advancements, and diplomatic efforts. The current trend is that countries are continuing to develop their space-based capabilities, but there has been no significant escalation of tensions or conflict in space.

The status quo outcome would be the continued development of satellite technology for peaceful purposes, with international cooperation playing a role in regulating space activities. However, the potential exists for tensions between major powers to escalate, leading to a perceived need for military superiority in space. This could result in the development and use of laser-equipped satellites or other forms of ASAT weapons.

The possibility of conflict in space is higher if countries prioritize their national interests over international cooperation and agreements. Conversely, significant progress in establishing international regulations and agreements governing the use of space technology could mitigate the risk of conflict.

Ultimately, the probability of a non-test ASAT weapon being used against a satellite before 2030 depends on the balance between cooperation and competition among nations, as well as their willingness to work together towards peaceful exploration and utilization of space resources.
