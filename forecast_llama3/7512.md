Here is a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The likelihood of armed conflict between Taiwan and China depends on various factors, including international relations, economic conditions, and political developments. The status quo outcome, where tensions remain high but no major escalation or conflict occurs, is likely due to the complexity and delicacy of the situation. However, sudden events or unexpected developments can occur, which could lead to a change in the current situation.

The possibility of a No outcome (no armed conflict) exists if China and Taiwan are able to negotiate a peaceful solution through diplomatic channels, potentially with international mediation. This scenario assumes that both sides are willing to make significant concessions, including Taiwan's recognition as part of China. On the other hand, a Yes outcome (armed conflict) could occur if tensions escalate rapidly, leading to military action by either side.

The time left until the outcome is known is uncertain, depending on various factors such as international relations, economic conditions, and political decisions. However, it is likely that the situation will remain tense but without major escalation or resolution in the near future. Nevertheless, unexpected events or developments could occur, which could lead to a significant conflict.

Overall, while there are multiple scenarios that could unfold, the likelihood of armed conflict between Taiwan and China is uncertain, making it difficult to predict with certainty.
