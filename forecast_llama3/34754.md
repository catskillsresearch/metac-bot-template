Here is a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to the question is known is relatively short, given that OpenAI has already shared a roadmap for future AI models. However, it's essential to consider the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Based on this assumption, I think it's more likely that OpenAI will continue to develop and improve its AI models without significant changes. Nevertheless, there is some uncertainty regarding the exact release date for GPT-4.5 and GPT-5.

OpenAI has not announced any unforeseen technical issues or setbacks in developing GPT-5, which suggests a higher likelihood of the company meeting its announced timeline. Additionally, considering the company's goals of simplifying its product lineup and improving user experience, it makes sense for them to continue this development path and release GPT-5.

However, there is still some uncertainty regarding the exact release date for GPT-4.5 and GPT-5. Despite this, I believe that OpenAI will likely announce GPT-5 as planned, integrating multiple technologies and streamlining AI usage for users.

This consistent rationale combines the ideas from each individual forecast to create a unified and logical reasoning for why OpenAI might or might not announce GPT-5 in 2025.
