Here's a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to this question is uncertain, but it will likely be influenced by ongoing advancements in brain-computer interfaces and AI. If nothing changes, current trends suggest that research and development in these areas will continue to progress, potentially leading to gradual increases in investment, adoption, and understanding of these technologies.

Experts in the field are optimistic about the potential of brain-computer interfaces and AI, but caution is also necessary due to the complexities and uncertainties surrounding these emerging technologies. Unexpected scenarios could include breakthroughs or setbacks that significantly impact the cost of whole brain emulation technology.

In terms of specific predictions, some experts believe that the cost of 1 hour of subjective run time could potentially drop to around $100 million by the end of 2025 if an unexpected scenario involving a breakthrough discovery or invention were to occur. Others predict that increased government investment in neural implant research and development could lead to a surge in prices.

At the same time, some experts are more pessimistic about the potential outcomes, suggesting that regulatory scrutiny or concerns around the development and use of brain-computer interfaces and whole brain emulation technologies could lead to significant delays or setbacks, potentially causing costs to rise or remain stable.

Overall, it's difficult to predict exactly when whole brain emulation technology will become available in the market, but ongoing advancements in AI and neuroscience research suggest that significant breakthroughs are likely on the horizon.
