Here's a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome is known depends on various factors such as government policies, technological advancements, societal shifts, and demographic trends. Currently, we are in the middle of the year (June 2025), which means that most events and trends will likely continue as they have been up until now.

The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be a continuation of the aging population trend, with governments and societies struggling to adapt to the increasing number of elderly individuals. This could lead to challenges in providing healthcare, social services, and economic support for this growing demographic. The trend towards an aging population will likely continue globally, with many countries experiencing a rise in the percentage of older adults in their populations.

A scenario that results in a No outcome would be if governments and societies fail to address the issue, leading to continued strain on healthcare systems, pension funds, and social services. This could result in decreased quality of life for older adults and increased economic burdens.

On the other hand, a scenario that results in a Yes outcome would be if governments and societies successfully implement policies and programs to support the aging population, such as increasing pension funds, improving healthcare services, and promoting age-friendly infrastructure. This could lead to improved quality of life for older adults and increased economic stability.

The continued rise of automation and artificial intelligence (AI) could also contribute to a Yes outcome by leading to increased job displacement among younger workers, causing them to delay retirement and stay in the workforce longer. This would further accelerate the aging population trend as more people remain employed beyond traditional retirement ages.

Ultimately, the key factors that will influence the outcome are government policies, technological advancements, societal shifts, and demographic trends.
