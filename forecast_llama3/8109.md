Here is the combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to the question is known is uncertain, and it depends on various factors such as geopolitical tensions, diplomatic efforts, and regional dynamics. However, considering recent developments and existing relationships, we can assume that it may take several months or even years for the outcome to be determined.

The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be that Saudi Arabia does not normalize its relations with Israel. This is because the current political climate, driven by conflicting interests and ideological differences, is unlikely to change significantly in the short term.

A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome (Saudi Arabia does not normalize its relations with Israel) could be: If regional tensions continue to rise, particularly with Iran, and the US remains focused on its own domestic issues or other international crises, it may not have the bandwidth to invest significant diplomatic capital into brokering an agreement between Saudi Arabia and Israel. Additionally, if Saudi Arabia's priorities remain focused on resolving its internal issues, such as economic diversification, rather than regional politics, it may not feel pressured to normalize relations with Israel.

On the other hand, a brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome (Saudi Arabia normalizes its relations with Israel) could be: If Saudi Arabia perceives significant benefits from normalizing relations with Israel, such as improved economic opportunities, enhanced security guarantees, or increased international recognition, it may be willing to take the necessary steps to establish diplomatic ties. This could involve engaging in direct talks with Israeli officials, addressing outstanding issues, and demonstrating a commitment to peaceful coexistence.

In this scenario, Saudi Arabia's primary focus is on maintaining its regional influence and countering Iran's growing presence, which may lead it to prioritize cooperation with other Gulf states, Egypt, and Jordan over normalization with Israel. However, if the US remains committed to its Middle East policy and sees value in fostering cooperation between Saudi Arabia and Israel, it could invest diplomatic capital in brokering an agreement.

Considering these scenarios, we can assume that the status quo outcome has a higher probability of occurring due to the complexity of regional politics and the potential consequences of such a move. However, there is also a possibility that Saudi Arabia may see significant benefits from normalizing relations with Israel, which could lead it to take steps towards normalization.

Overall, the likelihood of Saudi Arabia normalizing its relations with Israel depends on various factors, including regional tensions, diplomatic efforts, and internal priorities. While there are potential benefits from such an agreement, the current status quo reflects a more pressing need for Saudi Arabia to maintain its regional influence and counterbalance Iranian power.
