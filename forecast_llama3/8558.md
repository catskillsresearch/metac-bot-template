Here's a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The most important factor to consider is the status quo outcome, as it reflects the current societal norms and legal frameworks that are likely to persist unless there is a significant shift in public opinion or cultural values. Polygamy remains illegal in most countries, with some exceptions for specific cultural or religious groups. This suggests that the likelihood of polygamy being legalized nationwide in the US by 2050 is low.

However, it's also important to consider the possibility of societal change driven by shifts in public opinion, cultural norms, or religious beliefs. If there is a significant increase in acceptance of diverse family structures and personal freedom, this could lead to increased social recognition of polygamy. Governments may also be influenced by this shift in public opinion and consider legalizing or recognizing polygamous relationships.

The weight given to the status quo outcome should not be absolute, as it's possible that a sudden change in societal attitudes or political climate could lead to a "Yes" outcome. Nevertheless, the current lack of significant demand for polygamy legalization and the opposition from religious leaders, conservative politicians, and social conservatives suggest that the status quo is more likely to persist.

Ultimately, the likelihood of polygamy being legalized nationwide in the US by 2050 depends on the interplay between these factors. While it's possible that a sudden shift could lead to change, the current societal and legal frameworks suggest that the status quo outcome is more likely.
