Here's a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The current trend in egg production and prices is influenced by various factors, including supply chain disruptions, avian influenza outbreaks, and consumer demand for cage-free eggs. As of June 2025, we can expect the outcomes for these questions to be known within the next few weeks or months, depending on the specific topic and available data.

If nothing changes, we would likely see a continuation of the current trends in the egg industry, with some increase in prices due to supply chain disruptions and avian influenza outbreaks. Experts and market analysts are predicting a continuation of the current trends, with some expecting egg prices to reach as high as $25 per dozen by the end of 2025.

However, an unexpected scenario that could result in a lower outcome is if a new vaccine or treatment for avian influenza becomes widely available, allowing poultry populations to recover more quickly and reducing supply chain disruptions. This could lead to a decrease in egg prices as the market stabilizes.

On the other hand, an unexpected scenario that could result in a higher outcome is if there are further significant supply chain disruptions or an unforeseen outbreak of avian influenza, leading to a massive loss of poultry populations and driving up demand for eggs. This could lead to egg prices reaching $30-$40 per dozen.

To account for these uncertainties, we can expect the percentage of cage-free eggs in the market to vary depending on the specific scenario that plays out. Based on the current trends and expectations of experts and markets, I predict that by June 2025, around 75-85% of eggs will come from organic and free-range farms.

Here's my final answer:

Percentile 10: 65-70%
Percentile 20: 67-72%
Percentile 40: 72.5-77.2%
Percentile 60: 77.2-82.1%
Percentile 80: 82.1-85.8%
Percentile 90: 85.8%

Note that this is a combined rationale and not an individual forecast, but rather a summary of the best aspects of each individual rationale.
