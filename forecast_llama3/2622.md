Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The US federal debt is likely to continue growing at a steady rate, potentially reaching levels above 156% of GDP by 2055 if current trends persist. However, unexpected scenarios could result in either a low or high outcome for the highest level of annual GDP growth before 2030.

On one hand, an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome might involve a sudden and significant reduction in government spending, accompanied by a corresponding increase in tax revenues. This could lead to a faster-than-expected decline in the federal debt-to-GDP ratio, potentially resulting in slower economic growth rates.

On the other hand, another unexpected scenario that could result in a high outcome is the emergence of groundbreaking technological advancements, massive infrastructure investments, or innovative policy changes, leading to increased productivity, higher GDP growth rates, and potentially even rapid population growth.

In addition, demographic factors such as an aging population and low fertility rates could also impact economic growth. For instance, a declining population could lead to labor shortages and reduced economic growth, while an increasing population could result in faster growth due to more workers and consumers.

Finally, global events or policy changes could also influence the future direction of GDP growth. A severe global pandemic or widespread cyber attacks could lead to significant economic downturns, reduced productivity, and lower population growth rates, while a breakthrough in clean energy technology or other innovative areas could drive rapid innovation and growth across various sectors.

Now, here is my final answer:
