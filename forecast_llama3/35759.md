Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 1-2 years, considering the available data and trends up to this point. The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be a continuation of the labor market growth seen over the past few years, with employers adding jobs at a rate of around 150,000 per month.

However, experts and markets are generally expecting a slowdown in labor market growth, with some predicting a recession or significant decline in job additions within the next 2-3 years. This could result in a decrease of about 20-50 thousand jobs per month. An unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome could be a global economic downturn triggered by a major shock, such as a severe pandemic or a catastrophic event, which could lead to widespread job losses and a significant contraction in the labor market.

Conversely, an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome could be a surge in innovation and technological advancements that creates new industries and job opportunities. This could drive growth in the labor market and lead to increased hiring. Additionally, a breakthrough in technology or innovation that drives economic growth and job creation could also lead to a surge in job openings, potentially even exceeding the current trend, resulting in a higher number of people employed.

Overall, while there is some uncertainty surrounding the future of the US federal government's workforce, it is likely that the labor market will continue to grow at a moderate pace, with some fluctuations and potential slowdowns. However, unexpected events or technological advancements could lead to significant changes in employment numbers.
