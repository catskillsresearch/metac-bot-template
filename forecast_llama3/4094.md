Here is a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The amount of time left until the outcome to the question is known depends on various factors, including ongoing research and technological advancements. While caloric restriction has been studied as a potential intervention for increasing human lifespan, the exact answer will not be known for several years or even decades.

In the absence of significant breakthroughs or major changes in societal behavior, the status quo outcome is likely to continue, with caloric restriction remaining a topic of interest and study in the field of aging biology. However, this does not mean that the benefits of caloric restriction will not be realized; rather, it suggests that the pace of progress may be gradual.

If current trends continue, it is possible that caloric restriction could become a more widely accepted and effective strategy for increasing human lifespan. This would require significant advances in our understanding of aging biology and the development of practical, scalable solutions.

Experts are generally optimistic about the potential benefits of caloric restriction for improving health and increasing lifespan, with some predicting significant gains. Markets may also reflect this optimism by investing in related fields like healthcare and biotechnology.

An unexpected scenario that could result in a low outcome is if caloric restriction has unintended consequences on certain populations or demographics, leading to a reversal of expectations. Conversely, an unexpected breakthrough in our understanding of caloric restriction's effects on human lifespan could lead to a much more dramatic increase in longevity.

Ultimately, the expected increase in lifespan due to caloric restriction will depend on various factors, including ongoing research and technological advancements, societal changes, and individual choices.
