Here is a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The US dollar's dominance as the global reserve currency is likely to continue unless there is a significant shift in global economic power dynamics or a fundamental change in international trade relationships. The current status quo, where the USD remains the dominant reserve currency, is more likely than not due to its historical reputation, widespread acceptance, and the US's significant economic influence.

However, there are scenarios that could lead to a decline in the USD's dominance, such as:

* A sudden and drastic shift in global economic power dynamics, which could prompt other countries to diversify their reserves and potentially replace the USD with alternative currencies.
* A prolonged period of economic stagnation or decline in the US, combined with growing economic power and influence from emerging markets like China, which could lead to a decline in the value of the USD.
* The rise of cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, which could become an attractive alternative to traditional fiat currencies.

Despite these potential scenarios, the slow pace of change in global economics and politics suggests that the status quo outcome is more likely than not. The US dollar's dominance has been a stable feature of the global economy for decades, and it will take significant events or changes to displace it.

Ultimately, the likelihood of the USD remaining the dominant global reserve currency depends on the balance between these potential scenarios and the continued confidence in the US economy and financial system.
