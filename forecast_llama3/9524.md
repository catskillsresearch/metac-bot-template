Here's a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The likelihood of Israel being one of the first ten countries to embryo select >10% of its newborns for intelligence depends on several factors. Firstly, it is essential to consider the current status quo outcome, where Israel has been consistently innovating in medical technologies and continues to build upon existing strengths and address emerging needs. This status quo outcome assumes that there are no significant changes or events that would alter the current situation.

However, a scenario resulting in a No outcome could be a significant shift in global politics or international relations leading to a decline in cooperation between nations, potentially limiting Israel's ability to develop and export its medical technologies. This could result in decreased investment, talent migration, and economic growth, ultimately affecting the country's innovation ecosystem.

On the other hand, a scenario resulting in a Yes outcome could be the continued development of innovative medical technologies, combined with strong government support and a highly skilled workforce, leading to further growth and expansion of Israel's medical technology sector. This could result in increased exports, job creation, and recognition of Israel as a global leader in this field.

Additionally, it is important to consider the role of AI-powered IVF technology in embryo selection. A scenario resulting in a Yes outcome could be continued innovation and improvement in Israeli medical technologies, leading to increased adoption and success rates. This could happen if the Israeli government continues to prioritize innovation, entrepreneurship, and education, leading to sustained economic growth and international respect.

Furthermore, it is crucial to consider the societal and ethical implications of embryo selection for intelligence. A scenario resulting in a No outcome could be a significant increase in public concern or regulatory hurdles related to AI-powered IVF technology, potentially slowing down its adoption and development.

In conclusion, while there are various factors that could influence the likelihood of Israel being one of the first ten countries to embryo select >10% of its newborns for intelligence, it is essential to consider both the status quo outcome and the potential scenarios resulting in a Yes or No outcome.
