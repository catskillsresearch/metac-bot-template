Here's a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome is known is not necessarily a critical factor in this case, as governments tend to change slowly over time. Therefore, it's reasonable to give extra weight to the status quo outcome.

The status quo outcome implies that the government will continue to maintain its current stance on forced adoptions, and the victims will not receive official recognition or apologies for their experiences. This is supported by the fact that many governments prioritize short-term interests and avoid acknowledging past wrongs unless there's a significant public outcry or political pressure.

A scenario that could lead to a No outcome is if the government remains indifferent to the plight of the victims, and no significant pressure is applied by society or other governments. In this case, the government may continue to resist calls for an official apology and compensation, citing reasons such as the need to protect confidential records or avoid reopening old wounds.

On the other hand, a scenario that could lead to a Yes outcome is if there's a concerted effort from various stakeholders, including activists, politicians, and international organizations, to raise awareness about the issue and put pressure on the government. This could involve campaigns, petitions, and high-profile endorsements from influential individuals or organizations.

Ultimately, the likelihood of any sovereign government apologizing for forced adoptions depends on the balance between the status quo outcome and the potential for external pressure or catalysts to bring about change. While it's possible that the government may not issue an official apology or provide meaningful compensation due to various reasons, there is also a possibility that growing public awareness and demand for justice could lead to a change in the government's stance.
