Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The likelihood of detecting an exoplanet atmosphere with >5% oxygen atmosphere before 2030 depends on various factors, including the pace of technological advancements in astrobiology and exoplanet detection. The status quo outcome indicates that currently, we have no conclusive evidence of extraterrestrial life. However, this does not necessarily mean that life is rare or impossible; rather, it highlights the complexity and uniqueness of Earth's conditions.

A crucial factor in determining whether a "Yes" outcome occurs is the development of new technologies and detection methods. The ELT, for instance, has the potential to significantly enhance our capabilities in detecting signs of life on Proxima b or other exoplanets. However, its success is not guaranteed, as it may be hindered by technical issues or unfavorable astronomical conditions.

The likelihood of a "Yes" outcome also depends on the emergence of new research and discoveries that shed light on the conditions necessary for life to exist on Proxima b or other exoplanets. If further studies confirm that these conditions are favorable, it could increase the chances of detecting signs of life using current or future technologies.

Given the pace of scientific progress and the development of new technologies, I would argue that the probability of detecting an exoplanet atmosphere with >5% oxygen atmosphere before 2030 is higher than initially thought. However, this probability should still be tempered by the complexity and uniqueness of Earth's conditions, as well as the potential for unforeseen technical issues or limitations in our current detection methods.

Ultimately, the outcome depends on a combination of technological advancements, scientific discoveries, and the emergence of new data that can inform our understanding of the universe.
