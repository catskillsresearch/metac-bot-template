Here's a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until Maersk's decision to resume shipping in the Red Sea is known is approximately 2-6 months, considering the ongoing efforts by Maersk to resume normal operations and the security concerns in the Middle East. The status quo outcome would be that Maersk continues to avoid sailing through the Red Sea due to ongoing tensions and uncertainty surrounding the situation in Gaza. This scenario assumes that the risks remain high, making it difficult for shipping companies like Maersk to guarantee safe passage.

However, a brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome is one where Maersk sees an opportunity to capitalize on increased demand for shipping services due to global supply chain disruptions, particularly if other shipping companies are forced to take longer routes or experience delays. This scenario would enable Maersk to diversify its route network and potentially increase revenue.

A significant improvement in the security situation could also lead to a Yes outcome, perhaps due to increased international cooperation or diplomatic efforts. In this case, the company might reassess its routes and decide that the risk has decreased enough to justify resuming their normal sailing patterns.

On the other hand, a scenario that results in a No outcome is one where the security risks in the Red Sea decrease significantly, either due to a lasting ceasefire between Israel and Palestine or successful diplomatic efforts to resolve the crisis. This would allow Maersk to reassess its route options and potentially return to sailing through the Red Sea.

Considering these scenarios and factors, it's likely that Maersk will continue to avoid sailing through the Red Sea in the near future due to ongoing tensions and security concerns. However, there is always a possibility for changes in the situation, making it important to monitor developments closely.
