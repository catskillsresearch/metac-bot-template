Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until an outcome is known is approximately 4-7 years, considering the volatility of global politics and military dynamics. The status quo outcome, where tensions between major powers remain elevated but manageable, is likely given the slow pace of change in international relations.

A scenario that results in a No outcome could be one where China's economic growth continues to slow down, its military modernization efforts are hindered by internal political instability or external pressure from the international community, and the US and other countries strengthen their alliances and diplomatic relationships with Taiwan. This could prevent any major conflict.

Another possible scenario leading to a No outcome is if all three nations engage in sustained diplomacy and negotiations to address their differences peacefully. This could involve concessions from each side, such as China reducing its military presence in the Taiwan Strait or the US toning down its rhetoric on Chinese aggression. Additionally, external factors like economic pressures or international pressure from other countries could also contribute to a peaceful resolution.

On the other hand, a scenario that results in a Yes outcome could be one where tensions continue to escalate between China, the US, and Taiwan due to nationalist sentiment, miscommunications, or provocative actions. A minor incident, such as a naval confrontation or cyberattack, could spiral out of control, prompting each side to take further military action.

While some factors may increase the likelihood of conflict, others, such as diplomatic efforts and economic interdependence, could reduce tensions and maintain the status quo. The complexity of international relations, military dynamics, and global politics makes it challenging to pinpoint an exact timeline for a catastrophic event like World War III.
