Here's a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome is known is approximately 5-7 years, giving us a window to consider various factors that could influence the likelihood of an event precipitated by AI malfunction causing at least 100 deaths and/or $1B 2021 USD in economic damage. The status quo outcome if nothing changed would likely be continued growth and integration of AI into various aspects of society, with a significant impact on industries worldwide.

A scenario that results in a No outcome could involve significant technological advancements being made in areas like natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics, leading to increased automation and job displacement across various sectors. However, this could be mitigated by factors such as universal basic income, massive retraining programs, or major shifts in the global economy.

On the other hand, a scenario that results in a Yes outcome could involve rapid acceleration of AI development and deployment across industries, leading to widespread job displacement, changes in the economy, and significant societal transformations. This could be exacerbated by factors such as globalization, demographic changes, and shifts in consumer behavior.

The pace of technological advancements suggests that AI will continue to transform society at an unprecedented rate. However, this growth is not without its challenges, and various stakeholders must work together to mitigate the risks associated with AI adoption.
