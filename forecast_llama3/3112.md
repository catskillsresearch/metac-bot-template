Here's a rationale that combines the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome is known is uncertain, but it's likely to be around 5-15 years given the current pace of technological advancements and space exploration efforts. The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be that Mars remains an uninhabited planet, with no human presence or permanent settlements established.

A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome could involve significant setbacks or funding issues with NASA's plans for sending humans to Mars, or technical challenges that prove insurmountable. On the other hand, a scenario that results in a Yes outcome could involve breakthroughs in areas like propulsion systems, life support technologies, and radiation protection, as well as international cooperation leading to shared knowledge and resources.

Despite the slow pace of change in space exploration, there are factors beyond our control that could influence the outcome. However, considering the steady progress being made by NASA and private companies like SpaceX, it's likely that the status quo outcome (no human settlement on Mars) will remain unchanged unless unforeseen circumstances arise or significant technological advancements occur.

Incorporating this analysis, I believe that the probability of NASA sending humans to Mars within the next 5-15 years is [insert probability].

### Probability: 60%
