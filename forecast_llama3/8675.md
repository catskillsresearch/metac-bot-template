Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to the question is unknown, as it depends on various factors such as space debris re-entry patterns, aircraft routes, technological advancements, regulatory actions, and international cooperation. The status quo outcome if nothing changed would likely continue to be a growing risk of space debris hitting an airplane or passenger, with the likelihood increasing as more rockets are launched into orbit and the amount of space debris in orbit grows.

A scenario that could lead to a "No" outcome would involve significant investments in developing technologies to mitigate the risks associated with space debris, such as controlled re-entry systems for rockets and satellites, advanced tracking and warning systems for pilots, or innovative ways to remove existing debris from orbit. This could lead to a decrease in the amount of space debris entering Earth's atmosphere.

On the other hand, a scenario that could result in a "Yes" outcome would involve a lack of cooperation among countries, failure to implement effective regulations and technologies, and continued accumulation of space debris, leading to an increased likelihood of catastrophic events occurring, such as a piece of space junk falling through busy airspace and causing significant damage or loss of life.

Overall, the key factors that will determine whether space debris causes at least one fatality in space before 2035 include international cooperation, technological advancements, regulatory actions, and the ongoing efforts by space agencies and private companies to mitigate this issue.
