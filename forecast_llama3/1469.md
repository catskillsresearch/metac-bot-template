Here's a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome becomes clear is approximately 2-3 years, considering ongoing research and experiments. The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be that dark matter remains a mystery, with no significant changes in its behavior or properties. However, it's also possible for breakthroughs to occur, leading to shifts in our understanding of dark matter.

A scenario resulting in a No outcome could involve failed experiments or lack of funding for research on dark matter detection, prolonging the period of uncertainty and skepticism about its existence. Alternatively, scientists might discover that observed deceleration in dark matter is an artifact of their detection methods or the result of some unknown astrophysical process.

On the other hand, a scenario resulting in a Yes outcome could involve breakthroughs in technology and innovative experiment designs leading to the successful detection of dark matter, revolutionizing our understanding of the universe. This could also include evidence that dark matter's density is decreasing over time due to some unknown process or the influence of certain astrophysical phenomena.

Given these factors, it seems likely that the outcome will be influenced by a combination of ongoing research and potential breakthroughs. While there are risks involved in failed experiments or lack of funding, the possibility of significant discoveries also exists. Therefore, our understanding of dark matter is not fixed and may change as new information becomes available.
