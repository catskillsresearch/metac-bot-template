Here is a rationale that combines the best of each individual rationale:

The likelihood of any member country leaving BRICS before 2035 depends on various factors. One key consideration is the status quo outcome, which suggests that the current trend of cooperation and economic integration among BRICS countries is likely to continue. This is evident in the strengthening of partnerships and shared interests among member states.

However, there are also scenarios that could lead to a Yes outcome, such as significant changes in global politics or economies that prompt a reevaluation of membership. For instance, a country may decide to leave BRICS due to disagreements over international policies or trade agreements, driven by changes in government leadership, economic shifts, or shifting global priorities.

Another factor is the time left until the outcome is known, which is roughly 2-3 years considering the current date (2025). This means that there is still a significant amount of time for events to unfold and influence the outcome.

Ultimately, the probability of any member country leaving BRICS before 2035 is influenced by the interplay between these factors. While the status quo outcome suggests continuity, the possibility of unexpected events or changes in global priorities cannot be ruled out.
