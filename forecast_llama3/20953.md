Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to the question is unknown, as it depends on various factors and uncertainties mentioned in the passage. The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be that aerial drone attacks continue to occur, with some drones being shot down while others successfully target their objectives.

A scenario that results in a No outcome (drone attacks cease) could happen if Ukraine and Russia negotiate a peaceful resolution to the conflict, or if international pressure forces them to agree on a ceasefire. Additionally, advancements in drone technology or anti-drone defenses could lead to increased effectiveness in countering these attacks.

On the other hand, a scenario that results in a Yes outcome (drone attacks continue) could happen if diplomatic efforts fail to produce a lasting peace, and the conflict continues with both sides using drones as part of their military strategy. Another possibility is that one side develops new drone technologies or tactics that make them more effective against each other.

The slow-changing nature of international conflicts suggests that the status quo outcome may be more likely to occur, but sudden changes can also occur, making it difficult to predict the exact outcome with certainty.
