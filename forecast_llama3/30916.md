Here's a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

Real housing prices in the US are likely to continue growing at a moderate pace in 2025. The status quo outcome is supported by historical trends and current market conditions, including population growth, urbanization, and low interest rates. These factors have driven up demand for homes in recent years, leading to rising prices.

While there are some scenarios that could lead to a decline in housing prices, such as a significant increase in interest rates or an economic downturn, these outcomes seem unlikely given the current market conditions. In fact, the probability of these scenarios occurring is relatively low, as the world changes slowly most of the time.

On the other hand, there are also factors that could drive up demand for homes and push prices higher. These include ongoing low interest rates, population growth, and government policies supporting affordable housing. Additionally, if the economy experiences strong growth or a specific region experiences rapid growth, it could also contribute to higher house prices.

Overall, while there are some uncertainties and potential risks, the most likely outcome is that real housing prices will continue to rise at a moderate pace in 2025.
