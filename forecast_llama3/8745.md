Here is a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The world continues to face a high risk of new pandemics due to complacency towards preventive measures and environmental degradation. These factors create an ideal environment for infectious diseases to emerge and spread rapidly. The status quo outcome, where nothing changes, would likely result in more frequent and devastating outbreaks.

However, there are scenarios that could mitigate this risk. A concerted effort by governments and international organizations to address the root causes of pandemics, including environmental degradation, climate change, and complacency, could lead to a decrease in the spread of infectious diseases. This might involve increased investment in disease surveillance and research, improved healthcare systems, and a shift towards sustainable living practices.

On the other hand, if humanity's destructive habits continue unabated, the conditions for pandemics would become even more favorable. Climate change, deforestation, and urbanization could all contribute to an increase in the risk of new pandemics, straining global healthcare systems and economies.

Overall, while there are scenarios that could lead to a decrease in the risk of new pandemics, the current trends suggest that humanity will need to undergo significant changes to mitigate this risk.
