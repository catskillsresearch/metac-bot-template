Here is the combined rationale:

Synthetic biological weapons pose a risk due to their ease of development and potential for misuse. The status quo is that synthetic biology is being developed and used for various applications, but there are regulations and ethical guidelines in place to prevent its misuse as a biological weapon. However, the current trends suggest that these risks will continue unless new information or events trigger a change.

Rogue actors or nations may exploit the capabilities of synthetic biology for military purposes if they feel they can get away with it, or if international agreements and treaties are not strong enough to prevent their misuse. The lack of effective regulations and international coordination could allow these threats to materialize, putting global security at risk.

On the other hand, a scenario where synthetic biological weapons are not used in warfare could be one where international agreements and treaties are strengthened, and nations come together to regulate the development and use of such technology through increased transparency, verification mechanisms, and cooperation among governments, experts, and organizations.

Overall, the risks associated with synthetic biological weapons depend on various factors, including the level of regulation and international coordination, the ease of developing such weapons, and the willingness of rogue actors or nations to exploit their capabilities.
