Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 1.5 years, considering that Emmanuel Macron's presidential term ends in 2027. The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be that Emmanuel Macron does not cease being President of France.

A scenario that results in a No outcome could be that Macron's approval ratings continue to fluctuate around their current level, and he maintains a strong grip on power without any significant external factors or internal challenges forcing him to step down early. This could include a stable economy, no major scandals, and effective handling of international crises.

On the other hand, a scenario that results in a Yes outcome is if Macron's approval ratings continue to decline significantly due to various reasons such as economic downturn, political scandals, or ineffective handling of international crises, leading to widespread dissatisfaction among the French population. This could result in a loss of confidence in his leadership and pressure from various quarters for him to step down early.

The likelihood of Macron ceasing being President of France before 2027 is higher if he faces mounting pressure from the French public, his political opponents, and/or international organizations to take decisive action on issues such as climate change, economic reform, or European integration. In response, he may choose to dissolve parliament and hold early elections to seek a new mandate and demonstrate his commitment to these challenges.

Conversely, if Macron's popularity continues to rise due to his decisive actions on the international stage, particularly in response to significant global events, this could lead to increased support among the French people and a re-election in 2027.
