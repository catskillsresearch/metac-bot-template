Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome is known is uncertain, but it's reasonable to assume that the status quo outcome - Blake Masters not being President of the United States before 2070 - is more likely. This assumption is supported by the slow pace of government confirmations and the lack of concrete information about this specific nomination.

However, considering the potential factors that could influence the outcome, such as changes in Blake Masters' personal or professional life, public opinions, or political developments, it's also important to consider possible scenarios that could lead to a Yes outcome. These scenarios might include significant events or decisions made by Blake Masters himself, such as running for president or gaining momentum through his current pursuits.

Given the uncertainty surrounding Blake Masters' future plans and actions, it's difficult to predict with certainty whether he will become President of the United States before 2070. Nevertheless, a careful evaluation of the relevant factors and possible scenarios suggests that the status quo outcome is more likely than a drastic change in scenario.
