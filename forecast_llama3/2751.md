Here's a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The Voynich Manuscript has remained undeciphered for centuries, and despite recent studies and advancements in deciphering methods, it is likely that a definitive answer will take time. While breakthroughs in cryptography or code-breaking techniques are possible, they would require significant advancements and are not guaranteed.

New evidence or discoveries that contradict existing theories could potentially lead to the decipherment of the manuscript, but this would also depend on the availability of new technologies, methods, or innovative approaches. The complexity and mystery surrounding the Voynich Manuscript mean that cracking its code will likely require significant advances in fields like cryptography, linguistics, and computer science.

At the same time, it is possible for a breakthrough discovery to be made, potentially linking the Voynich script to an existing written language or revealing a hidden pattern. However, this would also depend on the development of new technologies or methods that allow researchers to crack its code.

Overall, while it is possible for the Voynich Manuscript to be deciphered, it is more likely that it will continue to remain an enigma, with cryptographers, linguists, and scholars continuing to make progress but ultimately failing to fully decipher its meaning. The status quo outcome, where the manuscript remains undeciphered, is therefore more plausible.

This combined rationale takes into account the possibility of breakthroughs or new discoveries, while also recognizing the complexity and mystery surrounding the Voynich Manuscript.
