Based on the rationales provided, a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale can be constructed as follows:

The greatest velocity (in c) attained by a human-made spacecraft before 2050 will depend on various factors, including the performance and capabilities of current and future spacecraft, as well as unforeseen events or breakthroughs in technology. If nothing changes, it is likely that NASA's Parker Solar Probe will continue to break records for speed and proximity to the sun, gathering valuable data about the solar corona and its impact on space weather.

The current trend of advancements in spacecraft technology and propulsion systems suggests that future spacecraft may be able to fly even closer to the sun or achieve higher speeds, potentially leading to new discoveries and breakthroughs. Experts in the field of astrophysics and NASA engineers are likely to continue making progress towards achieving these goals.

However, unexpected events or technical issues could also impact the outcome. For example, a malfunction or failure of critical components could result in a lower outcome, while an unforeseen breakthrough in technology could lead to an even higher outcome than expected.

Overall, the greatest velocity (in c) attained by a human-made spacecraft before 2050 will depend on a combination of these factors, including the pace of technological advancements and the potential for unexpected breakthroughs or setbacks.
