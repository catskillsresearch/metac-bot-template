Here's a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The status quo outcome is often characterized by slow changes or no significant changes at all. In this case, if nothing changed, it's likely that the current demographic trends and electoral processes would continue to shape the outcome. For instance, Arizona might experience continued population growth, leading to an increase in registered voters.

However, there are alternative scenarios where the outcome could be different. These scenarios often involve significant changes or reforms that address the underlying factors driving the outcome. For example, a scenario where the GOP adapts to demographic changes and energizes its base could lead to an increase in their seats in 2032. Similarly, effective policies and reforms implemented in Italy could address the demographic crisis and lead to population growth.

The likelihood of these alternative scenarios depends on various factors such as government policies, economic conditions, societal trends, and political attitudes. These factors can influence the outcome by driving changes in demographics, electoral processes, or voter registration efforts.

Ultimately, a consistent rationale for predicting the outcome is to consider both the status quo outcome and alternative scenarios that could result in a different outcome. This approach acknowledges the possibility of slow changes or no significant changes while also accounting for the potential impact of reforms, policies, or shifting societal attitudes on the outcome.
