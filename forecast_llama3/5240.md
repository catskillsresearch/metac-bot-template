Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to this question is known is still several years away, leaving room for uncertainty and unexpected events to impact market trends. Assuming the current trend continues, the S&P 500 may experience moderate growth, potentially driven by innovations in technology, e-commerce, and artificial intelligence.

Historically, the S&P 500 has experienced steady growth over time, with some fluctuations due to market volatility. If nothing changes, this growth rate could continue at around 11% per annum, although there may be minor adjustments along the way.

Expert opinions suggest a range of outcomes, from relatively low growth rates (around 5-7%) to more optimistic predictions (15-20%). The current forward price-to-earnings multiple suggests that the market is pricing in some level of growth. However, unexpected events such as global economic downturns, technological shocks, or changes in government policies could impact the actual outcome.

An unexpected scenario that could result in a low outcome might be a rapid decline in global economic activity, triggered by unforeseen events like a pandemic or a sudden increase in interest rates. This could lead to a recession and subsequently lower earnings growth rates. On the other hand, an unexpected scenario that could result in a high outcome might be the widespread adoption of new technologies or innovations, driving exponential growth in certain industries.
