Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The likelihood of a restriction on birthright citizenship in 2025 depends on the balance between the status quo and potential scenarios. On one hand, there is strong precedent and constitutional support for maintaining the current legal framework, which would maintain automatic citizenship for children born to undocumented immigrants. This "status quo" outcome has been the norm since the 14th Amendment was ratified in 1868.

On the other hand, there are scenarios where the Supreme Court might rule in favor of Trump's birthright citizenship order or against it. If the court upholds the order, it would mark a significant shift in US immigration policy and potentially have far-reaching consequences for undocumented immigrants and their families. Conversely, if the courts continue to block the executive order or Congress passes legislation overturning it, the status quo of unrestricted birthright citizenship would be maintained.

The weight of the status quo outcome suggests that the most likely scenario is that the current legal framework will prevail, with children born in the United States continuing to automatically receive US citizenship. However, the potential for a surprise outcome cannot be ruled out, particularly if new evidence or arguments emerge that could sway the justices' decision.

Ultimately, the key factors to consider are the strong constitutional and historical precedents supporting birthright citizenship, the ongoing legal challenges to Trump's executive order, and the potential for a ruling in favor of or against the order.
