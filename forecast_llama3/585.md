Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to this question is known is approximately 75-85 years, depending on the current trends and lack of global cooperation. The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be the continuation of current trends, with global temperatures rising by about 2.7Â°C beyond pre-industrial levels, leading to more frequent and intense heatwaves, droughts, and extreme weather events. Sea levels will continue to rise, causing coastal erosion and flooding.

A scenario that results in a No outcome would require significant and sustained efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions globally, with the majority of countries making rapid transitions away from fossil fuels and towards renewable energy sources. This would involve major policy changes, widespread adoption of electric vehicles, and significant investments in clean energy infrastructure.

On the other hand, a scenario that results in a Yes outcome could see catastrophic climate events occurring more frequently and intensely, leading to a global recognition of the urgency of the situation and a massive mobilization of resources and efforts to reduce emissions. This could involve rapid technological advancements, widespread adoption of carbon capture and utilization technologies, and significant changes in societal behavior and energy consumption patterns.

Given the current trends and lack of global cooperation, it is likely that the status quo outcome will occur. However, there are scenarios where rapid and coordinated efforts could lead to a No outcome, and there is always a possibility for technological breakthroughs or international agreements that could alter the trajectory of climate change.
