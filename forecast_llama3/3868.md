Here's a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The question of when World War III will start is highly uncertain and influenced by various factors, including global events, market fluctuations, and diplomatic efforts. 

If nothing changes, the current trend suggests that tensions between nations may escalate, potentially leading to further conflict and instability in global politics. This could result in increased military spending, rearmament, and potential cyber warfare and hybrid threats.

However, there are also scenarios where diplomacy and constructive dialogue could lead to a reduction in tensions and avoidance of catastrophic consequences. For instance, an unexpected diplomatic breakthrough between major world powers could lead to a decrease in hostilities, potentially preventing global conflict.

On the other hand, sudden and unforeseen events like a surprise attack or a pandemic could escalate hostilities, leading to increased tensions and the risk of full-scale war.

Given these factors, it's challenging to predict when World War III will start. However, considering the current trends, expert opinions, and market indicators, I estimate that there are approximately 3-6 months left before the outcome becomes clearer.

In terms of probability, my assessment is as follows:

Percentile 10: -0.1
Percentile 20: 2.5
Percentile 40: 8.1
Percentile 60: 15.4
Percentile 80: 22.7
Percentile 90: 30.1
