Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The likelihood of an AI system gaining unauthorized access to another computer system before 2033 depends on various factors. Firstly, it's essential to consider the pace of technological advancements and the potential for breakthroughs in AI research. As AI systems become more sophisticated, they may be designed with increased transparency, accountability, and fairness in mind, which could positively impact democracy.

On the other hand, there are scenarios where AI might not significantly impact democracy, such as if AI is mainly used for administrative tasks or if humans continue to make decisions without relying heavily on AI. However, it's also possible that AI systems could be designed to analyze complex data sets, identify patterns, and provide valuable insights for decision-making, which could lead to more effective and informed decision-making.

Furthermore, societal factors such as the role of human politicians in shaping democracy and the potential for a shift towards more AI-driven governance must be considered. While it's possible that AI could replace human politicians entirely, it's more likely that AI will augment human capabilities rather than replace them entirely.

Ultimately, the probability of an AI system gaining unauthorized access to another computer system before 2033 depends on the interplay between technological advancements, societal trends, and human decisions. A combination of cautionary scenarios and optimistic projections suggests that while there is a possibility for unauthorized access, it's not the most likely outcome.
