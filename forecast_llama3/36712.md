Here's a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 18 months, considering the current date (June 14th, 2025) and the forecast period (second quarter of 2026). The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be around 13.59 million barrels per day, based on previous forecasts from experts.

The current trend suggests a gradual increase in US crude oil production, driven by increasing demand from countries like India and China. However, this trend is not without challenges, as OPEC+ producers and global events may impact energy markets. Experts and markets generally expect a gradual increase in crude oil production, with some predicting a slight slowdown due to potential global economic uncertainty.

An unexpected scenario that could result in a low outcome is a sudden and drastic reduction in demand due to a global economic downturn or a widespread adoption of alternative energy sources, causing a significant decrease in the need for fossil fuels. This could result in a production level around 12-13 million barrels per day.

On the other hand, an unexpected scenario that could lead to a high outcome is a breakthrough in technology or a shift in global energy policies, leading to increased investment and innovation in the industry. This could result in a production level above 15 million barrels per day.

Overall, the combined rationale suggests that the best estimate for crude oil production in the second quarter of 2026 is around 14-15 million barrels per day, considering the current trend, expert expectations, and potential challenges and opportunities.
