Here's a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

While it's possible that the status quo outcome may persist, with some EU countries continuing to relax their genetic engineering regulations while others maintain stricter rules, there are also scenarios where significant events or developments could lead to a relaxation of requirements for all births to be genetically engineered. 

One such scenario is if scientific evidence supporting the safety and benefits of genetically engineered crops convinces policymakers to relax regulations, allowing for increased innovation and adoption. This is supported by the idea that breakthroughs in genetic engineering research could demonstrate significant benefits for agriculture, food production, and the environment.

However, it's also important to consider the potential risks and challenges associated with GMOs, including environmental concerns and public skepticism. These factors may lead governments to err on the side of caution or strengthen their regulations instead of relaxing them.

Additionally, if a well-publicized incident involving GMO crops or animals causes harm to people, wildlife, or the environment, it could trigger a significant backlash against relaxing genetic engineering regulations, leading to a "No" outcome.
