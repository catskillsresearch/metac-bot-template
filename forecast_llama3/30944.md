Here's a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to this question is known is approximately 6 months, considering the current data up to February 2025 and future data releases over the next few months. The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be a continuation of moderate inflation around 3%, driven by underlying trends in energy prices, wage growth, and consumer spending. This assumption is supported by recent trends and data showing no significant disruptions or changes.

However, there are potential scenarios that could disrupt this status quo, such as a global economic shock like a recession or a sudden change in global trade policies, which could lead to an increase in unemployment and a decrease in inflation-adjusted wages. On the other hand, strong economic growth driven by increased consumer spending and investment could result in higher employment opportunities and decreased unemployment rates.

Despite these scenarios, I believe that the status quo outcome is more likely to occur, as the world changes slowly most of the time. Therefore, my final prediction is based on this assumption, with a probability of [insert probability here].

### Probability: 70%
