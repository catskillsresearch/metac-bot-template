Here is a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The status quo outcome, where the UK and EU maintain their current trade and defense agreements without significant changes, is likely due to the slow pace of change in international relations. However, recent developments and ongoing trends suggest that there is a possibility for change in this scenario. The uncertainty surrounding Brexit's long-term implications and the desire for stability and cooperation could drive both sides towards finding common ground.

The willingness of both parties to engage in constructive dialogue, coupled with a desire for stability and cooperation, could lead to successful negotiations on new trade and defense agreements. This might involve creative solutions, mutual concessions, or innovative approaches to address specific concerns. The potential for positive developments in other areas of UK-EU relations or international events that highlight the importance of cooperation could also facilitate finding common ground.

On the other hand, factors such as ongoing disagreements over key issues like fishing quotas or defense cooperation, external pressures from other nations or organizations, or internal politics within either country could lead to a stalemate in negotiations and ultimately result in no new deals being reached.
