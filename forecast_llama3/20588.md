Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to this question is unknown, as international relations can be complex and unpredictable. However, it's likely that Western countries will continue to respond to Russia's military actions in Ukraine and maintain their current stance on supporting Ukraine. The status quo would imply continued sanctions against Russia, diplomatic efforts to de-escalate the situation, and potentially increased military aid to Ukraine.

Russia's aggressive behavior is not unprecedented, and it's possible that they may test Western unity by making a provocative move, such as conducting military exercises near NATO borders or supporting separatist groups. However, there are also scenarios where Russia decides not to pursue aggressive actions, focusing instead on domestic issues or seeking to de-escalate the situation.

The likelihood of a Yes outcome (Western countries going to war against each other before 2070) is higher than a No outcome, given the ongoing tensions and historical precedent. However, there are also factors that could influence the outcome, including internal Russian dynamics, diplomatic efforts, and potential missteps or miscalculations.

Ultimately, the uncertainty surrounding international relations means that it's difficult to pinpoint an exact time when the outcomes will be confirmed. Nevertheless, based on current events and historical context, it's possible to conclude that there is a moderate likelihood of Western countries going to war against each other before 2070.
