Here is a rationale that combines the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome becomes known is uncertain, as it depends on various factors such as international relations, military actions, and diplomatic efforts. However, considering recent trends and global developments, it's possible to estimate a timeframe within which the outcome may become clear (6-18 months).

The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be the continuation of tensions between China and Taiwan, with ongoing diplomatic efforts, military buildups, and strategic alliances. This could involve incremental changes rather than a significant shift.

A scenario that results in a No outcome (China does not invade Taiwan) is one where tensions escalate further, leading to a military confrontation or surprise attack by China. In response, the US and its allies may engage in diplomatic talks or take decisive action to deter further aggression. Alternatively, the situation could remain stable if all parties involved are able to find common ground and manage their differences peacefully.

A scenario that results in a Yes outcome (Taiwan receives direct military support from allied nations) is one where tensions escalate significantly, leading to a Chinese invasion of Taiwan or a major provocation by North Korea. In response, the US and its allies may take decisive action to defend Taiwan or deter further aggression, potentially resulting in a war between the US and China.

The probability of a Yes outcome occurring depends on various factors, including the willingness of some countries (like the United States) to take a more assertive stance on defending Taiwan. However, there are also risks and uncertainties surrounding this situation that could lead to a different outcome altogether.
