Here is a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

A consistent and comprehensive assessment of the situation suggests that the status quo outcome (no ceasefire) is more likely, as it is often easier for countries to maintain their current positions than to make significant changes. Russia's military advances in Ukraine have been significant, and Ukraine's resolve seems strong, making it challenging for either side to concede and agree to a ceasefire.

However, there are scenarios where diplomatic efforts and international pressure could lead to a breakthrough and a temporary truce. For instance, if Western nations impose stricter sanctions on Russia or provide significant military aid to Ukraine, this could give Russia an incentive to negotiate. Additionally, international pressure from major world powers, such as the United States, could facilitate a diplomatic solution.

Furthermore, it is essential to consider that countries can change their positions or make concessions in response to external factors or shifts in their internal dynamics. Therefore, while the status quo outcome may be more likely, there is still a non-negligible chance for a breakthrough leading to a temporary ceasefire.
