Here is a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The likelihood of Moldova controlling Transnistria before 2028 depends on various factors. The current status quo outcome, where Moldova does not control Transnistria, is likely to prevail unless significant changes occur in international relations or regional dynamics. Russia's influence over Transnistria and the region's historical independence make it unlikely that Moldova will suddenly gain control without a major shift.

However, there are potential scenarios that could lead to a No outcome (Moldova controlling Transnistria). A surprise diplomatic breakthrough facilitated by external powers like the European Union or the United States could result in significant concessions from both sides, leading to a unified government and international recognition. Alternatively, Moldovan authorities making political and economic concessions to Russia could lead Russia to lift its pressure on Transnistria and allow Moldova to take control.

On the other hand, a scenario resulting in a Yes outcome (Moldova controlling Transnistria) might involve gradual processes such as economic integration and cooperation between Moldova and Transnistria. As Moldovan gas supplies become more reliable, Transnistria might begin to rely less on Russian energy sources, paving the way for greater political coordination.

Despite these potential scenarios, the complex relationships between Moldova, Russia, and Ukraine make it challenging to predict significant changes in the short term. The ongoing conflict in Eastern Europe could create an environment in which Russia feels more comfortable supporting Transnistria's independence, making it harder for Moldova to assert its authority.

In conclusion, while there are potential flashpoints that could lead to a No outcome, the status quo outcome (Moldova not controlling Transnistria) is likely to prevail unless significant changes occur. The probability of Moldova controlling Transnistria before 2028 remains low.
