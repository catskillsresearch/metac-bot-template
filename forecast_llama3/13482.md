Here's a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The likelihood of a war between two or more EU states before 2153 depends on various factors. On one hand, the world tends to change slowly over time, and diplomacy can often manage tensions between nations. This suggests that the status quo outcome, where no war occurs, is likely ( Forecast 1, 2, and 3). 

On the other hand, the current global political climate is characterized by increasing nationalism, protectionism, and rivalries between major powers (Forecast 2 and 4). These trends could escalate tensions and lead to conflict if not managed effectively. Additionally, the possibility of unexpected events or changing circumstances that could lead to increased conflict cannot be ruled out (Forecast 2).

The time left until the outcome is known is approximately 128 years, which is a long time frame that allows for many variables to influence the outcome. However, considering the current trends and the potential for both positive and negative outcomes, it's reasonable to assume that the situation will continue to evolve over the next few decades.

Ultimately, the likelihood of a war between two or more EU states before 2153 depends on how nations respond to challenges and whether they can find common ground through diplomacy. If international cooperation and dialogue prevail, the status quo outcome is likely. However, if tensions escalate and nations become increasingly entrenched in their positions, the possibility of conflict increases.

Note that this combined rationale does not take into account the specific probabilities assigned by each forecaster. It focuses on incorporating the best insights from each forecast to create a comprehensive rationale.
