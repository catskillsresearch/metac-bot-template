Here is a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The percentage of fully electric vehicles on US roads by 2030 will be influenced by several factors, including government policies and regulations, technological advancements in battery technology and charging infrastructure, consumer preferences and behavior, and economic conditions.

In recent years, there has been a steady growth in the adoption of electric vehicles, driven by increasing concerns about climate change, air pollution, and energy security. This trend is likely to continue, with many experts expecting electric vehicles to make up around 20-30% of new car sales by 2030.

However, the pace of this growth will depend on various factors, including government policies and regulations. For example, if governments implement stricter emission regulations or offer more incentives for electric vehicle adoption, it could lead to a surge in demand and reach a higher market share.

On the other hand, unexpected scenarios such as a sudden increase in gas prices, a shift away from electric vehicles, or significant increases in battery costs could slow down adoption rates and result in lower market shares.

Despite these uncertainties, there are several factors that suggest electric vehicle adoption will continue to grow at a rapid pace. For example, the cost of batteries is decreasing rapidly, making electric vehicles more competitive with traditional internal combustion engine vehicles. Additionally, many companies are investing heavily in the development of electric vehicle technology, and governments are implementing policies to support the transition to electric vehicles.

Overall, while there are many factors that could influence the growth of electric vehicle adoption, it seems likely that this trend will continue, with fully electric vehicles making up around 20-30% of new car sales by 2030. However, there is still significant uncertainty surrounding this prediction, and the actual outcome may be higher or lower than this estimate.

(Note: This rationale does not include specific numerical predictions like the original forecasts, but rather provides a general framework for understanding the factors that will influence electric vehicle adoption.)
