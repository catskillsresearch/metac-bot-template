Here is a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome is known is approximately 4-5 years (2025-2030), which provides some uncertainty in predicting whether AI will revolutionize the global economy. The status quo outcome, where AI continues to advance and become more integrated into various industries, but does not necessarily transform the global economy, is a likely scenario. However, considering the rapid pace of AI development and its potential transformative impact on various sectors, there is a possibility for significant breakthroughs that could accelerate its impact on the global economy.

A scenario that results in a No outcome would be if AI development slows down or plateaus due to regulatory challenges, ethical concerns, or lack of investment. On the other hand, a scenario that results in a Yes outcome would be if there are significant breakthroughs in AI research and development, leading to widespread adoption across industries, increased productivity, job creation, and economic growth.

The key factors that will influence the outcome include policymakers' willingness to invest in infrastructure, education, and social safety nets to support the transition to an AI-driven economy, as well as innovation in areas like renewable energy, sustainable agriculture, or biotechnology. Additionally, societal acceptance of AI and its potential impact on employment and daily life will also play a crucial role.

Overall, while there are risks and uncertainties involved, the rapid advancements in AI and its potential to disrupt industries make it more likely that AI will revolutionize the global economy by 2030.
