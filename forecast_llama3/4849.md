Here is a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The likelihood of a science fiction novel originally written in Spanish winning a major science fiction award before 2031 depends on the status quo outcome as well as potential changes or surprises. Historical trends suggest that literary awards tend to stick to established patterns and genres, which would result in no significant changes (status quo outcome). However, there is always room for innovation and change in the literary world, particularly in genres like science fiction and fantasy. A shift in public opinion, new information coming to light, or a change in circumstances could lead to a "Yes" outcome.

Furthermore, while it's possible that some authors may continue to dominate certain categories, there is also potential for newcomers to emerge and challenge the status quo. The fact that there are many other books and authors competing for awards means that unexpected events or biases on the part of award committees could influence the outcome. However, a significant shift in popular culture towards science fiction could lead to recognition for innovative works.

Overall, while it's difficult to predict with certainty what will happen, considering both the status quo outcome and potential changes or surprises is essential when forecasting this question.
