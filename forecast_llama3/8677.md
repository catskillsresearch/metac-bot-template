Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to the question is unknown, and the information available up until now is not sufficient to make a definitive prediction. However, considering alternative scenarios, it seems likely that small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs) will not become widely adopted as a solution for data centers' electricity needs in the near term. The status quo outcome suggests that data centers will continue to rely on traditional energy sources and grids, with some experimenting with renewable energy solutions like solar and wind power.

However, there are also scenarios that could drive change, such as technological advancements or regulatory changes that make SMRs more viable options. For instance, breakthroughs in materials science or advancements in nuclear design could lead to the widespread adoption of SMRs as a solution for meeting data center energy demands.

Additionally, it is possible that unforeseen factors could influence the outcome, leading to a scenario where SMRs become a prominent source of electricity generation. This could be driven by a rapid increase in demand for electricity due to the widespread adoption of electric vehicles, artificial intelligence, and other emerging technologies, or by concerns about grid stability or the intermittency of renewable energy sources.

Overall, while it is difficult to predict with certainty whether SMRs will supply at least 1% of any nation's electricity by 2030, a balanced analysis of the available information suggests that this outcome is less likely than not.
