Here's a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The analysis suggests that the status quo outcome is most likely, as the world tends to change slowly. However, this does not mean that sudden changes cannot occur. The historical context and entrenched interests at play in the conflict between Ukraine and Russia suggest that the situation may persist unless significant breakthroughs are made.

A scenario that could lead to a "No" outcome (no civil war) is one where diplomatic efforts and international pressure lead to a comprehensive ceasefire agreement, followed by a gradual withdrawal of Russian forces from Ukrainian territory. This could be facilitated by a combination of economic sanctions, military deterrence, and changes in global politics.

On the other hand, a scenario that could lead to a "Yes" outcome (civil war) is one where the conflict escalates due to rising tensions between the US and Russia, increased military aid to Ukraine from the West, and a failure to achieve a negotiated settlement. This could be fueled by the desire of powerful actors to demonstrate their strength and resolve in the face of Russian aggression.

The complexity of international relations and the unpredictability of political decisions suggest that both scenarios are possible. However, the slow-changing nature of global events and the entrenched interests involved make it more likely that the status quo outcome will persist unless significant breakthroughs are made.

By considering these factors, we can conclude that the probability of a "No" outcome (no civil war) is relatively high due to the ongoing diplomatic efforts and international pressure. However, the complexity of the situation and the potential for unforeseen events to alter the situation mean that there is still a significant chance of a "Yes" outcome (civil war).
