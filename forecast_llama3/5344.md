Here's a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to the question is known is still uncertain, with some scenarios suggesting a shorter timeframe (3-4 years) and others leaving more room for uncertainty. However, considering the typical cycle of breakthroughs in physics research and technological advancements, it's likely that significant progress will be made before 2050.

The status quo outcome if nothing changed would likely involve incremental progress and no revolutionary discoveries, with a possibility of stagnation in the field if there is a lack of significant funding or support for cutting-edge research initiatives. However, the possibility of unexpected breakthroughs or game-changing discoveries that could alter the course of events should not be discounted.

A scenario that results in a No outcome could involve the Nobel Committee's selection process not finding suitable candidates or being flawed, leading to no award being given. On the other hand, a scenario that results in a Yes outcome would involve significant advancements or innovations in physics, such as the convergence of multiple research areas like quantum computing and artificial intelligence, driving innovation and breakthroughs in our understanding of fundamental physics principles.

Overall, it's more likely that there won't be significant changes in the Nobel Prize in Physics, but the possibility of unexpected breakthroughs or discoveries should not be discounted.
