Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

A good forecaster would consider multiple factors when evaluating the likelihood of perfect play resulting in White winning. First, it is important to acknowledge the status quo outcome, which suggests that chess will continue to be ongoing with no clear winner or loser, at least for the time being. This is consistent with the idea that the world changes slowly, and chess is a game that has been around for centuries.

However, this does not mean that there are not scenarios that could lead to a No outcome or a Yes outcome. A possible scenario for a No outcome is if one of the players makes a critical mistake, such as blundering away their queen, which would give their opponent an insurmountable advantage. On the other hand, a scenario that could result in a Yes outcome is if one of the players makes a series of well-calculated moves that put pressure on their opponent, ultimately forcing them to resign or making it impossible for them to continue playing.

The probability of these outcomes depends on various factors, such as the skill level and strategic thinking of the players involved, as well as any external factors that might affect the game. Ultimately, the likelihood of perfect play resulting in White winning will depend on a complex interplay of these factors.

Note: This combined rationale does not take into account the final predictions (probabilities) provided by each forecast, but rather focuses on combining their rationales to create a new, consistent explanation for why perfect play might result in White winning.
