Here's a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome is known is approximately 24 years (considering the earliest space elevator development plans are scheduled for 2027). The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be that space elevators remain in the conceptual or experimental phase, with no major breakthroughs or implementations yet. This aligns with the current state of research and development in this area.

A scenario that results in a No outcome could be the failure to develop materials strong enough to support the weight and stress of a space elevator, either due to technological limitations or lack of funding. Alternatively, significant technical challenges, regulatory hurdles, or environmental concerns may also prevent the construction of a space elevator.

On the other hand, a scenario that results in a Yes outcome could involve breakthroughs in materials science, advancements in manufacturing processes, or innovative solutions for anchoring and stabilizing the tether. Governments or private companies investing heavily in research and development, and allocating significant resources to build such infrastructure, could also lead to a yes outcome.

Given these factors, it is reasonable to expect that space elevators are unlikely to become a reality in the near term, as they require significant technological advancements, material innovations, and substantial investments. However, breakthroughs or advancements in these areas could lead to a revolutionizing of space travel, making it faster, cheaper, and more environmentally friendly.

Note: This rationale combines the insights from all five forecasts without explicitly stating that it is summarizing or combining original rationales.
