Here is a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The likelihood of most of the first 100 IQ-selected "designer babies" being born in China depends on various factors. Initially, it's essential to consider the status quo outcome, where current trends and regulations prevail, and gene editing and AI applications in reproductive technology continue to evolve without significant changes or breakthroughs. This scenario is plausible, given the rapid pace of technological advancements and the potential for powerful entities to drive innovation.

However, it's also crucial to acknowledge the possibility of unforeseen events, international agreements, or environmental concerns driving a change in the direction of gene editing and AI applications. The creation of "designer babies" could be influenced by factors such as government policies, public opinion, and ethical considerations.

Furthermore, considering the uncertainty surrounding the outcome, it's essential to assess the weight of evidence supporting or contradicting the possibility of most "designer babies" being born in China. This involves evaluating the current research landscape, technological advancements, and potential barriers or challenges that could arise.

Ultimately, a consistent rationale for this forecast would be a balanced consideration of these factors, taking into account the status quo outcome while also acknowledging the potential for unforeseen events or changes to drive a different outcome.
