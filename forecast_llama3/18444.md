Here's a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 2 years (2025-06-14 to 2027). The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be that China does not invade Taiwan, and the two countries continue their complex relationship with diplomatic efforts and economic interactions. A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome could include international pressure, particularly from the United States, preventing Beijing from taking military action. Alternatively, internal divisions within the Chinese government might hinder Xi Jinping's plans for an invasion.

On the other hand, a scenario that results in a Yes outcome could involve China becoming increasingly assertive in its claims to Taiwan and Xi Jinping deciding to use military force to achieve his goal, driven by various factors such as a desire to demonstrate strength ahead of the Chinese Communist Party's 20th National Congress or a perceived threat from Taiwan's independence movement.

Given these factors, I believe that the status quo outcome (Taiwan remaining independent) is the most likely scenario, as it represents the current situation and there is no immediate indication of an imminent invasion. However, considering the recent escalation of tensions between China and Taiwan, as well as the military preparations on both sides, I also consider the possibility of a Chinese invasion occurring.
