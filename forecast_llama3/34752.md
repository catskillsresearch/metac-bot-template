Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The likelihood of 2025 being one of the hottest years on record globally depends on several factors. Firstly, it is essential to consider the current trend and patterns in global temperatures, which have shown an upward trend over the past few years. This status quo outcome assumes no significant changes in climate drivers or extreme weather events occur.

A scenario resulting in a No outcome would require an unexpected cooling event, such as a sudden and sustained decrease in greenhouse gas emissions or an unforeseen large-scale natural climate oscillation. Alternatively, a brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome could involve continued high levels of greenhouse gas emissions, no significant cooling events, and a continuation of the trend observed in previous years.

Given the current trends and patterns, it is likely that 2025 will continue to experience rising temperatures, potentially breaking records. This could be exacerbated by factors such as extreme weather patterns or unforeseen natural climate variability. However, there is always a possibility for natural climate variability or unexpected cooling events that could lead to a decline in global temperatures.

In addition, considering the time left until the outcome is known and the short duration of this period, it is reasonable to assume that any significant changes in greenhouse gas emissions or other factors would need to occur rapidly to alter the trajectory.
