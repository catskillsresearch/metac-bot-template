Here's a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome is known is indefinite, as it depends on various factors such as international cooperation, scientific consensus, and global political dynamics. The status quo outcome would likely be a continuation of current efforts to address climate change through conventional means, such as reducing emissions and increasing energy efficiency, which have shown limited success in slowing down global warming.

A scenario that results in a No outcome could be one where global leaders and international organizations prioritize sustainable solutions, carbon capture technologies, and non-violent methods to combat climate change. This would lead to gradual but effective progress in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and slowing down the rate of global warming.

On the other hand, a scenario that results in a Yes outcome could involve a catastrophic event such as a massive nuclear bomb detonation, which fails to effectively neutralize carbon dioxide emissions and instead causes widespread destruction and radioactive contamination. Alternatively, unchecked climate change could lead to catastrophic consequences such as sea-level rise, food shortages, and mass migration.

This thought process considers the various factors that could influence the outcome, including international cooperation, scientific consensus, and global political dynamics. It also acknowledges the potential risks and uncertainties associated with extreme measures like nuclear bomb detonation, while recognizing the need for effective climate change mitigation strategies.
