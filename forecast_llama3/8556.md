Here's a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

Given that the world often changes slowly, it's reasonable to expect that current trends will continue unless there are significant efforts to address the issue. In this case, more than half of adults worldwide being overweight or obese by 2050 is a likely scenario based on current trends and data. However, there is also a possibility for significant global efforts to promote healthy lifestyles, increase access to nutritious food and exercise options, and invest in healthcare infrastructure. This could potentially lead to a slowdown or reversal of the trend towards higher obesity rates.

It's also important to consider that the likelihood of a different outcome increases as more time passes, allowing for changes in societal attitudes, government policies, and individual behaviors. Nevertheless, given the steady increase in global obesity levels since 1990, it's reasonable to assume that the status quo outcome is more likely than not.

Ultimately, the key factors influencing the outcome are the efforts made by governments, organizations, and individuals to address the root causes of obesity, as well as the pace at which current trends continue.
