Here's a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The continued decline in global freedom levels is a trend that has been observed for many years, and it would take significant and sudden changes to reverse this trend. As good forecasters tend to put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time, it's more likely that the report will continue to show a decline in global freedom. While there are always factors that can influence the outcome, such as unexpected events or significant changes in political landscapes, the historical trends and recent reports suggest that global freedom will continue to decline or remain stagnant.

The rise of authoritarian regimes and the erosion of democratic norms can be fueled by various factors, including the increasing influence of social media manipulation, propaganda, and disinformation. This can further erode public trust in institutions and promote divisive politics, leading to a continued decline in global freedom levels. Additionally, international pressure on governments to respect human rights is necessary for any improvement in global freedom, but it's uncertain whether such pressure will be sufficient to reverse the current trend.

Overall, while there are scenarios where freedom might improve, the current global context and historical patterns make a decline in global freedom more likely.
