Here's a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately [insert timeframe, e.g., 5-6 months] before the Norwegian parliamentary election in September 2025. The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be that Norway does not announce an EU membership application and continues to maintain its independence outside of the European Union.

The current political landscape suggests that significant changes are needed for Norway to take the next steps towards EU membership. There has been no significant surge in public support or government momentum for Norway to join the EU recently, and ongoing debates among Norwegian politicians have resulted in a stalemate.

However, it's essential to consider scenarios that could lead to a different outcome. A new government formed after the September 2025 parliamentary election with a strong majority of pro-EU parties could prioritize EU membership and successfully navigate the application process and referendum within four years. Additionally, international events and global trends could also contribute to a more favorable environment for Norway's potential EU membership.

Considering these factors, it appears that the status quo outcome (No) is more likely than not. However, scenarios that result in a Yes outcome are possible if significant changes occur, such as improved economic conditions or increased security concerns driving Norway towards greater integration with the EU and its institutions.

Overall, while there may be uncertainty surrounding the parliamentary election and ongoing debates among Norwegian politicians, the most likely scenario is that Norway will not announce an EU membership application and will continue to maintain its independence outside of the European Union.
