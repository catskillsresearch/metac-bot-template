Here's a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to the question is unknown, but it can be assumed that significant breakthroughs in genetic editing and gerontology research will continue to drive progress in the near future. The status quo outcome if nothing changed is that mice will continue to age and die at their current rate, while humans will not significantly extend their lifespan, and the woolly mammoth will remain extinct.

A scenario that results in a No outcome could be the emergence of unforeseen challenges or technological limitations that hinder the development of effective anti-aging treatments or de-extinction efforts. Conversely, a scenario that results in a Yes outcome would involve significant advancements in genetic editing techniques, gene expression manipulation, and/or artificial intelligence that enable more efficient and effective use of mice in scientific studies, leading to breakthroughs in anti-aging research and de-extinction efforts.

This combination of factors suggests that while the timeline for achieving these outcomes is uncertain, the potential for progress remains high. Therefore, it's likely that we will see significant breakthroughs in the near future that could lead to a mouse being confirmed to have lived for 2,500 days before January 2035.
