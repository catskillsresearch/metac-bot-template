Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The situation surrounding Pakistan recognizing the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan is complex and influenced by various factors. One key consideration is the time left until the outcome is known, which could be anywhere from a few months to several years. The status quo outcome is likely to be Pakistan not recognizing the Islamic Emirate, reflecting historical tensions and ideological differences between the two countries.

However, there are scenarios that could lead to a change in this status quo. One possible scenario is if both sides demonstrate genuine willingness to resolve outstanding issues and make concessions. This might involve Pakistan addressing concerns about terrorism, border security, or economic cooperation, while the Islamic Emirate makes significant progress on these fronts. Another scenario is if external factors like China play a mediating role between Pakistan and the Islamic Emirate, using its influence to facilitate dialogue and compromise.

In addition, internal dynamics within both countries could also impact the likelihood of recognition. For instance, a change in leadership or political climate could lead to a shift towards normalization with the Islamic Emirate. On the other hand, if tensions remain high and there is no significant change on either side, it's likely that recognition would not be forthcoming.

Considering these various factors, it's clear that predicting whether Pakistan will recognize the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan before 2030 requires careful analysis of the complex dynamics at play.
