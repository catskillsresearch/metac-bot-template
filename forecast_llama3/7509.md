Here is the combined rationale:

Time left until the outcome to be known: Most experts agree that the time frame for the outcome to be confirmed is around 5-10 years, considering the current regulatory landscape and potential drivers of change.

Status quo outcome if nothing changed: The current trend of Bitcoin adoption and growth seems likely to continue unless there's a significant external shock or regulatory change that could reverse this trend. This means we can expect moderate growth in Bitcoin adoption and use cases over the next few years, with major companies already holding Bitcoin as a long-term asset on their balance sheet.

Scenarios for No outcomes: A scenario that results in a No outcome is one where governments around the world intensify their efforts to regulate cryptocurrency, making it harder for individuals to access and use Bitcoin. In this scenario, the lack of mainstream acceptance and limited infrastructure would hinder widespread adoption. Another scenario is that regulatory bodies like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) continue to view Bitcoin as an unregistered security, which could further solidify the status quo.

Scenarios for Yes outcomes: A scenario that results in a Yes outcome is one where cryptocurrencies become more mainstream, with governments recognizing their potential benefits and implementing policies to support their growth. This could lead to increased investment, improved infrastructure, and broader accessibility, ultimately driving widespread adoption. Another scenario is that governments recognize the growing importance of digital currencies and their potential benefits in terms of diversification and financial inclusion, leading them to reconsider their stance on major companies holding Bitcoin.

By combining these rationales, we can identify key factors that will influence the outcome: regulatory landscape, market trends, and societal factors.
