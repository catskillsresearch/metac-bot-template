Here is a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 2-6 months (depending on various factors such as diplomatic efforts, military tactics, internal developments, and international pressure). Given this timeframe, it's essential to consider the status quo outcome if nothing changed. In this scenario, Russia would likely maintain its strong presence in Ukraine, with both sides continuing to exchange blows, making significant progress towards a peaceful resolution unlikely.

A scenario that results in a No outcome (Ukraine and Russia do not hold elections by 2025) could involve continued conflict between the two nations, leading to increased international pressure and diplomatic efforts. This may fail to yield the desired results, allowing the status quo to persist. On the other hand, a breakthrough in negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, driven by external factors (such as international pressure or economic incentives) or internal developments (like changes in leadership or shifts in public opinion), could lead to a Yes outcome.

Ultimately, the probability of a post-Putin Russia substantially democratizing within 5 years will depend on the effectiveness of diplomatic efforts, the willingness of key stakeholders to make concessions, and the impact of international pressure. While some factors may be more influential than others, it is impossible to predict with certainty which scenario will unfold.
