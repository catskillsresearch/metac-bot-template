Here's a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The likelihood of a China-India war by 2035 depends on various factors, including the current dynamics between China, the US, and India. The status quo outcome is likely to remain unchanged, with tensions between China and the US persisting, driven by competing interests, technological advancements, and global events. This could lead to increased competition for influence in Asia, potentially drawing India into their orbit.

However, there are scenarios that could result in a No outcome or a Yes outcome. A scenario where the US-China trade war escalates into a full-blown conflict could lead to a decline in global trade, affecting India's economy and potentially triggering military conflicts between China and India. On the other hand, a scenario where both countries experience significant economic downturns or political changes could lead to a renewed focus on cooperation and reduced tensions.

India's defense readiness is likely to increase due to tensions with China, driven by its own economic interests and regional security concerns. However, whether this increased preparedness will be enough to deter a conflict remains uncertain.
