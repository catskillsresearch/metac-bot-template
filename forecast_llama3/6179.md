Here is a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The likelihood of the USA entering a second civil war before 2031 depends on various factors, including the stability and cooperation among nations. The status quo outcome, where the world continues as it currently is, has a higher probability due to the slow pace of change in global politics, economies, and international relations. However, sudden shifts or shocks can still lead to unexpected outcomes.

A possible scenario that could result in a No outcome (no civil war) would be if there is a significant shift towards greater cooperation and diplomacy between nations, driven by factors such as increased dialogue, negotiation, arms control agreements, and a growing recognition of the devastating consequences of conflict. On the other hand, a deterioration in international relations and global governance could lead to an increase in tensions and conflicts.

Additionally, the likelihood of a civil war depends on the level of social tensions and economic conditions within the USA. A strong economy with low unemployment rates, coupled with effective diplomacy and international cooperation, can reduce the likelihood of conflicts. However, significant economic downturns or widespread poverty could rise social tensions, increasing the risk of conflict.

In conclusion, while there are always risks of conflict, the probability of a civil war in the USA before 2031 is relatively low due to the complex web of international relationships and the many factors working against such an outcome.
