Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until humanity uses more than one millionth of the sun's energy output is unknown and unpredictable with certainty. However, based on current trends and developments, it seems that some outcomes might be within the next few centuries or millennia. 

If nothing changes, humanity will likely continue to develop at its current pace, with some ups and downs along the way. This means that we can expect to see continued growth in renewable energy sources, advancements in technology, and improvements in our understanding of the universe.

The outcome if the current trend continues is uncertain, but it's possible that humanity might reach peak development by 2371 and start using all planetary energy. However, this milestone could also be accompanied by significant environmental degradation and potential catastrophic consequences due to rapid energy consumption.

Experts and markets generally expect that humanity will transition to renewable energy sources and adapt to climate change. Some predictions suggest that we could reach peak development in as little as 50-200 years, while others estimate it may take centuries or even millennia.

An unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome is if humanity fails to adapt to the challenges posed by climate change, leading to catastrophic consequences and limiting its ability to reach higher levels of development. On the other hand, an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome could be breakthroughs in energy production and storage, allowing it to harness and control its star (Type 2 civilization), granting immense powers and potentially leading to a new era for human civilization.
