Here is a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome is known is uncertain, as it depends on various factors such as future events and decisions made by different individuals or organizations. The status quo outcome if nothing changed would likely be that unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAPs) continue to be a topic of interest and debate, with some people believing they are evidence of alien life or other unexplained phenomena. However, without concrete evidence or official confirmation, the UAP phenomenon remains a mystery.

A scenario that results in a No outcome could be that all reported UAP sightings can be explained by natural phenomena, misidentification of known objects, or human error, and therefore there is no need for further investigation or concern. On the other hand, a scenario that results in a Yes outcome could be that new evidence emerges, such as physical samples or conclusive photographic or video evidence, that proves the existence of extraterrestrial life or other unexplained phenomena.

The likelihood of these outcomes depends on various factors, including the pace of scientific advancements and the willingness of governments and institutions to investigate and analyze UAP sightings. While there are many uncertainties surrounding this topic, it is possible to assign a moderate probability to both the No and Yes outcomes based on the current state of knowledge and the potential for new evidence to emerge.

Note that predicting the outcome of a question about UAPs is challenging due to the lack of concrete evidence and the complexity of the phenomenon. However, by considering the various factors at play and the possible scenarios that could unfold, it is possible to develop a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale.
