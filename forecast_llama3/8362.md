Here is a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to this question is known is approximately 9-10 years, leaving ample room for events to unfold and shape the outcome. The status quo outcome would be a "No" - i.e., no global war involving major economic powers by 2035 - as most countries are working towards peaceful resolution of conflicts through diplomacy and international cooperation.

One possible scenario that could result in a "No" outcome is if world leaders prioritize dialogue, compromise, and cooperation over conflict resolution. This could involve continued development of international institutions, agreements, and organizations designed to promote peace and stability. Additionally, advancements in technology and communication might further reduce the likelihood of misunderstandings leading to war.

Another possible scenario that could result in a "Yes" outcome is if tensions between major powers continue to escalate due to issues such as nationalism, ideological differences, or strategic competition. A miscalculation or provocative move could trigger a chain reaction, leading to an all-out war. This might be fueled by technological advancements, changes in the global power balance, or external events like cyber attacks or natural disasters.

However, while there are potential risks and tensions between major powers, it's unlikely that a full-scale global war will break out. The status quo outcome is more likely, with minor conflicts or proxy wars remaining a possibility. Nevertheless, the situation remains fragile, and sudden changes could alter the trajectory of events.

Overall, the likelihood of a global war by 2035 depends on various factors, including the ability of world leaders to prioritize diplomacy and cooperation, as well as the potential for miscalculations or unforeseen events that could escalate tensions.
