Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to the question is known is considerable, considering recent developments and investigations in the sports world. The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be that existing rules and regulations remain unchanged, and players, coaches, and teams continue to operate without significant disruptions.

A scenario that results in a No outcome could be the absence of new information or events that would significantly alter the outcomes. This means that Pat Hoberg remains fired from his position as an MLB umpire, Jontay Porter's ban from the NBA stands, and Terry Rozier is not charged with any wrongdoing related to illegal betting.

On the other hand, a scenario that results in a Yes outcome could be if new evidence emerges or additional information comes to light that supports the original findings and allegations against Pat Hoberg, Jontay Porter, or Terry Rozier. This could lead to changes or disruptions in the sports world, particularly with regards to gambling and betting.

Considering these scenarios, it is possible that there could be some changes or disruptions in the future, which would increase the likelihood of at least one professional athlete being banned or suspended for sports betting before 2026. However, the existing rules and regulations in place also suggest a status quo outcome where nothing changes.

Ultimately, the probability of this event occurring depends on various factors and events that have not yet occurred.

### Probability: 70%
