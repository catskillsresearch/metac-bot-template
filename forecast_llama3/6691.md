Here's a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The likelihood of any part of Great Britain being under monarchy in 2075 depends on various factors, including global politics, international relations, economic circumstances, and societal trends. The current status quo outcome is that the UK remains an independent country with its own government, economy, and culture, which has historically maintained its independence.

However, there are scenarios that could influence the outcome. A significant shift in global politics, international relations, or economic circumstances could lead to a major agreement or treaty that paves the way for the UK to become part of another country, potentially under a monarchy. This could involve factors such as changes in leadership, shifts in national priorities, or new forms of cooperation.

Conversely, there are also scenarios that could result in the status quo outcome prevailing. For example, if Prince William assumes the throne and leads the royal family through a period of stability and continuity, this could lead to a smooth transition of power and maintain the monarchy's role in British society. Alternatively, public opinion may turn against the monarchy, leading to widespread protests and calls for change that ultimately result in its abolition or significant reform.

Overall, while there are various factors at play, it is likely that the status quo outcome will prevail, with the UK maintaining its independence and the monarchy continuing to exist in some form. However, it's essential to acknowledge that unforeseen circumstances could lead to a scenario where the UK is considered for annexation or significant reform of the monarchy.
