Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome is known varies across different scenarios. However, considering the pace of technological change and the rapid progress made in areas like AI research, natural language processing, computer vision, and machine learning, it's likely that significant breakthroughs will be made in these fields.

Currently, there are a few countries with established AI research programs, which might continue to grow without reaching more than two additional countries launching their own AI research programs. However, if significant breakthroughs are made in areas such as cognitive architectures or the development of new AI-related technologies, this could spark a global interest in AI research, leading multiple countries to invest heavily in developing their own AI capabilities.

While there have been impressive advancements in AI research in recent years, it's still unclear whether these developments will lead to the creation of truly general-purpose AI systems. Nevertheless, significant progress is being made in areas such as natural language processing and computer vision, which could allow for the development of more sophisticated AI models that can solve complex problems without human intervention.

Considering the current pace of technological change and the rapid progress made in AI research, it's possible that we might see an explosion of AI-generated images, innovative and specific AI applications, or the emergence of new areas of focus within the next 5 years. This could be driven by increased funding for AI research, the development of more accessible and user-friendly tools, or the emergence of new applications that require large-scale image generation.

Overall, while there are various scenarios that could influence the outcome, considering the rapid progress made in AI research and development, it's likely that significant breakthroughs will be made within the next 5 years.
