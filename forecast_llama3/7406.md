Here's a rationale that combines the best of each individual rationale:

The world changes slowly most of the time, so it's reasonable to assume that the status quo outcome will persist unless there are significant external factors that drive change. In this case, the status quo outcome is that a non-state actor is unlikely to cause at least one fatality by detonating a nuclear device.

However, we must also consider alternative scenarios and their likelihood. One such scenario is the possibility of widespread opposition or support from local communities, environmental groups, and governments, which could lead to delays or cancellations of the project due to concerns about safety, cost, and environmental impact.

Another scenario to consider is the potential for breakthroughs in nuclear technology or asteroid deflection that could drastically alter the situation. While these scenarios are possible, they are not likely to occur without significant external factors driving change.

Ultimately, our forecast should balance the likelihood of the status quo outcome with the possibility of alternative scenarios occurring. By doing so, we can arrive at a probabilistic assessment that takes into account both the slow pace of change and the potential for unexpected events.
