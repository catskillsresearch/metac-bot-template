Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The situation in Ukraine and Russia's intentions are complex and influenced by various factors, including diplomatic efforts, economic sanctions, military actions, and international pressure. The status quo outcome, where Russia does not detonate nuclear weapons, is likely due to the slow pace of change in international politics and Russia's risk-averse nature. However, the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and the history of tensions between Russia and Western countries suggest that there could be a significant escalation of the conflict or an unexpected event that would lead Putin to use nuclear weapons.

A prolonged diplomatic effort, international pressure, and economic sanctions against Russia could decrease tensions between Russia and Western countries, making the use of nuclear weapons less likely. On the other hand, a scenario where Russia perceives a significant threat from Western countries, such as the deployment of military assets near its borders or an escalation of tensions over Ukraine, could lead Putin to decide to use nuclear capabilities to deter or respond to this perceived threat.

The uncertainty surrounding the outcome is influenced by various factors, including the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, diplomatic efforts between Russia and Western countries, and international pressure. While there are scenarios where tensions could escalate and lead to nuclear use, these are not the most likely outcomes given the current situation.
