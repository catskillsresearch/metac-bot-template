Here is a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The likelihood of transformer-derived architectures remaining state-of-the-art for language modeling in December 2025 depends on the balance between the status quo outcome and alternative scenarios. The status quo outcome is that transformers continue to dominate the field of natural language processing (NLP) due to their versatility, success in various NLP tasks, and widespread adoption.

However, there are also alternative scenarios where new breakthroughs in AI research or changes in the competitive landscape could lead to a decline in transformer dominance. These scenarios include the emergence of more efficient or effective algorithms, advancements in areas like memory-augmented neural networks or expert systems, or significant shifts in industry priorities and applications.

While it is difficult to pinpoint an exact timeline for when the outcome will be known, it is likely that the answer might be revealed within the next 6-12 months as new breakthroughs in AI research often take place at a faster pace than previously thought. Therefore, considering both the status quo outcome and alternative scenarios, it appears that transformer-derived architectures have a high likelihood of remaining state-of-the-art for language modeling in December 2025.

This rationale takes into account the uncertainty surrounding the emergence of new AI architectures or breakthroughs in areas like memory-augmented neural networks or expert systems. It also acknowledges the possibility of significant shifts in industry priorities and applications that could impact the dominance of transformer-derived models.
