Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 3 years, considering today's date (June 14th, 2025). If nothing changed, I would estimate that around 15-20% of new car sales would be electric vehicles (EVs), based on current growth rates and market trends. However, if the current trend continues, driven by increasing consumer demand, government incentives, and declining battery costs, I anticipate that EV sales could grow to around 25-30% of new car sales by 2027.

Experts and markets generally expect a significant increase in EV adoption, with some estimates reaching as high as 40-50%. However, unexpected scenarios could lead to either lower or higher outcomes. A severe economic downturn or trade war could result in slower growth rates, while rapid advancements in autonomous driving technology or breakthroughs in battery technology could accelerate the transition away from internal combustion engines.

Overall, considering these factors and trends, a consistent rationale for forecasting electric vehicle adoption by 2027 is that EV sales will likely continue to grow at a steady rate, driven by consumer demand, government incentives, and technological advancements. While unexpected scenarios could impact growth rates, I would anticipate that around 25-30% of new car sales will be electric vehicles by the end of 2027.
