Here is a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The likelihood of a 50% decline in global meat production by 2040 depends on various factors. On one hand, the status quo outcome suggests that meat consumption will continue to decline gradually over time, driven by increasing awareness of the environmental and health impacts of animal agriculture, as well as government initiatives promoting plant-based diets. This scenario is supported by trends of declining meat consumption in some regions, such as Spain.

On the other hand, a significant increase in global food production and consumption, driven by population growth, urbanization, and economic development, could lead to a continued high demand for animal products. Moreover, technological advancements in lab-grown meat and alternative protein sources may not be sufficient to significantly reduce demand for traditional animal-based products.

Furthermore, consumer behavior is influenced by factors such as government policies, public education campaigns, and changing lifestyles in emerging markets. The potential for policy changes, technological innovations, and environmental concerns to influence consumer behavior and lead to a decrease in meat consumption cannot be ruled out.

Ultimately, the likelihood of a 50% decline in global meat production by 2040 will depend on the interplay between these factors and the extent to which governments, international organizations, and industry stakeholders prioritize sustainable agriculture and plant-based diets.
