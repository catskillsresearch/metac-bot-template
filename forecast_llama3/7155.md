Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 5 years (from 2025 to 2030). The status quo outcome if nothing changed would likely be characterized by continued slow progress in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, with many countries struggling to meet their climate targets. This could lead to a scenario where global warming continues to rise, and its effects such as more frequent heatwaves, floods, and wildfires become even more severe.

One possible scenario that results in a No outcome is if there is no significant improvement in international cooperation and agreements on climate change. If countries continue to prioritize economic growth over environmental concerns, it may lead to further delays or even reversals in climate commitments, resulting in missed targets.

On the other hand, a scenario that could lead to a Yes outcome is if governments prioritizes climate action and implement policies to reduce emissions, such as transitioning away from fossil fuels, increasing energy efficiency, and promoting renewable energy sources. Additionally, if there is widespread public awareness and support for climate action, leading to individual and collective actions to reduce emissions.

The likelihood of significant progress on climate change depends on the level of international cooperation and agreements, as well as the pace of technological advancements and policy changes at the national level. While the status quo outcome may be more likely, there is still a possibility for positive change if governments and individuals take decisive action to address the climate crisis.
