Here's a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome is known is approximately 1-3 months, considering the ongoing nature of the events. The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be continued conflict between Russia and Ukraine, with little progress towards a resolution. This outcome assumes no significant new developments or shifts in policy or leadership.

A scenario that results in a No outcome could be one where Russia successfully annexes significant portions of Ukrainian territory, leading to a de facto partition of Ukraine and recognition by Western powers. Alternatively, it could be a situation where international pressure and diplomatic efforts lead to a ceasefire or withdrawal of Russian forces from Ukrainian territory.

On the other hand, a scenario that results in a Yes outcome could be one where Ukraine successfully repels Russian forces, regains control over its territory, and is recognized as a sovereign state by the international community. Alternatively, it could be a situation where Russia's military fortunes begin to wane, and the cost of the conflict becomes too great to sustain, prompting negotiations towards a ceasefire.

Given these scenarios, it appears that the status quo outcome (continued conflict) is more likely due to the entrenched positions of both countries and the slow pace of global changes. However, there are factors that could influence a different outcome, such as international pressure, diplomatic efforts, or military actions.
