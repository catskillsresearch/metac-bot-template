Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The question is: What will be the outcome?

(a) Time left until the outcome is known: The time frame for these predictions is up to 2030, which means we have approximately 5-12 years (2025-2030) or 60-90% of the time period left before the outcomes are known.

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: If nothing changes, the status quo outcome would likely be a continuation of the current trends and statistics, with poverty rates remaining high and income inequality persisting. Some regions may experience stagnation or even slight increases in poverty rates, while others might see slow but steady declines.

(c) Outcome if the current trend continued: If the current trend continues, we can expect poverty rates to remain relatively stable or even increase in some regions, while income inequality may continue to widen.

(d) Expectations of experts and markets: Experts are generally pessimistic about meeting the 2030 goal of eradicating extreme poverty, citing challenges such as climate change, economic inequality, and political instability. Markets might be more optimistic, but this is purely speculative. However, there is a general consensus that significant efforts are needed to achieve this goal.

(e) Unexpected scenario resulting in low outcome: An unexpected scenario could be a sudden and widespread adoption of sustainable practices, leading to increased food security and reduced poverty rates. Another possibility is the rapid development and deployment of innovative technologies that create jobs and stimulate local economies.

(f) Unexpected scenario resulting in high outcome: An unexpected scenario could be a global economic downturn triggered by factors like climate change, trade wars, or pandemics, leading to increased poverty rates. Another possibility is the failure of existing social safety nets and support systems, leaving vulnerable populations more exposed.

By combining these rationales, we can develop a comprehensive understanding of the potential outcomes for $1.90-a-day (2011 PPP) poverty by 2030.
