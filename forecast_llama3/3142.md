Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to the question is known depends on various factors such as technological advancements, government support, and private investment in space exploration. Currently, it's difficult to predict when exactly humans will establish a self-sufficient city on Mars.

Assuming current trends continue, it seems unlikely that a self-sufficient Martian city will be established by 2030. However, if significant progress is made in areas such as propulsion, life support systems, or radiation protection, the challenges involved in establishing a human settlement on another planet may be overcome more quickly than expected.

Experts and markets are likely to be divided on this issue, with some predicting advancements in technology and private investment will drive the development of a Martian city, while others are more skeptical about the feasibility of such a project. An unexpected scenario that could result in fewer people establishing a self-sufficient city on Mars by 2030 is if there's a significant delay or setback in technological advancements, leading to a lack of investment and progress in the field.

On the other hand, an unexpected scenario that could result in more people establishing a self-sufficient city on Mars by 2030 is if there's a breakthrough in sustainable life support systems or significant private investment, leading to rapid progress in Martian colonization.
