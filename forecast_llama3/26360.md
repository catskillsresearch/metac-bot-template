Here's a rationale that combines the best of each individual rationale:

The world has trended towards cooperation and diplomacy in recent decades, with localized conflicts being the norm rather than a full-scale war. This status quo outcome is likely to continue unless significant changes occur in global politics, international relations, or societal values.

A scenario where diplomatic efforts and international cooperation continue to resolve conflicts peacefully could lead to a more stable and peaceful world order, reducing the likelihood of a global conflict. However, there are potential risks and challenges associated with emerging technologies like Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), which could exacerbate tensions between nations if not managed carefully.

The rise of AGI could also bring about unprecedented benefits, such as improved healthcare, education, and economic opportunities, which would likely outweigh the risks and contribute to a more peaceful and prosperous world. Nevertheless, there are concerns that some nations may seek to use AGI as a means to gain a military advantage, leading to an arms race that ultimately escalates into conflict.

Despite these challenges, it is essential to recognize that humanity has learned from history and will strive for cooperation rather than conflict. The benefits of international cooperation, economic interdependence, and the rise of international institutions could help prevent conflicts from escalating into full-blown wars.

Ultimately, while there are potential risks and challenges ahead, the trend towards cooperation and diplomacy suggests that a global catastrophe like World War III is unlikely to occur in the next five years unless significant changes occur in global politics or societal values.
