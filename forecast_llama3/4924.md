Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) has historically been opposed to same-sex marriage, but there are signs of evolution and adaptation to changing societal norms. The church's current stance on same-sex marriage is unlikely to change dramatically in the near future, but internal discussions, external pressures from stakeholders, and a growing recognition of the importance of inclusivity and acceptance may prompt some adjustments.

The church's leadership has shown willingness to revise its teachings and practices in response to changing societal attitudes and values. For instance, the church has supported initiatives promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion. This suggests that the church may be open to reconsidering its stance on same-sex marriage if internal discussions and debates lead to a more inclusive approach.

On the other hand, traditionalist views within the church and external pressures from conservative groups may continue to influence the church's stance on same-sex marriage. The church's priority on maintaining its core beliefs and traditions also suggests that significant changes are unlikely in the near future.

Considering these factors, it is likely that the status quo outcome will prevail, with the LDS Church continuing to evolve and adapt while maintaining its traditional teachings on marriage and family. However, there is a chance that internal discussions and debates may lead to some adjustments or reconsideration of the church's stance on same-sex marriage in the future.
