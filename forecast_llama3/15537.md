Based on the rationales provided by each forecast, here's a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each:

The time left until the outcome to this question is known is approximately 5-10 years, considering the ongoing trends and developments in international politics, technological advancements, and environmental concerns. The status quo outcome if nothing changed would likely see ongoing development of existing nuclear technologies, with some countries investing in new reactor designs and others focusing on advanced fuel cycles.

However, a scenario that could result in a "No" outcome is a significant increase in international cooperation and agreements aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions, accompanied by a shift towards renewable energy sources. This could lead to a decline in demand for nuclear power, as countries focus on developing cleaner technologies.

On the other hand, a scenario that could result in a "Yes" outcome is a significant increase in global tensions and geopolitical rivalries, leading to renewed interest in nuclear weapons and the development of new reactor designs. This could be driven by concerns about energy security, national security, or regional stability.

The likelihood of significant international cooperation and agreements aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions increases the chances of a "No" outcome, while ongoing concerns about nuclear safety and security, limited financial resources for nuclear power plant construction and maintenance, and increasing emphasis on renewable energy sources and decreasing dependence on fossil fuels all contribute to a low probability of a "Yes" outcome.

Furthermore, the slow pace of changes in government policies and technological advancements suggests that the status quo outcome is more likely to prevail. However, the possibility of sudden shifts in global energy priorities or significant advances in nuclear technology cannot be ruled out entirely, making it difficult to predict with certainty whether a new nuclear-armed state will emerge before 2030.
