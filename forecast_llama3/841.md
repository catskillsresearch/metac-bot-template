Here is a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to the question is known: 5 years. The status quo outcome if nothing changed: Metaculus will not exist in 2030, with AGI not being achieved and smartphones continuing to be an essential part of our daily lives.

A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome: If there are no significant breakthroughs or investments in AI research, and experts continue to caution against the risks associated with AGI, it's likely that Metaculus will not exist in 2030. This could be due to a lack of consensus on the ethics and societal implications of AGI or the need for more rigorous testing and validation.

A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome: If there is rapid progress in AI research, significant investment in developing AGI, and widespread adoption of this technology across industries, it's possible that Metaculus will exist in 2030. This could involve the development of more advanced AI algorithms, increased computing power, or novel applications of AI in areas like healthcare or finance.

While there are many experts working on developing AGI, the challenges and risks associated with this technology are significant, and it's unlikely that we will see a major breakthrough in the next 5 years. Additionally, even if AGI is achieved, it's uncertain whether Metaculus will be the primary platform for predicting AGI milestones.

Considering these scenarios, I would argue that the status quo outcome is more likely to occur, with a No outcome being the most plausible scenario. While there are many experts working on developing AGI, the challenges and risks associated with this technology are significant, and it's unlikely that we will see a major breakthrough in the next 5 years.
