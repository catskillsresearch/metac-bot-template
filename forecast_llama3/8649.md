Here's a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The likelihood of two national space agencies concluding that an interstellar object in our solar system has a non-human artificial origin by 2100 depends on various factors. The status quo outcome is likely that humanity will continue to face challenges and uncertainties in exploring space, with no significant breakthroughs leading to the detection and study of interstellar objects. However, there are scenarios where significant advancements could lead to a Yes outcome.

One possible scenario is that humanity prioritizes long-term investments in space exploration, develops advanced technologies, and fosters international cooperation, enabling us to detect and study interstellar objects. This could involve breakthroughs in propulsion systems, communication technology, and data analysis.

On the other hand, if humanity remains stuck in its current trajectory, with little progress made in areas like artificial intelligence, renewable energy, or space exploration, it is unlikely that we will achieve significant advancements in these areas, leading to a No outcome. This could be due to various factors such as lack of funding, bureaucratic hurdles, or societal priorities shifting away from these areas.

Ultimately, the probability of a Yes outcome depends on whether humanity can overcome the challenges and uncertainties involved in exploring space and making rapid breakthroughs in the necessary technologies.
