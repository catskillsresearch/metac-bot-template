Here's a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome is known is significant, with at least 2.5 years remaining before we can say with certainty whether a book written by a language model will make it to the NY Times Best Seller list before 2030.

In the status quo, it's likely that the trend of AI models "remembering" copyrighted content will continue, given the rapid advancements in this field and the growing importance of intellectual property protection. This could lead to an increased likelihood of a book written by a language model containing copyrighted content.

However, there are potential barriers and challenges that could slow down or halt the development of small and large language models, such as regulatory or societal barriers to their widespread adoption. Additionally, significant breakthroughs in understanding human creativity, storytelling, and context could lead to more sophisticated AI-generated books that resonate with readers.

On the other hand, if OpenAI makes significant advancements in NLP and creative vision, it's possible that we might see the publication of a book written by OpenAI models. Similarly, if there is continued investment in AI research and development, as well as increased adoption of these technologies in various industries, we may see an increase in the creation of copyrighted material without proper attribution or clearance.

Ultimately, the likelihood of a book written by a language model making it to the NY Times Best Seller list before 2030 depends on the interplay between these factors and how they shape the development and adoption of AI-generated content.
