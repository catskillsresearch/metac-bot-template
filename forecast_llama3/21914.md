Here is a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to the question is known will depend on various factors, including the specific event or action being predicted. However, considering the current state of the global economy and the potential for significant changes or surprises, it's reasonable to assume that there is still uncertainty surrounding the outcome.

In terms of the status quo outcome if nothing changed, it's likely that Bryan Caplan will continue to engage in his usual activities as an economist and public figure, without any major changes or events affecting him. This means he would likely continue to write papers, give talks, and participate in academic discussions, with no significant departures from his current career path.

However, the possibility of significant changes or surprises cannot be ruled out entirely. If there were a major shock to the global economy, such as a significant decline in consumer spending or a major trade war leading to widespread tariffs and disruptions to supply chains, it could lead to a recession by the end of 2025.

On the other hand, if the ongoing trade conflicts escalate into a full-blown trade war, it may slow down the US economy, leading to a recession. Alternatively, if there are new opportunities or demand for professional forecasters, and Bryan Caplan decides to pursue this path, then it is possible that he will become a professional forecaster.

In conclusion, while it's difficult to predict with certainty what will happen in the future, considering the potential for significant changes or surprises and the ongoing global economic trends, it's reasonable to assume that there is still uncertainty surrounding the outcome.
