Here's a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The status quo outcome if nothing changed would likely be characterized by China's continued involvement in India-Pakistan tensions, with no significant changes or escalations. This is supported by the current situation and the general tendency for the world to change slowly most of the time.

However, unforeseen circumstances can always arise to alter this situation. A scenario that could result in a "No" outcome would be if diplomatic efforts between India and China, as well as international community efforts, lead to a peaceful resolution of their disputes. This might involve cooperation on issues like climate change, economic development, or regional security concerns.

On the other hand, a scenario that could result in a "Yes" outcome would be if tensions between India and Pakistan continue to escalate, with China playing a more significant role as a mediator or even an arbitrator. This could lead to increased involvement from China, potentially resulting in a more substantial commitment to the region.

The time left until the outcome is known is relatively long-term, ranging from 1-3 months to 2-3 years. This allows for ongoing diplomatic efforts and potential changes in the situation that could influence the outcome.

Overall, while there are factors that could lead to either a "Yes" or "No" outcome, the current trend suggests that China's involvement in India-Pakistan tensions will likely continue unless unforeseen circumstances arise.
