Here's a rationale that combines the best of each individual rationale:

The status quo outcome is characterized by ongoing existential risks from climate change, nuclear proliferation, pandemics, and technological advancements. However, it is essential to consider the complexities and uncertainties involved in these scenarios.

One possible scenario that could lead to a "No" outcome is if humanity collectively recognizes the existential risks posed by these threats and takes concerted action to address them. This could involve international cooperation, technological innovations, and policy changes aimed at mitigating climate change, reducing nuclear arsenals, and developing more resilient societies.

On the other hand, a scenario that could lead to a "Yes" outcome is if humanity fails to address these existential risks or becomes complacent about the threats. This could involve continued political gridlock, technological stagnation, and environmental degradation, ultimately leading to catastrophic consequences.

Ultimately, the likelihood of human extinction depends on the balance between these two scenarios. While the status quo outcome suggests that humanity continues to exist with ongoing threats, it is also possible for humanity to adapt and evolve in response to these challenges.

Given the complexities and uncertainties involved, a consistent rationale can be developed by considering the following factors:

1. The status quo outcome: Human existence with ongoing existential risks.
2. The possibility of collective action to mitigate these risks.
3. The potential for catastrophic consequences if these risks are not addressed.

By balancing these factors, it is possible to develop a more nuanced understanding of the likelihood of human extinction in response to a nuclear conflict involving >1,000 detonations.
