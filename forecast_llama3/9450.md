Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual forecast:

The time left until the outcome to this question is known is approximately 25 years, considering the pace of technological advancements and changes in global energy policies. The status quo outcome if nothing changed would likely result in a modest increase in nuclear power capacity, potentially around 12-15% of the world's electricity generation by 2050.

However, experts and market analysts generally agree that nuclear power will play an increasingly important role in meeting growing energy demands. Many predict that nuclear energy will account for around 15-20% of the world's electricity generation by 2050, with some more optimistic projections reaching up to 25%.

An unexpected scenario that could result in a lower outcome is if there is a rapid increase in renewable energy sources and grid-scale storage capabilities, leading to a decrease in demand for nuclear power. This could result in the percentage of US nuclear power capacity decreasing to around 8-10% by 2050.

On the other hand, an unexpected scenario that could result in a higher outcome is if there is a significant breakthrough in small modular reactor (SMR) technology, leading to widespread adoption and rapid expansion of nuclear energy globally. This could result in the percentage of US nuclear power capacity increasing to around 25-30% by 2050.

Additionally, unprecedented breakthroughs in SMR technology or innovative financing models could lead to a surge in nuclear energy investments and a tripling of capacity by 2050.
