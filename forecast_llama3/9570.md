Here is a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The world has entered a period of long-term warming above 1.5°C, and it is likely that this trend will continue unless significant changes occur. The slow pace of change in human systems means that the status quo outcome of continued warming is more probable than not. While there are scenarios where emissions reductions could occur, leading to a No outcome, these are less likely to occur in the short term.

The current trajectory suggests that the world will continue on its current path of rising temperatures, with occasional extreme weather events and sea level rise. The continued reliance on fossil fuels and inadequate climate policies mean that the scenario resulting in a Yes outcome (continued warming) is also possible and has been observed historically.

However, it is not impossible for a significant global agreement to be reached or unforeseen technological breakthroughs to occur, leading to a sudden decline in greenhouse gas emissions and a slowing of the temperature increase. While these scenarios are less likely, they are not impossible, and the possibility of rapid change cannot be ruled out entirely.

Ultimately, the likelihood of the annual average temperature anomaly exceeding 2°C above the 1850-1899 baseline by 2037 depends on the pace of change in human systems and the effectiveness of mitigation efforts. While there is some room for uncertainty and potential surprises, the current trend suggests that continued warming is more probable than not.
