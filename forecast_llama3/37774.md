Here is a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 15-20 days, considering the current date and lack of official confirmation from either side. The status quo outcome if nothing changed is that Donald Trump has not yet visited China, as there has been no significant change in US-China relations or diplomatic visits between leaders.

A scenario that results in a No outcome could be that ongoing disagreements over trade issues or other political concerns lead to the visit being delayed or cancelled. This might also involve a shift in foreign policy priorities for the Trump administration, making a visit to China less likely.

On the other hand, a possible scenario that results in a Yes outcome is if there is progress in US-China trade talks, with both sides showing flexibility and a willingness to compromise. This could lead to an improvement in diplomatic ties, increasing the likelihood of Xi Jinping visiting Washington D.C. as planned.

Additionally, the fact that Xi Jinping has not yet visited Washington D.C. since Trump announced his visit in March 2025 suggests that there may be ongoing tensions or unresolved issues between the two countries, which could impact the likelihood of a visit occurring before July 1, 2025.

Overall, considering these factors and the current state of US-China relations, it is possible that either outcome (Yes or No) could occur.
