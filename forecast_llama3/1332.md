Here's a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 5-7 years, as the data provided only goes up to 2023. The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be that global malaria mortality rates continue to decline at a slow pace, with some fluctuations due to various factors such as changes in healthcare infrastructure, disease transmission patterns, and population dynamics.

A scenario that results in a No outcome (no progress in reducing malaria mortality rates) could involve a significant setback in the fight against malaria, such as a major funding cut for global health initiatives or a widespread outbreak of another infectious disease that diverts attention and resources away from malaria control efforts. This could lead to a stagnation or even an increase in malaria cases and deaths.

On the other hand, a scenario that results in a Yes outcome (significant progress in reducing malaria mortality rates) could involve sustained international cooperation, increased funding for malaria control programs, and continued advances in diagnostic tools, treatments, and prevention strategies. This could lead to a significant decline in malaria cases and deaths, potentially reaching the World Health Organization's goal of less than 5 deaths per 1,000 births by 2030.

The likelihood of achieving the desired outcome is influenced by both internal and external factors. Internally, it requires sustained efforts from governments, international organizations, and civil society to scale up interventions and investments in healthcare, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Externally, it also depends on global health funding, investments in healthcare infrastructure, and the collective response to disease outbreaks.

Overall, while there are challenges ahead, the trend of declining malaria mortality rates is generally positive, and with continued efforts and investment, it's possible to achieve significant progress by 2030.
