Here's a rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

Cryonics is a highly speculative and controversial practice, and its adoption rate is influenced by various factors. The status quo outcome would likely be an increase in interest and demand for cryonic preservation services, driven by advances in technology and changes in societal attitudes towards death and mortality.

If the current trend continues, we can expect moderate progress in cryopreservation technology, with some experts being skeptical about its feasibility or ethics. Experts and markets generally expect incremental advancements, but overall skepticism and caution prevail.

However, unexpected scenarios could significantly impact the outcome. On one hand, a sudden breakthrough in disease treatment or medical technology could reduce interest in cryonics. On the other hand, significant investments in cryopreservation research could lead to major scientific discoveries, increasing the likelihood of successful revivals and driving further growth in the industry.

In addition, public attitudes towards cryonics are crucial. A sudden increase in public backlash against cryonics due to concerns over ethics, regulation, or environmental impact could reduce adoption rates. Conversely, a groundbreaking technology that makes cryonics more accessible, affordable, and effective could lead to rapid global adoption and significant breakthroughs in healthcare.

Taking these factors into account, we can expect a moderate increase in the percentage of Americans signed up for cryonics within 10 years. However, the actual outcome will depend on various unpredictable events and developments that may arise over time.
