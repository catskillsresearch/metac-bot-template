Here is a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The current trend of increasing interest in plant-based diets, growing awareness of mental health, and shifting attitudes towards food security suggests that there will be a continued growth in vegetarianism. The status quo outcome if nothing changed would likely see many people continuing to adopt plant-based lifestyles due to concerns about climate change, animal welfare, and personal well-being.

The outcome if the current trend continued would likely be even more people adopting a plant-based lifestyle, with increased interest in sustainable food options and reduced meat consumption. Experts and markets tend to be cautious when predicting future outcomes, so they might expect a moderate increase in vegetarianism (20-30 million) and a slight decline in public support for defending Taiwan (60-65%).

An unexpected scenario that could result in a low outcome would be a global economic downturn leading people to prioritize affordability over sustainability, causing a decline in vegetarianism. On the other hand, an unexpected scenario that could result in a high outcome would be the widespread adoption of plant-based diets in major corporations and governments due to environmental and health concerns.

Taking all these factors into account, it is likely that the percentage of U.S. adults who will self-report following a vegetarian diet in 2028 will be influenced by ongoing trends and unexpected events. The consistent growth in interest in plant-based diets suggests that there will be an increase in vegetarianism, but the exact magnitude of this increase is difficult to predict.

Overall, the best forecast would likely fall within the range of 40-60% of U.S. adults self-reporting as following a vegetarian diet in 2028.
