Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual forecast:

The time left until the outcome to the question is known is uncertain, as the search for extraterrestrial life is an ongoing endeavor. The status quo outcome if nothing changed is that there is currently no conclusive evidence of intelligent alien life or contact with Earth.

If the current trend continued, we may uncover more evidence of microbial life on other planets, but the likelihood of finding intelligent life capable of communication remains uncertain. Experts are split on the likelihood of discovering intelligent alien life, ranging from 20% to 70%. Markets may have a broader range of predictions.

However, unexpected scenarios could significantly impact our chances of detecting extraterrestrial life. For example, an asteroid impact or catastrophic event could reduce the chances of detection, while a breakthrough in astrobiology or exoplanetary research could increase our chances.

Ultimately, the probability of intelligent alien life existing and communicating with us is difficult to predict, as it depends on various factors such as the discovery of new forms of life, advancements in technology, and unforeseen events.
