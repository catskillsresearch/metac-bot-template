Here is a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The concept of warp drives has been around for decades, but the practical development of a functioning warp drive remains uncertain. The current status quo outcome is that warp drives are still purely theoretical concepts, with no concrete evidence to support their feasibility. One possible scenario leading to a "No" outcome is if the scientific community fails to make significant progress in understanding the fundamental laws of physics, particularly quantum gravity and negative energy. Without a deeper understanding of these concepts, the development of a warp drive becomes even more challenging.

On the other hand, breakthroughs in physics, materials science, and engineering could potentially enable the construction of devices capable of manipulating space-time. A possible scenario that could lead to a "Yes" outcome is if scientists make groundbreaking discoveries in areas like quantum gravity or if new technologies are developed that allow for the creation of negative energy.

The challenges involved in creating negative energy and manipulating space-time are significant, and it is likely that the development of a functional Alcubierre warp drive will require major scientific discoveries or technological innovations. However, it is also possible that future breakthroughs could alter the probability landscape and make the development of a warp drive more feasible.

Overall, while there are many unknowns and uncertainties surrounding this topic, it seems unlikely that a functional Alcubierre warp drive will be developed in the near future. Nevertheless, I believe it's essential to acknowledge the possibility of unexpected breakthroughs or innovations that could potentially enable the creation of such technology.
