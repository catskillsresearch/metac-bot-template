Here is a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The global economy tends to change slowly over time, and therefore, the status quo outcome (moderate growth) has a higher likelihood of occurring. However, considering the current trade tensions and economic uncertainty, there are valid arguments for both scenarios (slow growth with possible recession and moderate growth). A prolonged period of escalating trade tensions could lead to significant disruptions in global supply chains, causing businesses to become increasingly cautious about investments and potentially triggering a recession.

On the other hand, an unexpected improvement in global economic indicators, such as a decrease in tariffs, an increase in investment confidence, or a surge in consumption spending, could result in a no-recession outcome. Additionally, good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time.

Taking these factors into account, it is likely that the global economy will continue to experience slow growth, with some variation in GDP between countries, but no significant recession. However, there are valid arguments for both scenarios, and therefore, the probability of a recession cannot be ruled out entirely.
