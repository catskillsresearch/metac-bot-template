Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to the question is known depends on various factors such as government policies, technological advancements, and global events. The status quo outcome would likely be a continuation of current climate diplomacy efforts, with China, the European Union, and Brazil taking the lead in maintaining momentum for climate negotiations.

A scenario that results in a No outcome (i.e., at least ten countries committing to any diplomatic agreement restricting solar geoengineering before 2026) would involve significant changes in global politics, such as a shift towards international cooperation on climate action. This could happen if there is increased pressure from non-state actors like businesses and civil society organizations, or if new technologies emerge that make renewable energy more cost-effective.

On the other hand, a scenario that results in a Yes outcome (i.e., no countries committing to any diplomatic agreement restricting solar geoengineering before 2026) would be characterized by a continuation of the current status quo, where international climate diplomacy efforts are hindered by the US withdrawal from the Paris Agreement. This could lead to continued tensions between nations and challenges for global cooperation on climate change.

Overall, considering my assessment of the current situation and potential future developments, I believe that there is a strong likelihood that at least ten countries will commit to any diplomatic agreement restricting solar geoengineering before 2026.
