Here's a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual forecast:

The average American employee will work per week in 2030 is influenced by various factors, including current trends, expert expectations, and unexpected scenarios.

Firstly, it's likely that workers will continue to work more than 40 hours a week, as they strive to maintain their lifestyle and keep up with increasing costs of living. This status quo outcome could see workers aiming for even longer working hours, potentially reaching 45 hours per week.

However, experts and markets are divided on the issue, with some predicting a shift towards shorter working hours and others expecting an increase in productivity, leading to more work being done within the same time frame. Therefore, it's possible that technological advancements or economic factors could lead to changes in work patterns, potentially resulting in longer or shorter working hours.

An unexpected scenario that could result in a low outcome (fewer working hours) might involve a significant shift towards remote work or flexible work arrangements, which could reduce the need for traditional office work. On the other hand, an unexpected high-scenario could be driven by a rapid expansion of industries such as e-commerce and technology, leading to longer working hours and higher productivity.

Finally, it's important to consider that the actual outcome will depend on various factors, including societal values, technological advancements, and economic conditions. Therefore, the best prediction is one that incorporates these complexities and uncertainties.
