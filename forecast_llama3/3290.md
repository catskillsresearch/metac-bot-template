Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to the question is known: This is difficult to predict, as demographic trends can be influenced by various factors such as economic conditions, social attitudes, and technological advancements. However, it's reasonable to assume that there may be some uncertainty or surprises along the way.

The status quo outcome if nothing changed: Current trends suggest a continued decline in birth rates, potentially reaching around 1.6 births per woman. This could lead to demographic challenges, such as an aging workforce and reduced taxpayer pools, which could have significant economic and social implications.

The outcome if the current trend continued: If the current trend of declining fertility rates continues, it's likely that we'll see further decreases in birth rates and population growth. This could be driven by factors like increasing education levels, changing family structures, and advancements in reproductive technologies.

Experts' and markets' expectations: Most experts are predicting a continuation of this trend, with some predicting an even higher percentage of babies born to women aged 40 or older. Markets may not be fully accounting for these demographic changes, which could lead to surprises in the future.

Unexpected scenarios that result in a low outcome: An unexpected global economic downturn, significant changes in government policies or regulations affecting fertility treatments, or a medical breakthrough leading to more natural conception alternatives could potentially lead to a decline in IVF births and birth rates.
