Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome is known is likely to be several months, as policy decisions and regulatory actions can take time to unfold. The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be the continuation of existing tax credits and regulations, with possible minor adjustments or clarifications. However, an unexpected shift in public opinion regarding climate change could lead to increased pressure on governments to take more drastic action, potentially altering the timeline for sunset reductions.

Additionally, a sudden change in global energy demand or a breakthrough in alternative energy sources could result in a rapid shift away from fossil fuels and reduce the need for sunset reduction policies. On the other hand, a gradual phase-out of fossil fuels is also possible, with some sort of safe harbor provision in place to help facilitate this transition.

Overall, it appears that most outcomes will not change significantly without external factors influencing them, but there is always a possibility of unexpected events or changes in public opinion that could alter the timeline for sunset reductions.
