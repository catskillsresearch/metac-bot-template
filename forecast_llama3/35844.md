Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual forecast:

The time left until the outcome of the 45V (hydrogen) tax credit repeal or modification is known is relatively short, as many of these regulations and incentives are already in place or have recently been implemented. Currently, some clean energy incentives from the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) will eventually sunset, and if nothing changes, it's likely that the existing rules and regulations for these incentives will remain in place until they expire.

However, there is a possibility of an unexpected outcome, such as a surprise bipartisan agreement to extend or modify the tax credits before they sunset. This might occur if key lawmakers recognize the importance of clean energy and the benefits it brings to various stakeholders. Additionally, an unexpected global energy crisis could cause a surge in demand for clean hydrogen production, leading to a rapid increase in investment and adoption of new technologies, resulting in a significantly accelerated timeline for achieving the Act's goals.

Furthermore, there is also a chance that government priorities or policies could shift, leading to changes in the IRA, such as repeal or significant modification. This could happen if there is a shift in public opinion, changes in international agreements or treaties, or unforeseen events that alter the energy landscape.

Considering these factors, it's likely that some of the current tax credits will be repealed or reduced over time, but the extent of those changes is uncertain. The key drivers of this uncertainty include the remaining time left until the outcome is known, the status quo outcome if nothing changed, and the possibility of unexpected outcomes.

Now, here are my final probabilities:

Option_A (2025-2026 sunset w/o safe harbor): 15%
Option_B (2025-2026 sunset w/ safe harbor): 25%
Option_C (2027-2028 sunset w/o safe harbor): 20%
Option_D (2027-2028 sunset w/ safe harbor): 15%
Option_E (2029-2031 sunset w/o safe harbor): 10%
Option_F (2029-2031 sunset w/ safe harbor): 5%
Option_G (No sunset reduction before 2026): 20%

Total Probability: 100
