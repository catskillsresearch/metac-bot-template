Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to this question is known is approximately 2-3 years, considering the deadline set by UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres for countries to establish clear standards on the use of AI weapons. The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be a continued lack of global consensus and binding regulations on the development and deployment of lethal autonomous weapons systems (LAWS). Many countries, including the United States, Russia, China, and India, have preferred national guidelines or existing international laws rather than adopting globally binding agreements. This scenario would likely lead to the proliferation of LAWS, potentially exacerbating concerns about accountability and human life.

The lack of consensus among governments and international organizations on regulating LAWS could lead to further proliferation and deployment of these weapons in various conflict zones, potentially destabilizing global security. However, there are signs of increased momentum towards addressing the issue of LAWS, including growing concerns about the risks and consequences of these weapons, as well as efforts by countries like Sri Lanka to promote disarmament and non-proliferation.

A scenario that results in a No outcome would be if the majority of countries prioritize their military interests and technological advancements over international cooperation and humanitarian concerns. This could lead to an arms race, with each country trying to develop more advanced AI-powered weapons, which would ultimately destabilize global security.

On the other hand, a scenario that results in a Yes outcome would be if countries prioritize human life and safety, recognizing the potential risks and unintended consequences of deploying lethal autonomous weapons. This could lead to international cooperation and agreement on regulations or bans, which would help prevent humanitarian crises and promote global security.

Given these factors, it is likely that the status quo outcome (No) is more probable, as the development and deployment of LAWS by various countries without any international regulation or ban is a possible scenario. However, there are signs of increased momentum towards addressing the issue of LAWS, which could lead to a collective decision to prevent an arms race.
