Here is a rationale that combines the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to the question is unknown, but it's likely to take at least several months for the outcome to be known, as there are many variables at play. If nothing changes, Sam Bankman-Fried will remain in prison, and his parents' efforts to secure a pardon from Donald Trump will face significant challenges.

However, if the current trend continues, we may see an increase in white-collar defendants seeking pardons or clemency from President Trump. This could lead to increased competition for limited available clemency resources, making it even more challenging for Sam Bankman-Fried's parents to secure a pardon.

Experts and market analysts are likely to be divided on the likelihood of a pardon being granted, with some believing that President Trump's use of his pardon power is becoming more unpredictable, while others think that the current trend of granting pardons will continue. An unexpected scenario that could lead to a lower outcome would be if President Trump decides to focus on other issues and prioritizes justice over clemency.

On the other hand, an unexpected scenario that could lead to a higher outcome would be if President Trump discovers new information about the FTX case or receives public support from influential figures, leading him to reconsider his stance and grant clemency to Bankman-Fried. Alternatively, a change of heart by President Trump about clemency and pardons could also result in an increase in the likelihood of a pardon.

Overall, while it's difficult to predict when or if a decision will be made, we can expect that Sam Bankman-Fried's parents' efforts to secure a pardon from Donald Trump will face significant challenges unless there are unforeseen developments or changes in the legal system.
