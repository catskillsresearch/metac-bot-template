Here is a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to the question is known is around 2-3 months, considering the ongoing economic trends and trade statistics. If nothing changes, Ukraine's exports are likely to continue facing challenges from foreign imports and online shopping, with demand exceeding supply in certain markets. A significant boost in agricultural production and processing capacity could lead to an increase in exports, while a sudden change in global market conditions or international cooperation could make Ukrainian goods more competitive.

On the other hand, scenarios that could result in Ukraine's exports not exceeding those in 2021 include economic downturns or crises, internal political instability, or global economic shocks. However, there are also opportunities for growth, such as diversifying export markets and products, strengthening trade relationships with key partners, and implementing policies to boost domestic production.

Given these scenarios and trends, it is likely that Ukraine's exports will continue growing at a slower pace than in previous years, but may not exceed those in 2021.
