Here is a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to this question is known is approximately 47 years (2025-2072). The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be a continuation of current demographic trends, including an aging population and low birth rates. However, significant changes are required for the No outcome to occur. This could include sudden and rapid increases in fertility rates, leading to a larger workforce and subsequent growth in contributions to pension funds. Alternatively, improvements in investment returns or changes in government policies could also contribute to an increase in the pension fund's surplus.

On the other hand, the current low birth rate trend is likely to continue, leading to a decrease in the working-age population and subsequently, lower contributions to pension funds. Poor investment returns or increased outflows from the pension fund could also contribute to its depletion by 2070. Governments may struggle to keep up with the increased demand for services, potentially sparking economic instability.

Given that the world tends to change slowly over time, and significant changes often require multiple factors coming together, I believe that there is a moderate likelihood of the predicted outcomes occurring. However, I also think that there are scenarios where the outcome could be different, such as if governments implement policies to increase fertility rates or if there are unexpected changes in social norms or economic conditions.

Overall, while significant policy changes or external shocks could alter the current demographic trends, the status quo outcome of continued low birth rates and aging population seems more likely.
