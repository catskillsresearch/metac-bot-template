Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to the question is known is uncertain, with various factors influencing the decision. The complexity of these factors, including diplomatic efforts, military developments, and international relations, suggests that the outcome will be determined over a relatively long period.

The status quo outcome would likely be Ukraine remaining outside NATO, with ongoing tensions between Russia and Ukraine potentially leading to more instability in the region. However, this outcome is not guaranteed, as significant events or diplomatic breakthroughs could alter the situation.

Scenarios resulting in both a No and Yes outcome are plausible, but they require major shifts in international relations, which are difficult to predict with certainty. A scenario where Russia continues to pose an existential threat to Ukraine's national security and Ukraine prioritizes its sovereignty over NATO membership is possible, leading to focus on strengthening defense capabilities rather than pursuing NATO membership. On the other hand, a significant shift in the global security landscape or a Russian defeat on the battlefield could lead to a reevaluation of Ukrainian aspirations towards joining NATO.

Ultimately, the most likely outcome is that the status quo persists, with Ukraine remaining outside NATO unless significant events or diplomatic breakthroughs alter the situation.
