Here's a rationale that combines the best of each individual rationale:

Tom Tugendhat's stance on various issues, including China's Mega Hub in London, has been consistent, and it is likely that his opinions will remain unchanged. As a vocal critic of China's human rights record and potential threats to national security, he may continue to express concerns about the proposed embassy, potentially influencing public opinion or government decisions.

However, there are also factors that could influence Tom Tugendhat's stance, such as diplomatic pressure from China, changes in government policies or party dynamics, or shifts in his personal beliefs. Additionally, it is possible that his opinions may evolve over time based on new information or experiences.

Considering these factors, a consistent rationale emerges: Tom Tugendhat's opinions are likely to remain consistent with his past stance as a vocal critic of China's Mega Hub in London, but there is also a possibility for change driven by various external and internal factors.
