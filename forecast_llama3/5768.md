Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The status quo outcome should be considered the most likely scenario since the world changes slowly most of the time. In most cases, major public companies do not change their practices significantly enough to result in criminal charges for senior executives. However, there are factors that could shift this outcome towards increased accountability.

External pressures, such as public awareness and concern about environmental degradation or corruption, can drive change. If governments or international organizations take stronger action to hold accountable those responsible for significant ecological damage or corporate crimes, it's possible that we may see more cases of senior executives being held accountable for their role in these issues.

Additionally, a significant shift in circumstances surrounding a company or executive could also lead to increased scrutiny and potentially even criminal charges. This might be driven by major environmental disasters, changes in regulatory frameworks, or international agreements that establish clear expectations for corporate responsibility.

Ultimately, while the status quo outcome is likely, there are factors that could lead to increased accountability and change. Therefore, a comprehensive analysis should consider both the potential for continued business-as-usual as well as the possibility of external pressures leading to increased scrutiny and potentially even criminal charges.
