Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to the question is known can be considered relatively short, considering the frequency and pace of updates from various sources. Given this, it's likely that the outcome will become clear within a few months.

Russia's military losses continue at a high rate, exceeding 1,000 personnel per day. This scenario assumes that the current trends and circumstances remain unchanged. However, some experts have suggested a potential for change in Russia's military strategy or tactics, which could lead to reduced losses. Nevertheless, considering the ongoing conflict and recent trends, it's likely that Russia will continue to suffer significant losses.

A sudden ceasefire or peace agreement between Ukraine and Russia could lead to a significant decrease in Russian military losses. This could be due to diplomatic efforts, changes in international policies, or unforeseen events that alter the conflict's trajectory. However, this scenario is unlikely given the current situation on the ground.

The world changes slowly most of the time, so it's reasonable to put extra weight on the status quo outcome. Considering the ongoing war and recent trends, it's likely that Russia will continue to suffer significant losses in its military, with an estimated total of around 1 million personnel lost by the end of 2025.

Russia's military is likely to continue losing troops, tanks, and other military equipment at an unsustainable pace unless there is a drastic change in their war strategy or tactics. This could be achieved through a combination of factors such as better military leadership, increased supplies, or improved morale.

Overall, while there are some potential scenarios that could result in lower losses for Russia's military, the ongoing conflict and recent trends suggest that it's likely that Russia will continue to suffer significant losses in its military, potentially exceeding 1 million personnel by the end of 2025.
