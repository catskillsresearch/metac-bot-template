Here's a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome is known is approximately 6 months, considering recent trends and statements from Arab League countries. The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be around 3-4 Arab League countries having normalized relations with Israel. If the current trend continued, it's possible that 2-5 additional Arab League countries might normalize their relations within the next year or two.

Many experts believe that more significant progress will be made in the coming years as regional tensions ease and economic interests align. However, unexpected scenarios could result in a lower outcome, such as a significant escalation of tensions between Israel and Palestine or another regional conflict, leading to a slowdown or reversal of normalization efforts.

On the other hand, an unexpected positive development could be the emergence of a unified Middle Eastern peace initiative, encouraging multiple Arab League countries to simultaneously normalize their relations with Israel. This could lead to a higher-than-expected number of states normalizing relations (around 7-9).

Overall, while there are various factors at play, it's possible that up to 5-7 additional Arab League countries might normalize their relations with Israel within the next year or two. However, this is contingent upon regional tensions remaining relatively low and economic interests aligning.
