Here is the combined rationale:

The status quo outcome suggests that European countries' military spending will continue to be outpaced by Russia's. However, there are scenarios where this could change. For example, if certain European countries significantly increase their military spending due to concerns about Russian aggression or a shift in their strategic priorities, it could lead to another country surpassing Russia's military spending.

Additionally, changes in global economic conditions and geopolitics could also impact military spending. If the global economy improves, governments may feel more confident about their defense budgets, leading to increased spending. On the other hand, if global economic conditions worsen or there is a significant shift in international relations, it could lead to reduced government spending on defense.

Furthermore, European countries may increase their defense spending and capabilities through cooperation and joint military development. If they are able to agree on a comprehensive plan to increase their defense spending and leverage economies of scale, this could enable the EU to effectively counter Russia's military capabilities by 2030.

Overall, while the status quo outcome suggests that Europe will not surpass Russia's military spending, there are scenarios where this could change due to changes in global economic conditions, geopolitics, or European cooperation.
