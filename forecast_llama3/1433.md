Here is the combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The most important factor in determining whether the fraction of American 18-24 year-olds enrolled in colleges in 2025 will be â‰¥10% less than were enrolled in 2015 is the current trend. As noted in FORECAST 1 and FORECAST 2, the world changes slowly most of the time, so it's reasonable to expect that the current trend of declining birth rates and decreasing college enrollment among young men will continue unless there is a significant change in societal factors.

Additionally, as pointed out in FORECAST 3, the accuracy of forecasts can be impacted by outdated data. Since about half of the available data points are from 2024 and earlier, it's possible that the trend may not accurately reflect the current situation. However, this does not necessarily mean that the forecast should be revised; rather, it highlights the need to consider alternative scenarios.

FORECAST 4 provides a useful perspective by considering the possibility of significant economic or social changes affecting the education system. Similarly, FORECAST 5 notes the potential impact of government spending on vocational training and job placement programs, as well as the effects of automation and economic downturns.

Taking all of these factors into account, it's likely that the current trend will continue unless there is a significant change in societal factors or economic conditions. However, it's also important to consider alternative scenarios that could lead to a No outcome (i.e., an increase in marriage rates and birth rates) or a Yes outcome (i.e., continued decline in college enrollment).
