Here is a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The European Union's efforts to regulate artificial intelligence (AI) will continue to evolve and improve over time. The current regulatory framework established by the AI Act will likely remain in place, with some adjustments based on feedback from stakeholders. The EU's approach to AI regulation is characterized by a focus on promoting innovation while ensuring responsible use.

However, there are scenarios where the EU might not make significant changes to its regulation of AI. If the European Commission is satisfied with the current state of AI regulation and does not receive enough feedback from stakeholders or member states, it may choose to maintain the status quo. Additionally, if other pressing issues in Europe, such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic or economic uncertainty, take center stage, the EU might prioritize these concerns over revising its AI regulations.

On the other hand, there are scenarios where the EU could make significant changes to its regulation of AI. If the European Commission receives widespread feedback from stakeholders and member states highlighting the need for more robust AI regulations, it may decide to revise its framework. Furthermore, if there are high-profile incidents or controversies related to AI misuse, public pressure might prompt the EU to strengthen its regulations.

Ultimately, the likelihood of a European Union member state selecting 10% of its population for IQ depends on the EU's ability to balance the need for innovation with the need for safety and protection of human rights. If the EU continues to refine its regulations on AI and these regulations prove effective in promoting responsible AI development, it is likely that a European Union member state will be one of the first 10 countries to select 10% of its population for IQ.
