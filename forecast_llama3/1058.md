Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 15 years, from 2025 to 2040/2050, depending on the specific prediction. The status quo outcome if nothing changed would likely be a continued trend of population growth, resource depletion, and environmental degradation, leading to further challenges and potential crises for human civilization.

A scenario that results in a No outcome could involve significant changes in global governance, technological innovation, and societal behavior. For example, a coordinated international effort to transition to renewable energy sources, implement sustainable agriculture practices, and develop innovative technologies to mitigate climate change could help avert the predicted catastrophes.

On the other hand, a scenario that results in a Yes outcome could involve a catastrophic event or combination of events, such as a massive asteroid impact, a prolonged nuclear war, or an unforeseen environmental disaster. This scenario would likely require a combination of human factors and external shocks to converge in a way that leads to the extinction of the human species.

While there are many factors at play, it is possible for humanity to adapt and survive by making significant progress in addressing climate change, resource depletion, and demographic challenges through concerted international efforts, technological innovation, and sustainable development. However, the uncertainty surrounding these predictions is significant, which is why a probability assessment is necessary.

Ultimately, the likelihood of human extinction or apocalypse depends on whether humanity can successfully address its environmental and social challenges. If significant changes are made to consumption patterns, technology, and societal structures, then the risk of global catastrophe diminishes, and human civilization continues to thrive.
