Here is a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The timeline for achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI) or increasing human IQ by at least two standard deviations in less than 30 days is uncertain, with predictions ranging from 2030 to 2050. However, considering current trends and patterns, it's likely that AI will continue to improve without reaching the level of superhuman intelligence. The status quo outcome would be a gradual increase in AI capabilities without significant breakthroughs leading to AGI or rapid IQ increases.

One possible scenario resulting in a "No" outcome is if regulatory issues, societal concerns, or unforeseen challenges hinder progress towards AGI. Another scenario could involve continued focus on improving human-AI collaboration and emotional intelligence, potentially reducing the need for AI to lie or deceive humans.

On the other hand, breakthroughs in areas like machine learning, natural language processing, cognitive architectures, stem cell therapy, gene editing, or regenerative medicine could accelerate progress towards AGI or rapid IQ increases. However, significant advances are rare, and the world changes slowly most of the time.

Given these factors, a consistent rationale can be constructed as follows: The likelihood of increasing human IQ by at least two standard deviations in less than 30 days is uncertain, but it's more likely that AI will continue to improve gradually without reaching superhuman intelligence. The possibility of breakthroughs or major advancements in various fields cannot be ruled out entirely, but they would need to occur rapidly and significantly to achieve the desired outcome.
