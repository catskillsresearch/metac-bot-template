Here's a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The most likely scenario is that armed conflicts between Greece, Turkey, and Cyprus will continue to pose a significant threat to civilians. The status quo outcome, where wars persist, is supported by historical trends and current patterns. However, there are scenarios where diplomatic efforts could lead to a decline in active conflicts or even a complete resolution.

One possible scenario is that international cooperation and economic sanctions encourage warring parties to settle their differences peacefully. Another possibility is that regional instability escalates, leading to an increase in arms trafficking and further fuelling cycles of revenge and violence.

Furthermore, there are instances where diplomatic efforts gain momentum, and international pressure leads to a breakthrough in resolving some of the ongoing conflicts. For example, initiatives like the "Peace Network" could result in successful mediation efforts between warring parties.

On the other hand, sudden deterioration in relations between Greece and Turkey, potentially triggered by a specific incident or provocative action, could lead to an escalation of military activity and direct combat.

Considering these scenarios, it's essential to recognize that the status quo outcome is the most likely scenario since the world changes slowly most of the time. However, there are alternative scenarios that could influence the trajectory of conflicts, making it crucial to consider the uncertainty surrounding these events.

Overall, this combined rationale acknowledges the persistence of armed conflicts as the most likely scenario while also highlighting the importance of considering alternative scenarios and their likelihoods in informing a final answer.
