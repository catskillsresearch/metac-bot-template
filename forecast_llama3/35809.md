Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to this question is known is significant, with approximately 1.5 years remaining (considering the earliest reported deadline for obtaining a banking license in Ukraine by the end of 2025). The status quo outcome if nothing changed is that Revolut does not obtain a banking license in Ukraine and continues to offer limited services such as money transfers from their card to Ukrainian bank cards.

A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome (Revolut does not obtain a banking license) is if there are significant regulatory hurdles or changes in the Ukrainian financial landscape, making it difficult for Revolut to meet necessary requirements. Additionally, if there is increased competition from traditional banks or established fintech companies, Revolut might not see Ukraine as a priority market.

On the other hand, a brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome (Revolut obtains a banking license) is if Revolut continues to demonstrate growth and success in the Ukrainian market, making it more likely they will obtain a banking license. Additionally, if there are favorable changes in Ukrainian regulations or increased demand for digital banking services, Revolut might prioritize expanding their presence in Ukraine.

Given that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time, it is reasonable to assume that the default scenario is a No outcome. However, there are still factors that could influence the outcome, such as changes in regulations or increased demand for digital banking services.
