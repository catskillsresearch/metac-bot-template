Here's a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

While it's difficult to predict exactly what the future holds, I believe that good forecasters should put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. In this case, Bitcoin has maintained its dominance for over a decade, and it's reasonable to assume that it will continue to do so unless something significant disrupts the market.

However, I also acknowledge that there are scenarios where a new cryptocurrency could potentially surpass Bitcoin. The possibility of a new cryptocurrency emerging with innovative features or technologies, gaining widespread adoption, and eventually surpassing Bitcoin is higher than that of a major event occurring that would have a significant impact on the market.

Regulatory uncertainty and volatility in the market could also hinder the growth of alternative cryptocurrencies, maintaining Bitcoin's status quo. Additionally, Bitcoin's established brand recognition, large user base, and long history of operation make it challenging for other cryptocurrencies to surpass it.

Ultimately, while there is always the possibility that a new cryptocurrency could emerge and surpass Bitcoin, I believe that the likelihood is lower due to Bitcoin's established network effect and brand recognition.
