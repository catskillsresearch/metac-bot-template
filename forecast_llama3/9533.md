Here's a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The most crucial factor in determining whether China will be one of the first ten countries to embryo select >10% of its newborns for intelligence is the pace and direction of change in China's demographics, economy, and society. The status quo outcome assumes that current trends continue, with declining birth rates and a shrinking workforce, which could exacerbate demographic challenges and societal issues.

One possible scenario leading to a No outcome (i.e., China does not experience significant declines in birth rates) involves the government implementing comprehensive policies to address low fertility, such as increasing support for working mothers, improving education and healthcare systems, and promoting gender equality. Additionally, cultural or social factors could contribute to an increase in birth rates.

On the other hand, a scenario leading to a Yes outcome (i.e., China experiences significant declines in birth rates) might involve the government failing to address the root causes of low fertility, with demographic challenges worsening as a result. This could be due to various factors, including lack of political will, inadequate policy implementation, or continued urbanization and migration away from rural areas.

Given that the world tends to change slowly most of the time, it is reasonable to place extra weight on the status quo outcome. However, significant external factors or policy changes could potentially disrupt this scenario, leading to a different outcome.
