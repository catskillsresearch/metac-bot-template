Here's a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome is known is unknown, as it depends on various factors. However, given the slow pace of change in most cases, it is reasonable to assume that the status quo outcome (Kneecap performing at Glastonbury Festival 2025) is more likely to prevail unless significant changes or controversies arise. A possible scenario for a No outcome is if Kneecap's lyrics or actions become too controversial, and festival organizers decide to remove them from the lineup due to public outcry. On the other hand, a scenario that results in a Yes outcome could be where Kneecap continues to perform without any controversy or backlash, and festival organizers do not intervene.

Incorporating these scenarios, it is reasonable to assume that the status quo outcome has more weight, but it's also important to consider alternative scenarios, especially those that could lead to a change in the status quo. The fact that Kneecap was announced as a performer earlier this year suggests that their inclusion at Glastonbury Festival 2025 is already set, unless something unexpected occurs.
