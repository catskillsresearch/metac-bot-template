Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

**(a) Time left until the outcome to the question is known:** The time left until the outcomes are known varies by article, but most of them seem to be within a few years (2025-2034). So, I'd say that roughly 70% of the outcomes will be known within the next decade. This uncertainty affects population growth and decline in certain regions.

**(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed:** Since most articles are predicting population growth or decline in certain regions, the status quo outcome would likely remain around the current levels. For example, Vienna's city development plan aims to address challenges without introducing major changes. Similarly, experts expect moderate population growth in some areas and stability or decline in others.

**(c) The outcome if the current trend continued:** Many articles suggest that certain trends will continue, such as population growth in southern Germany (Munich) or decline in eastern regions. If these trends continue, we might see more significant shifts in population distribution. This could lead to increased population growth in some areas and stability or decline in others.

**(d) Expectations of experts and markets:** Experts seem to be expecting moderate population growth in some areas and stability or decline in others. Markets are likely reflecting this uncertainty by offering a range of predictions.

**(e) Unexpected scenario that results in low outcome:** An unexpected scenario that could lead to a low outcome is a rapid, widespread adoption of virtual reality or other technologies that drastically change how people live and work, potentially reducing population growth or even decline in certain areas. Another unexpected scenario could be a pandemic or widespread disease that significantly reduces the global population.

**(f) Unexpected scenario that results in high outcome:** An unexpected scenario that could lead to a high outcome is the discovery of new, sustainable energy sources that accelerate economic growth and lead to increased population growth in regions with strong economies. Another unexpected scenario could be significant advances in medicine and technology that increase human lifespan, leading to a higher population growth rate.
