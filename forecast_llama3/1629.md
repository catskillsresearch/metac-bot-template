Here's a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The detection of alien technosignatures is contingent upon various factors, including technological advancements, societal priorities, and our understanding of the universe. The status quo outcome, where no technosignatures have been detected, is likely to remain unchanged in the near future due to the slow pace of progress in space exploration and detection technology. However, considering the rapid advancements being made in fields like astrobiology, exoplanetary science, and artificial intelligence, it's possible that significant breakthroughs could lead to a shift towards detecting technosignatures.

The likelihood of this event depends on humanity's ability to develop more sensitive instruments for detecting signals, as well as our capacity to interpret and verify any potential signals. The scenario where no technosignatures are detected may prevail if humanity continues to focus on terrestrial issues, lacks the technological infrastructure to detect extraterrestrial life, or encounters false positives or misinterpretation of natural phenomena.

Conversely, a breakthrough in SETI technology could lead to the successful detection of alien technosignatures, potentially revealing the presence of intelligent life elsewhere in the universe. This possibility cannot be ruled out entirely, as humanity continues to push the boundaries of technological innovation and our understanding of the universe. Ultimately, the probability of detecting alien technosignatures depends on a complex interplay of factors, making it challenging to predict with certainty.
