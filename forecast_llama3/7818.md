Here's a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual forecast:

The time left until the outcome to this question is unknown, as it depends on various factors and future events. The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be that Spain does not recognize Catalonia's independence. This is because there has been no significant change in the political landscape or international pressure that would lead to a sudden recognition of Catalonia's independence.

However, a scenario that results in a Yes outcome could be if Catalonia continues to assert its cultural and national identity through peaceful means, such as protests and referendums, and the international community becomes more sympathetic to their cause. This could prompt Spain to recognize Catalonia's independence as a way to maintain good relations with the European Union and other countries.

Another factor that could influence the outcome is if there is increased dialogue and cooperation between the governments of Spain and Catalonia, leading to a mutually beneficial agreement on autonomy and self-governance. This could lead to recognition of Catalan independence, especially if there are no significant changes in public opinion or international pressure that would prompt the Spanish government to reconsider its position.

Finally, it's possible that a major crisis or conflict between Spain and Catalonia could make it difficult for the Spanish government to maintain its current stance on the issue. This could lead to a recognition of Catalan independence as a way to address the crisis and maintain stability in the region.

Overall, while there are no specific deadlines or milestones that would indicate when the outcome will be known, it's likely that the status quo outcome of Spain not recognizing Catalonia's independence will persist unless there is a significant change in the political landscape, international pressure, or public opinion.
