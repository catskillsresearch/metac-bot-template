Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The UK House of Commons has historically been elected using the first-past-the-post (FPTP) system, and there is no guarantee that this will change. The status quo outcome is likely to prevail unless there are significant changes in public opinion or political will. While it is possible for a series of local elections or byelections to lead to gains for smaller parties, which could then push for reforms to the electoral system, such events are unpredictable and do not guarantee a change in the FPTP system.

However, there are signs that public opinion may be shifting towards support for proportional representation (PR). Some experts argue that FPTP is not representative of the country's diversity, leading to a desire for change. Additionally, recent polls have shown increasing support for PR among voters.

While it is possible for the government and opposition parties to prioritize stability and maintain their power-sharing arrangements, which could lead to a lack of pressure to adopt PR, there are also scenarios in which public opinion could drive change. For example, if smaller parties gain momentum and present a united front in favor of reform, or if experts argue that FPTP is not representative of the country's diversity, leading to a consensus among the main parties to adopt PR.

Ultimately, while there are valid arguments for both sides, it is difficult to predict with certainty whether the UK House of Commons will be elected by proportional representation before 2030.
