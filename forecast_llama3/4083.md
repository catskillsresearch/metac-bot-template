Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The likelihood of a Great Depression-like scenario occurring in the next US depression depends on various factors, including the time left until the outcome is known (approximately 2-6 months), the status quo outcome if nothing changes (continuation of current trends with some fluctuations), and the expectations of experts and markets (a decline in global stability and security).

If the current trend continues, it's possible that economic instability will worsen, leading to increased unemployment rates, poverty, and social unrest. However, unexpected scenarios could also occur, such as breakthroughs in artificial intelligence or renewable energy leading to rapid job creation and economic growth, or world leaders coming together to address global issues like climate change, inequality, and technological disruption.

Experts and markets are cautioning about a potential slowdown or recession in some regions, driven by factors such as inflation, interest rates, and trade tensions. Some experts believe that the global economy is due for a correction after years of expansion, while others predict a more prolonged period of slow growth.

The rapid development of digital technologies and the potential for a global economic collapse or war could lead to a worsening of the situation. On the other hand, unexpected scenarios like a sudden and severe economic shock, such as a massive financial institution failure or a global pandemic, could trigger a rapid decline in confidence and investment, leading to widespread job losses, business failures, and a sharp contraction in economic activity.

In conclusion, the likelihood of a Great Depression-like scenario occurring depends on various factors, including current trends, expert opinions, and market expectations. Unexpected scenarios could also occur, which could either exacerbate or mitigate the negative outcomes.
