Here is the combined rationale:

The time left until the outcome to the question is known is significant, with various events and developments still unfolding before we can know for certain. The status quo outcome implies that the world continues as it is today, with no significant changes or disruptions. In this scenario, it's likely that the donor funding crisis will persist, and wealthy nations may not increase their support for global public goods.

However, there are scenarios where a "No" outcome could occur. For instance, a sudden shift in global politics, breakthroughs in artificial intelligence or other technologies, or significant job creation and economic growth could reduce the need for donor funding. Alternatively, governments and organizations continue to make efforts to improve their financial management and transparency, leading to increased trust and cooperation.

On the other hand, there are also scenarios where a "Yes" outcome is more likely. For example, continued global economic uncertainty could lead governments to re-evaluate their priorities and recognize the importance of providing aid to countries in need. This could be accompanied by increased public awareness and pressure on leaders to take action. Additionally, growth of global wealth, combined with increased awareness and education about the importance of philanthropy, could lead to a surge in charitable donations and a significant expansion of philanthropic efforts.

Ultimately, it's possible that a combination of factors will influence the outcome, including continued progress in improving financial management and transparency, technological advancements, and shifts in global politics.
