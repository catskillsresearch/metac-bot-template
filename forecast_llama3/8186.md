Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 5-7 years, considering the recent trends and reforms in El Salvador's financial sector. The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be around 1-2 countries adopting Bitcoin as a legal tender, considering the current pace of adoption and the challenges faced by governments and regulatory bodies.

If the current trend continued, we could see 3-5 countries adopting Bitcoin as a legal tender in the next 5-7 years, driven by the growing interest in decentralized finance and the increasing recognition of Bitcoin's potential as a store of value. However, an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome (less than 1 country adopting Bitcoin as a legal tender) could be a sudden and severe economic downturn, leading governments to focus on more traditional forms of currency and financial systems.

Conversely, an unexpected high scenario could be the development of a new, decentralized financial infrastructure that makes it easier and more appealing for governments to adopt cryptocurrencies. This could also happen if there is a major shift in global economic power dynamics, leading countries to seek out alternative forms of currency and financial systems.

Overall, while some experts believe that only 2-3 countries will adopt Bitcoin as a legal tender in the next few years, others predict a more rapid adoption rate driven by factors like increasing digitalization, globalization, and the need for faster, cheaper payment systems.
