Here is a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to this question is unknown, as it depends on various factors such as societal attitudes towards animals, technological advancements, and the progress of animal welfare movements. However, I can provide a rough estimate based on historical trends and current developments.

The status quo outcome if nothing changed would likely be that reducing wild animal populations continues, with some species potentially facing extinction due to human activities such as habitat destruction, hunting, and climate change. While there are many challenges facing conservation efforts, there is still hope for progress through increased awareness, cooperation, and innovative solutions.

One possible scenario that could lead to a decrease in support for animal welfare is if influential voices or powerful interest groups begin to challenge the notion that animals have inherent value. This could happen through subtle shifts in public opinion, media coverage, or even political decisions.

On the other hand, a strong possibility exists where societal attitudes and technological advancements continue to propel forward the cause of animal welfare. For instance, further breakthroughs in AI-powered conservation tools, increased accessibility to educational resources, or celebrity endorsements could fuel public enthusiasm for protecting animals.

Given these factors, I believe that there is still some uncertainty remaining, but overall, the trend towards increasing awareness and concern for animal welfare will continue to dominate.
