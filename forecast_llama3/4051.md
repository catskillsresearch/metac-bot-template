Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The likelihood of Alcor offering fixative during cryopreservation procedures before 2030 depends on various factors. First, we should consider the status quo outcome, where Alcor continues to offer its current services and maintains market share without significant changes or disruptions. This is a reasonable assumption given that the foundation has been operating for decades and has established itself as a reputable provider of cryopreservation services.

However, breakthroughs in regenerative medicine, stem cell banking, nanomedicine, artificial intelligence, and biotechnology could lead to significant improvements in cryopreservation technology, increasing public confidence and driving up demand for the service. On the other hand, regulatory hurdles, market demand, or the company's resources being better allocated elsewhere could divert attention away from cryopreservation, leading to decreased interest and demand.

The uncertainty surrounding future developments and advancements in cryonics and cryopreservation technologies means that the outcome is still unknown. Nevertheless, it is essential to consider the potential for disruptions or innovations that could alter the market dynamics.
