Here's a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The likelihood of Russia repelling Ukrainian forces from the Kursk region before June 30, 2025 depends on various factors influencing the status quo. A key consideration is the slow-changing nature of most conflicts, which often persist without significant shifts in power dynamics. This implies that the current stalemate may continue unless a dramatic change occurs.

A potential scenario leading to a No outcome (Russia failing to repel Ukraine) could be a combination of effective tactics, strategic alliances, and possibly outside support from international partners. Conversely, a Yes outcome (Russia successfully repelling Ukraine) might result from a range of factors such as improved military tactics, increased troop numbers, and/or external support.

The time left until the outcome is known varies across forecasts, but most estimates suggest several months or longer. This prolonged uncertainty means that the status quo outcome (ongoing conflict with Russia repelling Ukrainian forces) remains the most likely scenario unless a significant event or development occurs to alter the dynamics of the situation.

Given these considerations, it's reasonable to weight the status quo outcome heavily, as it is consistent with the slow and incremental changes that often occur in complex systems like this conflict.
