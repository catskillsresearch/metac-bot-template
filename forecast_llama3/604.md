Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The detection of gravitational waves from supermassive black hole mergers depends on various factors, including scientific advancements and future discoveries in the field. The time left until the outcome to the question is known is uncertain, as it may take several years or even decades for ongoing research and advancements in detection technology to shed light on this phenomenon.

The status quo outcome would likely be continued detection of gravitational waves by LIGO and Virgo, with no major breakthroughs or surprises in the field. However, if new research challenges our current understanding of black hole formation and evolution, it could lead to a reevaluation of the detection methods used by these observatories, resulting in a period where no new detections are made.

One possible scenario that could result in a No outcome is if significant changes in funding or priorities for gravitational wave research slow down progress in this area. On the other hand, continued investment and innovation in detection technology, combined with ongoing scientific research and collaboration, could lead to new discoveries and a deeper understanding of these phenomena.

The gravitational wave background is still an active area of research, and its evolution over time may take several years or even decades to confirm. The role of supermassive black hole mergers in generating this background is currently supported by observational evidence, but our understanding of this phenomenon is still evolving and may be subject to revision as new data becomes available.

Overall, the likelihood of detecting gravitational waves from supermassive black hole mergers depends on the pace of scientific advancements and future discoveries in the field.
