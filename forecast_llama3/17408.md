Here's a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The likelihood of a US court fining or ordering a company to pay >=$100M due to how they used data to train a large AI model before 2026 depends on various factors. The current trend is that courts are likely to impose fines and penalties for non-compliance with existing regulations, as AI technology continues to evolve and be used in various industries. However, there are scenarios where this trend could change.

One possible scenario is that courts take a more proactive approach to addressing AI-generated court documents with false citations, implementing stricter guidelines and penalties for non-compliance. This could lead to increased accountability and a reduction in the use of AI for generating misleading or fraudulent legal documents.

Another scenario is that significant advancements in natural language processing (NLP), machine learning, and data verification techniques make it easier to verify and cite sources accurately, reducing the need for human input and eliminating the risk of false citations. This could be achieved through further development of robust and accurate AI systems that can generate court documents without requiring human intervention.

The probability of these scenarios playing out depends on various factors, including changes in government policies or public opinion, as well as advancements in AI technology. While there is uncertainty surrounding the outcome, it is likely that courts will continue to impose fines and penalties for non-compliance with existing regulations, at least in the short term. However, there is a possibility for change if courts become more lenient in their acceptance of AI-generated precedents or if significant advancements are made in AI technology that make it easier to verify and cite sources accurately.

Overall, the likelihood of a US court fining or ordering a company to pay >=$100M due to how they used data to train a large AI model before 2026 depends on various factors, including changes in government policies or public opinion, as well as advancements in AI technology.
