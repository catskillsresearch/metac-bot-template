Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The likelihood of Ukraine launching a nuclear weapons program before 2026 depends on various factors, including the ongoing conflict with Russia and international dynamics. The status quo outcome, where Ukraine does not launch a nuclear attack, is currently the most likely scenario due to the stability and continuity of the current situation.

Ukraine's decision-making process is influenced by its government's commitment to seeking diplomatic resolutions to the crisis, as well as its reliance on international support and assistance. Russia's military campaign in Ukraine also plays a significant role, with internal challenges, economic sanctions, and international pressure potentially leading to reconsideration of its objectives and abandonment of plans for nuclear attacks.

While scenarios exist for both a No and Yes outcome, the current situation suggests that the likelihood of significant change or a dramatic shift in circumstances is relatively low. However, the possibility of unpredictable events occurring cannot be ruled out, and new information may arise that could impact decision-making processes.

Ultimately, the most likely outcome is the status quo, with Ukraine not launching a nuclear attack. This is supported by the fact that the conflict has been ongoing without escalating to a nuclear level, despite various scenarios presenting themselves.
