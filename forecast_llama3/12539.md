Here is a rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to this question is known is relatively short, which means that unexpected events or changes in circumstances can significantly impact the probability of Pierre Poilievre becoming Prime Minister. However, considering the slow pace of significant changes in Canadian politics and the stability of the current political landscape, it's reasonable to place more weight on the status quo outcome.

The status quo outcome is likely to result in Pierre Poilievre continuing as the leader of the Conservative Party of Canada and possibly becoming the next Prime Minister. This is because many of his policies are considered divisive, which may not resonate with all Canadians. However, there are scenarios that could lead to a change in the outcome.

A scenario that results in a No outcome (Pierre Poilievre does not remain as Prime Minister) could be if Pierre Poilievre's government faces significant opposition from other parties in Parliament, leading to a lack of cooperation on key issues and ultimately failing to deliver the leadership Canada needs. Alternatively, an unexpected event or scandal could lead to widespread criticism of Poilievre's leadership and ultimately result in his removal from office.

A scenario that results in a Yes outcome (Pierre Poilievre remains as Prime Minister) could be if Pierre Poilievre successfully negotiates with the US to reach an agreement on tariffs, or Canada experiences economic growth and stability under his leadership, leading to increased support for him and his policies. Additionally, if Poilievre's policies and leadership style resonate with Canadians, allowing him to maintain public support and avoid major crises that could threaten his position.

Ultimately, the probability of Pierre Poilievre becoming Prime Minister before 2026 depends on a complex interplay of factors, including international pressure, domestic public opinion, and his own political calculations. While it's difficult to predict with certainty, considering both the stability of Canadian politics and the potential for unexpected events or changes in circumstances, it's reasonable to estimate that Pierre Poilievre has a moderate chance of becoming Prime Minister before 2026.
