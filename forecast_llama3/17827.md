Here's a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

Turkey's membership bid has been ongoing since 1999, with no significant progress towards actual membership. However, if Turkey continues to implement democratic reforms and addresses EU concerns over human rights and the rule of law, it may be granted full membership into the European Union. This would require significant changes within Turkey's political system, as well as strong support from EU member states.

On the other hand, if Turkey's economy grows rapidly but its relations with other European countries remain strained, it may decide to focus on developing its own regional trade agreements rather than pursuing membership in the EU. This could lead to Turkey not meeting the necessary requirements for EU membership by 2030.

Additionally, tensions between Turkey and the EU over political or economic disagreements could escalate, making it unlikely that Turkey will become an EU member in the near future. Similarly, if there are no significant changes in Turkish-EU relations and the EU does not reform its membership criteria to accommodate Turkey, it is unlikely that Turkey will become an EU member by 2030.

However, if the EU reforms its membership criteria to make it more inclusive and Turkey makes significant political and economic reforms to align with EU standards, there is a possibility that Turkey could become an EU member in the future.
