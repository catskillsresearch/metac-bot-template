Here's a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual forecast:

The time left until the outcome is known can be estimated as approximately 4-5 years, considering the ongoing diplomatic talks between Ukraine and Russia. The status quo outcome would likely see Ukraine continuing its accession talks with the EU without significant progress or changes.

However, there are scenarios where a No outcome could occur: if Ukraine's reform process slows down or stagnates, if there is increased Russian pressure or internal political instability, or if the EU prioritizes other candidate countries over Ukraine. On the other hand, a Yes outcome would require rapid and effective implementation of reforms by Ukraine's government, combined with strong support from the international community.

Given the complexity and duration of the accession process, it seems that the world changes slowly most of the time. Therefore, the status quo outcome is likely to prevail, with Ukraine remaining an EU candidate country and continuing its accession talks without significant change or stagnation. However, there are scenarios where Ukraine could make progress at a faster pace and join the EU before 2030, such as through continued international pressure on Russia or internal political stability.

Overall, while the probability of Ukraine joining the EU by 2030 is uncertain, it seems that the status quo outcome is more likely than any other scenario.
