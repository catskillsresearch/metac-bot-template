Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to the question is known will be around 2-3 years, considering current market trends and potential factors that could impact prices in the next few days. The status quo outcome if nothing changed would likely result in stable or slightly increasing beef prices due to declining consumption and reduction in cattle supply.

However, if the current trend continues, we could see a moderate increase in beef prices driven by demand and supply imbalances. Experts in the meat industry have predicted a possible price increase due to the decline in cattle supply, while markets are also reflecting this trend.

An unexpected scenario that could result in a lower outcome would be an unusual recovery in Ukraine's agricultural sector, leading to an increase in cattle supply and subsequent decrease in prices. On the other hand, an unexpected scenario that could result in a higher outcome would be a severe drought or natural disaster affecting major beef-producing regions, significantly reducing supply and driving up prices.

Additionally, an unexpected improvement in cattle yields or an unexpected surge in beef consumption could lead to a price drop. Similarly, a significant increase in demand for beef due to changing consumer preferences could drive up prices further.

Finally, the expectations of experts and markets are that beef prices will continue increasing due to supply chain constraints, droughts, and changing consumer preferences.

Considering these factors, we can expect the price of any product containing 50% clean meat to be around $[insert value] per kg in 2026.
