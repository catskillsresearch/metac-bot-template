Here's a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The first step is to understand the time left until the outcome is known. This varies across forecasts, but generally, it ranges from several weeks to months. The status quo outcome is the most likely scenario, as governments and institutions tend to maintain their current structures unless there are significant external pressures or changes in priorities.

One possible scenario that could result in a No outcome is if there is no change in government policies or laws regarding education. This could be due to a lack of support from lawmakers, insufficient public awareness about the issue, or other factors that prevent significant changes.

On the other hand, a scenario that could result in a Yes outcome is if the government takes steps to reform or abolish the Department of Education, potentially driven by public pressure, shifting political priorities, or concerns over government efficiency. This could lead to a more decentralized education system, with state governments taking on more responsibility for education policy and administration.

Overall, considering the status quo tendency of most systems, it is likely that the Department of Education will remain in place unless there is significant public pressure or political momentum driving change.
