Here's a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The price of Bitcoin will likely continue to fluctuate around its current value until significant external events or changes in market conditions occur. The status quo outcome is more likely than not, as it assumes no major disruptions or shifts in investor sentiment. However, there are scenarios where the price could drop below $10 (2021 USD) before 2121.

One such scenario is a sudden and unexpected negative event in the global economy, which could lead to a rush of investors selling their Bitcoin holdings and causing the price to plummet. This could be triggered by a major financial institution failing or a large-scale cyber attack.

On the other hand, a positive event in the global economy, such as a major breakthrough in renewable energy or a historic diplomatic agreement, could increase investor optimism and drive up the price of Bitcoin. Additionally, significant developments in blockchain technology or mainstream adoption could also contribute to a rise in price.

The current market trends and volatility suggest that the price of Bitcoin may be more susceptible to fluctuations than previously thought. Therefore, it's essential to consider both positive and negative scenarios when predicting the future price of Bitcoin.

In conclusion, while the status quo outcome is more likely, there are scenarios where the price could drop below $10 (2021 USD) before 2121.
