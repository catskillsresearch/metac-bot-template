Here's a rationale that combines the best of each individual rationale:

The Chinese government's approach to population control has been shaped by its complex history, economic considerations, and demographic trends. While there are concerns about an aging population and low birth rates, these factors don't necessarily dictate a complete ban on abortion.

One possible scenario is that China will continue to evolve its population control policies without drastically altering the current landscape. The government may maintain its two- or three-child policy while gradually increasing support for families and improving reproductive health services. This could be driven by demographic trends, economic factors, or shifts in societal values.

Another possibility is that China's government will prioritize investing in education, healthcare, and family planning resources, leading to a decrease in poverty rates, increased access to reproductive health services, and a more stable population. This approach would align with the country's historical emphasis on controlling population growth while promoting social stability.

However, there are also scenarios where a national ban on abortion could occur. For instance, if China experiences significant changes in its demographics or economic conditions, it may lead to a shift in the government's priorities. If international pressure or domestic concerns about reproductive rights become more prominent, the government might reconsider its population control policies and impose stricter regulations or even prohibit elective abortions.

Ultimately, the likelihood of China banning abortion depends on how these factors interact and evolve over time. While there are no strong indicators suggesting a significant demographic crisis or economic pressures that would prompt a ban on abortion, it's possible that the government could respond to changing circumstances by implementing stricter population control measures.
