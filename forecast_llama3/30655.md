Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until we know the answer is approximately 2-5 years, considering the rapid pace of AI research and development. The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be that AI continues to evolve at its current rate, with incremental improvements in areas like natural language processing, computer vision, and decision-making. However, this gradual progress may be hindered by various factors such as societal concerns about job displacement, data privacy, or existential risks, which could slow down the development of AGI.

For a scenario that results in a No outcome, it is possible that significant breakthroughs are required to overcome the limitations of current AI systems, and these might not happen within the given timeframe. Regulatory challenges and societal resistance to the adoption of more intelligent machines could also hinder progress.

On the other hand, a scenario that results in a Yes outcome would involve continued advancements in deep learning, large-scale computing power, and breakthroughs in areas like cognitive architectures, planning, and reasoning, leading to the development of AGI. Additionally, sustained investments in AI research and development, combined with significant breakthroughs and increased collaboration between researchers, industries, and governments, could accelerate the pace of progress.

Overall, while there are valid arguments for both "Yes" and "No" outcomes, it is likely that the momentum in AI research and development will continue to drive progress toward achieving AGI. However, significant societal and regulatory factors can impact the timeline and outcome of this event.
