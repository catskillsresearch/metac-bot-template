Here is a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to the question is known is unknown, as it depends on various factors and uncertainties. The status quo outcome if nothing changed is that human cloning has not been widely accepted or approved by governments and regulatory bodies due to ethical concerns and technical challenges.

However, despite these challenges, significant breakthroughs are possible in understanding the biological processes involved in cloning, which could lead to advancements in gene editing or regenerative medicine. Additionally, societal attitudes may shift towards accepting genetic modification and human cloning as scientific progress is made and public education and awareness increase.

On the other hand, if the scientific community continues to face ethical and moral objections, and governments remain cautious about approving human cloning, it may not be pursued further. Regulatory frameworks and societal acceptance may also hinder the development of human cloning, even if the technical challenges are overcome.

Therefore, while there is a possibility of significant progress being made in addressing ethical concerns and moral objections, and governments beginning to approve human cloning for medical purposes or other legitimate uses, the probability of human cloning being widely accepted and feasible in the near future is low due to the complex interplay of factors involved.
