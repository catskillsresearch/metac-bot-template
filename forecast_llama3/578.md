Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to the question is known is uncertain, as it depends on various factors such as human behavior, technological advancements, and environmental changes. The status quo outcome suggests that humans will likely continue to exist beyond 2100, as our species has shown remarkable resilience in the face of challenges and crises.

However, this assumption is based on a continuation of current trends and does not account for potential future disruptions or catastrophes. To predict extinction, we need to identify significant changes or events that would lead to such an outcome.

One scenario where humans do not go extinct by 2100 is if we collectively take steps to address environmental issues like climate change, biodiversity loss, and pollution. This could involve rapid adoption of renewable energy sources, widespread implementation of sustainable practices, and significant investments in conservation and restoration efforts.

On the other hand, a catastrophic event or combination of events, such as a global pandemic, nuclear war, or massive environmental degradation, could lead to a significant decline in the human population. Climate change accelerates, causing widespread ecological disruptions and making it difficult for humans to adapt and survive.

Ultimately, the outcome depends on our ability to address the mounting environmental pressures and societal challenges that threaten our existence. If we fail to address these challenges and prioritize short-term gains over long-term sustainability, it's possible that human extinction could occur by 2100 or sooner.
