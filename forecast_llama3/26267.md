Here is a rationale that combines the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to this question is unknown, but it will take at least a few years for the outcomes to be fully realized. The status quo outcome if nothing changed is that nuclear energy will continue to play a significant role in global electricity generation, with renewable energy sources also making progress.

One possible scenario that could lead to a decrease in nuclear energy's importance is a rapid shift towards alternative forms of energy production, such as solar or wind power. This could be driven by advancements in technology, changes in government policies, or decreased public acceptance of nuclear energy.

However, another possible scenario is that advancements in nuclear technology, such as small modular reactors (SMRs) and potentially even nuclear fusion, make nuclear energy more efficient, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly, leading to increased adoption and growth in the sector. Governments and private investors may continue to prioritize nuclear energy as a key component of their energy mix, driven by concerns over climate change, energy security, and the need for baseload power.

In this scenario, investment in research and development could lead to breakthroughs that increase confidence in the industry's potential and prompt investors to pour more resources into innovative solutions like nuclear fusion. Growing concerns about climate change and energy security could also create a sense of urgency among investors, prompting them to support the development of new technologies that can help address these challenges.

Overall, while there are risks and uncertainties associated with nuclear energy, the potential benefits of advancements in technology and investment in research and development could lead to increased adoption and growth in the sector.
