Here is a rationale that combines the best of each individual rationale:

**Rationale**

The time left until the outcome to the question is known can be considered negligible, as we have already passed the relevant dates. The status quo outcome is that President Trump has not declared martial law or invoked the Insurrection Act as of June 14, 2025, suggesting a continued lack of significant changes in the political landscape and government institutions.

A scenario that results in a No outcome is if President Trump continues to focus on his border security agenda without invoking the Insurrection Act or declaring martial law. This could be due to concerns about potential backlash from Democrats and civil liberties groups, as well as the uncertainty surrounding the effectiveness of such measures. Additionally, if the Department of Defense and Department of Homeland Security do not submit a joint report recommending the invocation of the Insurrection Act, President Trump may decide to maintain the status quo.

A scenario that results in a Yes outcome is if President Trump becomes increasingly frustrated with the pace of progress on border security or feels threatened by potential impeachment proceedings or other political challenges. In this case, he might declare martial law under the Insurrection Act as a means of consolidating his authority and maintaining control.

Overall, it appears that the status quo outcome (President Trump does not formally declare martial law) is more likely than a drastic change occurring in the next few months. This is supported by the lack of concrete evidence supporting such a declaration and the ongoing discussions with cabinet secretaries and advisors, as well as public outcry over the potential consequences of such a move.
