Here's a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The likelihood of achieving longevity escape velocity depends on the pace of scientific progress, technological innovation, and societal investment in research and development. The current trend suggests that significant breakthroughs are necessary to achieve this outcome. However, the complexity of human biology and the challenges involved in understanding and combating aging suggest that gradual progress is more likely.

While exponential growth in medical advancements could lead to rapid breakthroughs, it is uncertain whether this will occur by 2030. If significant investment and cooperation across industries drive research and development, there may be a higher likelihood of achieving longevity escape velocity. On the other hand, regulatory hurdles, funding issues, or societal resistance to changing the status quo could hinder progress.

Ultimately, the outcome depends on the interplay between scientific understanding, technological innovation, and societal factors. While gradual progress is more likely, rapid breakthroughs are possible if concerted efforts are made to accelerate research and development.

Note that this rationale does not make any specific predictions or assign a numerical probability to the outcome. Instead, it provides a framework for evaluating the likelihood of achieving longevity escape velocity based on various factors.
