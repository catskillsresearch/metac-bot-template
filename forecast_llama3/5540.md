Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The likelihood of a US Supreme Court Justice being impeached and removed before 2030 depends on various factors. Firstly, the status quo outcome would be for no impeachment or removal to occur, as the current justices are expected to continue serving their terms without any significant issues or opposition.

However, there are scenarios that could lead to a Yes outcome. One such scenario is if the collegium continues to support Justice Bagchi's appointment as a Supreme Court judge due to his exceptional track record and reputation, leading to his eventual confirmation as a Supreme Court justice.

Another scenario is if unforeseen changes occur in the political landscape or government priorities, which could lead to a change in the expected outcome. This might happen if there are significant changes in the political landscape or if the government decides to prioritize other judicial appointments over Justice Bagchi.

The time left until the outcome of this question is known is approximately 2-6 years, considering that many Supreme Court justices have a long tenure and it takes some time for them to reach their maximum term. Given these circumstances, it's likely that the status quo will prevail, but there is still a possibility of unforeseen changes or opposition to Justice Bagchi's appointment.

Overall, while the likelihood of impeachment and removal before 2030 is low, it cannot be ruled out entirely. A combination of factors, including the current trajectory of judicial appointments, political developments, and potential opposition, will influence the outcome of this question.
