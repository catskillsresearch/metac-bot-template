Here's a rationale that combines the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to this question is known is uncertain, but it's likely that most factors influencing Russia's territory will continue to evolve slowly over time. As such, the status quo outcome would be for Russia's population decline and poverty rates to persist at their current pace or with minor fluctuations.

A scenario that results in a No outcome (i.e., Russia's total territory does not decrease by 20%) could involve significant improvements in healthcare infrastructure, leading to decreases in mortality rates and increases in births. On the other hand, a scenario that results in a Yes outcome could be a series of natural disasters or economic shocks causing widespread poverty and increased mortality rates.

It's possible that Russia might experience rapid economic growth, leading to increased consumer spending and demand for housing, which would drive up prices and make it more likely that the government will implement policies aimed at increasing fertility rates. Alternatively, Russia might face economic challenges, such as stagnant growth, high inflation, or supply chain disruptions, which could prompt the government to decrease interest rates to stimulate the economy.

Considering these scenarios, I believe that the probability of Russia's total territory decreasing by at least 20% before 2028 is influenced by both the slow-changing nature of demographic trends and the potential for unforeseen events or policy decisions.

### Probability: 60%
