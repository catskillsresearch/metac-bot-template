Here is a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 4 years and 2 months. The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be that SpaceX does not send humans to Mars by 2029, as the company has faced setbacks and challenges in its mission to colonize Mars.

A scenario that results in a No outcome could be if SpaceX encounters significant technical difficulties or funding issues that prevent them from sending humans to Mars. Additionally, unforeseen external factors such as changes in government policies or international agreements could also impact the company's ability to achieve their goal. 

On the other hand, a scenario that results in a Yes outcome could be if SpaceX successfully overcomes its current challenges and achieves significant breakthroughs in technology, funding, and planning, enabling them to send humans to Mars by 2029. Additionally, external factors such as supportive government policies or international agreements could also facilitate the company's progress.

Given these scenarios, it is likely that SpaceX will continue to make slow but steady progress towards sending humans to Mars. While there may be uncertainties and challenges ahead, it is more probable that the company will overcome them and achieve their goal rather than experiencing catastrophic failures or rapid success.
