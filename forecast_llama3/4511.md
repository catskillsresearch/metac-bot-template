Here is a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 20-25 years, as the current trend suggests that the global population will peak in the mid-2080s and then decline.

If nothing changes, the status quo outcome would be continued growth at a slower rate due to declining fertility rates and increasing life expectancy. However, if the current trend continues, it is likely that the global population will peak around 10.3 billion in the mid-2080s and then decline.

Experts' expectations vary, but most predict a decline in fertility rates leading to a peak and subsequent decline in the global population. This is reflected in market expectations as well.

Unexpected scenarios that could result in a low outcome might include a rapid shift towards urbanization and increased life expectancy, or the adoption of advanced reproductive technologies or fertility treatments that significantly increase fertility rates.

Conversely, unexpected scenarios that could result in a high outcome might involve unforeseen changes in economic conditions or cultural shifts, such as a global fertility rate increase driven by technological advancements and improved healthcare outcomes.
