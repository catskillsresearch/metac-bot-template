Here's a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The world tends to change slowly most of the time, so it is reasonable to assume that the status quo outcome will continue. However, significant advancements in medical research, technology, and lifestyle changes could lead to a sustained increase in life expectancy. The rapid progress made in healthcare and technological advancements should also be taken into account.

Furthermore, considering the current trends and projections, it seems likely that life expectancy will continue to increase, although the rate of progress may vary. However, potential disruptions or setbacks, such as global pandemics or significant decreases in healthcare infrastructure, could affect the actual outcome.

The gap between male and female life expectancy at birth has been decreasing over time, which could contribute to a higher percentage of girls born in 2030 reaching the milestone age of 100. Additionally, breakthroughs in disease prevention or treatments could also lead to an increase in life expectancy.

Overall, while there are some possible scenarios that could result in a No outcome, they seem less likely given the current trajectory and advancements in healthcare and technology.
