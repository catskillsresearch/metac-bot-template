Here's a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The timeframe for this question is several years or more, allowing for significant changes in global politics and circumstances. The status quo outcome is likely "No", as nuclear tests and asteroid impacts are typically preceded by escalating tensions and conflicts. However, there are scenarios where global tensions escalate, leading to a new nuclear arms race or the need to resume nuclear testing for deterrent capabilities.

One scenario that could lead to no nuclear tests being conducted is if global tensions decrease and countries focus on diplomacy and cooperation instead of rearmament. Another possibility is that new technologies or strategies are developed for dealing with asteroids, making the need for nuclear explosions unnecessary.

On the other hand, a scenario that could lead to nuclear tests being conducted again is if global tensions escalate and countries feel the need to rearm themselves in response. This could be triggered by events like a major military conflict or a crisis in international relations. Similarly, new discoveries or threats from asteroids may make it necessary to develop and test more effective methods for deflecting them, including using nuclear explosions.

The likelihood of these scenarios playing out depends on the relative likelihood of global tensions escalating and international cooperation on disarmament and asteroid defense. While there are potential risks and uncertainties involved in predicting such outcomes, a balanced assessment suggests that the status quo outcome is more likely to persist unless significant changes occur.

This combined rationale draws from the best elements of each individual forecast, providing a comprehensive analysis for evaluating the likelihood of nuclear tests being conducted before 2030.
