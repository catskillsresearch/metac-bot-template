Here's a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The Square Kilometre Array (SKA) project has been ongoing for some time, with a planned completion date by 2030. While there are no guarantees in any complex project, the status quo outcome is likely to be construction continuing as planned, with some possible minor setbacks. However, significant unforeseen challenges or changes in government priorities could arise, causing delays or even cancellation of the project.

The most important factor in determining the likelihood of the SKA being operational by 2030 is the continued support and investment in the project. If the necessary resources and expertise are allocated to ensure a smooth construction and commissioning process, the project is likely to remain on track. On the other hand, if unforeseen technical issues or funding constraints arise, causing significant delays and setbacks, the project might not meet its planned completion date.

In addition to these factors, international collaborations and technological advancements will also play a crucial role in determining the outcome. The SKA's development and construction rely heavily on global partnerships and innovative technologies, which can sometimes be unpredictable. However, considering the project's current progress and momentum, it is likely that the necessary resources and expertise will be available to ensure its timely completion.

Overall, while there are risks and uncertainties involved in any large-scale project, the likelihood of the SKA being operational by 2030 is high if the necessary support and investment continue.
