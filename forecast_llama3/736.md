Here's a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The question asks whether there will be a complete 4-year interval in which world output doubles before the first 1-year interval in which world output doubles. To analyze this, we need to consider the time left until the outcome is known, the status quo outcome if nothing changed, and scenarios that result in both "Yes" and "No" outcomes.

Firstly, considering the time left until the outcome is known, it's important to note that most of these events occurred before 2025. This means that the time left for the outcome to be known is negligible. Therefore, we can focus on analyzing the status quo outcome and scenarios that result in both "Yes" and "No" outcomes.

The status quo outcome if nothing changed would likely involve continued population growth, urbanization, and increasing standards of living driving energy consumption forward. However, this could be offset by significant advancements in renewable energy technologies or major policy changes leading to reduced energy consumption or increased efficiency.

A scenario that results in a "Yes" outcome could include global economic growth continuing at its current pace, driving energy consumption and urbanization forward, leading to increased demand for energy. On the other hand, a scenario that results in a "No" outcome could involve a significant shift towards alternative energy sources or a sudden collapse in global economic activity.

In addition to these scenarios, we should also consider the ongoing climate crisis and its potential impact on global energy consumption and economic growth. Climate change could lead to increased temperature fluctuations, causing extreme weather events that might drive up energy demand or disrupt global supply chains.

Ultimately, the probability of a complete 4-year interval in which world output doubles before the first 1-year interval in which world output doubles will depend on the relative likelihood of these scenarios and the ongoing climate crisis.
