Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to the question is known is relatively short-term, likely within the next few weeks or months. The status quo outcome would be a continuation of the current power dynamics between Israel and Hamas, with some degree of violence and instability. However, an unexpected scenario could be that the international community comes together to impose a ceasefire on both sides, forcing Hamas and Israel to accept a temporary truce. This could lead to a more stable and prosperous region, with increased economic cooperation and reduced violence.

Alternatively, an unexpected outcome could be a sudden shift in international pressure or diplomatic efforts that leads to a comprehensive peace agreement between Israel and Hamas. This could be facilitated by external factors such as a new US administration with a more nuanced approach to the conflict, increased European Union involvement, or even a surprise visit from a high-ranking official like the Pope.

It is also possible that Egypt plays a more significant role in mediating a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, leading to a temporary power-sharing agreement between the two sides. However, this outcome would require significant concessions from both parties, but it's not entirely impossible given the ongoing efforts towards a resolution.

Overall, the likelihood of any one party gaining de facto control over Gaza City on August 31, 2025, is uncertain due to the complex and dynamic nature of the conflict.
