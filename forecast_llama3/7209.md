Here's a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The likelihood of anyone being convicted for possessing Bitcoin before 2060 is influenced by various factors. The status quo outcome suggests that the current trend of cryptocurrency-related crimes and scams will continue unless significant changes are made. This assumption is based on the slow pace of change in the world, with authorities struggling to keep up with the ever-evolving nature of these illegal activities.

However, there is potential for change in the future, particularly if law enforcement agencies can develop more effective strategies to combat these crimes. This could involve investing in advanced technologies like AI-powered forensic tools or collaborating with private companies to share information and resources. Additionally, governments and regulatory bodies may make significant efforts to improve coordination and cooperation across jurisdictions to combat cryptocurrency-related crimes.

On the other hand, systemic issues, corruption, or a lack of cooperation among law enforcement agencies could lead to a No outcome, where individuals involved in cryptocurrency scandals avoid criminal charges or receive lenient punishments. Moreover, technological advancements in the cryptocurrency space could make it difficult for authorities to track and prosecute criminal activity, further contributing to a No outcome.

Ultimately, the probability of anyone being convicted for possessing Bitcoin before 2060 will depend on a complex interplay of these factors. While some scenarios may lead to a Yes outcome, where law enforcement agencies successfully gather robust evidence and present strong cases against individuals involved in cryptocurrency-related crimes, others may result in a mix of both Yes and No outcomes, reflecting the ongoing struggle between good and bad actors in this space.
