Based on the provided rationales, a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale could be as follows:

The time left until the outcome is known is relatively long, giving us time to consider various scenarios. The status quo outcome suggests that no nuclear conflict will occur by 2035, as most countries are committed to non-proliferation and disarmament efforts. However, we must also acknowledge that the world has experienced significant geopolitical tensions in recent years, which could lead to a breakdown in diplomatic relations.

A scenario resulting in a No outcome (no nuclear conflict) involves continued international diplomacy, cooperation, and dialogue, leading to reduced tensions between nations and decreased military spending. This could be achieved through increased cooperation on issues like climate change, economic development, and social justice, which create shared interests and incentives for countries to work together.

On the other hand, a scenario resulting in a Yes outcome (nuclear conflict) involves escalating tensions between major powers, fueled by issues like territorial disputes, trade wars, or military deployments. This could be triggered by a military misstep or miscalculation, such as a surprise attack or an accidental nuclear exchange, ultimately leading to the use of nuclear weapons.

Given these factors, it is likely that the status quo outcome (no nuclear conflict) will prevail, but there are significant risks and uncertainties involved that cannot be ignored.
