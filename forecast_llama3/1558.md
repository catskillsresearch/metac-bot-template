Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual forecast:

The likelihood of the Cavendish account for less than 50% of banana exports worldwide before 2035 depends on various factors. One significant factor is climate change, which could have profound impacts on agricultural productivity and global food supply chains. However, as the world tends to change slowly most of the time, it's reasonable to assume that gradual changes in consumer preferences or trends may not significantly affect the Cavendish variety's dominance.

On the other hand, sudden shifts in consumer preferences or technological breakthroughs could lead to a reduction in banana demand and a shift away from traditional production methods. Additionally, economic pressures and climate-resilient agricultural practices could also impact banana production levels and global trade patterns.

Considering these factors, it's essential to consider the likelihood of significant changes occurring in the next few years that would affect the Cavendish variety's market share. While some forecasts suggest a high probability of climate change having an impact on banana production, others emphasize the gradual nature of changes in consumer preferences and trends.

Overall, while there are valid arguments for both a Yes and No outcome, it seems more likely that the status quo will prevail, with bananas continuing to be widely consumed and exported worldwide. However, the potential for sudden shifts or significant disruptions due to climate change or other factors means that a No outcome cannot be entirely ruled out.

This combined rationale provides a balanced view of the various factors at play, acknowledging both gradual changes in consumer preferences and trends as well as the potential for sudden shifts or significant disruptions due to climate change or other factors.
