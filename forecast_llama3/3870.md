Based on the rationales presented, a consistent and integrated rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale could be:

The time left until the outcome is known is uncertain, but it's likely within a few years or decades (Forecast 1). The status quo outcome if nothing changed is that lichens may not be able to survive on Mars due to the harsh conditions, radiation, and lack of liquid water (Forecasts 3, 4). A scenario that results in a No outcome could involve the continued challenges posed by Mars' environment, such as radiation levels becoming too extreme for lichens to survive (Forecast 4), or further research revealing that their metabolic processes are more sensitive to these conditions than initially thought (Forecast 2).

On the other hand, a scenario that results in a Yes outcome could involve breakthroughs in astrobiology, planetary science, and engineering, as well as increased investment in space exploration, leading to discoveries of microorganisms that can survive in simulated Martian conditions (Forecast 2). Alternatively, advancements in terraforming technology or changes in solar activity could make it possible for lichens to thrive on Mars (Forecast 4).

Given the uncertainty surrounding the outcome and the challenges posed by Mars' environment, a probabilistic assessment would suggest that the likelihood of widespread fossils of algae and lichens being found on Mars is currently around 30-40%. While there are potential breakthroughs and developments that could make it possible for life to thrive on Mars, the status quo outcome remains more likely due to the harsh conditions and lack of liquid water.

### Probability: 40%
