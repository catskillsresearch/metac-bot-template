Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to the question is known can be characterized by a period of ongoing economic growth, with recent trends indicating increased government spending. If nothing changed, the current trend suggests that the budget deficit will continue to rise, driven by increasing expenses and stagnant revenues.

However, expert opinions and market expectations suggest a more nuanced picture, with some predicting continued growth and others expecting moderation in the growth rate of the budget deficit. This uncertainty creates an environment where both positive and negative unexpected scenarios can play out.

On one hand, an unexpected surprise could be a sudden improvement in economic growth, leading to increased revenues and reduced spending. On the other hand, a global economic downturn or a significant decline in economic activity could lead to decreased revenue and increased social welfare expenses, resulting in a higher budget deficit than expected.

Overall, the government's net outlays in FY 2028 will likely be influenced by a combination of factors, including ongoing economic growth, changes in government spending, and external events that can impact revenue and expenses.
