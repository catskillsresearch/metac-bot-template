Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 75-80 years, considering the complexity of demographic trends and global population growth. The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be a continued increase in population, potentially reaching a peak of around 10.3 billion by 2100.

However, it's possible that the current trend may slow down or decline in some regions due to factors such as decreasing fertility rates and increasing life expectancy. Experts from various organizations, including the United Nations, have predicted that the global population will peak at around 10.3 billion and then decline. Some market analysts predict that this peak will occur slightly earlier or later than expected.

An unexpected scenario that could result in a lower outcome is a significant decrease in fertility rates due to changing social norms, economic factors, or technological advancements that alter the way people live and interact. This could lead to a slower population growth rate or even a decline in population. On the other hand, an unexpected scenario that could result in a higher outcome is a sudden increase in birth rates due to changes in government policies, economic growth, or advances in healthcare and technology.

Overall, while there are uncertainties and potential for surprises, it's likely that the world's population will continue to grow before peaking at around 10.3 billion by 2100, with some variation depending on demographic trends and global factors.
