Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to this question is unknown, as it depends on various factors and circumstances that have not yet occurred or been resolved. However, we can consider the status quo outcome if nothing changed, which suggests that Israel will not recognize the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan (IEA) due to historical tensions and disagreements over issues such as human rights, territorial integrity, and self-determination.

One scenario that could result in a No outcome is if the IEA continues to be perceived as weak or divided, or if there are significant diplomatic efforts from other countries or international organizations that support the Palestinians' right to self-determination. On the other hand, if the IEA demonstrates significant changes in its policies and actions, leading to increased trust and recognition by the international community, it could lead to a Yes outcome.

Additionally, if the Israeli government remains committed to its existing policies and the international community continues to pressure Israel to make concessions on Palestinian statehood, it is likely that recognition would not occur. However, if there are significant breakthroughs in Israeli-Palestinian peace talks or shifts in international pressure towards recognition, this could increase the likelihood of Israel acknowledging the IEA.

Given the complexity and uncertainty surrounding the relationship between the IEA and Israel, a moderate probability seems reasonable for both scenarios. Ultimately, the outcome will depend on various factors that have not yet been resolved, making it difficult to assign a specific probability at this time.
