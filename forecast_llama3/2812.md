Here is a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

Whole brain emulation (WBE) is a complex and uncertain concept, requiring significant advancements in neuroscience, computer engineering, and our understanding of human consciousness. The timeline for achieving WBE depends on various factors, including research breakthroughs, investment in development, and societal acceptance.

In the short term, it's unlikely that WBE will become a reality without substantial progress in these areas. However, if current trends continue, we might see limited breakthroughs in WBE technology, potentially leading to niche applications or enhancements for individuals with exceptional mental capacity.

An unexpected scenario that could lead to a lower outcome is the emergence of a novel neurological disorder or cognitive impairment that renders WBE technology ineffective for treating it. On the other hand, an unexpected breakthrough in neuroscience, AI-powered brain-computer interfaces, or quantum computing could accelerate the pace of WBE development and integration into various industries.

The expectations of experts and markets vary widely on this topic, with some believing it's a realistic goal within the next few decades while others think it might take longer or be impossible to achieve. The market doesn't directly influence WBE outcomes, as its impact is primarily driven by technological advancements and societal acceptance.

Considering these factors, we can expect that the maximum number of humans that will be uploaded in any 5-year period will depend on the pace of breakthroughs, investment in research and development, and societal acceptance.
