Here's a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The likelihood of one government governing 80% of Earth's population and economy by 2100 depends on various factors. While it's possible to imagine scenarios where multiple governments continue to exist, there are also potential catalysts for change. The slow pace of global politics and the tendency for governments to function despite challenges suggest that the status quo outcome is likely.

However, significant events or crises could trigger a shift towards a unified government. These might include global catastrophes, rapid technological advancements disrupting traditional power structures, or widespread poverty and inequality. On the other hand, gradual consolidation of power among existing governments through cooperation and international agreements could also lead to a single governing entity.

Ultimately, the key factor is likely the pace of change in global politics, economics, and society. If there are significant changes that drive a need for more centralized governance or global cooperation, one government might govern 80% of Earth's population and economy by 2100.
