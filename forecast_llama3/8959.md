Here's a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 4-6 years, considering the current data and trends. The status quo outcome if nothing changed would likely result in a continued decline in birth rates, potentially reaching around 0.8-1.2 births per woman by the end of this decade (2030). If the current trend continues, China's total fertility rate might decline further to around 0.5-1.0 births per woman by 2030.

Experts and markets expect that China's population will continue to age rapidly, with some predicting a total fertility rate as low as 0.5 births per woman or even lower in the coming decades. However, unexpected scenarios could lead to a high outcome (more births than expected). For example, an unforeseen change in government policies or social norms that promote larger families and reduce the stigma around having multiple children could lead to a surprise increase in birth rates.

On the other hand, unexpected economic downturns or financial crises could lead to a significant decrease in marriage rates and family formation, resulting in a low outcome (fewer births than expected). Additionally, urbanization and changes in social norms could also influence fertility rates.

Overall, while there is uncertainty surrounding China's total fertility rate in 2031, the trend of declining birth rates is likely to continue unless unforeseen circumstances arise.
