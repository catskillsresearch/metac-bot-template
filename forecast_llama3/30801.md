Here is a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The likelihood of the US Congress passing a bill implementing Trump's tariff policies in 2025 depends on various factors. The status quo outcome, where President Trump continues to have broad discretion over tariffs without congressional approval, is likely unless there is significant pressure or opposition from lawmakers or other stakeholders. However, considering the recent introduction of the bill and the potential for bipartisan support, there is also a possibility that Congress could limit Trump's authority.

The passage of time and new information will continue to evolve, making it difficult to predict the exact outcome with certainty. Nevertheless, it seems likely that the US Congress will not introduce a bill to limit President Trump's tariff authority unless there are strong incentives for cooperation, such as concerns about trade wars or economic instability.

One scenario that could result in a No outcome is if the majority of lawmakers do not support the bill or if it does not receive enough votes to pass. This could be due to various reasons such as disagreements over certain provisions, concerns about economic impacts, or simply a lack of urgency to address the issue.

On the other hand, a scenario that results in a Yes outcome is if a bipartisan coalition of lawmakers comes together to support the bill, potentially overcoming any potential opposition and leading to its passage into law. This could be fueled by negative economic impacts, concerns about trade wars, or a desire to reduce uncertainty and promote free trade.

Ultimately, the outcome will depend on the interplay between these factors, as well as the evolving political landscape and public opinion. While there is no guarantee of any particular outcome, it seems likely that the status quo outcome (No) would persist unless a significant event or shift in public opinion occurs.
