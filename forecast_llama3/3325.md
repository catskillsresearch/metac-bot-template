Here is a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to the question is known is unknown, as the data only goes up to 2024, and we are in 2025. However, historical trends and patterns can provide valuable insights into the future direction of the poultry industry.

If nothing changes, I expect around 76 billion poultry slaughtered annually worldwide. This is based on historical trends and no significant changes or disruptions in the market.

Assuming the current trend continues, which is a moderate decline in poultry slaughter due to factors such as avian flu outbreaks and changes in consumer behavior, I would estimate an outcome of around 72-74 billion poultry.

Experts and markets are likely expecting a moderate growth rate in the poultry industry, with some predicting higher demand due to population growth and increasing meat consumption. Markets are likely to respond to these trends by adjusting prices and supplies accordingly.

An unexpected scenario that could result in a low outcome is a sudden, widespread outbreak of avian flu or another disease affecting poultry populations, leading to reduced demand and increased caution among consumers. This would result in fewer poultry being slaughtered annually.

Another unexpected scenario that could lead to a higher outcome is the development of new, more efficient farming methods or technologies that increase productivity and allow for larger flocks to be maintained.

Considering these factors, I predict:
