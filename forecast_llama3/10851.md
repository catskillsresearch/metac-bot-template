Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to this question is uncertain, but it's likely to take several years for Norway's government and the European Union to negotiate and ratify any potential membership agreements. The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be Norway remaining outside of the EU, possibly maintaining its current bilateral agreements and cooperation with the organization.

A scenario that could result in a No outcome is if Norway's political landscape remains divided on the issue of EU membership, or if there are no significant changes or pressures that prompt it to reconsider its membership. On the other hand, a scenario that could result in a Yes outcome involves a shift in public opinion and political will towards EU membership, possibly driven by changes in European politics or international relations.

Additionally, Norway's economy remaining stable and its trade relations with the EU being satisfactory would make it less likely for Norway to join the EU. However, if Norway faces significant economic challenges, such as high energy costs or trade restrictions, joining the EU could become more appealing as a way to increase its economic security and stability.

Recent trends and events suggest that there is a possibility of a Yes outcome, particularly if global political and economic conditions continue to shift in favor of EU membership. However, it's also important to consider that Norway has traditionally maintained its independence and sovereignty while still cooperating with the EU through various agreements, which could lead to a No outcome.

Overall, the likelihood of Norway joining the EU before 2035 depends on a complex interplay of factors, including changes in European politics or international relations, economic conditions, and public opinion.
