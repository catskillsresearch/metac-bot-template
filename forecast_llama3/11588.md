Here is the combined rationale:

The time left until the outcome is known is approximately 2-6 months, considering ongoing legal battles and political debates surrounding abortion laws. The status quo outcome assumes that there are no significant changes in state laws or the US Supreme Court's stance on abortion, resulting in a patchwork of laws across the country.

A scenario leading to a No outcome (elective abortion banned) could be a nationwide ban on elective abortion, potentially driven by a shift in public opinion, a change in presidential administration, or a landmark Supreme Court decision that further restricts access to abortion. Conversely, a scenario leading to a Yes outcome (elective abortion remains legal) could be increased access to reproductive healthcare services, improved health outcomes due to better prenatal care and management of congenital abnormalities, and a recognition of the importance of women's autonomy and reproductive rights.

It is essential to consider recent trends and events, as well as ongoing public education campaigns, advocacy efforts, and changes in societal attitudes towards abortion. While it is difficult to predict with certainty, it appears that the status quo outcome (elective abortion remains legal in some states) is more likely to persist unless there are significant changes in political ideologies, public opinions, or court decisions affecting the legality of abortion.

The combined rationale suggests that the probability of elective abortion being banned nationally before 2030 is uncertain, but the current status quo outcome is more likely to persist.
