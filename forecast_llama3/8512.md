Here is a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The outcome to this question will not be known for some time, as quantum computing and artificial intelligence are rapidly evolving fields with many factors influencing their development. If nothing changes, it's likely that the current market trend and pace of innovation would continue, with quantum computing growing at an exponential rate and AI advancements being incremental. However, breakthroughs in quantum computing hardware and software could lead to rapid adoption across industries, driving widespread applications.

On the other hand, significant technical hurdles or lack of investment could impede further progress in quantum computing, leading to slower-than-expected growth. Alternatively, the convergence of multiple fields like computer science, neuroscience, and mathematics could drive exponential growth in AI capabilities, leading to a singularity.

The likelihood of achieving this outcome depends on various factors, including government initiatives, private investments, and technical innovations. While there are uncertainties and unknowns that can influence the outcome, a combination of rapid progress in quantum computing and AI advancements could make it possible for the answer to be "Yes" by 2040.
