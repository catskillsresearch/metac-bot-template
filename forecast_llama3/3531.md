Here is a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome is known is uncertain, with estimates ranging from a few weeks to tens of thousands of years. The status quo outcome is that Betelgeuse has not yet exploded as a supernova and will continue to burn helium in its core for hundreds of thousands of years before exhausting its fuel supply. This scenario assumes no external factors will affect the star's life cycle or cause it to explode earlier than expected.

A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome is if Betelgeuse were to stabilize or find an alternative energy source, potentially avoiding becoming a supernova. However, this is highly unlikely given the star's current state and internal processes.

A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome is if Betelgeuse continues its natural life cycle, burning out its hydrogen fuel and fusing helium in its core, which would eventually lead to an explosion as a supernova. This sudden event could be triggered by various factors such as changes in the star's magnetic field, stellar activity, or external influences.

Considering the slow pace of change in the universe, it is more likely that the status quo outcome will occur, with Betelgeuse continuing its natural life cycle and eventually exploding as a supernova. However, there is still a possibility for an unexpected event to trigger an earlier explosion.
