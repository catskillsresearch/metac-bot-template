Here is a rationale that combines the best of each individual rationale:

The Catholic Church has historically been slow to change, and significant shifts in its stance on LGBTQ+ issues are unlikely to occur quickly. However, Pope Francis's efforts towards reform and his demonstrated willingness to listen to diverse perspectives offer hope for a more inclusive future. His health concerns have sparked speculation about his potential resignation, but his close associates and biographers have ruled out a resignation. Therefore, it is possible that Pope Francis will continue in office without resigning.

Despite the Church's conservative stance on LGBTQ+ issues, there have been some positive developments regarding inclusivity within the Catholic Church. Pope Francis has shown resilience and determination to continue leading the Church despite his health concerns, which suggests that he may be more likely to initiate reforms than to resign.

Ultimately, the likelihood of an openly LGBT Pope before 2050 depends on a combination of factors, including Pope Francis's continued health and willingness to reform, as well as the progress made by the Synod in promoting inclusivity within the Church. While there is always a chance for unexpected events or setbacks, it is possible that the Catholic Church will continue to move towards greater inclusivity under Pope Francis's leadership.

Note: I have not included any probability estimates in this rationale, but rather focused on presenting a comprehensive and consistent argument.
