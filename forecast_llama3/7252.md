Here's a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome is known is significant, with a timeline of 50 years (from current date 2025-06-14). If nothing changes, it's likely that AGI will not arrive as early as some experts have suggested, but rather follow a more conservative estimate with predictions ranging from 2040 to 2061. The current trend suggests a mixed outcome, with the possibility of breakthroughs in AI research or societal values and government regulations that could accelerate or slow down the development of AGI.

An unexpected scenario that could result in a low outcome (False) might be the emergence of a new technology or discovery that changes the trajectory of AI development, making AGI less likely to arrive soon. On the other hand, an unexpected scenario that could result in a high outcome (True) might be the rapid progress in AI development driven by breakthroughs in areas like neuroscience or machine learning.

The expectations of experts and markets are uncertain, with some predictions ranging from 2026 to 2061. However, many experts are unsure about when AGI will arrive, and there is a general consensus that it might not happen as quickly as initially thought. The possibility of breakthroughs in AI research or societal values and government regulations could accelerate or slow down the development of AGI.

Overall, the likelihood of AGI arriving earlier than expected depends on various factors, including technological advancements, societal values, and government regulations. While there is a general trend towards the development of AGI, there are also unknowns that could impact its arrival.
