Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to the question is known is significant, with 5-20 years remaining depending on the forecast. The status quo outcome if nothing changed suggests that MIRI's employment of researchers in 2030 is uncertain and may depend on various factors such as advancements in AI research, changes in funding priorities, or breakthroughs in machine learning and cognitive architectures.

A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome highlights the possibility of MIRI not achieving its goals if it fails to secure sufficient funding, faces major setbacks, or prioritizes other areas of research. Conversely, a scenario that results in a Yes outcome posits significant breakthroughs in AI research and MIRI's ability to attract top talent and make groundbreaking discoveries.

Considering these factors, a consistent rationale emerges. The likelihood of MIRI employing researchers by 2030 is uncertain and may depend on the pace of AI advancements, changes in funding priorities, or breakthroughs in machine learning and cognitive architectures. While there are potential scenarios that could lead to this outcome, such as significant investments in AI research or major discoveries in machine learning, other factors like setbacks or prioritization of other areas of research could also influence the outcome.

Overall, this rationale suggests that the probability of MIRI employing researchers by 2030 is uncertain and may depend on various factors.
