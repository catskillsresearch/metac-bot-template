Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The Catholic Church's requirement for priestly celibacy has been a longstanding tradition, and it's challenging to predict when a definitive change will occur. However, considering various factors such as ongoing debates, societal changes, and internal reforms, there are indications that the status quo outcome is likely to persist unless significant changes or reforms are implemented.

One possible scenario for a No outcome (change) is if there is a shift in societal values and norms towards greater acceptance of diverse family structures and relationships, which could lead to increased pressure from the laity and secular authorities. Additionally, a papal change or a major scandal involving clergy abuse and cover-ups could also contribute to a reevaluation of the Church's stance on priestly celibacy.

On the other hand, a scenario that results in a Yes outcome (change) is if there is a gradual relaxation or elimination of the priestly celibacy requirement, potentially allowing married men to become priests or recognizing same-sex marriages performed within the Church. This could be driven by changes in societal attitudes towards marriage, family, and gender roles, as well as increased pressure from laypeople and other religious leaders.

Ultimately, while it's difficult to predict exactly when or if change will occur, considering historical trends and societal attitudes, I believe that there is a higher likelihood of the status quo outcome being maintained.
