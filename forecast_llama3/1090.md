Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The likelihood of the next assassination of a sitting US President occurring after January 1, 2100, depends on several factors. The status quo outcome, where no such event occurs, is likely due to the robust protection measures in place for presidential candidates and office holders. These measures have been effective since John F. Kennedy's assassination in 1963, and it is reasonable to expect them to continue being effective.

However, there are scenarios that could lead to an assassination attempt. For instance, significant gaps in security protocols, human error, or unforeseen events could allow a would-be assassin to gain access to a candidate or office holder. Additionally, a change in the political landscape, such as increased polarization or extremism, could create conditions conducive to an assassination attempt.

On the other hand, factors that reduce the likelihood of an assassination include continued advancements in intelligence gathering, surveillance technology, and law enforcement cooperation. The growing awareness and condemnation of political violence might also contribute to a decrease in extremist or hate-based ideologies driving individuals to commit such acts.

Furthermore, it is important to consider the historical context and current trends when assessing the likelihood of another presidential assassination. While it is impossible to rule out completely, the status quo outcome seems more plausible given the progress made in security measures and law enforcement cooperation.

Ultimately, the probability of the next assassination occurring after January 1, 2100, will depend on a complex interplay of these factors.
