Here's a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The likelihood of three African countries (Morocco, Spain, and Portugal) establishing an East African Federation before 2030 depends on various factors. Firstly, considering the gradual pace of change in international agreements and diplomatic efforts, it is more likely that the status quo outcome will prevail unless there are significant external factors driving the countries towards cooperation.

One potential scenario leading to a Yes outcome could be if all three countries successfully collaborate on infrastructure development, marketing efforts, and logistical planning. This would require strong leadership, a shared vision for the tournament, and a willingness to compromise and find mutually beneficial solutions.

However, the likelihood of this happening is also influenced by potential disruptions or challenges that could impact the partnership. For instance, significant political instability or economic turmoil in one of the countries (e.g., Morocco) might lead to a reevaluation of the partnership and potentially result in a No outcome.

In addition, internal conflicts within individual countries, unforeseen global events, or disagreements between the three countries on key issues could also hinder the creation of a unified effort. Therefore, it is essential to monitor any potential issues and adjust the forecast accordingly.

Overall, while there are factors that could lead to either a Yes or No outcome, I believe that the status quo outcome (the establishment of an East African Federation) is more likely given the current momentum and cooperation between the three countries.
