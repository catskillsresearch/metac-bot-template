Here's a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The search for dark matter is an ongoing process that will likely involve continued research and experimentation in various fields, including cosmology, particle physics, and astronomy. The existence or non-existence of primordial black holes as a significant component of dark matter is currently unknown and has not been directly observed or confirmed.

One possible scenario that could lead to a "No" outcome is the continued analysis of cosmic microwave background radiation and other data without finding any conclusive evidence of primordial black holes. This would suggest that these hypothetical objects are an interesting but ultimately unfounded concept.

On the other hand, if future studies were to detect significant neutrino emissions or other signs of Hawking radiation, it could be indicative of primordial black hole existence. This would not only shed light on the early universe but also provide a new window into understanding dark matter and its interactions with normal matter.

The uncertainty surrounding the composition of dark matter means that there is currently no conclusive evidence to support or refute the hypothesis that most dark matter is composed of primordial black holes. The scientific consensus has not yet shifted significantly in favor or against this hypothesis, leaving room for further exploration and discovery.

Ultimately, the probability of a "Yes" outcome will depend on future research and discoveries in the field of cosmology and particle physics. While there are intriguing hints and possibilities related to primordial black holes, the scientific community remains skeptical about their potential impact on dark matter and the universe's evolution.

By considering these factors, we can conclude that:
