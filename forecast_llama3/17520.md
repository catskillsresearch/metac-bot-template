Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The likelihood of the percentage of U.S. workers employed in white-collar jobs dropping at least 2 percentage points below the 2022 level before 2026 depends on various factors. The current status quo suggests that the labor market may continue to evolve, with some fluctuations and adjustments happening over time. However, there are scenarios that could influence the outcome.

One possibility is a global economic downturn or recession, which could lead to increased layoffs, reduced hiring, and decreased job security, making it harder for people to find work and maintain their current employment status. This scenario would result in a decrease in white-collar jobs.

On the other hand, a surge in innovation, increased demand for specialized services, or a growing need for skilled professionals in emerging industries could lead to an increase in white-collar job opportunities, resulting in an increase in their percentage.

Additionally, there are factors that could impact job growth and employment rates, such as changes in global economic trends, technological advancements, or policy decisions. For instance, if companies prepare for an uncertain future by diversifying their workforce and developing more flexible work arrangements, this could lead to a significant shift in job market trends.

Given these scenarios and factors, it is possible that the percentage of white-collar workers may decline due to a combination of economic uncertainty, technological advancements, and changes in labor market trends. However, it is also possible that the status quo outcome will prevail, with the percentage remaining relatively stable or slightly changing due to natural fluctuations in the job market.

Overall, while there are various factors at play, the likelihood of a significant decrease in white-collar jobs depends on the extent to which these scenarios and factors unfold.
