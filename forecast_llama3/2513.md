Here's a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome is known is uncertain and depends on various factors such as technological advancements and societal changes. However, it's possible to estimate a timeframe within which humanity may be at risk of existential threat from AI or other catastrophic events.

The status quo outcome is that humanity will continue to exist with a high probability, albeit facing ongoing challenges posed by climate change, nuclear war, pandemics, and demographic collapse. These threats would continue to exist, but their likelihood of causing extinction would remain low.

A scenario that results in a No outcome could involve sustained international cooperation, effective governance, rapid advancements in renewable energy, and the development of AI aligned with human values and ethics. This might reduce the risk of super-intelligent AI posing an existential threat or slow climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

On the other hand, a scenario that results in a Yes outcome could involve an unchecked global population growth leading to severe resource shortages, famine, and societal collapse; rapid development of AI that prioritizes efficiency over human well-being, potentially wiping out humanity; or extreme climate change causing catastrophic consequences such as a nuclear winter.

Considering these scenarios and the current state of AI development and potential risks, it's possible to assign a moderate probability to the Yes outcome. However, humanity has faced existential risks before and has generally found ways to adapt and survive, making the status quo outcome more likely.

This rationale takes into account the uncertainty surrounding the time left until the outcome is known, the ongoing challenges facing humanity, and the potential for both catastrophic events and gradual collective changes that could mitigate these risks.
