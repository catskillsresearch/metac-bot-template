Based on the rationales provided in the five forecasts, a consistent rationale can be constructed as follows:

The most likely scenario is that the status quo outcome, where Ukraine continues to maintain its non-Crimean territory, remains intact. This is because there has been no significant shift in the international political landscape or any notable changes in the Ukrainian government's stance that would suggest a loss of sovereignty.

However, various factors can influence the outcome, including diplomatic efforts, military actions, and economic pressures. A possible scenario that could lead to Ukraine losing non-territorial aspects of its sovereignty is if Russia manages to escalate tensions and creates divisions within Ukraine's government or society. Additionally, if Western support wanes or becomes less consistent, Ukraine may become more vulnerable to Russian pressure.

On the other hand, a negotiated settlement between Ukraine, Russia, and the international community could lead to a gradual normalization of relations, accompanied by economic cooperation and security guarantees. This could be facilitated by diplomatic efforts, humanitarian aid, and strategic reassessments by all parties involved.

Furthermore, if Ukraine's military receives substantial support from Western powers, it could lead to a decisive victory over Russian forces, allowing Ukraine to stabilize its borders and maintain its sovereignty.
