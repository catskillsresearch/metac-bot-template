Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome is known is uncertain, but it's likely that there are some months remaining before the outcome is fully known. In the absence of significant changes, the number of journalists facing criminal charges related to their work is expected to remain relatively stable at around 22-23 million. However, if current trends continue, the number of journalists targeted or attacked could increase due to factors such as political tensions and authoritarian tendencies.

Experts and markets may anticipate a slight increase in journalist arrests and detentions due to growing repression against journalists, but these expectations are difficult to quantify precisely. An unexpected scenario that could lead to a lower outcome is the widespread adoption of encryption technologies by journalists and media organizations, making it more challenging for authorities to track and target them.

On the other hand, an unexpected scenario that could result in a higher outcome is the emergence of a new global crisis or conflict that amplifies the pressure on governments to crack down on dissenting voices, resulting in more journalists being targeted.
