Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to be known can significantly influence the likelihood of certain events. Considering the current trends and market conditions, it's essential to factor in this uncertainty. The status quo outcome, which assumes no significant changes or developments, should also be considered.

One possible scenario that could result in a "No" outcome is if regulatory bodies continue to maintain their stance against allowing certain types of betting, citing concerns about potential manipulation and the impact on sensitive topics. This could lead to real-money betting sites not permitting wagers on specific events.

On the other hand, alternative scenarios that might lead to a "Yes" outcome could involve significant changes in public opinion, shifts in leadership, or increased tolerance for unconventional forms of entertainment. These scenarios should also be considered when assessing the likelihood of certain outcomes.

Given the complexity and evolving nature of regulatory landscapes, it's crucial to take a balanced approach when making predictions. By considering both the status quo outcome and alternative scenarios, it becomes clear that there is no straightforward answer. Ultimately, a nuanced assessment of the various factors at play can provide valuable insights into the likelihood of specific outcomes.

Note: I did not explicitly mention any particular forecast as this combined rationale aims to present an entirely new perspective.
