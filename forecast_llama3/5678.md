Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to the question is unknown, as it depends on various factors such as medical treatment and patient response. However, given Joe Biden's age and health conditions, we can assume that his current advanced prostate cancer will continue to be a major factor in determining the outcome.

The status quo outcome if nothing changed is likely "Yes", as there are no immediate indications of any catastrophic event that would lead to Joe Biden's sudden passing. Additionally, he has shown resilience and determination in his treatment, which suggests that he may continue to receive care and manage his condition for a while longer.

One possible scenario that results in a No outcome is if Joe Biden's medical team discovers a new treatment option that completely eliminates the cancer, leading to his full recovery. However, this scenario is less likely given the advanced nature of his prostate cancer.

Another possible scenario that results in a Yes outcome is if the cancer continues to progress and spread, making it increasingly difficult for Biden to continue with his presidential duties or daily life. This scenario is more plausible given the current status of his health.

Given the uncertainty surrounding Joe Biden's health and the possibility of various outcomes, we can assume that the default outcome is likely that his condition will not improve significantly. However, there are scenarios where treatment can be successful, and Biden's health could stabilize or even improve.

Overall, it appears that a combination of the status quo outcome (Joe Biden's advanced prostate cancer does not improve) and the possibility of various outcomes (successful treatment or continued progression of the cancer) is the most likely scenario.
