Here is a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The initial assumption should be that the status quo outcome (Harvard University remaining eligible to host international students) is more likely than not. This is because the world changes slowly most of the time, and significant changes are typically preceded by warning signs or precursors. Additionally, the potential reputational damage and financial losses associated with revoking Harvard's eligibility to host international students serve as a deterrent against such an outcome.

However, it is also important to consider external factors that could influence the outcome. The Trump administration's actions towards Harvard University are unpredictable and can change rapidly, which means that there is always a possibility of a No outcome (revocation of eligibility). Moreover, the potential for increased scrutiny of the government's actions could lead to a reversal or modification of its stance on Harvard University.

Ultimately, while the status quo outcome seems more likely than not, it is essential to consider the potential for external factors to influence the outcome and disrupt the status quo.
