Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The situation in Gaza is complex and uncertain, but there are underlying factors that suggest the status quo outcome is likely. The humanitarian crisis has been ongoing for over 15 months, with little progress towards a peaceful resolution. This suggests that the situation will continue to deteriorate without significant changes.

However, it's also possible that a breakthrough in peace negotiations or a shift in international pressure could lead to a sudden and unexpected resolution, resulting in a decrease in displacement numbers. Similarly, external factors such as diplomatic efforts, economic instability, or political infighting could escalate tensions and lead to further displacement and humanitarian crises.

The most likely scenario is that the status quo outcome will continue, with ongoing violence and aggression leading to further displacement and humanitarian crises. This is supported by the fact that both sides have shown little willingness to compromise or make concessions, suggesting that a peaceful resolution may be elusive in the short term.

Ultimately, the likelihood of at least 500,000 Palestinians being displaced from Gaza before December 31st, 2025 will depend on various factors, including future events and decisions made by individuals or organizations involved. However, based on the current situation and underlying dynamics, it seems more likely that the status quo outcome will continue, resulting in ongoing displacement and humanitarian crises.
