Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to the question is known is uncertain, but it's likely to take several years or even decades for the situation to unfold. In the meantime, the status quo outcome if nothing changed would be a continuation of the current tensions and competition between the US and China, with both sides likely to continue developing their AI capabilities and competing globally.

A scenario that results in a No outcome (i.e., there will not be active war between the US and China) is one where both countries engage in diplomatic efforts to resolve their differences through dialogue and compromise. This could involve agreements on specific rules for AI development and use, or establish joint research initiatives to address common challenges.

Conversely, a scenario that results in a Yes outcome (i.e., there will be active war between the US and China) is one where tensions escalate due to misunderstandings, miscommunications, or miscalculations. This could be triggered by issues like Taiwan's independence, the South China Sea disputes, or cyber warfare.

The ongoing economic interdependence between the US and China continues to serve as a stabilizing force, reducing the likelihood of conflict. However, the current situation is marked by increasing tensions between China and the US, which could potentially lead to conflict if not managed properly.

Overall, while it's difficult to predict with certainty whether there will be active war between the US and China before 2027, the status quo outcome appears to be the most likely scenario. Both countries have incentives to avoid conflict and can find ways to resolve their differences through diplomacy, but the risk of miscalculation or miscommunication remains a threat.
