Here's a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

**(a)** Time left until the outcome is known: The time left until the outcome is unknown, as it depends on various factors and decisions made in the future. This includes the legislative process, economic conditions, and potential external events or crises.

**(b)** Status quo outcome if nothing changed: In this scenario, the current status quo would likely persist. For example, the reconciliation bill might not pass or be significantly modified, leading to a continued increase in the nation's debt and deficit. This is because politicians tend to prioritize short-term gains over long-term fiscal responsibility, and external events could also influence the legislative process.

**(c)** Unexpected outcome scenario: An unexpected outcome could be a surprise agreement between Congress and the White House to compromise on the reconciliation package, leading to significant changes in taxation or spending. Alternatively, unforeseen events like natural disasters, economic downturns, or global market shifts could alter the trajectory of these outcomes.

This combined rationale takes into account the uncertainty surrounding the legislative process, the potential for external events to influence policy decisions, and the possibility of unexpected breakthroughs in negotiations. It also acknowledges that politicians tend to prioritize short-term gains over long-term fiscal responsibility, which could lead to a continued increase in the nation's debt and deficit if nothing changes.
