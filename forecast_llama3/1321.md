Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to the question is known is relatively short, ranging from approximately 2-10 years. The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be that humans continue to age and eventually die due to biological processes.

A scenario resulting in a No outcome could involve a lack of significant breakthroughs in biotechnology, nanotechnology, or artificial intelligence, as well as insufficient investment in research, unforeseen challenges, or a lack of collaboration among experts. Alternatively, societal and economic factors might not align to support the widespread adoption of technologies that could enable human longevity.

On the other hand, a scenario resulting in a Yes outcome could involve rapid progress made in biotechnology, nanotechnology, and artificial intelligence, leading to breakthroughs in understanding and manipulating the aging process. This could be achieved through significant investments in research, international cooperation, and the convergence of multiple technological advancements.

While historical trends may suggest that major changes in human lifespan or aging have been gradual and incremental, it is also possible for significant breakthroughs to occur due to exponential growth in computing power and artificial intelligence, leading to advancements in areas like gene editing, senolytic therapy, and nanotechnology.
