Here is a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The current trajectory of human activity is unsustainable in the long term. The continued decline of biodiversity, degradation of natural habitats and ecosystems, and increasing pressure on resources will likely lead to catastrophic consequences for the planet and human societies unless drastic measures are taken.

The weight of evidence suggests that humanity's current path is unsustainable, with trends such as climate change, pollution, and overconsumption driving environmental degradation. However, there is hope for change, as seen in scenarios where humanity makes a concerted effort to adopt sustainable practices, reduce waste and pollution, and protect natural habitats.

A key factor in determining the outcome will be human behavior and policy changes. If humans continue down their current path of excessive consumption, pollution, and degradation of natural ecosystems, the consequences could be severe. On the other hand, if humanity can transition to more sustainable practices, such as investing in renewable energy, reducing waste and pollution, and protecting natural habitats, it is possible that we could create a more resilient and sustainable future for ourselves and the planet.

Ultimately, the likelihood of a sustainable off-world presence by 2100 depends on the balance between the status quo outcome (continued decline of biodiversity and environmental degradation) and the scenario where humanity makes significant changes to adopt sustainable practices.
