Here's a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The question asks about the success of de-allergenizing wheat by 2030. To assess the situation, we can consider several factors. First, there are still several years before the outcome is known, which means that various scenarios could unfold between now and 2030.

In terms of the status quo, it's likely that wheat production and consumption patterns would continue as they have been in recent years, with some countries struggling with food security issues while others experience surpluses. The global market for wheat would remain relatively stable, with fluctuations depending on factors like weather conditions, trade policies, and consumer demand.

However, there are also scenarios where changes could occur that might impact the success of de-allergenizing wheat. For example, advances in agricultural technology, irrigation systems, and crop management practices could improve wheat yields and reduce environmental impact. Alternatively, a significant shift in consumer preferences towards alternative grains or plant-based diets could lead to reduced demand for wheat.

Another possible scenario is that Morocco, Jigawa State, and other countries invest in agricultural development programs, modernize their irrigation systems, and implement more efficient farming practices. This could enable them to increase domestic wheat production, reduce reliance on imports, and make it a net exporter.

Considering these factors, the likelihood of successfully de-allergenizing wheat by 2030 depends on various scenarios unfolding between now and then. However, it's possible that advances in agricultural technology and sustainable farming practices could drive progress towards this goal.
