Here's a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The status quo outcome, where OpenAI does not announce superintelligence, is more likely given the slow pace of change in most fields and the potential for overhyping "superintelligence." However, considering the rapid progress in AI research and OpenAI's efforts to develop more advanced AI capabilities, a scenario resulting in a Yes outcome is not entirely implausible.

While it's possible that OpenAI might delay or cancel its plans for superintelligence due to unforeseen technical challenges or concerns about potential risks and consequences, the company's focus on safety measures and recent developments suggest that they may make significant progress and announce their findings.

It's also important to consider the possibility that OpenAI's focus might shift to other AI-related projects, leading to a delay or no announcement at all. However, if the company continues to make progress on their superintelligence project and decides to publicly announce its development and release, it would likely lead to a positive outcome (Yes).

Ultimately, while there are valid reasons for expecting either a Yes or No outcome, the most likely scenario is that OpenAI will not make any significant announcements regarding superintelligence in 2027.
