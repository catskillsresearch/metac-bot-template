Here's a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual forecast:

The time left until the outcome is known is uncertain, but it could be anywhere from 3-6 months. In the absence of an agreement, Ukraine maintains control over its territories, with Russia having no significant influence or recognition of occupied territories.

There are two main scenarios that could result in a "Yes" outcome: (1) Ukraine reaches a mutually acceptable compromise on the control of occupied territories, possibly involving de facto recognition of Russian control over certain regions; and (2) the US and Russia reach an agreement, which includes de facto recognition of Russian control over certain Ukrainian territories.

On the other hand, if there is no agreement, Ukraine may continue to maintain its stance on sovereignty, refusing any concessions that would acknowledge Russia's control over occupied territories. This could lead to a prolonged and potentially more violent conflict.

The status quo outcome, where Ukraine maintains control over its territories without recognition of Russian control, seems plausible given the complexity and contentious nature of the issue. However, it is also possible that Ukraine and Russia reach an agreement that involves de facto recognition of Russian control over certain regions, as seen in some peace agreements in the past.

Ultimately, the outcome depends on various factors, including the willingness of both sides to compromise, external pressure from international actors like the US and European countries, and the potential for new developments or crises that could influence the negotiations.
