Here's a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The likelihood of both first elected Senators from Puerto Rico being Republicans depends on various factors. One crucial aspect is the political climate in the United States, which suggests that Congress may be more likely to maintain the status quo or consider alternative solutions rather than granting statehood. Additionally, Puerto Rico's current financial struggles and economic challenges may not provide a compelling reason for the US government to grant statehood.

Furthermore, the process of adding a new state is complex, requiring significant legislative and administrative efforts. This complexity, combined with potential opposition from certain lawmakers or other factors, increases the likelihood that the status quo will prevail.

However, it's also important to consider scenarios where strong support for statehood among Puerto Ricans and the US government could lead to bipartisan agreement in Congress and a successful passage of legislation making Puerto Rico the 51st state. This possibility is supported by the fact that some politicians have shown interest in granting Puerto Rican statehood.

In conclusion, while there are valid arguments for and against Puerto Rico's statehood, the current political climate and complexity of the process suggest that it's more likely that the status quo will prevail. However, scenarios where strong support for statehood leads to a successful outcome cannot be ruled out entirely.
