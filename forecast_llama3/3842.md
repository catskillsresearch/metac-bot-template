Here is a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome is known plays a significant role in determining whether a majority of physicists will accept the many-worlds interpretation by 2050. As with other complex questions, it's essential to consider the status quo outcome if nothing changed, which in this case would be that the many-worlds interpretation remains a minority view within the physics community.

Scenarios that result in a No outcome could involve a lack of significant scientific advancements or paradigm shifts that would lead to a broader acceptance of the many-worlds interpretation. This might also include the continued dominance of other interpretations, such as the Copenhagen interpretation, which is currently the most widely accepted view.

On the other hand, scenarios that result in a Yes outcome could involve breakthroughs in quantum mechanics or major advancements in our understanding of the universe that would make the many-worlds interpretation more plausible and appealing to a majority of physicists. This might also include changes in public perception or government policies that create an environment more conducive to the acceptance of alternative interpretations.

Given these factors, it's essential to consider the pace of scientific progress, the current state of the physics community, and potential future developments that could influence the outcome.
