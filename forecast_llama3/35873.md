Here is a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The current situation provides some uncertainty surrounding the outcome, as there are still several months left until the outcome becomes clear. However, based on current trends and data, it's likely that the status quo outcome will prevail, with the $7,500 tax credit for electric vehicles continuing to exist or being only slightly modified. This is because the incentives seem to have had a positive impact on EV sales and adoption rates.

At the same time, there are some factors that could lead to an unexpected outcome, such as a sudden change in global energy policies or the emergence of new, affordable energy storage technologies that disrupt the EV market. Additionally, government priorities, budget constraints, or concerns about the environmental impact of EVs could also lead to changes in the tax credits and incentives.

However, it's important to note that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Therefore, a moderate probability should be assigned to unexpected outcomes to account for surprises.
