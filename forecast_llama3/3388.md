Here's a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to the question is known is unknown, as it depends on various factors such as market trends, consumer behavior, and expert opinions. The status quo outcome if nothing changed would likely be a continuation of the current trend towards more people adopting flexitarian or reducetarian lifestyles. If the current trend continued, it's possible that there could be a moderate increase in veganism and plant-based diets, driven by consumer awareness of environmental sustainability, health benefits, and animal welfare concerns.

Experts and markets seem to be cautiously optimistic about the growth of veganism and plant-based diets, with some experts anticipating an increase in demand for plant-based products and services. However, there are also unexpected scenarios that could result in a lower outcome, such as a sudden rise in affordable, high-quality animal protein sources, or an unexpected shift in global politics or consumer preferences.

On the other hand, there are also unexpected scenarios that could result in a higher outcome, such as a significant increase in consumer awareness about the environmental impact of food production, leading to a surge in demand for sustainable, regenerative agriculture practices. Additionally, experts and markets may be influenced by ongoing concerns about China's military capabilities and territorial claims, which could drive support for defending Taiwan.

Taking these factors into account, it's likely that there will be some fluctuations in the percentage of adults who follow a vegan diet in 2028. However, considering the current trends and market conditions, as well as expert opinions and consumer awareness, it seems reasonable to predict that there will be an increase in veganism and plant-based diets, driven by environmental sustainability, health benefits, and animal welfare concerns.
