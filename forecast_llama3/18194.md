Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to the question is known is uncertain, as ongoing research and breakthroughs in this area are continually providing new insights. The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be no room-temperature superconductor being developed or discovered anytime soon, given the current focus on high-pressure or high-temperature conditions to achieve superconductivity.

A scenario that results in a No outcome could involve researchers continuing to focus primarily on materials with complex structures or exotic properties, leading to slow progress and no breakthroughs at the room temperature level. This might also occur if funding for research is reduced or shifted to other areas, hindering progress.

On the other hand, a scenario that results in a Yes outcome could involve significant breakthroughs in understanding the underlying physics of high-temperature superconductivity, leading to the development of new materials or technologies that enable room-temperature operation. This might happen if scientists successfully identify and synthesize new materials with improved properties, such as higher critical temperatures, and advances in computational simulations guide the design process.

Overall, it is uncertain whether a room-temperature, ambient-pressure superconductor will be used in a commercial application before 2030.
