Here's a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to the question is known is uncertain, as various scenarios and variables can affect the likelihood of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan. However, considering the current status quo, it appears that China and Taiwan are engaged in a state of tension and military posturing, with China's aggressive shipbuilding strategy and provocative incursions into Taiwanese shipping lanes and airspace being major concerns.

The status quo outcome if nothing changed suggests that Taiwan remains independent and not invaded by China. However, this scenario assumes no significant changes in the global political landscape or regional dynamics, which could alter the probability of a Chinese invasion.

A possible scenario where there is no Chinese invasion of Taiwan could be if China's economic and military power continues to decline due to Western economic and technological encirclement, leading it to reevaluate its priorities and focus on domestic development rather than pursuing an aggressive foreign policy. On the other hand, another possible scenario could be if President Xi Jinping's ambitions for territorial expansion are met with little opposition or deterrence from the international community, leading China to feel emboldened and deciding to take decisive action to assert its claims.

Ultimately, the likelihood of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan depends on various factors, including changes in the global political landscape, regional dynamics, and internal developments within China.
