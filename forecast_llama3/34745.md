Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome is known is approximately 6 months, considering the natural pace of political developments. The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be Pedro Sánchez's government maintaining its power and stability, with the PSOE party continuing to lead the country.

A scenario that could result in a No outcome (Sánchez losing his position) is if there is a significant loss of public trust in Sánchez due to a major scandal or economic crisis. If this happens, it's possible that the opposition parties could gain momentum and form a coalition government without Sánchez at the helm. Alternatively, internal conflicts within the PSOE party could lead to Sánchez's departure.

On the other hand, a scenario that could result in a Yes outcome (Sánchez maintaining his position) is if he successfully navigates the current political landscape, maintaining public support and avoiding major crises. This could be achieved through effective policy implementations, successful crisis management, or strategic alliances with other parties.

Given these scenarios, it's reasonable to assume that the status quo outcome has a significant weight, around 60-70%, as Sánchez's government has a strong foundation of power and stability. The scenario resulting in a No outcome has a moderate weight, around 20-30%, as it is possible but not yet likely. The scenario resulting in a Yes outcome has a lower weight, around 10-20%, as it requires specific circumstances to occur.

Overall, the likelihood of Pedro Sánchez remaining as Prime Minister is quite high, given the current status quo and the challenges he faces are manageable.

### Probability: 65%
