Here is a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The likelihood of reported human-to-human transmission of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 globally before 2026 depends on various factors. Firstly, it's essential to consider the status quo outcome, where the virus continues to circulate mainly among animals and does not acquire the ability to transmit efficiently between humans. This is supported by current trends and reports, with no documented cases of sustained transmission.

However, unexpected events or changes in the virus's behavior could lead to a scenario where the avian influenza virus adapts to become more contagious and transmissible between humans. This might occur if there is a significant increase in animal cases, leading to increased human exposure and potential for viral evolution. Additionally, genetic mutations or environmental factors could create a favorable environment for human-to-human transmission.

Other factors that could influence the outcome include ongoing surveillance efforts, vaccination programs, and public health measures aimed at preventing transmission. The effectiveness of these measures would play a crucial role in determining whether the status quo outcome prevails or an unexpected scenario unfolds.

Ultimately, the probability of reported human-to-human transmission of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 globally before 2026 is uncertain, and it's essential to consider multiple scenarios and factors when assessing this question.
