Here is a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 4-7 years (2025-2032), considering current trends and data. The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be a world where climate change continues to worsen, greenhouse gas emissions remain high, and the consequences of inaction continue to unfold. This scenario assumes that current trends and policies do not change significantly.

A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome is one where governments fail to work together to address climate change, individual actions are insufficient to make a significant impact, and the lack of international cooperation and collective action leads to a world that is even more unsustainable than it is today. This could be triggered by a combination of factors, including political instability, economic downturns, or unforeseen environmental disasters.

On the other hand, a scenario that results in a Yes outcome would require a concerted global effort to transition away from fossil fuels, increase renewable energy production, and implement effective climate policies. This could be driven by a combination of factors, including technological advancements, changes in public opinion, or the consequences of severe weather events.

Ultimately, the probability of the world remaining on a trajectory towards a Yes outcome is influenced by the uncertainty surrounding global cooperation and collective action to address climate change. While there are signs of progress in climate action, the overall trend suggests that the status quo outcome is more likely, with some countries making more efforts to reduce emissions than others.

This assessment reflects my confidence that global efforts to address climate change will continue, albeit with some challenges and setbacks. However, I also recognize the potential for negative outcomes if international cooperation falters or key stakeholders fail to take decisive action.

Probability: 60-65%
