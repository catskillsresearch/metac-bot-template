Here's a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome is known is significant, with the 2028 presidential election still over two years away. However, considering the current political landscape and trends, it's likely that the status quo outcome would be a Democratic win, with a moderate or progressive candidate emerging victorious.

One possible scenario that could lead to a No outcome (i.e., Republicans winning the presidency) is if a strong Republican challenger emerges, capitalizing on current political divisions and societal concerns to rally the party's base and win over moderate voters. Alternatively, a significant shift in public opinion towards conservatism, combined with effective Republican messaging and candidate recruitment, could also lead to the Republicans regaining control of the White House.

On the other hand, another possible scenario that could result in a Yes outcome (i.e., Democrats winning the presidency) is if the Democratic Party unites behind a strong candidate, leveraging the momentum from their recent successes in state elections and local politics to build a broad coalition of support. Additionally, if popular Democratic candidates emerge to challenge Trump Jr. or other potential Republican nominees, it could allow the party to maintain its grip on the presidency.

Overall, while there are factors that could lead to a change in power, the current political climate and trends suggest that the status quo outcome is more likely. Therefore, a moderate probability (around 70-75%) seems reasonable for this outcome.

### Probability: 65%
