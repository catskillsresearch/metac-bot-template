Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to the question is known is likely to be decades or even centuries, considering the long-term and complex nature of cryonics research. The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be that people continue to die and be buried or cremated, and cryonics remains a fringe technology with no proven benefits for human revival.

However, there are scenarios where significant breakthroughs could lead to successful revivals. One possible scenario is the rapid progress in understanding cellular decay, tissue engineering, and artificial intelligence, enabling the development of reversible cryopreservation techniques. This could lead to the successful revival of humans or animals, opening up new possibilities for medicine, science, and society as a whole.

Another possible scenario is that significant advancements are made in understanding the human brain and developing treatments for age-related diseases. If this leads to a greater emphasis on preserving and reviving the human body, rather than just freezing it, then cryonics could become a more viable option.

Additionally, breakthroughs could occur suddenly, driven by advances in fields like neuroscience, biotechnology, or artificial intelligence, which enable the preservation and revival of complex biological systems. In this scenario, the successful revival of humans or animals could lead to widespread acceptance and adoption of cryonics as a method for extending human lifespan or reviving the dead.

Overall, while there are valid arguments for both "Yes" and "No" outcomes, it is essential to maintain an open mind and re-evaluate our forecast as new information becomes available.
