Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The likelihood of the EU having a mandatory multi-tiered animal welfare labelling scheme in place by 2025 depends on various factors. One key consideration is the status quo outcome, which suggests that the current situation where animal diseases and sustainable use of pesticides remain significant challenges may persist unless there are effective policies implemented, increased investment in research and development, and widespread adoption of best practices by farmers.

However, momentum for change is building, driven by growing awareness of animal welfare issues and public pressure. This could contribute to a shift towards positive outcomes, such as the implementation of reforms that prioritize animal welfare concerns like cage-free farming, reducing antibiotic use, and improving farm-to-table practices.

The likelihood of change is also influenced by economic pressures, societal attitudes, and political factors. While some forecasts suggest that the EU may continue to permit fur farming or not have animal welfare standards that meet minimum legal requirements for all meat sold in supermarkets, others propose scenarios where consumer demand drives market shifts towards better animal welfare standards, leading to increased sales from farms with improved conditions.

Ultimately, the outcome will depend on a complex interplay of factors. While the status quo outcome may seem more likely due to the slow pace of change, there is also potential for significant progress if policymakers prioritize reforms and stakeholders work together to address challenges.
