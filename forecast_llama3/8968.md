Here's a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The Federal Reserve's decision on setting a target policy rate that is negative by 2050 is likely to be influenced by various economic indicators, such as inflation, unemployment, and GDP growth. The world changes slowly most of the time, which suggests that the status quo outcome of maintaining the current monetary policy stance without making any significant changes to interest rates is more likely.

However, recent trends and events may also suggest a possibility for the Federal Reserve to adjust its interest rate policy in response to changing economic conditions. For instance, if the economy continues to grow at a moderate pace with low inflation and stable employment numbers, the Fed may consider maintaining its current interest rate policy or even raising interest rates to prevent overheating of the economy.

On the other hand, unexpected events such as a severe recession or a significant increase in inflation could prompt the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates higher for longer to stabilize the economy. Additionally, global economic uncertainty and potential trade tensions may also impact the Fed's decision-making process.

Overall, while the status quo outcome is more likely, there are various scenarios that could affect the outcome of the Federal Reserve's decision on setting a target policy rate that is negative by 2050.
