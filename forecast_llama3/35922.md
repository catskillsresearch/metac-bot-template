Here's a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome is known will depend on various factors and human actions. The status quo outcome would be that the regulations and tax credits remain largely unchanged, with some potential tweaks or adjustments as usual. However, there are scenarios where a significant increase in global temperature above 2°C compared to pre-industrial levels could occur if greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise unabated.

A scenario that results in a No outcome is if there's a significant change in the political landscape or a shift in public opinion that leads policymakers to reevaluate the effectiveness of these tax credits. On the other hand, a scenario that results in a Yes outcome is if there's continued momentum and growth in the adoption of clean energy technologies, driving increased demand for tax credits and regulatory support.

Moreover, the persistence of human activities contributing to climate change makes it more likely that the status quo outcome will prevail. However, a significant reduction in emissions and transition to renewable energy sources would require substantial changes, which may not occur quickly enough to prevent exceeding the 2°C threshold.

In addition, some regulations have been finalized, but others are still subject to change or modification. This leaves approximately 20% unknown and potentially uncertain. A No outcome could also occur if the Trump administration decides to rescind or significantly modify the regulations, leading to uncertainty and potential delays for clean energy projects.

Overall, while there are potential risks and uncertainties, the overall trend towards clean energy adoption and regulatory support is likely to continue.
