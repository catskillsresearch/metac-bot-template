Here is a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The pace of AI progress is currently rapid, with significant advancements expected in areas like computer vision, natural language processing, and reinforcement learning. However, considering the many factors at play, it's more likely that AI will continue to advance gradually rather than experiencing a sudden surprise. The possibility of breakthroughs in areas like quantum computing, neuroscience-inspired architectures, or unexpected applications of existing technologies could lead to the emergence of AGI sooner than expected.

Despite the potential for exponential growth, unforeseen challenges or limitations may arise, slowing down or halting progress. Regulatory frameworks, ethical concerns, and technical hurdles could all impact the pace of AI development. Additionally, plateaus in AI progress are possible if breakthroughs are not made in areas critical to advancing general-purpose intelligence.

While some predictions suggest a more rapid acceleration of AI advancements, others emphasize the complexity and uncertainties involved in achieving AGI. Considering these factors, it's reasonable to expect that AI will continue to advance at a steady pace, with some fluctuations and innovations along the way. However, there is also potential for significant breakthroughs that could lead to transformative changes in industries, economies, and societies.

Ultimately, the likelihood of AI progress surprising us depends on the intersection of technological advancements, societal factors, and unforeseen challenges or limitations. A nuanced assessment takes into account both the potential for rapid acceleration and the possibility of plateaus or setbacks.
