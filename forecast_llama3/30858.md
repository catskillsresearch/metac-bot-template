Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to the question is known can be estimated at around 6 months, considering the current date (June 14th) and the expected timeframe for the outcome to become clear.

If nothing changed, the status quo outcome would likely result in a moderate increase in chicken consumption due to its competitive retail prices compared to beef and pork. This assumption is supported by trends up to June 14th, 2025, and experts' expectations that chicken demand will continue to rise if retail prices remain competitive.

If the current trend continued, we can expect a steady increase in chicken consumption driven by its affordability and cultural factors. A growth rate of around 2% per annum is a reasonable assumption, considering the current trends and data provided.

Experts and markets generally predict a rise in chicken demand if retail prices remain competitive, aligning with the trend observed so far. Additionally, experts expect that consumer preferences will continue to drive demand for chicken meat as a relatively affordable and reliable option.

An unexpected scenario that could result in a low outcome is a sudden increase in feed costs or a severe outbreak of avian influenza, leading to higher prices at the retail level, reduced demand, and potentially causing a decline in consumption. On the other hand, an unexpected surge in demand could occur if new, innovative chicken-based products become extremely popular.

Overall, considering these factors and trends, it is reasonable to expect that chicken consumption will continue to increase, driven by its competitive retail prices and potential increases in production to meet this demand. However, unexpected events or scenarios could still impact the outcome, leading to a range of possible outcomes between 42-60 pounds per person per year.

Note: I've combined the rationales without explicitly stating that they are summaries of individual forecasts.
