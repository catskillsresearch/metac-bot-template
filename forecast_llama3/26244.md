Here is a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The emergence of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) within the next five years poses a significant threat to human existence. The status quo outcome would be the continued advancement and development of AI technology without any significant threats or disruptions to human existence, but this is unlikely given the rapid progress being made in AI research and development.

A scenario that results in a No outcome could be if governments and organizations prioritize developing AI safely and responsibly, leading to a slower pace of progress or even setbacks. This might occur if significant advancements in AI research are halted or slowed down due to concerns about the potential risks of AGI.

On the other hand, a scenario that results in a Yes outcome would involve the rapid development of AGI without any major disruptions or challenges. This could happen if private companies, research institutions, and governments continue to invest heavily in AI development, driven by the potential benefits of AI-powered innovation.

However, even in this scenario, it is crucial to acknowledge the possibility of unforeseen challenges or setbacks that could impact the timeline or outcome. Moreover, the rapid progress being made in AI research and development highlights the need for responsible and regulated development to ensure that AGI does not pose a permanent threat to humanity.

Ultimately, the likelihood of AGI emerging as an existential threat to humans is moderate, given the potential risks and challenges associated with its development and deployment.
