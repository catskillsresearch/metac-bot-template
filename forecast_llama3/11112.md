Here is a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The likelihood of China invading Taiwan before 2035 depends on various factors, including the current trajectory of international relations, regional power dynamics, and China's internal economic and social priorities. Historically, conflicts are relatively rare, and countries tend to maintain the status quo unless there is a significant change in circumstances or a major escalation of tensions.

China's military modernization efforts and economic growth could lead it to become overconfident and perceive an opportunity to invade Taiwan. However, this scenario assumes that China would be willing to risk international backlash, potential damage to its reputation, and the risk of escalating the conflict into a global war.

On the other hand, there are factors that suggest China may not invade Taiwan in the near future. The country's slowing economy, internal social issues, and diplomatic efforts with the US and other nations could reduce tensions and make an invasion less feasible or desirable for China. Additionally, international pressure and potential sanctions could deter China from taking military action.

Ultimately, the probability of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan before 2035 depends on the interplay between these factors. While there is some uncertainty surrounding the outcome, it is possible that China may focus on economic development and international cooperation rather than military conflict, which would suggest a No outcome.

This rationale does not necessarily favor one scenario over another but instead considers various perspectives and factors to provide a comprehensive understanding of the situation.
