Here's a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The average global CO2 atmospheric concentration will likely continue to rise unless there is a significant shift in societal behavior, technological advancements, or natural factors that mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. The current trend suggests that human activities such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation are driving greenhouse gas emissions, leading to an increase in global temperature.

However, it's possible that a sudden and unexpected global transition to renewable energy sources could occur, driven by breakthroughs in clean energy technology or widespread government policies promoting the adoption of green technologies. Alternatively, extreme weather events such as heatwaves, droughts, and heavy rainfall could persist globally, releasing more CO2 into the atmosphere and exacerbating the problem.

Another scenario that could lead to a decrease in global average temperature is a rapid decline in industrial emissions, possibly driven by significant societal shifts or technological advancements. On the other hand, prolonged periods of strong El Ni√±o events or population growth, economic development, and climate-related feedback loops could accelerate global warming.

In general, it's reasonable to assume that the status quo outcome (increasing global average temperature) is likely to continue unless there are significant changes in human activities or natural factors. The pace of change in the world is slow, and major societal shifts or unexpected technological advancements would be required to alter this trend.
