Here's a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to the question is known is uncertain, with some forecasting scenarios suggesting several months or years, while others assume it could be known within a few weeks. Regardless, it's essential to consider the status quo outcome if nothing changed. In this scenario, India continues its efforts in technology advancements and innovation, with no significant disruptions or changes.

However, unforeseen challenges or budget constraints could hinder progress, leading to a slower pace of development or even a halt in advancements. On the other hand, continued innovation and investment in gravitational wave detector technology, combined with advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning, could lead to breakthroughs in detection capabilities and accuracy.

The likelihood of a third LIGO detector being built in India depends on various factors, including government support, funding, and technological advancements. A scenario where the Indian government recognizes the importance of technology advancements in promoting independence and accessibility for people with physical disabilities could lead to increased investment in smart wheelchairs and other innovative technologies.

Ultimately, the probability of a third LIGO detector being built in India before 2028 depends on the interplay between these factors. While there are uncertainties and challenges ahead, the potential benefits of such an endeavor make it a plausible scenario.

### Probability: 80%
