Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome is known is significant, approximately 25 years. In this timeframe, trends can evolve, and new patterns may emerge. However, some underlying factors, such as societal norms and traditional gender influences, are more likely to persist than change quickly.

Currently, women make up only a small proportion of graduates with top-paying bachelor's degrees. This status quo outcome is likely to continue unless there are concerted efforts to promote greater diversity in high-paying fields and offer targeted support for underrepresented groups.

Scenarios that result in a Yes outcome include increased government support for STEM education and careers, growing demand for diverse perspectives in industries, and shifting societal norms promoting greater gender equality. These factors could lead to more women pursuing and achieving top-paying college degrees.

While it is possible for significant changes to occur, the weight of evidence suggests that the status quo outcome is more likely to persist unless there are deliberate efforts to address the underlying issues driving the current gap. However, it is also important to consider the scenarios that could drive change and improve the chances of a Yes outcome.

In conclusion, the likelihood of women receiving at least 70% of bachelor's degrees in the US by 2050 depends on the persistence or change of societal norms, government support for STEM education, and industry demand for diverse perspectives.

### Probability: 60%
