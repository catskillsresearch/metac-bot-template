Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The search for life on Mars is an ongoing process that requires significant advancements in technology, international cooperation, and scientific breakthroughs. While there have been some promising discoveries, such as evidence of water and methane on Mars, finding definitive proof of life on Mars may take several years or even decades.

Currently, the status quo outcome is that humanity has not found conclusive evidence of life on Mars, and it's likely that we won't find it in the near future. However, if significant progress is made in areas such as astrobiology, planetary science, and robotics, it's possible to imagine scenarios where humans establish a self-sustaining presence on Mars or discover biosignatures in the planet's atmosphere.

One scenario that could lead to a Yes outcome is if NASA and other space agencies continue to send missions to Mars and find conclusive evidence of water on the planet. This could be through the detection of biosignatures, such as oxygen or methane, which are indicative of biological activity.

On the other hand, lack of significant progress in detecting extraterrestrial life could be attributed to the limitations of current detection methods and the vast distances between stars. The search for extraterrestrial life might continue, but without any major discoveries or breakthroughs.

Ultimately, finding evidence of life on Mars will require overcoming numerous challenges, including technological hurdles, financial constraints, and potential setbacks. While there are many uncertainties involved, it's possible to imagine scenarios where humanity makes progress in searching for extraterrestrial life, whether through robotic missions or human exploration.
