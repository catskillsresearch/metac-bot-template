Here's a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to the question is known is significant, with several years remaining before the outcome becomes clear. However, considering the status quo outcome, it seems likely that UEFA Champions League matches will not be hosted in the United States by 2033. The current lack of concrete plans or agreements in place for hosting Champions League matches outside of Europe, combined with concerns about disrupting the traditional Champions League format and maintaining the integrity of the competition, suggest that this is the most probable outcome.

However, there are potential scenarios that could lead to a "Yes" outcome. These include changes in consumer behavior, advances in digital technology, or shifts in the global sports landscape that could drive UEFA's decision to expand its global reach by hosting matches outside of Europe. Additionally, successful negotiations between UEFA and Relevent Sports on commercial rights agreements, as well as amends to FIFA's policy allowing national leagues to host matches in different countries, could also contribute to a "Yes" outcome.

Ultimately, while the status quo outcome is likely, there are potential factors that could lead to a change in this situation. A combination of these factors and their relative weights will determine whether UEFA Champions League matches are hosted in the United States by 2033.
