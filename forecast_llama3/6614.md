Here is a rationale that combines the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to this question is known is approximately 2-3 years, depending on current trends and expert opinions. If nothing changes, it's likely that Bitcoin's price will continue to fluctuate, potentially ranging between $90,000 and $150,000. However, if the current trend of increasing institutional adoption and growing interest in Bitcoin as a digital store of value continues, we could see the price of Bitcoin reach $1 million or more by 2030.

Experts and market analysts predict that Bitcoin's price will reach at least $500,000 to $1 million by 2030. Some even estimate it could go as high as $13 million (as mentioned in one of the articles). However, unexpected scenarios could result in a low outcome, such as an unexpected regulatory crackdown on cryptocurrency exchanges or a significant increase in mining difficulties.

On the other hand, unexpected scenarios that could drive up Bitcoin's price include a sudden and widespread adoption of Bitcoin as a reserve currency by major central banks or governments, which could cause its value to skyrocket, potentially reaching $5 million or more. Another possible scenario is a major breakthrough in blockchain technology or the widespread adoption of Bitcoin as a store of value by institutional investors, which could propel its price to new heights, potentially reaching over $10 million.

Overall, while there are many factors that could influence the future price of Bitcoin, it's likely that we'll see significant growth if current trends continue and unexpected scenarios don't disrupt the market.
