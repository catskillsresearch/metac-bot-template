Here's a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The search for extraterrestrial life is an ongoing process that has been underway for decades, with no conclusive evidence found so far. However, recent breakthroughs in exoplanet discoveries and advanced theoretical models suggest that the possibility of extraterrestrial life is higher than ever before.

While it's essential to consider the current state of knowledge and the pace at which science advances, it's also important to acknowledge the potential for exciting breakthroughs that could lead to a "Yes" outcome. New technologies or research breakthroughs could enable us to detect signs of life beyond Earth, such as advancements in radio astronomy or the development of more sensitive telescopes.

On the other hand, it's also possible that future exoplanet discoveries may not yield any signs of biological activity or biosignatures, and advanced telescopes and space exploration missions may fail to detect any indicators of alien life. This could lead to a scenario where we conclude that we are likely alone in the universe.

Ultimately, the likelihood of finding conclusive evidence for extraterrestrial life depends on the pace of scientific progress, the development of new technologies, and our ability to interpret data from ongoing and future missions. Considering these factors, it's reasonable to estimate that we may have a conclusive answer within the next few years or decades, but the actual outcome is uncertain.

This combined rationale takes into account the slow pace of change in scientific discoveries, the potential for exciting breakthroughs, and the possibility of continued searches without significant findings.
