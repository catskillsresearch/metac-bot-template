Here's a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to the question is unknown, as it involves Russia's actions and territories in the future. The status quo outcome is likely, given the slow pace of change in global politics, with Russia continuing to occupy and expand its influence in resource-rich territories in Ukraine.

However, this stability can be disrupted by external factors or internal developments within Russia. International pressure, economic sanctions, or diplomatic efforts could lead to a negotiated settlement, resulting in Russia's influence diminishing or remaining stable rather than increasing. On the other hand, Russia might continue to make strategic gains on the ground, solidifying its control over key territories and potentially securing access to valuable resources.

A scenario that results in a No outcome (Russia does not significantly expand its territory) could involve international pressure leading to a ceasefire agreement between Russia and Ukraine, or diplomatic efforts resulting in a negotiated settlement. Alternatively, Russia might be stalled due to internal political dynamics or external factors, preventing significant territorial gains.

In contrast, a scenario that results in a Yes outcome (Russia significantly expands its territory) could arise from an escalation of hostilities, with Russia gaining an upper hand in the conflict, driven by changes in international pressure, economic sanctions, or internal political dynamics in Ukraine.
