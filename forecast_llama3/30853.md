Here's a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to the question is known is unknown, as it depends on various factors such as global trends, market conditions, and the companies' strategies. The status quo outcome if nothing changed is that antimicrobial drug use in livestock will continue to rise, driven by the increasing demand for animal-derived products, leading to concerns over antibiotic resistance and its impact on human health.

One possible scenario that could lead to a decrease in antimicrobial drug use is the widespread adoption of alternative farming practices, such as regenerative agriculture or organic farming methods, which prioritize soil health, biodiversity, and ecosystem services over chemical-intensive approaches. On the other hand, a scenario that could drive antimicrobial drug use even higher is the continued rise of global meat consumption, particularly in developing countries, where demand for affordable animal protein is expected to increase.

The key factors at play are the growth of the global population, urbanization, changes in consumption patterns, and the development of alternative solutions. While some factors might contribute to a slight decrease or increase, the overall trend is expected to continue unless significant changes occur.

Incorporating these factors, I would put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world tends to change slowly. However, I also consider the uncertainty surrounding future trends and the possibility of disruptions or surprises that could alter the trajectory of antimicrobial drug use in livestock farming.
