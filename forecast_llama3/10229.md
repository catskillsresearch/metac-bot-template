Here's a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The current fertility rate in Russia is around 1.41 births per woman, but this trend may not continue indefinitely. A key factor influencing fertility rates is economic security and stability, which can impact reproductive decisions. The natural population decline has been increasing by 20% annually since 2023, with the number of births decreasing and deaths increasing.

If nothing changes, the current trend might lead to a slight decrease in fertility rates over the next few years. However, unexpected events or scenarios could alter this trajectory. For instance, a severe economic downturn or crisis could lead to reduced financial security and changed reproductive priorities, resulting in lower birth rates. On the other hand, an unexpected rise in government support for families, such as increased child benefits or childcare subsidies, could increase fertility rates.

Expert predictions and market expectations suggest that fertility rates may remain low, potentially dropping to 1.32 or even lower. However, there is some uncertainty surrounding these forecasts, particularly in light of the complexity and volatility of demographic trends.

Overall, it seems likely that Russia's fertility rate will continue to decline slightly over the next few years, potentially reaching around 1.35-1.40 births per woman by 2027.
