Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The likelihood of the US placing restrictions on the total compute capacity individuals or companies are allowed to have before 2026 depends on various factors. The status quo outcome, where current rules governing chip exports remain in place, is possible if international cooperation and diplomacy effectively address global issues, reducing the need for stricter controls. However, recent trends and events related to chip exports and national security suggest that a Yes outcome is also plausible.

The imposition of new restrictions on chip export could be driven by concerns about national security risks, intellectual property theft, or human rights abuses. The dynamic nature of international relations and the ever-evolving landscape of technology mean that the US government may need to adapt its policies to address emerging challenges.

In addition, the recent changes in global politics and the emergence of new technologies could lead to a scenario where the US government decides to impose stricter controls on chip exports. This could happen if there is significant opposition from technology companies or international pressure that makes it difficult for the US government to justify imposing less restrictive measures.

Furthermore, while the world tends to change slowly most of the time, recent events have shown that unexpected breakthroughs in computing technology or changes in global politics can lead to increased cooperation between countries, reducing the need for restrictive export controls. This possibility should also be considered when evaluating the likelihood of new restrictions being placed on chip exports.

Ultimately, the likelihood of the US placing restrictions on the total compute capacity individuals or companies are allowed to have before 2026 depends on a complex interplay of factors, including international relations, technological advancements, and national security concerns.
