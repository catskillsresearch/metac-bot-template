Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome is known is uncertain, but it's reasonable to assume that some factors will influence the outcome. The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be that Donald Trump does not remain in office or continue to serve as President beyond his elected term.

A scenario that could lead to a No outcome is if Trump's popularity continues to decline, leading to widespread discontent and galvanizing opposition from Congress and the public. Alternatively, significant revelations about Trump's actions or policies could contribute to a No outcome. On the other hand, if Trump maintains good relations with Congress and foreign leaders, and economic conditions remain strong or improve during his term, this could lead to a continued presence in office.

However, it's also possible that Trump may find ways to manipulate the law and seek support from Congress to avoid prison, allowing him to run for president again. Additionally, if Trump is able to clear his legal issues and use his charisma and loyal fan base to win over enough swing voters, he could secure another term in office.

Overall, it's difficult to pinpoint an exact date or event that would reveal the outcome, but considering these scenarios and factors, a consistent rationale emerges: Donald Trump's continued presence in office beyond his elected term is unlikely unless he finds ways to manipulate the law or maintain strong public support.
