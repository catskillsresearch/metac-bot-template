Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to the question is known is considerable, with at least 6 months remaining before Russia can be expected to annex any Baltic country. The status quo outcome is likely a "No" answer, as there are currently no recent instances of Russia annexing new territories, and the Baltic states have already disconnected from the Russian energy grid and are diversifying their energy sources.

A scenario that results in a No outcome would involve Russia maintaining good relations with Europe and the United States, leading to increased economic cooperation and diplomatic ties. This could potentially weaken any desire or capability to annex Baltic countries. The ongoing conflict in Ukraine and Western sanctions against Russia could also further embolden Russia's assertive behavior.

Additionally, a continued focus on internal development and economic growth by Russian President Vladimir Putin, combined with increased international pressure and sanctions, might lead Russia to prioritize domestic issues over territorial expansion. This could result in no further annexations or territorial changes for the foreseeable future.

Furthermore, the historical context and current international environment suggest that the status quo outcome (No) is more likely to occur. The annexation of Crimea was a one-off event driven by specific circumstances, and while Russia may still have territorial aspirations, it seems less likely to engage in further annexations without significant changes in the regional or global political landscape.

Considering these factors, I would argue that the status quo outcome (no annexation) is more likely than a significant change occurring in the near term.
