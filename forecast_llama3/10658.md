Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 1-3 years, depending on various factors such as regulatory developments and market trends. The current status quo outcome if nothing changed suggests that there has been increased investment in nuclear energy in recent years, with some experts expecting a gradual increase in the number of reactors built.

The trend towards building more small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs) could continue, potentially leading to an increase in the number of reactors being built and planned. Experts seem to be cautiously optimistic about the future of nuclear energy, while markets are showing signs of growth with companies investing in nuclear energy.

However, unexpected scenarios could lead to a lower or higher outcome than expected. For instance, regulatory setbacks, public concern over safety or environmental impact, or breakthroughs in SMR technology could all influence the number of reactors built. Additionally, unforeseen changes in renewable energy production and storage capacity could also affect demand for nuclear power.

Ultimately, the best prediction is one that takes into account these factors, as well as expert expectations and market trends.
