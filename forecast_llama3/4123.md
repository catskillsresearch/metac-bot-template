Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The timeline for the development of superintelligent oracle AGI after a weak AGI is created is uncertain, but we can consider several factors to inform our prediction. If current trends continue, experts predict that AGI will arrive within 2-3 years, driven by advancements in computing power, data, and model complexity. This scenario assumes that the pace of progress continues uninterrupted.

However, unexpected scenarios could lead to either a lower or higher outcome. A sudden shift in government regulations or public opinion could slow down the development of AGI, potentially pushing its arrival to 36-48 months or beyond. On the other hand, breakthroughs in neuroscience or cognitive computing could accelerate the creation of more sophisticated and human-like AGI, leading to a superintelligent oracle within 6-18 months.

The expectations of experts and markets also play a significant role in shaping our prediction. Experts like Sam Altman, Eric Schmidt, and Alexandr Wang have predicted that AGI will arrive as soon as 2026. The market is optimistic, with investors pouring money into AI startups and research initiatives. This optimism could drive innovation and accelerate the development of AGI.

Finally, we must consider the possibility of unforeseen challenges or setbacks that could hinder the development of AGI. If governments invest heavily in AI research and development, the timeline for AGI could be accelerated to under 12 months. Conversely, a global regulatory crackdown on AI development could slow down progress, potentially leading to a delay or even cancellation of planned investments and innovations.

In light of these factors, we can infer that the timeline for the development of superintelligent oracle AGI is uncertain but likely to fall within a range of 2-5 years.
