Based on the rationales provided in each forecast, here is a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

Large-scale solar radiation management (SRM) technology is still an experimental solution with significant uncertainties and potential risks associated with it. The status quo outcome is likely to be the absence of widespread SRM deployment, as governments tend to prioritize emission reductions over geoengineering solutions due to concerns about the risks and unintended consequences.

However, climate change continues to accelerate, and its impacts are becoming more pronounced and widespread. This could lead to increased pressure on governments and international organizations to find innovative solutions to mitigate its effects. If there is a sudden and widespread recognition of the urgent need to address climate change, governments may prioritize the development and deployment of SRM technology as a last resort to prevent catastrophic outcomes.

The pace of global policy changes and technological advancements will be crucial in determining whether SRM becomes a reality. While some experts warn about the potential risks and unintended consequences of SRM, others argue that it could provide a temporary "insurance policy" against catastrophic climate impacts.

Ultimately, the likelihood of large-scale SRM deployment depends on the complex interplay between technological progress, international cooperation, and the perceived urgency of addressing climate change.
