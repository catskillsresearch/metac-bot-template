Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to the question is known is uncertain, as it depends on various factors such as technological advancements, societal developments, and breakthroughs in fields like artificial intelligence, nanotechnology, and regenerative medicine. The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be that cryonics remains an experimental and unproven method of preserving human life, with some people signing up for the process but others questioning its ethics and scientific validity.

A scenario that results in a No outcome could be that significant advances are made in medical technology and disease treatment, making it possible to cure or manage diseases without the need for cryonic preservation. This could lead to a decrease in interest in cryonics and a shift towards more established and effective methods of preserving human life.

On the other hand, a scenario that results in a Yes outcome could be that significant breakthroughs are made in fields like neuroscience, medicine, artificial intelligence, and nanotechnology, allowing for the repair or replacement of damaged tissues and organs, and the recreation of lost memories and personalities. This could lead to an increase in interest in cryonics and a growth in the number of people signing up for the process.

The challenges involved in reviving frozen bodies are significant, including the complexity of cellular damage caused by freezing, the difficulty in preserving memories and neural connections, and the limited understanding of the human brain's functions. However, while these challenges may not be overcome in the near future, they do not preclude the possibility that a breakthrough could occur, especially if new research and innovations emerge in the coming decades.

Ultimately, the probability of successfully reviving cryonically frozen individuals before 2100 will depend on the pace of technological advancements and societal developments. While there are currently no proven methods for reviving cryopreserved humans, the potential for a breakthrough remains.
