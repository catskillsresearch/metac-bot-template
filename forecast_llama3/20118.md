Here is the combined rationale:

The time left until the outcome to be known is approximately 5-6 years (2025-2030). The status quo outcome suggests that the job market will continue to evolve gradually, with some jobs being displaced by automation and AI, while new ones are created in emerging fields. However, this gradual evolution may not necessarily lead to a drastic increase or decrease in employment levels.

A scenario resulting in a Yes outcome involves rapid technological advancements, widespread adoption of AI and automation, and significant economic shifts leading to job losses across various sectors. On the other hand, a scenario that leads to 20 million people following a new AI-created religion would likely require a surge in innovation, entrepreneurship, and investment in upskilling and reskilling programs.

Considering these factors, it is essential to acknowledge that while the status quo outcome is more likely, there are scenarios where significant changes could lead to either job losses or the creation of new jobs. Therefore, it is crucial to consider both gradual evolution and potential disruptions when making a forecast about the likelihood of 20 million people following a new AI-created religion by 2030.
