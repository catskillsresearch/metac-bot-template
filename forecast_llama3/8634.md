Here's a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 5-12 years (depending on the forecast). If nothing changes, current trends suggest that around 50-60% of Americans will be affected by obesity by 2032. However, if the current trend continues, we may see an even higher percentage of Americans affected by obesity, potentially ranging from 60-70%.

Experts and markets predict similar outcomes, with some estimates ranging from 55-75%. An unexpected scenario that could result in a lower outcome is widespread adoption of healthy lifestyle habits, significant changes in food production and distribution, or breakthroughs in medical treatments that address obesity.

On the other hand, an unexpected scenario that could result in a higher outcome is lack of effective policy responses to combat obesity, significant increases in fast-food consumption, or unforeseen side effects from certain medications leading to weight gain.
