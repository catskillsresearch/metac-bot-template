Here's a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The likelihood of the Chinese Yuan being among the top 3 global payments currencies before 2030 depends on two primary factors: the current trends and the potential for significant disruptions or game-changers. On one hand, the US dollar has historically maintained its dominance in international trade and finance, with a share in global foreign exchange transactions exceeding 50%. However, there are signs of change, including the increasing willingness of countries to diversify their financial portfolios and the rise of alternative currencies like the petroyuan.

On the other hand, significant disruptions or game-changers could alter the current trajectory. These might include a major shift in global economic powers, a financial crisis that prompts countries to abandon the US dollar as a reserve currency, or the widespread adoption of digital currencies. China's rapid economic growth and increasing international influence also present a potential threat to the US dollar's dominance.

Ultimately, while the status quo outcome is likely to prevail unless there are significant external factors driving change, the uncertainty surrounding future events means that there is still a possibility for unexpected developments to shape the global financial landscape.
