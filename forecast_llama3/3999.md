Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The peak population of Antarctica by 2075 will be influenced by various factors, including current trends, expert opinions, and unexpected scenarios.

Currently, the world's population is expected to continue growing at a moderate pace, with some projections suggesting a peak around 10.3 billion people in the mid-2080s. However, this trend may slow down or even decline due to declining fertility rates and increasing life expectancy.

Experts generally agree that the world's population will continue to grow, but at a slower rate than in the past. Some predict a plateau or decline in certain regions, while others anticipate continued growth.

However, unexpected scenarios could significantly impact population growth rates. For example, an unforeseen global economic downturn or widespread adoption of sustainable practices could lead to a significant decrease in fertility rates and lower population projections. On the other hand, a sudden and sustained increase in life expectancy or technological advancements that reduce mortality rates could result in unexpected population growth.

Furthermore, demographic trends can also play a crucial role in shaping future population growth. If current demographic trends continue, the peak population could be reached even earlier, possibly in the late 2070s or early 2080s.

In conclusion, while it is difficult to predict with certainty what will happen, considering these factors and possible scenarios, we can create a range of outcomes that take into account both current trends and unexpected events.
