Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

**(a) The time left until the outcome is known.**: Based on current information and technological advancements, it seems that we have around 15-20 years before we can confirm whether humans will live on Mars or not. This estimate takes into account Elon Musk's ambitious plans and NASA's Artemis program.

**(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.**: If nothing changes, I predict that the number of people living on Mars will remain at zero for now. However, this is likely to change as private companies like SpaceX continue to push the boundaries of space exploration.

**(c) The current trend continued.**: If the current trend continues, with private companies like SpaceX leading the charge, I predict that we'll see a steady increase in the number of people living on Mars over the next 20 years. This could lead to a population of around 500-1,000 people by mid-century.

**(d) The expectations of experts and markets.**: Experts like Elon Musk and NASA officials are optimistic about the potential for human settlement on Mars. Markets are also responding positively to the idea, with investments pouring in to support space exploration initiatives. However, some experts and market expectations vary widely, with some being more skeptical about the feasibility of establishing a human settlement on Mars within the next 20 years.

**(e) Unexpected low outcome scenario.**: An unexpected scenario that could result in a lower number is if unforeseen technical challenges or regulatory hurdles delay or cancel the plans for establishing a human settlement on Mars. For example, if the development of necessary technologies or infrastructure takes longer than expected, or if there are significant changes in government policies or regulations that make it more difficult to establish a human settlement.

**(f) Unexpected high outcome scenario.**: An unexpected scenario that could result in a higher number is if breakthroughs are made in areas like life support systems, radiation protection, or advanced propulsion technologies, making it possible for humans to settle on Mars earlier than expected. For example, if a new technology allows for faster and more efficient travel to Mars, or if innovative life support systems can sustain human life for longer periods.

This combined rationale provides a comprehensive understanding of the factors that will influence the outcome of humans living on Mars within the next 20 years.
