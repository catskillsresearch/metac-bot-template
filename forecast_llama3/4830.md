Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 25 years, considering the current year as 2025. The status quo outcome if nothing changed would likely result in a continuation of the current trend of declining fertility rates, potentially reaching levels below 2.1 children per woman.

However, it's crucial to consider that experts and markets have different predictions, with some anticipating a continued decline in fertility rates while others foresee a slight increase. Moreover, unexpected scenarios could significantly impact the global fertility rate, such as a sudden shift towards more traditional or conservative values leading to an increase in birth rates (up to 2.5-3 children per woman) or widespread adoption of advanced family planning technologies resulting in a sharp decline in fertility rates (down to 1.4 children per woman).

Furthermore, cultural shifts towards smaller families or significant improvements in economic conditions, education levels, and healthcare systems could lead to an increase in fertility rates. On the other hand, unforeseen global pandemics or widespread economic crises could result in a sudden decline in birth rates.

Taking these factors into account, it's essential to consider the potential range of outcomes. The combined rationale suggests that the global fertility rate by 2050 could be anywhere between approximately 1.7 and 2.9 children per woman, with the most likely scenario being a continued decline, potentially reaching levels around 2.0-2.3 children per woman.
