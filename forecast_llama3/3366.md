Here is a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to this question is known is unknown. The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be around $18 billion-$20 billion by 2030, based on current trends and moderate growth in the space industry. However, if the current trend continues, we could see rapid growth driven by advancements in technology, increasing private investment, and government support. This could result in a market valuation of $1-2 trillion or more by 2030.

Experts and markets generally agree that the space economy will continue to grow rapidly, driven by innovation and increasing demand for space-related services and products. However, unexpected scenarios could result in either low or high outcomes. A sudden collapse of investor confidence in the space industry due to unforeseen challenges could lead to a market contraction. On the other hand, breakthroughs in reusable launch technology or government support for space exploration could accelerate growth and drive up market valuation.

Overall, while there is uncertainty surrounding the future of the space industry, it is likely that SpaceX's market valuation will continue to grow at a rapid pace, driven by innovation and increasing demand for its services.
