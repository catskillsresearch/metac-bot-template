Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The likelihood of the 12-month percentage change in the US Consumer Price Index being lower in November 2025 than it was in November 2024 depends on various factors. Firstly, we have some time left before the outcome becomes known, which provides an opportunity for economic trends and government policies to influence inflation rates. The status quo outcome would be a continuation of moderate inflation growth, with the Consumer Price Index likely remaining above 2.5% for the remainder of 2025, driven by strong corporate earnings and low unemployment.

However, there are scenarios that could result in a lower-than-expected CPI reading. For instance, unexpected shocks to global commodity prices, such as a sharp decline in oil prices or an increase in agricultural production, could lead to reduced inflationary pressures. Additionally, a prolonged period of economic stagnation characterized by low GDP growth and decreased consumer spending could also curb inflationary pressures.

On the other hand, there are scenarios that could result in a higher-than-expected CPI reading. For instance, if the US economy experiences strong growth driven by consumer spending and business investment, it could lead to higher-than-expected inflationary pressures. This might occur if there were significant tariff increases on imported goods or unexpected supply chain disruptions.

Overall, while the status quo outcome is more likely, there are various factors that could influence the CPI reading in November 2025. Therefore, a moderate probability of around 70% seems reasonable for the likelihood of the CPI being lower than expected.
