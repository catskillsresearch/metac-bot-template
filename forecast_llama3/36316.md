Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The likelihood of a federal investigation into President Trump's tariff announcements being launched before September 2025 depends on various factors. Firstly, the status quo outcome would be that no investigation occurs, as changes in this area tend to occur slowly. However, if there are widespread public outcries and pressure from lawmakers for an inquiry, the situation could escalate, leading to a federal investigation.

A scenario where an investigation is unlikely would involve President Trump's actions being scrutinized but ultimately deemed not motivated by insider trading or market manipulation. This might happen if evidence gathered does not support allegations of wrongdoing or if alternative explanations for market movements are found.

On the other hand, a scenario that results in a Yes outcome could involve an investigation uncovering evidence of insider trading or market manipulation by President Trump or those close to him. This might occur if whistleblowers come forward with information about advance knowledge of tariff decisions or financial records show suspicious transactions linked to the announcements.

The likelihood of a federal investigation occurring before September 2025 is influenced by the time left until the outcome is known, which could be around 2-3 months, depending on various factors and events. As such, it is possible that an investigation could conclude with a finding of Yes (insider trading or market manipulation) or No, without significant impact on the overall market.

Overall, considering these scenarios and factors, it seems that the probability of a federal investigation into President Trump's tariff announcements being launched before September 2025 is around 60%.
