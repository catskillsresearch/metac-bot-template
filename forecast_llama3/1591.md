Here is a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The total interest in Effective Altruism on Google Trends in 2030 will be at least 0.2 times the total interest in 2017 if there is no significant change in the underlying environment or trends that drive public interest and engagement with effective altruism.

In this scenario, the status quo outcome would be that effective altruism continues to grow as a movement, driven by factors such as increasing awareness of global issues, growing concern about climate change, and the rise of online platforms that facilitate information sharing and community building. This trend is likely to continue unless there are significant changes in the economic or political landscape that could impact public interest and engagement with effective altruism.

A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome could be a sudden and unexpected shift away from global issues, such as a major breakthrough in renewable energy or a reduction in poverty rates, which could reduce public concern about climate change and other pressing problems. This could lead to decreased interest in effective altruism and related topics.

A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome could be the continued growth of online platforms and social media, which would allow effective altruism to reach a wider audience and facilitate greater engagement with the movement. Additionally, increasing recognition of the importance of effective giving and the rise of impact investing could drive more people to explore effective altruism as a way to make a positive difference in the world.

Overall, while there are potential risks and challenges that could impact public interest and engagement with effective altruism, the current trend towards growing concern about global issues and increasing awareness of the importance of effective giving suggest a high probability that total interest in Effective Altruism on Google Trends in 2030 will be at least 0.2 times the total interest in 2017.
