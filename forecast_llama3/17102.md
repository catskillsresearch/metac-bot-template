Here is a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome is known is approximately 1-2 years, considering the ongoing global AI development and chip manufacturing evolution. The status quo outcome if nothing changed is likely that the US will continue to impose some level of export controls on advanced AI chips and technologies to ensure national security and protect its economic interests.

A possible scenario for a "No" outcome is if the US government realizes that the restrictions are having unintended consequences, such as driving innovation and investment away from the country. This could lead to reduced reliance on US chip technology and potentially even alliances between countries critical of US restrictions. On the other hand, a scenario that results in a "Yes" outcome might involve increased national security concerns, such as China making rapid progress in AI development and posing an increasing threat to US interests. This could prompt the US government to re-evaluate its export control policies and impose stricter regulations to protect its intellectual property and economic interests.

The ongoing trade tensions between the US and China, as well as the potential emergence of alternative chip manufacturers, are factors that could influence the outcome. Additionally, the slow pace of changes in government policies means that the status quo is likely to prevail unless significant events or technological advancements drive a change in direction.
