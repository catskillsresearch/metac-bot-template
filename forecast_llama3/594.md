Here is a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The likelihood of there being more than 13 people off of planet Earth on December 31, 2050, depends on various factors, including the pace of change in the world and the uncertainty surrounding asteroid predictions. It's essential to consider the status quo outcome, which suggests that the current trajectory of the asteroid is likely to remain unchanged unless unforeseen events or human intervention occur.

The world tends to change slowly, and it's unlikely that there will be a sudden, drastic shift in population distribution or asteroid trajectory within the next 7 years. However, we must also acknowledge the possibility of unforeseen changes in the asteroid's orbit or human efforts to deflect or destroy it, which could alter the outcome.

Given these considerations, I believe that the status quo outcome is more likely to occur, but with a moderate degree of uncertainty. The complexity of asteroid tracking and potential deflection/destruction efforts means that there is always some chance of an unexpected turn of events, regardless of NASA's predictions.

Ultimately, this uncertainty must be factored into our assessment of the likelihood of there being more than 13 people off of planet Earth on December 31, 2050.
