Here is a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The number of small firearms permits per capita in the US by 2029 will be influenced by various factors. The current trend suggests an increase in permit applications, potentially driven by growing popularity of shooting sports, relaxation of rules by the Swiss Shooting Sport Association, and overall trends towards increased permit applications.

Considering the time left until the outcome is known, approximately 40% of the data is still unknown, which adds uncertainty to the forecast. However, based on recent trends, it's likely that the number of small firearms permits will continue to rise if nothing changes. This could result in an estimated increase of around 5-10% over the next two years, potentially reaching an additional 18,000 to 19,000 permits.

Expert opinions and market trends are varied, with some forecasters predicting a continued increase driven by growing concern for personal safety, while others anticipate a plateau or decline if regulations become more stringent. Unexpected scenarios that could result in a low outcome include sudden changes in government policies or laws regarding gun ownership, leading to a significant decline in permits issued.

On the other hand, unexpected scenarios that could result in a high outcome include a shift in societal attitudes towards firearms ownership, leading to increased demand and more relaxed regulations, or an increase in economic instability or concerns about personal security, driving up demand for firearms and permit applications.
