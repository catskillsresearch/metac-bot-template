Here's a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome is known is unknown, as various events and developments can influence the outcome. The status quo outcome if nothing changed would likely be an ongoing conflict between Ukraine and Russia, with both sides continuing their military actions and no significant progress towards a ceasefire or resolution.

There are two key factors that could lead to unexpected outcomes: external factors and internal dynamics. External factors such as changes in international politics, surprise military developments, or shifts in diplomatic efforts can force the parties involved to re-evaluate their strategies. Internal dynamics, such as a sudden change in negotiating positions or a significant setback for one of the parties, could also disrupt the status quo.

The recent history of the conflict has shown that the ceasefire agreements between Ukraine and Russia have held for some time now, but it takes significant events to disrupt them. This suggests that the status quo outcome is likely to persist unless there are major changes in the external environment or internal dynamics.

However, unexpected outcomes can arise if there are sudden changes in international circumstances, surprise military maneuvers, or significant diplomatic breakthroughs. These factors could lead to a rapid deterioration of the situation and a potential escalation into a wider conflict, or they could facilitate a comprehensive peace agreement.

Overall, the likelihood of an unexpected outcome depends on the interplay between these external and internal factors.
