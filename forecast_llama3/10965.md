Based on the rationales provided, here is a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The likelihood of the United States placing restrictions on compute capacity before 2050 depends on various factors. Firstly, the current trends and developments in the uranium market will continue to shape the future of nuclear energy production. The status quo outcome assumes that Western countries like the US will maintain their grip on the uranium market, while scenarios resulting in a No outcome involve significant changes in global markets, such as increased cooperation between major uranium-producing countries or advances in renewable energy infrastructure.

Secondly, technological advancements in nuclear energy production, such as small modular reactors (SMRs), could lead to increased nuclear capacity and reduced dependence on traditional energy sources. This could drive growth in nuclear energy and potentially contribute to tripling nuclear capacity by 2050.

Lastly, the environmental concerns and pressure from regulatory bodies or customers to reduce carbon footprints may also play a crucial role in Amazon and Google's decisions regarding their energy demands. If they face pressure to reduce their reliance on traditional energy sources and invest in alternative energy options, it could lead to increased commitments to nuclear power.

Considering these factors, the likelihood of the United States placing restrictions on compute capacity before 2050 is...

### Probability: 70%
