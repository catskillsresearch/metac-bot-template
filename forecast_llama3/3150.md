Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best elements from each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 10 years (2025-2035). The status quo outcome if nothing changed would likely be that nuclear weapons continue to pose a threat, with some countries increasing their arsenals. However, there are scenarios where global efforts could lead to a reduction in their presence and impact.

A scenario that results in a No outcome could involve the international community continuing to prioritize diplomacy and cooperation, addressing root causes of conflicts through negotiation and dialogue. This would require countries to engage in meaningful dialogue and come together to address shared global challenges like climate change.

On the other hand, a scenario that results in a Yes outcome could involve the absence of effective international agreements and the rise of nationalism leading to an increase in nuclear weapons development and deployment by various countries, exacerbating the threat they pose to global security. This would require countries to prioritize their own interests over global cooperation and stability.

The key factor determining whether no non-test nuclear weapons will be detonated before 2035 is the ability of international leaders to address underlying issues through diplomacy and cooperation. If tensions between major powers escalate, and countries prioritize their own interests over global security, it is more likely that a third world war could break out.

This combined rationale highlights the importance of global cooperation and effective international agreements in reducing the threat posed by nuclear weapons, while also acknowledging the potential for increased tensions and conflict if countries prioritize their own interests.
