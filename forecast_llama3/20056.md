Here is a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

Argentina's economy has been characterized by gradual progress towards macroeconomic stability, with some sectors experiencing growth and others facing challenges. The current economic policies and currency regime have maintained some degree of control over the exchange rate, which could be seen as a status quo outcome.

However, there are potential risks and challenges ahead that could impact Argentina's economic trajectory. On one hand, if the government prioritizes domestic economic stability and implements policies that promote competitiveness and exports, it may maintain some control over its exchange rate and resist full dollarization. This could be driven by concerns about losing sovereignty or generating massive wealth inequalities.

On the other hand, a significant economic crisis or external shocks, such as changes in global trade policies or commodity prices, could trigger a scenario where Argentina fully dollarizes its economy to stabilize the currency and attract more investment.

Furthermore, while there are potential risks and challenges ahead, Argentina has taken steps in the right direction, such as fiscal consolidation and monetary stability, which should support its economic growth. However, there is still room for improvement, and external factors could impact Argentina's economic trajectory.

In light of these considerations, it seems unlikely that Argentina will fully dollarize its economy without a significant crisis or external pressure.
