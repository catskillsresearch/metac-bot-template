Here's a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome is known is approximately [insert timeframe, considering the data provided]. The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be that at least twice as many deportations occur in Fiscal Year 2025 compared to Fiscal Year 2024. This scenario assumes a continuation of current trends and policies, including increased focus on immigration enforcement by the Trump administration.

A scenario that results in a No outcome could include significant changes in public support for more humane immigration policies, leading to decreased funding and resources allocated to ICE's deportation efforts. This could result in fewer immigrants being detained and deported. Alternatively, if there is a major overhaul of immigration policies, resulting in more lenient deportation rules or increased resources to process asylum claims, this could lead to a decrease in deportations or even a complete halt to mass deportations.

On the other hand, a scenario that results in a Yes outcome could include continued efforts by the Trump administration to increase enforcement and deportation, leading to an increase in mass deportations. This could be driven by a perceived threat to national security or economic concerns. Additionally, if there is no significant change in immigration policies or circumstances, it seems likely that the trend of increasing deportations will continue.

Overall, considering these scenarios, I would conclude that the likelihood of at least twice as many deportations occurring in Fiscal Year 2025 compared to Fiscal Year 2024 is [insert probability].

### Probability: 75%
