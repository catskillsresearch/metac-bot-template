Here's a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to this question is known is approximately 5 years. The current status quo outcome if nothing changed is that NASA has not yet landed people on Mars by the end of the decade, as significant technological advancements, infrastructure development, and logistical planning are required.

A scenario that results in a No outcome would involve unforeseen challenges or setbacks in NASA's Mars exploration program, such as technological issues, budget constraints, or changes in priorities due to shifting global circumstances. This could lead to delays or cancellations of mission plans, pushing the timeline for human landings on Mars beyond 2030.

On the other hand, a scenario that results in a Yes outcome would involve NASA successfully overcoming challenges and making rapid progress in developing the necessary technologies and infrastructure for human missions to Mars. This could be achieved through continued advancements in rocket technology, life support systems, and communication networks, as well as international cooperation and government funding.

Overall, while there are uncertainties involved in achieving a manned mission to Mars by the end of 2030, NASA's current plans and progress, combined with increasing investment in space exploration, suggest that it is possible for humans to land on Mars prior to this date.
