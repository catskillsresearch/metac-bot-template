Here's a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome is known is uncertain, but the status quo outcome is likely no civil war. Most countries strive to maintain peace and stability, and institutions established over time tend to stabilize societies, reducing the likelihood of large-scale violence. However, unexpected events or rapid changes in global dynamics could contribute to a civil war.

A scenario that results in a No outcome would involve leaders engaging in peaceful dialogue, negotiating settlements, or adopting reforms to address the root causes of discontent. This might involve international mediation, economic development programs, or institutional strengthening efforts.

On the other hand, a scenario that results in a Yes outcome could be where tensions escalate due to political polarization, economic inequality, or social grievances, leading to widespread violence and instability. Factors like government repression, ethnic or religious conflict, or the breakdown of institutions could contribute to this outcome.

Given the uncertainty of the time frame, it's essential to prioritize the status quo outcome since the world tends to change slowly over time. However, unexpected events or rapid changes in global dynamics could contribute to a civil war.

By considering both the stability of established institutions and the potential for unexpected events, we can develop a more comprehensive understanding of the likelihood of a civil war breaking out in a country with a median age above 30 before 2070.
