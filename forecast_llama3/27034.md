Here's a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The likelihood of powerful open-source AI being regulated more tightly than closed-source AI through newly-enacted US law depends on various factors. In the short term, it is likely that AI regulation will continue to be a patchwork of laws around the world, with different countries having their own approaches. This status quo outcome assumes no significant changes in government policies or international agreements.

However, there are scenarios where governments and private companies work together to establish global AI regulatory frameworks that balance innovation with safety and security concerns. For instance, a major AI-related incident could spark international cooperation on regulation, or countries may recognize the benefits of collaboration on AI regulation.

Furthermore, the pace of technological advancements in AI means that there is a moderate chance of significant regulation emerging in the near future. Additionally, the growing recognition of the need for international cooperation and harmonization on AI regulation could lead to progress in the future.

On the other hand, it is possible that governments worldwide fail to reach a consensus on AI regulation, leading to continued fragmentation and uncertainty. This could happen if countries prioritize their national interests over international cooperation or if they are unable to agree on common standards.

Overall, while the status quo outcome may be the most likely scenario in the short term, there are scenarios where governments and private companies work together to establish global AI regulatory frameworks that balance innovation with safety and security concerns.
