Here's a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome is known is relatively short, considering Jerome Powell's term as Federal Reserve Chairman expires in a year. The status quo outcome is that no attempt will be made to fire Powell, and he will continue to serve as Chairman until his term ends. This scenario is more likely because of the significant institutional hurdles an attempt to fire Powell would face, including legal challenges and potential disruptions to global financial markets.

However, there are scenarios in which Trump might decide to push forward with an attempt to fire Powell despite these warnings. These scenarios could include a major economic downturn, a change in Trump's political calculus, or a perceived need to shake up the status quo at the Fed. In such cases, the potential consequences of firing Powell could be significant enough to deter Trump from taking such action.

Overall, while there is some uncertainty surrounding the likelihood of an attempt being made to fire Jerome Powell, the best available evidence suggests that the status quo outcome is more likely. This is because of the slow pace of change in the world and the potential legal challenges and market instability that could result from attempting to fire the Chairman.
