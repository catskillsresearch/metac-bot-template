Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome is known is relatively short-term, with approximately 2-3 months of uncertainty before the actual revenue figures are reported. The status quo outcome would be an increase in customs duties and tariffs due to ongoing trade tensions between nations, leading to an overall increase in revenue for governments relying heavily on these sources.

However, there are also scenarios that could result in a No outcome. For example, if countries resolve their trade disputes, agree on reduced or removed tariffs, and shift away from customs duties as a significant source of revenue, this would likely result in a decrease in customs duty revenue for governments. Alternatively, a global economic downturn could lead to reduced international trade and customs duties revenue.

On the other hand, there are also scenarios that could result in a Yes outcome. For example, continued escalation of global trade tensions and tariffs between countries could lead to an increase in customs duties revenue as more goods are subject to higher tariffs.

Despite these uncertainties, it's likely that the status quo outcome will prevail, with customs duties revenue continuing to fluctuate based on global trade and tariffs. This is because the world changes slowly most of the time, and ongoing trade disputes and protectionist policies suggest that customs duties revenue will continue to rise.

Overall, this rationale provides a balanced view of the possible outcomes and their likelihood, taking into account both the status quo outcome and potential external factors that could influence customs duties revenue.
