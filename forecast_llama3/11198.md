Here's a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The likelihood of an AI being able to take arbitrary proofs from the mathematical literature and convert them into a symbolic form suitable for verification within the next 2-3 years is uncertain. The status quo outcome is likely to be a mix of both Yes and No outcomes, reflecting the gradual pace of change in AI research and development.

One possible scenario that could lead to a No outcome is if significant societal and political changes occur that prioritize human decision-making over AI-based solutions. This could be driven by unforeseen technological challenges or limitations that make it difficult for AI to fully replace human leadership.

On the other hand, a scenario that could lead to a Yes outcome is if AI continues to rapidly advance and becomes increasingly integrated into various sectors, including politics. This could be driven by the development of more sophisticated AI systems, improved data collection and analysis, or the increasing reliance on automation and efficiency gains.

However, it's also important to consider the limitations of current AI technology. As a professional forecaster, I believe that AI will not replace me in the near future because there are still many aspects of forecasting that require human judgment and expertise. Similarly, AI may not be able to fully replace human decision-making in politics or mathematics without significant breakthroughs in areas like machine learning and natural language processing.

Ultimately, the outcome depends on the pace of technological progress and the societal factors that influence its development and adoption. While there is a possibility that AI could surpass human capabilities in these domains within a relatively short period, it's also possible that the status quo outcome will prevail or that unforeseen challenges or limitations will emerge.
