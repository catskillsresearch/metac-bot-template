Here's a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The likelihood of the research group responsible for developing AGI being part of a government project depends on various factors. Firstly, it is essential to consider the time left until the outcome becomes known. While it is difficult to pinpoint an exact timeline, it is likely that the outcome will be determined within the next few months to a year.

In terms of the status quo outcome, if nothing changes, it is likely that the research group will continue their current initiatives with minimal advancements or breakthroughs. This could result in incremental progress, but not necessarily significant innovative solutions. The research group may face challenges related to funding, resource allocation, and stakeholder engagement, which could impede their ability to achieve their goals.

However, there are also scenarios where things could change rapidly. For instance, a shift in government priorities or a major global crisis could lead to increased investment in research and innovation, resulting in a Yes outcome. On the other hand, funding constraints, internal conflicts, or external factors could contribute to a No outcome.

Ultimately, the likelihood of the research group achieving their goals depends on their ability to adapt to changing circumstances, secure adequate resources, and collaborate effectively with stakeholders. While there are always uncertainties involved, it is possible that the research group will successfully complete their project and achieve their objectives, given the right conditions and support.
