Here is a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

Given the historical trend of slow change in international relations and the persistence of nuclear threats, it is likely that the status quo outcome (continued increase in nuclear weapons numbers) will prevail. However, there are alternative scenarios that could lead to a decrease or elimination of nuclear weapons, such as significant diplomatic efforts or global agreements.

The fact that some countries, like Iran and Saudi Arabia, are expected to develop their nuclear capabilities at a slow pace suggests that the trend towards more countries possessing nuclear weapons may continue. On the other hand, international tensions and conflicts could drive an increase in nuclear proliferation, particularly among countries with security concerns.

While it is possible for global leaders to make significant strides towards disarmament and non-proliferation, leading to a reduction or elimination of nuclear weapons, this scenario seems less likely given the ongoing tensions and conflicts between nations. However, it is essential to consider alternative scenarios and the potential for international cooperation to address the growing threat of nuclear proliferation.

Ultimately, the likelihood of any country that had nuclear weapons on July 1, 2017 giving them up before 2035 depends on a complex interplay of factors, including global tensions, diplomatic efforts, and regional security concerns. While some countries may choose to accelerate their nuclear development efforts, others may slow down or abandon their programs altogether.

By considering these various factors and scenarios, we can develop a more nuanced understanding of the likelihood of this outcome occurring before 2035.
