Here is a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to the question is known can be estimated at around 1.5-4 years, considering the questions are about events that may occur up to 2050. The status quo outcome if nothing changed would likely be that the current composition and dynamics of the US Supreme Court continue, with some possibility of minor adjustments or retirements.

One possible scenario leading to a "No" outcome could be if Congress fails to pass any significant legislation related to the Supreme Court's size or composition, and the Court continues to operate with its current nine justices. This might occur if there isn't sufficient bipartisan support for any major changes.

On the other hand, a scenario leading to a "Yes" outcome could be driven by public dissatisfaction with the current state of affairs, changing demographics, or shifts in societal values, potentially leading to significant political momentum and bipartisanship on issues like gerrymandering, ethics standards, or court reform. This could result in changes in the Supreme Court's composition or procedures.

Ultimately, the likelihood of achieving the required two-thirds vote in both houses of Congress and then securing ratification from three-fourths of the states is relatively low. The world tends to change slowly most of the time, so significant changes are possible after elections or other events that could result in a more conservative or liberal tilt.
