Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to the question is known is significant, with over six months remaining. The status quo outcome, where tariffs remain in place, seems more likely given the current political landscape and the fact that the tariffs have already been implemented.

A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome involves a significant change in global trade policies or domestic politics, leading to a reduction or elimination of tariffs. This might happen if the US and China reach a trade agreement that addresses concerns driving the tariffs.

Conversely, a scenario that results in a Yes outcome could involve ongoing tensions between the US and China, with neither side willing to make significant concessions, leading to continued or increased tariffs. This might occur if the trade war becomes increasingly politicized, with both countries using tariffs as leverage in their respective domestic political battles.

While there is uncertainty surrounding future developments and negotiations, it seems more likely that the status quo outcome will prevail, given the current trajectory of events.
