Here's a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The Christian Democratic Union (CDU) is unlikely to announce that it is open to negotiating a coalition with the Alternative for Germany (AfD) before 2030. The status quo outcome, where the CDU maintains its stance against governing with the AfD due to concerns about their far-right ideology, is likely to prevail. This is supported by historical patterns of coalition formation in Germany, where the CDU has traditionally been cautious about forming coalitions with parties that share ideologies incompatible with democratic values and human rights.

While there are scenarios where the CDU might consider governing with the AfD, such as significant changes in the political landscape or an unprecedented economic crisis, these outcomes are not likely. The vast majority of parties have ruled out a coalition with the AfD, making it difficult for the CDU to form a government without alienating its allies and compromising its values.

Furthermore, even if the CDU were to face a crisis that makes governing with the AfD an attractive option, it is unlikely that they would prioritize forming a coalition over maintaining their principles. The CDU has historically prioritized upholding democratic values and human rights, making it more likely that they will reject coalitions that compromise these values.

Overall, while there are some scenarios where the CDU might consider governing with the AfD, the status quo outcome of rejecting such a coalition is the most likely.
