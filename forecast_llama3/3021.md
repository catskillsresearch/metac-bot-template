Here's a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual forecast:

The time left until the outcome to the question is known can be estimated by considering the pace of scientific progress. While it's impossible to predict with certainty, we can assume that the resolution of significant discrepancies in Hubble parameter determinations will likely take several years or even decades.

In the absence of any new developments or breakthroughs, the status quo outcome would likely be a persistence of the discrepancies, with no significant changes to our understanding of gravity and dark energy. This is because scientific theories are slow to change, and it often takes major anomalies or unexpected findings to challenge our current understanding of the universe.

However, there is also the possibility of new observations or experiments revealing unexpected patterns or behaviors that cannot be explained by current theories, leading to a reevaluation of our understanding of gravity and dark energy. This could involve the development of new theories or modifications to existing ones, which would fundamentally change our understanding of the universe.

Ultimately, the resolution of significant discrepancies in Hubble parameter determinations will likely require a combination of further research, refinement of data analysis methods, and potential breakthroughs in our understanding of the universe's fundamental forces and structures.
