Here's a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The existence or non-existence of Planet Nine can be understood by considering the ongoing search for conclusive evidence. The search has been ongoing for several decades, and it is likely that new data will continue to emerge, which could lead to further refinement of our understanding of the solar system.

If the orbits of trans-Neptunian objects continue to be explained by Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) and not attributed to the gravitational influence of a large planet like Planet Nine, it would suggest that Planet Nine might not exist. On the other hand, if new observations and data analyses confirm the presence of a large, undiscovered planet beyond Neptune, it would strongly suggest the existence of Planet Nine.

Additionally, the status quo outcome is likely to be that Planet Nine does not exist, as our current understanding of planetary formation and the solar system suggests that it's unlikely to have a massive planet hiding in the outer reaches of our solar system. However, continued research and observations could lead to new findings that change our understanding and potentially reveal the existence of Planet Nine.

Overall, the likelihood of Planet Nine being discovered depends on the emergence of new evidence or the refinement of current theories, which may take time.
