Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome becomes known is approximately 25 years. In this timeframe, medical science and technology are likely to continue advancing at a gradual pace, with some potential for breakthroughs or significant advancements. The status quo outcome assumes that current trends and limitations will continue to prevail, which means that individuals who survive until 2050 will not necessarily evade death altogether.

However, it is also possible that a sudden and significant breakthrough in medical research or treatment could lead to a drastic reduction in mortality rates or even the complete evasion of death. The likelihood of such an outcome depends on various factors, including the pace and direction of scientific progress, societal willingness to adopt new technologies, and regulatory frameworks that support or hinder innovation.

In addition, it is important to consider the underlying causes of aging and disease progression. If medical research continues to focus primarily on treating specific diseases rather than addressing the underlying causes of aging, individuals who survive until 2050 may still face the same mortality risks as today.

On the other hand, if significant progress is made in understanding and manipulating cellular aging, and this knowledge is translated into effective treatments or therapies, it's possible that people could evade death altogether. This could occur through advances in regenerative medicine, gene editing, or other technologies that allow for the repair or replacement of damaged tissues.

Overall, the likelihood of individuals who survive until 2050 evading death altogether depends on a complex interplay of factors, including scientific progress, societal willingness to adopt new technologies, and regulatory frameworks. While there is some potential for breakthroughs or significant advancements, it is also important to consider the status quo outcome as the most likely scenario.
