Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The likelihood of intelligent life discovering and understanding the contents of the Voyager Golden Records depends on various factors. Firstly, it is essential to acknowledge the status quo outcome, which suggests that no intelligent life has yet discovered the records or responded to humanity's message. This is because the world changes slowly most of the time, and significant technological advancements are required to detect and interpret signals carried by the Voyager spacecraft.

However, considering the possibility of intelligent life existing elsewhere in the universe, it is crucial to consider scenarios that could result in a Yes outcome. One such scenario is the development of technologies capable of detecting and interpreting signals across vast distances, which could potentially lead to contact with extraterrestrial life forms who would then be able to understand and appreciate the contents of the Golden Records.

Another factor to consider is the unpredictability of technological advancements, which can influence the outcome. While it is impossible to predict exactly when or if intelligent life will discover the records, acknowledging this uncertainty highlights the importance of considering both positive and negative scenarios that could impact the outcome.

Ultimately, a comprehensive assessment of the situation suggests that the status quo outcome (No) has more weight due to the slow pace of change in the world. Nevertheless, it is essential to consider the possibility of intelligent life discovering and understanding the Voyager Golden Records, as this scenario cannot be ruled out entirely.
