Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to this question is known depends on various factors, including global events, political decisions, and economic trends. However, as a good forecaster, I prioritize the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. The absence of a sudden, catastrophic event or a major crisis leading to a global conflict suggests that the status quo will continue.

While there are ongoing tensions and conflicts between nations, international institutions and organizations are designed to promote peaceful resolutions to conflicts. Diplomacy and cooperation can help manage these tensions, preventing a rapid escalation into global conflict. The probability of a world war occurring is low, as most countries have mechanisms in place to resolve conflicts peacefully, and many nations are working towards cooperation rather than conflict.

However, I also recognize that sudden and unexpected events can occur, which can have significant consequences. A combination of diplomatic efforts, international agreements, and peacekeeping initiatives could help prevent a global conflict from erupting. Moreover, scenarios where nations prioritize diplomacy and cooperation over military intervention or where new global leaders emerge who prioritize dialogue and collaboration could also lead to a peaceful outcome.

Ultimately, my combined rationale suggests that the status quo outcome is likely, but I also acknowledge that there are scenarios where a world war could occur.
