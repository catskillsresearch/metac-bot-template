Here is a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The likelihood of the United Kingdom rejoining the European Union before 2030 depends on various factors, including the pace of change in global politics, international support, and Ukraine's progress in implementing reforms. A key consideration is the status quo outcome, where Ukraine does not join the EU by 2030 due to ongoing challenges and complexities involved in implementing necessary reforms. This scenario assumes no significant changes or progress in Ukraine's reforms, its relations with the EU, or global events that could influence its accession.

However, there are also scenarios that result in a Yes outcome, such as Ukraine continuing to make significant progress on implementing reforms, meeting EU standards, and demonstrating stability despite ongoing conflicts. Strong international support for Ukraine's efforts and a willingness among EU member states to adapt to changing circumstances could facilitate Ukraine's membership before 2030.

Ultimately, the likelihood of Ukraine joining the EU before 2030 is influenced by both internal and external factors, including the pace of reform implementation, international relations, and global events.
