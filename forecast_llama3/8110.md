Here is a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The status quo outcome, where Saudi Arabia does not normalize its relations with Israel, is still the most likely scenario. This is because there has been no significant change in the region's dynamics or political situation that would prompt a sudden normalization of ties between these two countries. While scenarios exist that could lead to normalization, such as mutually beneficial agreements or strategic alliances against a common threat, it's uncertain whether they will materialize.

However, it's also possible that Saudi Arabia and Israel reach a mutually beneficial agreement, such as a significant economic deal or a strategic alliance, which would create a conducive environment for normalization. The possibility of US-Iran rapprochement or the desire for regional stability and economic cooperation could drive both countries to seek a mutually beneficial agreement.

Additionally, internal power struggles within Saudi Arabia or changes in leadership could lead to a delay or reversal of any potential normalization efforts. Similarly, external factors like Iran's nuclear program or the threat from terrorism in the region could influence Saudi Arabia's decision-making on normalizing relations with Israel.

Ultimately, while the status quo outcome is still the most likely scenario, there are scenarios that could lead to normalization if certain conditions are met. The key will be whether Saudi Arabia and Israel can overcome their historical tensions and find common ground on issues such as economic cooperation, security concerns, or ideological differences.
