Here's a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The likelihood of the USA being the first country to embryo select >10% of its newborns for intelligence depends on various factors. Firstly, it is more likely for the status quo to prevail, as significant changes often require complex societal and technological shifts. The continued advancement of genetic testing and gene editing technologies could increase the demand for IVF and embryo selection practices.

However, there are also scenarios where the outcome may be different from the status quo. One possible scenario is that society prioritizes inclusivity, diversity, and acceptance, valuing individuality over intellectual or physical abilities. This could lead to a decrease in demand for IVF services and embryo selection technologies.

Another scenario is that there's a significant breakthrough in understanding the genetics behind intelligence, athleticism, or other desirable traits, which could lead to parents seeking out embryos with these characteristics to increase their child's chances of success.

Furthermore, the development and use of IVF technologies are influenced by societal attitudes towards reproductive choices, as well as regulatory frameworks. A significant regulatory change or public backlash against IVF and embryo selection could lead to a decrease in demand for these services or even bans on certain aspects of IVF.

On the other hand, widespread adoption and normalization of IVF technology could lead to increased demand for services, including embryo selection. This might be driven by factors like advancements in AI-powered embryo selection, decreasing costs, or growing awareness of the benefits of IVF among certain demographics (e.g., older individuals looking to conceive).

Ultimately, the likelihood of the USA being the first country to embryo select >10% of its newborns for intelligence depends on a complex interplay of technological, societal, and regulatory factors.
