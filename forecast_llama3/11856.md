Here's a rationale that combines the best of each individual rationale:

The likelihood of Israel joining the EU before 2050 depends on several factors. Firstly, the status quo outcome is for Israel to continue its Partnership Council with the EU without making significant concessions or changes in its treatment of Palestinians. However, this scenario assumes that there will be no meaningful pressure from the EU or increased public awareness of Israeli actions.

A scenario that results in a No outcome is if the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians continues to escalate, leading to divisions within the EU and reduced chances for Israel to join. This could also involve continued human rights abuses and international law non-compliance by Israel, making it less likely to join the EU.

On the other hand, a scenario that results in a Yes outcome is if there is a sudden breakthrough in Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, leading to improved relations between Israel and the EU. This would require cooperation from both sides and a willingness to address concerns of EU member states.

However, a more realistic assessment would be that any changes will likely be incremental and driven by shared interests, economic incentives, or regional stability considerations rather than sudden breakthroughs. Therefore, the most likely scenario is that Israel will continue its Partnership Council with the EU without making significant concessions or changes in its treatment of Palestinians, making it unlikely to join before 2050.

This analysis suggests that there are no compelling reasons for Israel to join the EU anytime soon, and the status quo outcome remains the most plausible.
