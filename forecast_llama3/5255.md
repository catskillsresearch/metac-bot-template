Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 6 years and 2 months, assuming that the missions mentioned in the articles are not delayed further. The status quo outcome if nothing changed would likely be a continuation of the current pace of space exploration and research on Venus, which could include continued monitoring of Venus' atmosphere and surface using existing satellites and spacecraft, as well as ongoing planning and development for future missions to the planet.

However, it is also important to consider the possibility of breakthroughs or setbacks that could impact the search for life on Venus. For example, significant delays or cancellations of planned missions to Venus could lead to a prolonged period without major progress on understanding Venus' environment and potential for life. On the other hand, successful launches and operations of planned missions, such as the Venus Life Finder mission, could provide significant insights into the planet's atmosphere and potential habitability.

Additionally, it is important to consider the possibility of rapid advancements in fields like robotics, artificial intelligence, and propulsion systems that could enable humanity to successfully establish contact with extraterrestrial life or colonize Venus. International cooperation and investment in space exploration and research on Venus could also play a significant role in determining the outcome of this question.

Overall, while it is difficult to predict exactly when or if life on Venus will be confirmed, considering both the current pace of space exploration and the possibility of breakthroughs or setbacks provides a more comprehensive understanding of the situation.
