Here's a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The global population is expected to continue growing, albeit at a slower rate than in the past. Current trends suggest that fertility rates will remain low, and mortality rates will improve, leading to a continued increase in population. However, there are uncertainties surrounding the timing and magnitude of the peak.

One unexpected scenario that could result in a lower outcome is a sudden and widespread decline in fertility rates across multiple regions, potentially driven by changes in social and economic factors or environmental concerns. This could result in a global population peak of around 9-10 billion.

Another unexpected scenario that could result in a higher outcome is the development of advanced fertility treatments or technologies that significantly increase birth rates worldwide, leading to a population boom.

In addition, there are potential external factors that could impact population growth, such as environmental changes, pandemics, or technological advancements. These uncertainties highlight the need for ongoing monitoring and adaptation to changing circumstances.
