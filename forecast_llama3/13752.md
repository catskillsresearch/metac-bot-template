Here's a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The underlying tensions between the US and China will continue to shape their approaches to space exploration, with both countries having different priorities and motivations. While there are signs of increased cooperation on specific projects, such as the Chang'e 5 lunar sample international borrowing application, the Wolf Amendment remains in place, prohibiting direct collaboration between NASA and CNSA.

However, considering the rapid pace of technological advancements in space exploration, China's lunar program has made significant progress and could potentially surpass the US in capabilities. This could be driven by significant investments in space research and technology, government support for private industry initiatives, and strategic partnerships with other countries or organizations.

The status quo outcome, where the US law continues to prohibit NASA from collaborating directly with Chinese institutions, is likely to persist unless a significant shift occurs in US-China relations or a new policy change is introduced. This could be driven by changes in leadership, diplomatic priorities, or an acknowledgment of the benefits of cooperation.

On the other hand, if China's lunar program accelerates its development and becomes an attractive partner for other countries, it could lead to a reevaluation of the US stance on collaboration. Additionally, the US maintaining its current stance on space exploration, prioritizing domestic efforts and limiting international cooperation, is another possible scenario that could result in the US law continuing to prohibit NASA from collaborating with China.

Overall, while there are various factors at play, it seems likely that the underlying tensions between the US and China will continue to shape their approaches to space exploration, leading to a continued prohibition on direct collaboration.
