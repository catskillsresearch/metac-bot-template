Here is a final consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The most plausible scenario is that the status quo outcome prevails, with no significant change in the political landscape or party affiliations. However, there are also scenarios where the House of Representatives may come together to pass legislation, potentially driven by growing public dissatisfaction with the current government or a desire for more accountability and transparency.

One possible path to a Yes outcome could be if lawmakers from both parties can put aside their differences and agree on the importance of term limits, leading to a concerted effort to pass the bill. Alternatively, external pressures from public opinion and other stakeholders may push for reform, driving change in the political landscape.

While there are valid arguments for and against the bill, it is likely that the House of Representatives will continue to deliberate and debate before making a decision, with 2-3 weeks left until the outcome is known.
