Here's a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

A good starting point for assessing the likelihood of Newcastle United changing its club badge redesign before August 16, 2025, is to consider the status quo outcome. As most changes in this context tend to occur slowly, it is reasonable to assume that the current crest will remain unchanged unless there are strong reasons to change.

However, recent developments and the consultation process suggest that there may be a moderate chance of the club changing its crest. The brand team's proposals could receive widespread support from fans and stakeholders, leading to a modernized crest that better represents the club's global identity.

Additionally, considering the time left until the outcome is known, it is reasonable to assume that the status quo outcome (no change) has a higher probability due to the slow pace of changes in this context. The scenarios that result in a No or Yes outcome both rely on specific events or decisions, which may not necessarily occur.

Furthermore, given the potential backlash from fans and stakeholders against changing the crest, it is possible that Newcastle United might reconsider their decision and maintain the current crest if there are significant objections.

Incorporating these factors, it appears that a moderate probability of change exists, with the status quo outcome (no change) having a higher likelihood due to the slow pace of changes in this context. However, recent developments and the consultation process suggest that there may be a moderate chance of the club changing its crest if the brand team's proposals are well-received by fans and stakeholders.
