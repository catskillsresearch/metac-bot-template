Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The likelihood of mainstream news media reporting that alien technology has visited our solar system before 2030 depends on various factors. Firstly, it's crucial to consider the time left until the outcome is known, which is unknown in this case since we're dealing with predictions made about extraterrestrial life. Secondly, the status quo outcome if nothing changed would imply that there is currently no conclusive evidence of alien life.

A possible scenario leading to a No outcome could be unforeseen challenges or setbacks hindering our progress towards detecting or communicating with alien civilizations, making their technology seem nonexistent. On the other hand, a breakthrough in astronomy, astrobiology, or SETI could lead to the discovery of alien life, making it more likely that mainstream news media will report on this finding.

The pace of technological advancements and international cooperation are also crucial factors in determining whether Elon Musk's vision for Mars colonization comes true, which could have implications for our understanding of extraterrestrial life. Moreover, the rise of social media and alternative sources of information might lead to a decline in mainstream news media's influence, making it less likely that they will report on alien technology.

However, mainstream news media's ability to adapt to technological advancements and changes in audience habits could result in them maintaining their significant influence on shaping public opinion. This, combined with the potential for breakthroughs in sustainable energy sources, could lead to a "Yes" outcome where mainstream news media reports on signs of alien life or technology.

Ultimately, predicting the accuracy of mainstream news media's predictions about extraterrestrial life requires balancing these factors and considering both short-term and long-term trends.
