Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to this question is uncertain, as it depends on various factors and uncertainties involved in the scenarios presented. The status quo outcome if nothing changed is likely that the violence will continue, with both sides experiencing significant losses.

A scenario that results in a No outcome could be a negotiated peace agreement reached between the warring parties, which includes concrete steps for demilitarization, reparations, and accountability. This agreement is backed by international organizations and nations, ensuring its implementation and enforcement.

On the other hand, a scenario that results in a Yes outcome could be an escalation of tensions between the conflicting parties, leading to increased violence and instability in the region. This could also lead to more military personnel being involved in violent crimes, both during and after their service in the conflict zone.

The likelihood of future violent incidents occurring is high due to various factors such as historical patterns, political tensions, and global power dynamics. While it's possible for peaceful resolutions to occur through diplomatic efforts or significant changes in global politics or economic conditions, the status quo outcome is more likely given the complexities involved in these conflicts.

Note that this rationale does not take into account any specific time frame or probability of occurrence, but rather focuses on the underlying factors and scenarios that could lead to a Yes or No outcome.
