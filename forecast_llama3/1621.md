Here is a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

Given the slow pace of change in the pharmaceutical industry and biotechnology sector, it is reasonable to assume that the status quo outcome (the continued development and approval of gene therapies) is more likely. This is because many companies are continuing their research and development efforts to find innovative treatments for various diseases, and there is currently no indication that this trend will change significantly in the near future.

Additionally, Pfizer's decision to focus on other pharmaceutical products and its experience with discontinuing Beqvez in some regions suggest that the company may prioritize more profitable opportunities over continuing to develop and commercialize senolytic therapies. This could lead to a scenario where senolytic therapies are not approved for commercial sale by the US FDA before January 1, 2030.

Furthermore, while breakthroughs in gene therapy research or significant setbacks in clinical trials or regulatory approvals could potentially impact the outcome, these scenarios do not necessarily suggest that the status quo outcome is unlikely. Instead, they highlight the uncertainties and challenges associated with developing new treatments, which are inherent to the pharmaceutical industry.

Overall, considering the slow pace of change and Pfizer's priorities, it is reasonable to conclude that the probability of senolytic therapies being approved for commercial sale by the US FDA before January 1, 2030 is relatively low.
