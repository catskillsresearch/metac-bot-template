Here is a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome is known is approximately 75 years, considering the question pertains to the situation by the year 2100. The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be continued global population growth, reaching around 10-11 billion people by the end of the century, as reported by the United Nations.

A scenario that results in a No outcome could be one where there is a significant and sudden drop in fertility rates globally, leading to a plateau or even decline in population growth. This could be triggered by widespread adoption of advanced reproductive technologies, changes in societal values, or unforeseen environmental factors.

Alternatively, a scenario that results in a Yes outcome could be continued rapid population growth driven by factors such as improved healthcare, increased life expectancy, and rising living standards in developing regions. This could lead to a peak population of around 11-12 billion by the end of the century.

It is essential to consider both these scenarios, along with the status quo outcome, when assessing the likelihood of a city on Earth having a population of over 100 million by 2100.
