Here is a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The development and impact of transformative AI will be shaped by a complex interplay of factors, including technological advancements, societal trends, regulatory environments, and human decisions. While it's difficult to predict the exact outcome with certainty, we can draw on current trends and patterns to inform our analysis.

Firstly, the rapid pace of progress in AI research and development suggests that transformative AI will continue to evolve and improve over time. This is supported by the fact that many experts believe that AI will augment human capabilities rather than replace them, leading to significant improvements in areas such as healthcare, education, and productivity.

However, it's also important to recognize that the impact of transformative AI will depend on various factors, including societal resistance to change, regulatory barriers, and investments in education and retraining programs. If policymakers and businesses fail to address these challenges, the social and economic impacts of AI could be more severe than expected, leading to widespread unemployment and inequality.

On the other hand, if governments and businesses work together to develop policies and programs that promote the responsible development and deployment of AI, we could see widespread benefits from AI, including improved healthcare outcomes, enhanced productivity, and increased economic growth.

Overall, while it's difficult to predict with certainty whether transformative AI will result in a singleton or multipolar world, our analysis suggests that the status quo outcome is more likely than not. This is because many experts believe that AI will continue to evolve and improve over time, leading to significant improvements in various aspects of society. However, there are also scenarios under which the No outcome could occur, such as if policymakers fail to invest in education and retraining programs or if societal resistance to change slows down the adoption of transformative AI.
