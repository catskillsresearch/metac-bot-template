Here's a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome becomes known is unknown, as it involves future possibilities in the AI industry. However, we can consider the current status quo in the field, where Gary Marcus has expressed skepticism about the capabilities of current AI systems and their potential applications.

The status quo outcome would be that Gary Marcus remains skeptical about the current state of AI, highlighting its limitations and potential biases. The AI industry continues to evolve, with companies like OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic pushing the boundaries of what is possible with AI. This scenario assumes that the challenges and limitations of AI development persist without significant progress.

However, there are also possibilities for unexpected outcomes. For instance, a breakthrough in AI research could lead to a fundamental shift in the way AI is developed and applied, making many current applications seem outdated or even obsolete. This unexpected development could shift the focus from skepticism to excitement about the potential of AI.

Additionally, we should consider that the world tends to change slowly most of the time, which suggests that incremental advancements in AI are more likely than revolutionary breakthroughs. Nevertheless, there is always some uncertainty and possibility for unexpected events to occur.

Ultimately, the outcome will depend on a combination of factors, including future developments in AI research, the evolution of the industry, and the perspectives of experts like Gary Marcus and Miles Brundage.
