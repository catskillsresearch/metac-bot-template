Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

A unified European Army is unlikely to emerge in the near future due to the slow pace of change in global politics and security concerns. The status quo outcome, where Europe relies on NATO for defense needs with some individual countries increasing their military spending, is likely to continue. However, there are scenarios that could lead to a shift towards increased cooperation and investment in military capabilities. For instance, significant shifts in global politics or security concerns, such as a major crisis like a Russian invasion, could prompt European leaders to reevaluate their defense strategies and consider establishing a new army.

The slow pace of change is reflected in the existing NATO structure and national militaries, which have been effective in providing security for Europe over the years. While there may be some incremental improvements in European defense cooperation, a unified military force seems less likely without significant external pressure or a major catalyst.

On the other hand, there are factors that could drive increased investment in military readiness and potentially even lead to the establishment of a unified European Army. These include growing tensions with Russia, a unified response to security threats, and a growing recognition of the importance of European security.

Ultimately, the likelihood of a European Army emerging will depend on how these factors play out over time. However, as good forecasters would expect, the status quo outcome is likely to continue unless there is a significant shift in global politics or security concerns.
