Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual forecast:

The time left until the outcome to this question is unknown, as it depends on various factors such as demographic changes, economic trends, and social shifts. However, considering the current trend and uncertainty surrounding the outcome, we can assume that there are around 3-5 years left before the outcome is known.

If nothing changed, the status quo outcome would likely be a decline in Christianity, potentially reaching around 55-60% of the population identifying as Christian. However, this assumes no significant changes or external factors influencing the population's religious identification.

The current trend suggests that the decline in Christianity may continue, potentially reaching around 45-50% of the population identifying as Christian by 2050. This is supported by experts' opinions and market trends, which suggest a continued decline in Christianity due to shifting societal values, demographic changes, and other factors.

However, there are also unexpected scenarios that could result in either a lower or higher outcome. A significant shift towards secularism or non-Christian religions could lead to an even greater decline in Christianity, potentially reaching as low as 45% of the population identifying as Christian. On the other hand, a resurgence of interest in spirituality and faith could lead to an increase in religiosity, potentially reaching around 70-75% of the population identifying as Christian.

Overall, considering these factors, we can expect that the percentage of the global population identifying as "religiously unaffiliated" will continue to rise, potentially reaching around 60-65% by 2050. However, this is only a rough estimate, and there are many variables that could influence the outcome.
