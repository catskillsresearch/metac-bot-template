Here's a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The world changes slowly most of the time, so it's reasonable to put extra weight on the status quo outcome. However, external factors and unforeseen events can still impact companies like McDonald's. A good forecaster should consider both the status quo outcome (where McDonald's continues its current trajectory) and potential scenarios that could result in a Yes or No outcome.

In this case, McDonald's has been a successful fast-food chain for decades, with a strong global presence, brand recognition, and loyal customer base. Unless there are significant external factors or unforeseen events, it's likely that McDonald's will continue to operate as a successful business.

However, it's also important to consider potential scenarios that could impact McDonald's performance. For example, changes in consumer preferences, increased competition from emerging food trends, or the company's failure to innovate and adapt to changing market conditions could all affect its success.

Ultimately, a good forecaster should balance the status quo outcome with consideration of these potential scenarios to make an informed prediction about whether McDonald's will feature a cultivated meat product on their menu before 2027.
