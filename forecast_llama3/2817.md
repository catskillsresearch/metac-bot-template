Here is a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The status quo outcome is likely to prevail, with China continuing to develop its nuclear arsenal and other countries maintaining or expanding their own arsenals. This trend is driven by historical patterns of rapid nuclear development in China, as well as international tensions and national security concerns. However, there is a possibility for a breakthrough in arms control and disarmament efforts, which could lead to a reduction in the number of nuclear warheads. This scenario would require significant changes in global politics, such as a major shift in US-China relations or the emergence of a new international treaty.

While it is possible that China may suddenly change course and abandon its nuclear weapons modernization program, this is considered unlikely given historical trends and current events. Additionally, while there have been some positive developments in arms control efforts, the overall trend has been towards increased nuclear arsenals.

The consistency of these rationales can be summarized as follows:

* The status quo outcome is driven by historical patterns of rapid nuclear development in China and international tensions.
* There is a possibility for a breakthrough in arms control and disarmament efforts, which could lead to a reduction in the number of nuclear warheads.
* The likelihood of a sudden change in China's nuclear policy is low due to historical trends and current events.
* The overall trend has been towards increased nuclear arsenals.
