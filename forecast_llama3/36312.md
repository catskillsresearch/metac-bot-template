Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to this question is known is approximately 6-7 months, considering current fiscal trends and assumptions about future spending and tax policies.

Assuming no changes in current trends, the United States government's budget deficit will likely continue to rise, potentially exceeding $4 trillion by the end of 2034. This would result in federal debt as a percentage of GDP reaching or surpassing 125%.

Experts and financial markets are likely to expect continued growth in federal debt levels due to ongoing budget deficits, with potential consequences for interest rates, inflation, and the overall economy.

An unexpected scenario that could lead to a lower budget deficit is if the US Congress passes significant fiscal reforms, such as meaningful tax reform, spending reductions, or both. This could potentially reduce the federal budget deficit by $1 trillion or more over the next decade.

On the other hand, an unexpected scenario that could result in a higher budget deficit is if global economic conditions deteriorate significantly, leading to a sharp decline in US economic growth and an increase in government spending. This could lead to a deficit exceeding $12-15 trillion annually.

The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be that the national debt continues growing at a moderate pace, potentially reaching around $52 trillion by 2035.

If the current trend continues, I foresee the national debt growing even faster, potentially exceeding $60 trillion by 2035. This would be driven by sustained large annual deficits and a lack of significant changes in government policies or economic conditions.

Experts and financial markets are likely to have similar concerns about the growing national debt and its potential impact on the economy. They may expect the debt-to-GDP ratio to continue rising, potentially leading to increased borrowing costs, reduced investment, and slower economic growth.

An unexpected scenario that could result in a lower deficit is if Congress passes legislation that combines tax increases with targeted spending reductions. This could help reduce the budget deficit by around $1 trillion by 2034.

Another unexpected scenario that could lead to an even higher deficit is if President Trump's proposed tax cuts are passed without corresponding spending reductions, resulting in a potential increase of $1-2 trillion in the national debt by 2034.

Overall, considering these factors and trends, it is likely that the budget deficit will continue to rise unless significant changes are made to address the issue.
