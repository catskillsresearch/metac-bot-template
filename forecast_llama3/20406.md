Here is a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The key factors to consider when forecasting whether Trump will win the 2024 presidential election and retain supreme executive power past 2028 are the status quo outcome, potential scenarios for both a No and Yes outcome, and the pace of change in politics.

Firstly, it's essential to acknowledge that the status quo outcome is often the most likely scenario, as changes in politics tend to occur gradually. In this case, Trump has already won the 2024 election (according to some forecasts) or continues his presidency until the end of his term in January 2025. This status quo outcome should be given significant weight.

However, it's also crucial to consider potential scenarios that could lead to either a No or Yes outcome. These include factors such as controversies and scandals surrounding Trump's administration, which could erode his popularity; Kamala Harris's campaign gaining momentum and winning key swing states; internal party conflicts within the Democratic Party; and Trump's ability to connect with voters through social media and rallies.

Additionally, it's essential to consider potential external factors that could impact the outcome, such as economic downturn or social unrest leading to widespread dissatisfaction with Trump's leadership. These scenarios should also be given consideration in determining the likelihood of a Yes or No outcome.

Ultimately, the pace of change in politics should be taken into account when making a forecast. While it is possible for unexpected events or shifts in public opinion to alter the trajectory of an election, the status quo outcome should still be given significant weight due to its relative stability and predictability.

This consistent rationale can now be used to make a prediction about the likelihood of Trump winning the 2024 presidential election and retaining supreme executive power past 2028.
