Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The probability of any of Belgium's neighbors leaving the EU before 2027 is influenced by several factors. Firstly, the status quo assumption is that these countries are generally peaceful and have not been involved in significant conflicts recently, which suggests that they will continue to maintain their relationships with each other and with the EU. This is because most countries have learned from past experiences and tend to prioritize diplomacy over military action.

However, there are also underlying tensions between countries that could escalate into full-blown wars if left unchecked. The complexity of regulatory frameworks and the strength of international competition also play a role in shaping the future trajectory of these countries' relationships with each other and with the EU.

In addition, significant events or policies can change the course of history and influence the likelihood of any of these countries leaving the EU before 2027. For instance, if there are no significant changes to the European Union's banking sector or regulatory framework, it is likely that European banks will continue to struggle with competitiveness issues, which could make it more difficult for American banks to compete effectively.

On the other hand, if Germany, France, and Italy can come together to lead a comprehensive review of European banking regulations, this could result in significant changes that improve banks' competitiveness and make it more challenging for American banks to compete effectively. This scenario is more likely than not, given the slow pace of change in international relations and the tendency for countries to prioritize diplomacy over military action.

In conclusion, while there are many factors at play, the status quo assumption is that these countries will continue to maintain their relationships with each other and with the EU, with some incremental changes rather than a major overhaul. Therefore, I predict that it is less likely that any of Belgium's neighbors will leave the EU before 2027.
