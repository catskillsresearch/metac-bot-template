Here's a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The most likely outcome is that the status quo will be maintained, with the conviction standing and the possibility of parole after 25 years. This is because the legal system tends to maintain consistency, making it less likely for new evidence to emerge or significant procedural errors to be found. Additionally, the slow pace of change in the legal system means that it's unlikely for unexpected events to occur.

Furthermore, the fact that the Supreme Court has already overturned a previous ruling suggests that they may be inclined to rule in favor of maintaining the status quo. The potential consequences for Louzan if he were found guilty or removed from office also suggest that the court may be hesitant to make any changes.

While it's possible for new evidence to emerge or significant procedural errors to be found, this likelihood decreases over time. As a result, the most probable outcome is that the conviction will stand and Louzan will continue serving his life sentence with parole eligibility after 25 years.
