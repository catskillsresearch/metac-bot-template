Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome is known is uncertain, with factors such as future events or decisions made by Congress influencing the likelihood of different outcomes. The status quo outcome would be the continuation of the current tax credits and regulations under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), assuming no significant changes or repeals.

An unexpected outcome could arise from a sudden shift in global energy policies, changes in public opinion, or unforeseen events that prompt lawmakers to take drastic action. This could lead to changes in government incentives and investments, potentially altering the trajectory of clean energy production.

Additionally, external factors such as international trade agreements, global economic downturns, or changes in political priorities could also influence the outcome. These factors could trigger significant modifications or even repeal of the IRA tax credits, leading to an unexpected outcome.

Considering these variables, it is reasonable to assume that the momentum of clean energy investments and tax credits will continue unless there are major changes in government policies or market trends. However, the possibility of an unexpected outcome cannot be ruled out, particularly if there are significant shifts in global politics or public opinion.
