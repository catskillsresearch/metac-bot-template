Here's a combined rationale:

The trend towards increasing support for marijuana legalization at the state level suggests that it is more likely than not that we will see some form of federal legalization in the near future. However, the pace of policy changes varies across states, and strong opposition from law enforcement agencies, conservative lawmakers, or religious groups can hinder the process.

Currently, many states have already legalized medical marijuana, and ongoing debate about recreational use is a common theme. The status quo outcome is likely to be that marijuana remains illegal for recreational use in most states, with some allowing medical use only.

For a Yes outcome to occur, there needs to be a shift in public opinion and government attitudes towards marijuana legalization. This could be driven by successful experiments with regulated marijuana markets in certain states, growing public support for legalization, or changes in political leadership that are more open to the idea of legalization.

On the other hand, strong opposition from law enforcement agencies, conservative lawmakers, or religious groups can lead to a continued lack of support for federal legalization and a delay in the process. Additionally, if neighboring states successfully implement recreational cannabis laws, it may increase pressure on other states to follow suit.

Considering these factors, it's likely that the trend towards increasing support for marijuana legalization will continue, but at a slower pace than expected due to ongoing opposition and challenges.
