Here's a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 2-3 years, considering various factors such as diplomatic efforts, military preparedness, and global economic conditions. The status quo outcome if nothing changed is that China does not invade Taiwan by 2027, with international tensions possibly rising and falling but sudden, dramatic changes being less likely.

A possible scenario resulting in a No outcome is the continuation of diplomatic efforts and economic pressures from the international community, leading to a peaceful resolution through dialogue. This could involve increased engagement between major powers to deter Chinese aggression and encourage peaceful coexistence. Another scenario that results in a No outcome is the gradual easing of tensions and a more stable relationship between China and Taiwan through sustained diplomatic effort by the US and its allies.

On the other hand, a scenario that results in a Yes outcome is the significant deterioration in Sino-US relations, coupled with rising nationalism and military modernization efforts by China, creating an environment where Beijing feels emboldened to take action against Taiwan. This could be triggered by a provocative incident or a sudden shift in global circumstances that makes an invasion more feasible.

Overall, the most likely outcome is the status quo (no invasion), as international tensions may rise and fall but sudden, dramatic changes are less likely. However, there are risks involved, and unforeseen factors could lead to a different outcome.
