Here's a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The likelihood of achieving human-machine intelligence parity by 2040 depends on various factors. Firstly, it's essential to acknowledge that humans will continue to die unless significant breakthroughs are made in understanding and treating diseases. Rapid advancements in nanotechnology, artificial intelligence, and biomedicine could lead to breakthroughs in extending human lifespan beyond the current biological limit of 120 years.

Moreover, the status quo outcome is a competition between human intelligence and AI, with each trying to surpass the other in various aspects. This competition has been the case for decades, and it's unlikely that this dynamic will cease anytime soon. However, there is also a possibility that AI could surpass human intelligence in many aspects, leading to a loss of control and a potential threat to humanity.

On the other hand, significant investments in research and development could lead to the creation of new technologies that enable humans to repair or replace damaged cells and tissues, effectively reversing the aging process. Additionally, breakthroughs in senolytic therapy or telomere extension could also contribute to human immortality by 2030.

Furthermore, it's crucial to consider the possibility of AI-driven scientific discovery and medical innovation accelerating progress in understanding and treating age-related diseases. This could lead to rapid breakthroughs in reversing biological aging, enabling humans to live indefinitely.

In conclusion, achieving human-machine intelligence parity by 2040 is possible if significant breakthroughs are made in understanding and manipulating cellular processes, senolytic therapy, or telomere extension. Additionally, AI-driven scientific discovery and medical innovation could accelerate progress in reversing biological aging. While the status quo outcome is a competition between human intelligence and AI, there is also a possibility of collaboration, which could lead to exponential growth in various fields.
