Here's a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The likelihood of Stacey Abrams being elected president in or before 2028 depends on various factors, including the status quo outcome and potential scenarios that could unfold. The status quo suggests that Abrams' presidential bid is still uncertain, with no clear indication of whether she will run or not.

One scenario that could lead to a No outcome is if internal party conflicts, personal reasons, or unforeseen circumstances prevent her from building momentum and becoming a strong contender. Alternatively, she might decide not to run due to concerns about the competition or focus on her governorship instead.

On the other hand, a scenario resulting in a Yes outcome could be driven by factors such as her leadership skills being showcased during key positions, her ability to unite the party, or her popularity among voters. If she is able to build support and momentum within the Democratic Party, it's possible that she will consider running for president.

The time left until the outcome is known is approximately 2-3 years, depending on the forecast, which means there is still ample opportunity for developments that could affect her decision. The lack of clear contenders in the Democratic nomination process also increases the chances of a competitive primary season and potentially gives Abrams an advantage if she decides to run.

Ultimately, while some factors suggest a low likelihood of change in the near term, others indicate that the outcome is not yet determined and could be influenced by various events or decisions.
