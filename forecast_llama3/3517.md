Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome becomes known is indefinite, as the date of knowledge for this specific forecast is unknown. However, considering the status quo outcome, it is likely that the current situation will persist without significant changes, with no major war breaking out in Europe and global economic collapse. This scenario assumes that international tensions remain manageable, and nations prioritize cooperation over conflict.

A possible scenario leading to a "No" outcome is if diplomatic efforts continue to strengthen, leading to increased cooperation among European nations and effective resolution of outstanding conflicts through peaceful means. Additionally, the scientific community and international organizations emphasize the risks associated with detonating thermonuclear bombs for environmental purposes, leading policymakers to reject this proposal due to concerns about safety, ethics, and unintended consequences.

On the other hand, a possible scenario leading to a "Yes" outcome is if global warming continues to accelerate, leading to catastrophic consequences such as massive flooding or crop failures. In response, governments and scientists might consider more radical solutions, including the use of thermonuclear explosions to combat climate change. However, this scenario is less likely since international relations tend to evolve slowly, and nations usually prioritize cooperation over conflict.

Overall, while there are factors that could potentially lead to either a "Yes" or a "No" outcome, the status quo outcome has more weight since the world changes slowly most of the time.
