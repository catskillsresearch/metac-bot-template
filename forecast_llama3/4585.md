Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual forecast:

The time left until the outcome to the question is known is uncertain, but it's likely that some outcomes will become clear within the next few years (2-5 years). The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be moderate growth, driven by factors such as technological advancements and changes in consumer spending. If the current trend continues, we could see significant growth, with analysts predicting an average annual return of 3% or higher over the next decade.

Experts are generally optimistic about the market's prospects, with many expecting continued upward trends in the S&P 500 index. However, unexpected scenarios such as global economic downturns or sudden shocks to the financial system could lead to a sharp decline in stock prices and lower-than-expected returns. On the other hand, unprecedented technological advancements or breakthroughs in industries could drive growth and push stock prices even higher.

The combined effect of these factors suggests that the annual real return on investment will likely be moderate, with a possible range of 1-5% per year. The key to achieving this range will depend on the extent to which the current trend continues, as well as any unexpected shocks or surprises that may occur along the way.

Note: This combined rationale does not include specific percentage ranges or probabilities, but rather provides a general framework for understanding the factors that could influence the annual real return on investment.
