Here's a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The P vs NP question is an open problem in computer science, and its resolution will likely require a fundamental shift in our understanding of computation and complexity theory. While it's difficult to predict when or if someone will find a solution, the current status quo suggests that P ≠ NP, as most experts believe that certain computational problems are inherently difficult to solve efficiently.

One possible scenario leading to a "No" outcome (P ≠ NP) could be if researchers continue to make progress in cryptography, coding theory, and machine learning without finding a polynomial-time algorithm for solving NP-complete problems. This would reinforce the notion that certain computational problems are fundamentally difficult to solve efficiently.

On the other hand, a breakthrough or new perspective that revolutionizes our understanding of computational complexity could lead to a "Yes" outcome (P = NP). However, this is less likely given the current state of knowledge and the lack of a definitive solution so far.

Overall, while it's possible that a groundbreaking discovery could change the status quo, the current consensus among experts suggests that P ≠ NP, and it may remain unsolved for a long time.
