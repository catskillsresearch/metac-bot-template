Here's a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome is known depends on various factors, including AI development, human decision-making, and advancements in machine learning, computer vision, and natural language processing. The current trend of AI improvement will continue, with some minor fluctuations, unless significant disruptions or breakthroughs occur.

If nothing changed, AI would likely continue to make progress in achieving high scores on math benchmarks like FrontierMath, driven by the increasing importance of math and logic in various industries. However, this progress might not be reflected accurately by these benchmarks, as they may not adequately address limitations and biases inherent in training data.

A significant shift in the field of AI research could lead to a decline in AI's performance on math benchmarks or even stall progress altogether. This could happen if regulatory obstacles, lack of funding, or societal backlash hinder AI development.

On the other hand, breakthroughs in areas like human-AI collaboration, explainability, and transfer learning could drive significant advances in AI capabilities, enabling it to achieve impressive results in complex math problems.

The pace of change in the field of artificial intelligence is slow, but advancements can happen suddenly. A balanced forecast should consider both the stability and potential for innovation in AI development.

Overall, a combination of these factors suggests that while AI is likely to continue making progress on FrontierMath, there are also scenarios where significant breakthroughs or setbacks could occur, affecting its performance on the benchmark.
