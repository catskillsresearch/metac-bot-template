Here's a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The likelihood of a meteor causing more injuries than the Chelyabinsk event before 2051 depends on various factors and uncertainties. On one hand, scientific advancements in asteroid detection and tracking, combined with international cooperation, could lead to the development of effective early warning systems for near-Earth objects. This could result in humans being able to detect potential threats earlier and take necessary precautions to mitigate their impact.

On the other hand, human activities such as deforestation, climate change, or asteroid mining could unintentionally disrupt the orbits of nearby asteroids, causing one to fall towards Earth. Additionally, lack of international cooperation, inadequate funding for space monitoring programs, or technological limitations could also contribute to the possibility of an asteroid impacting Earth.

Moreover, the status quo outcome assumes a continuation of the current trend, which suggests that there will be more meteor showers in the future, possibly with varying levels of damage and injury. However, this assumption relies heavily on the idea that the world is inherently chaotic and unpredictable, which may not always hold true.

Ultimately, the likelihood of another major meteor shower like Chelyabinsk occurring in the future depends on a complex interplay between these factors, making it difficult to determine with certainty whether the outcome will be a No or Yes.
