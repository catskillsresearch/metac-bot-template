Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The status quo outcome, where China does not recognize Taiwan's sovereignty, is likely to persist due to the complexities in their relationships and the international community's recognition of Taiwan as an independent country. However, it is also important to consider alternative scenarios that could lead to a different outcome.

One possible scenario that could result in a "Yes" outcome (China recognizing Taiwan's sovereignty) is if significant changes occur in global politics or economic interests, leading to increased cooperation and mutual understanding between China and Taiwan. This could be facilitated by the strengthening of relationships with countries like the United States, Japan, and South Korea.

Conversely, a scenario that could result in a "No" outcome (China not recognizing Taiwan's sovereignty) is if tensions between Taiwan and China escalate further, leading to increased economic pressure or even military conflict. This could also lead to international involvement in efforts to mediate the situation, making it less likely that China would recognize Taiwan as a sovereign state.

Ultimately, the likelihood of China recognizing Taiwan's sovereignty depends on the interplay between these different factors. While the status quo outcome is currently more probable, there are scenarios under which a recognition could occur if conditions change favorably for Taiwan.
