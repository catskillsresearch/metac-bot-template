Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to this question is known is uncertain, as it depends on various factors such as scientific discoveries, technological advancements, and societal changes. The current trend suggests that humanity's capacity for technological advancement and scientific discovery will continue to drive progress in various fields, potentially leading to breakthroughs in areas like astrobiology, exoplanetary science, and artificial intelligence.

If nothing changed, the status quo outcome would likely result in continued improvements in our understanding of the universe, with potential discoveries of habitable exoplanets or advancements in sustainable energy sources. However, unexpected scenarios could also arise, such as global economic downturns, technological failures, or unforeseen environmental disasters that slow down progress.

Experts and markets have varying opinions on the likelihood of finding evidence of alien life, but many expect significant progress in areas like space exploration and biotechnology over the next 20-30 years. Breakthroughs in fields like quantum computing, nanotechnology, or advanced materials science could also accelerate human progress and potentially lead to the discovery of extraterrestrial intelligence.

Despite these uncertainties, it is possible that humanity will make significant strides in understanding the universe and potentially finding evidence of alien life within the next few decades. A sudden breakthrough in astrobiology or exoplanetary science could lead to a new understanding of the universe, making it seem less likely that extraterrestrial life exists. On the other hand, the discovery of a habitable exoplanet with conditions similar to those on Earth could lead scientists to believe that intelligent life might exist elsewhere in the universe.

Ultimately, the outcome depends on various factors and unexpected scenarios that can arise.
