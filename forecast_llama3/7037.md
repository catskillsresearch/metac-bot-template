Here is a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The likelihood of North Korea and South Korea being recognized as a unified sovereign state by 2045 will be influenced by various factors. The status quo outcome, where the two countries remain separate entities, is likely due to the complex and contentious political dynamics on the Korean Peninsula. However, there are scenarios under which diplomatic relations could be established or progress made towards normalization.

A significant shift in the global political landscape, triggered by a major international crisis or event that highlights the risks of nuclear proliferation, could create an environment where the US and North Korea are willing to engage in meaningful talks. This might lead to incremental steps such as reopening communication channels, establishing liaison offices, or even holding high-level talks.

Alternatively, if tensions continue to rise on the Korean Peninsula due to disagreements over denuclearization, sanctions, or military exercises, it is likely that a stalemate will result, making it unlikely for the two countries to establish diplomatic relations. This could be driven by internal power struggles or external pressures.

The economic situation of North Korea and the stability of its regime also play a crucial role in determining the likelihood of a unified sovereign state. If North Korea's economic situation worsens significantly, it may lead to internal instability, causing the regime to prioritize domestic issues over external threats. This could result in a reduced focus on nuclear development and military expansion.

Considering these factors, I believe that the status quo outcome (no diplomatic relations) is most likely due to the complex political dynamics on the Korean Peninsula. However, there are scenarios under which diplomatic relations could be established or progress made towards normalization.
