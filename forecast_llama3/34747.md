Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best elements from each individual forecast:

The time left until the outcome is known is significant, with roughly 4-5 months remaining. This allows for some uncertainty and potential changes in voter preferences. However, considering the status quo outcome, it seems likely that Vox will continue to gain ground among young voters due to its strong online presence and anti-establishment message.

A scenario that could lead to a No outcome (Vox not surpassing the PSOE) is if the PP regains its footing and becomes more appealing to young voters, potentially drawing them away from Vox. Alternatively, the PSOE could improve its messaging and appeal to a broader range of voters, including those currently supporting Vox.

On the other hand, a scenario that could lead to a Yes outcome (Vox surpassing the PSOE) is if Vox successfully maintains its momentum by focusing on issues that resonate with young voters, such as housing affordability and unemployment. If Vox can capitalize on this demographic shift and maintain its strong online presence, it's possible that the party could surpass the PSOE in voting intention.

Overall, while there are potential scenarios for both a Yes and No outcome, the status quo outcome is likely, given the slow-moving nature of voter preferences. However, considering recent trends and events, it's essential to acknowledge the potential for change and be prepared for unexpected shifts in voter behavior.
