Based on the rationales provided by each forecast, I combine them into a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 3-6 years (based on current trends and indicators), with some events still unfolding. The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be the continuation of the current situation without significant changes or conflicts, with both China and Taiwan maintaining their military postures and diplomatic efforts.

A scenario that results in a No outcome could involve both sides engaging in diplomatic efforts and confidence-building measures, leading to a reduction in tensions and increased economic cooperation. This could be facilitated by international support for Taiwan's sovereignty and the normalization of cross-strait relations. On the other hand, a scenario that results in a Yes outcome could involve China perceiving a window of opportunity to invade Taiwan due to a perceived weakening of Taiwan's military or a change in the global political landscape.

Given these factors, I conclude that there is no strong reason to believe that armed conflicts between China and Taiwan will lead to at least 100 deaths before 2026. The slow pace of change in international relations, combined with diplomatic efforts and economic cooperation, make it more likely that the status quo outcome will persist without significant changes or conflicts.

However, I also acknowledge that there are scenarios where China's military advancements or economic growth could lead to a more significant shift towards a Yes outcome. The probability of this happening is difficult to quantify, but I would estimate it to be relatively low due to the complexity and volatility of international relations.

Overall, my rationale suggests that the likelihood of armed conflicts between China and Taiwan leading to at least 100 deaths before 2026 is lower than initially thought, but not impossible. The actual outcome may differ depending on various factors, including changes in government policies, international relations, and global events.
