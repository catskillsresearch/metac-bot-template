Here is a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 75 years, as we are currently in the year 2025 and the predicted outcome refers to the year 2100. The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be a global temperature increase of around 2.7째C by 2100, based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predictions.

If the current trend continues, it is expected that greenhouse gas emissions will continue to increase, leading to a further warming of the planet. This could result in a global temperature rise above 3째C or even 4째C by 2100. Experts predict that the Arctic will warm faster than previously thought, leading to more melting of Greenland and a faster rise in sea levels. They also anticipate more frequent and intense heatwaves, droughts, and extreme weather events.

However, there are unexpected scenarios that could result in a lower global temperature increase by 2100. These include the implementation of widespread, effective climate mitigation policies and the rapid transition to renewable energy sources, which could limit the warming to around 1-2째C above pre-industrial levels. On the other hand, an unexpected scenario that could result in a higher global temperature increase by 2100 is a significant delay or failure to implement climate policies, leading to continued high greenhouse gas emissions and accelerated warming.

Overall, it is essential to consider both the current trends and expert expectations as well as potential unexpected scenarios when assessing the likelihood of different outcomes.
