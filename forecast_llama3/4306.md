Here is a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to the question is known is unknown, as it depends on various factors such as market trends, competition, and technological advancements. The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be that NASA's Artemis program will continue to make progress towards its goal of sending humans back to the Moon by 2027, with the Blue Ghost mission providing valuable data and insights for the program.

If the current trend continued, it is likely that NASA's Artemis program will successfully land humans on the Moon in 2027, marking a significant milestone for space travel. Experts and markets are generally optimistic about the prospects for space exploration and the potential for private companies like Firefly Aerospace to play a major role in this effort.

However, unexpected scenarios could impact the outcome, such as a sudden budget cut or change in administration that could delay or cancel the Artemis mission, or an unforeseen breakthrough in technological advancements that enables a faster and more efficient lunar mission. On the other hand, private companies like Firefly Aerospace could accelerate their progress and achieve significant breakthroughs in areas such as lunar resource utilization, commercialization of space, or development of new technologies.

Overall, while there are risks and uncertainties involved, the current trend suggests that NASA's Artemis program is on track to successfully land humans on the Moon by 2027.
