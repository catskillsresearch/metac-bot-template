Here is a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The likelihood of North and South Korea being at war before 2050 depends on the persistence of the status quo. The current relationship between North and South Korea is marked by tensions and hostility, with North Korea continuing to develop its nuclear capabilities and maintain its hostile stance towards the US and South Korea. This situation is likely to persist unless a significant external shock or internal change occurs.

The possibility of a peaceful resolution depends on whether North Korea's leadership decides to prioritize diplomacy over military posturing, or if international pressure leads to a slowdown or halt in North Korea's nuclear program. Conversely, the scenario where North Korea acquires nuclear weapons or strengthens its military capabilities is more likely to occur if tensions on the Korean Peninsula escalate and the US responds with military buildup and sanctions.

While there are scenarios that could lead to a war before 2050, it is also possible for North and South Korea to improve their relationship through diplomatic efforts, economic cooperation, or reunions between families separated by the 38th parallel. The key factor determining whether this scenario plays out is whether both countries can make significant concessions and compromises, potentially leading to increased trust and confidence.

Ultimately, the likelihood of war before 2050 depends on the complex interplay of these factors, with the status quo outcome being the most likely scenario unless a significant change or external shock occurs.
