Here's a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The status quo outcome is likely to continue, with global fertility rates declining at a moderate pace. The world tends to change slowly most of the time, and there is no significant evidence or indication that would suggest a drastic change in global fertility rates. The decline has been gradual over the past few decades, and it's likely to continue unless something drastically changes.

The current trend of declining fertility rates has been observed for decades, making it a likely continuation. Factors such as urbanization, increased participation of women in the workforce, improved healthcare leading to lower child mortality rates, and persistent economic uncertainty could all contribute to this decline. While there may be some short-term fluctuations, the long-term trend is more likely to continue due to the persistence of current demographic, economic, and cultural factors.

Additionally, there are no significant indicators that would suggest a rapid and widespread shift towards more traditional family values or increased investment in education and job creation, which could potentially lead to an increase in global fertility rates. Similarly, there is no indication of a sudden increase in unforeseen factors such as significant improvements in economic conditions, increased access to education and healthcare, or unexpected cultural shifts leading to a renewed emphasis on family planning.

Overall, the likelihood of global fertility rates dropping to 0.25 births per woman before 2046 remains high, with the trend pointing towards continued decline unless something drastically changes.
