Here's a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The likelihood of a conventional conflict preceding a non-test detonation of a state's nuclear weapon depends on various factors, including international relations, global power dynamics, and national security priorities. In general, a rapid deterioration in international relations, increased tensions among nations, or a significant shift in global power dynamics could lead to countries reconsidering their nuclear policies and potentially acquiring nuclear weapons.

On the other hand, if international diplomacy and dialogue continue to progress, and countries prioritize cooperation over confrontation, the likelihood of new nuclear proliferants decreases. This scenario assumes that the current global security landscape does not significantly change, and nations maintain their commitment to non-proliferation efforts.

Additionally, factors such as Turkey's regional influence, security concerns, and international pressure can also play a role in shaping its decision to acquire nuclear weapons. If Turkey experiences a significant change in its regional security environment or perceives a threat from foreign powers, it might decide to prioritize nuclear deterrence and pursue a nuclear weapons program.

Given the complexities of global politics and the slow pace of change, it is reasonable to assume that the status quo outcome (Turkey does not acquire nuclear weapons) is more likely. However, there is still a possibility that changes in regional security dynamics or other factors could push Turkey towards pursuing a nuclear deterrent.

Overall, the likelihood of a conventional conflict preceding a non-test detonation of a state's nuclear weapon depends on the interplay between these various factors and the pace of change in international relations.
