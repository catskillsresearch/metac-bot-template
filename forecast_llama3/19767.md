Here's a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome is known is relatively short, with most scenarios focusing on developments up to 2038 or within the next few years. The status quo outcome assumes no significant changes in political or economic conditions that could affect defense spending or military priorities.

A plausible scenario for a No outcome would be a severe economic downturn or unexpected technological advancement leading to delays or cancellations in the US Navy's aircraft carrier procurement plans, potentially resulting in fewer carriers than anticipated.

On the other hand, a scenario that results in a Yes outcome could involve the continued rise of tensions between major powers, coupled with increased investment in naval capabilities, which might prompt the US Navy to accelerate its aircraft carrier development and deployment, leading to more carriers being built and deployed than initially planned.

Considering these scenarios, I am inclined to put extra weight on the status quo outcome due to the slow pace of change in the world. However, I also recognize that alternative scenarios could impact the outcome, such as economic downturns or shifts in global priorities that might slow or halt the development of new aircraft carriers.

Ultimately, a balanced approach is necessary to account for both the possibility of continued stability and the potential for rapid changes in geopolitics or military developments.
