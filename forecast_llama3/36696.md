Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The election for the Democratic presidential nominee will take place in 2028, leaving us with approximately 3 years and 2 months until the outcome is known. The status quo outcome would likely be a continuation of Kamala Harris' lead, with her remaining the most favored candidate for the nomination.

However, unexpected scenarios could disrupt this status quo. A surprise endorsement by a prominent Democrat, such as President Biden or Senator Chuck Schumer, could significantly boost Pete Buttigieg's national profile and challenge Kamala Harris's dominance. Alternatively, an unexpected resurgence by Pete Buttigieg himself, leveraging his connections within the Biden administration to gain popularity among party loyalists, could also shake up the field.

Additionally, a relatively unknown politician with a compelling personal story and quietly built network could emerge as a surprise candidate, potentially gaining popularity through their work in local government or celebrity status. This could be someone like a governor or mayor who has gained popularity through their work in local government, or even a celebrity who has become disillusioned with the current state of politics.

These unexpected scenarios highlight the potential for surprises and upsets in the nomination process, making it essential to consider both the status quo outcome and the possibility of an unexpected event.
