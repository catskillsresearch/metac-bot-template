Here's a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to this question is known is approximately 6 months, allowing for more data and trends to emerge. The current growth trend suggests that Spain's economy will continue to grow at a moderate pace unless significant external shocks or policy changes occur. A brief description of a scenario that results in a no outcome would be a severe economic shock, such as a global pandemic or prolonged energy crisis, which could lead to reduced consumer spending, decreased exports, and increased unemployment.

On the other hand, if Spain continues to implement pro-business policies, maintains its strong services sector, attracts foreign investment, and addresses high debt levels through effective fiscal policies, it is possible for the economy to continue growing at a robust pace. This would be supported by favorable demographic trends, high employment rates, increasing productivity, and a stable global economy.

The probability of Spain's economy growing more than 3.2% in 2025 depends on these factors. While there are scenarios that could result in a no outcome, the status quo outcome suggests that continued economic growth is likely unless unforeseen events occur or policy changes have an adverse impact.

### Probability: 85%
