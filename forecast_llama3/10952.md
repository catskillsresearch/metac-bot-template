Here is a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to the question is known can be significant, considering that future events and outcomes are uncertain. However, based on current trends and public opinion, it's likely that the status quo outcome will prevail, where inter-racial marriage is not banned in any US state by 2030.

A scenario that results in a No outcome could occur if there is a significant shift in societal attitudes and values towards greater acceptance and understanding between different racial groups. In this case, laws and regulations governing marriage would likely continue to evolve in a direction that promotes equality and respect for all individuals, regardless of their race.

On the other hand, a scenario that results in a Yes outcome could occur if there is a concerted effort from conservative forces or political parties to restrict inter-racial marriages, citing concerns about cultural preservation or traditional values. However, this outcome is less likely given the current trend towards greater acceptance and understanding between different racial groups.

Ultimately, considering these factors, it's likely that the status quo outcome will prevail, where inter-racial marriage is not banned in any US state by 2030.
