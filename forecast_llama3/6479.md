Here's a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The world changes slowly most of the time, so it's reasonable to assume that the status quo outcome (steady growth and adoption of consumer genomics market) is more likely than a sudden change or major disruption. However, it's essential to consider potential adverse scenarios that could impact the market's growth.

Advancements in gene sequencing technologies, increasing public interest in personalized health insights, and favorable regulatory environment are all contributing factors driving the growth and adoption of consumer genomics market. While there are some risks involved, such as a significant downturn in global economic activity or a major setback in gene sequencing technology development, these risks seem manageable.

Additionally, it's crucial to recognize that the industry is already focused on developing AI-powered genomics tools for personalized healthcare, diagnostics, and research, which suggests that adversarial attacks are not a priority at present. The market prioritizes improving analytics and interpretation capabilities, with minimal focus on cybersecurity.

Furthermore, regulatory frameworks and public awareness could lead to the development of more responsible genomic data analysis and interpretation systems, reducing the likelihood of significant adverse effects from an increase in genomic data collection and analysis.

While there is no definitive answer to the question of adversarial AI emerging, it's important to consider the status quo outcome (no adversarial AI currently prevalent) and potential scenarios that could lead to its emergence. The absence of a catastrophic event or unforeseen consequences suggests that the likelihood of adversarial AI emerging is low.

Overall, considering these factors, it seems reasonable to assume that the growth and adoption of consumer genomics market will continue steadily, with some adjustments in regulations and ethics guidelines as needed, without significant adverse effects from an increase in genomic data collection and analysis.
