Here's a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome is known is significant, with approximately 5 years remaining before the potential outcome. The status quo outcome, where no blue state secedes from the US, is more likely due to the stability of established governments and the challenges involved in altering the country's political landscape.

A scenario that results in a No outcome would involve continued efforts by blue states to resist Republican control at the national level, focusing on defending Democratic majorities and chipping away at Republican control. This could be fueled by factors like economic disparities between regions, cultural differences, or concerns about national security.

On the other hand, a scenario that results in a Yes outcome would involve some blue states experiencing extreme frustration with federal policies or political dynamics, leading them to explore the possibility of secession as a means of protecting their interests and values. This could be fueled by factors like economic disparities between regions, cultural differences, or concerns about national security.

The complexity of the process and the need for significant public support would likely slow down any attempts at secession. Additionally, the stability of established governments and the challenges involved in altering the country's political landscape would make it difficult for blue states to consider secession as a viable option.

While there may be some discussion and exploration of secession in certain blue states, the likelihood of actual secession is low due to the slow pace of change in most situations. The status quo outcome seems more plausible, with no significant changes leading to secession.
