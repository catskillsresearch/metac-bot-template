Based on the rationales provided, a consistent and comprehensive rationale can be developed as follows:

The soybean market is likely to continue growing at a steady pace, driven by increasing demand for plant-based protein sources, growth in global populations, and rising consumer interest in sustainable and environmentally friendly products. The current trend towards plant-based diets and veganism, driven by awareness about animal welfare, environmental sustainability, and health benefits, is expected to continue, further amplifying the demand for soybeans.

While there are scenarios that could potentially disrupt this status quo, such as sudden shifts towards alternative protein sources or concerns about soy allergies/intolerances, these factors are not likely to have a significant impact in the next few years. In fact, advancements in soybean cultivation, processing, and product development can drive growth in the market.

The probability of the soybean market remaining significant is higher than that of it experiencing a decline, as consumers' preferences for plant-based products and sustainable agriculture are expected to continue growing.

### Probability: 75%
