Based on the rationales provided by each forecast, I combine them into a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome (China's recognition of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan) is known, as various factors such as diplomatic efforts, political dynamics, and regional developments will influence the trajectory. Currently, the status quo outcome is that China has not recognized the IEA, which is due to concerns about the Taliban's religiosity, human rights record, and potential impact on its Xinjiang Muslim region.

For a "No" outcome to occur, the IEA would need to fail in demonstrating significant progress in stabilizing its government, addressing international concerns about terrorism and human rights, or making substantial reforms. This could lead China to view the IEA as an unviable partner, resulting in no recognition.

Conversely, for a "Yes" outcome to occur, the IEA would need to successfully implement key reforms, such as improving governance, addressing human rights concerns, and demonstrating its commitment to regional stability. If China sees these efforts as meaningful and sustainable, it might extend official recognition to the IEA, potentially driven by shared interests and concerns about regional stability.

Ultimately, China's recognition of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan will depend on a careful balance between its economic interests, political considerations, and regional dynamics.
