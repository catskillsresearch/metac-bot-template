Here's a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to the question is known is uncertain, as it depends on various factors and uncertainties. The status quo outcome if nothing changed would likely be an increase in nuclear weapons proliferation, ongoing world conflicts, and potentially even new pandemics or financial crises.

A scenario that results in a No outcome could involve international cooperation and agreements on nuclear disarmament, leading to a gradual reduction in the number of nuclear weapons worldwide. This could also include progress made in addressing climate change, conflicts resolved through diplomacy, and global economic stability improved.

On the other hand, a scenario that results in a Yes outcome could involve continued escalation of nuclear weapons development, increased tensions between nations leading to world conflicts, and potential new pandemics or financial crises. This could be triggered by misunderstandings, miscalculations, or deliberate decisions made by political leaders.

The key factor influencing the likelihood of global nuclear disarmament is international cooperation and diplomacy. If major powers commit to reducing their arsenals and work together to address the root causes of conflict, such as poverty, inequality, and lack of resources, it could lead to a gradual reduction or elimination of nuclear weapons.

However, there are also factors at play that could lead to significant changes in the near future. The current state of international relations is characterized by ongoing world conflicts, tensions between nations, and the proliferation of nuclear weapons. This trend is expected to continue unless significant efforts are made to reverse it.

Ultimately, the outcome depends on the ability of global leaders to come together and negotiate meaningful agreements that effectively limit the spread of nuclear weapons. While there are many reasons to be concerned about the current state of international relations, historical trends suggest that diplomacy and cooperation often prevail in the face of adversity.
