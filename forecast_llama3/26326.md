Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to this question is unknown, as it depends on various factors such as technological advancements, economic conditions, and societal changes. The status quo outcome if nothing changed would likely be that governments continue to experiment with small-scale UBI pilots or maintain their existing social welfare systems, without a widespread adoption of UBI globally.

A scenario that could lead to no implementation of UBI globally is a continued focus on traditional social safety nets and lack of political will for radical change. This could be due to various factors such as economic instability, ideological opposition, or the perceived complexity of implementing such a system.

On the other hand, a scenario that could lead to widespread implementation of UBI globally is the adoption of UBI by several large and influential countries, which would then create a snowball effect, prompting other nations to follow suit. This could be driven by factors such as economic inequality, technological advancements, or changing societal values.

As good forecasters, we should assign more weight to the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. However, considering the rapid progress in AI and its potential impact on society, there is a higher probability that governments will respond to the challenges posed by AGI with a UBI. Additionally, the mixed results of small-scale UBI experiments suggest that there may be room for improvement and innovation in this area.

Overall, while it is difficult to predict exactly when or if a global UBI will be implemented, it seems likely that the debate around UBI will continue, with proponents and opponents presenting their arguments. The success or failure of small-scale experiments and pilots could influence the trajectory of UBI implementation globally.
