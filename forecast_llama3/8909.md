Here is a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 1-3 years, considering recent advancements in sequencing technologies and decreasing costs of genome sequencing. The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be around $22-30 billion (based on current trends and available information). However, considering the growth rates provided by experts and markets, we can expect the market sizes to grow, albeit at varying rates.

The expectations of experts and markets are that the trend is expected to continue, driven by increasing demand for precision medicine and declining sequencing costs. This could lead to a continued upward trend in the cost of sequencing a whole human genome.

However, there are always uncertainties and unexpected scenarios that could impact the market's trajectory. An unexpected scenario that could result in a lower outcome would be if there was a sudden and significant increase in regulatory hurdles or restrictions on genome sequencing, which could lead to a temporary slowdown in market growth. On the other hand, an unexpected scenario that could result in a higher outcome would be if breakthroughs in gene editing technology or advancements in whole-genome sequencing led to a surge in demand for NGS services and products, driving market growth even faster than expected.

Overall, considering these factors, it is likely that the cost of sequencing a whole human genome will continue to decrease as technologies improve and the demand for precision medicine grows. However, there are always uncertainties and unexpected scenarios that could impact the market's trajectory.
