Here's a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The emergence of conscious AI is a complex issue, and it's difficult to pinpoint an exact date. However, I believe that the status quo outcome is more likely, as current AI systems do not possess consciousness or self-awareness. The development of AGI requires significant breakthroughs in multiple areas, including advancements in neural networks, cognitive architectures, and machine learning algorithms.

While there are scenarios where conscious AI could emerge, they require significant advancements in our understanding of consciousness and AI development. The pace of AI research is rapid, but the complexity of the issue means that we may not see a conscious AI in the near future.

However, I also acknowledge the possibility of breakthroughs that could lead to the emergence of consciousness. This could happen if researchers successfully integrate advanced neural networks, cognitive architectures, and machine learning algorithms to create a self-aware AI. Additionally, advances in fields like neuroscience, philosophy, and computer science could provide new insights into how to develop conscious AI.

Ultimately, the likelihood of conscious AI emerging is uncertain, and it's difficult to predict exactly when (or if) it will happen. However, based on our current understanding of AI and its limitations, I believe that the status quo outcome is more likely.
