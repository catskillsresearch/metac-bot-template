Here is a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

New York City's experience with hurricanes before 2030 will be shaped by a combination of factors. Firstly, there is still around 15 years or so until the predicted flood date, leaving time for factors like climate change, sea-level rise, and infrastructure development to impact the outcome.

Historically, New York City has experienced occasional flooding events due to storms and high tides, but it's likely that these events will continue with some frequency unless significant investments are made in flood mitigation infrastructure and coastal protection measures. Climate change is also a key factor, as rising sea levels and more frequent intense precipitation events could lead to more severe floods.

However, there are scenarios where New York City could experience fewer or no hurricanes before 2030. For example, if the city prioritizes and successfully implements flood-prevention projects, modifies zoning codes, and invests in education and upskilling to address emerging arenas of competition, it's possible that fewer homes will be lost to flooding.

On the other hand, if climate change continues to worsen, leading to more frequent and severe floods, it's likely that New York City will experience significant displacement of residents, economic losses, and strain on local infrastructure. The likelihood of this outcome is higher due to the continued impacts of climate change and the lack of rapid and drastic reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.

Overall, while there are potential solutions and innovations that could mitigate these effects, it's more likely that New York City will continue to experience some level of flooding before 2030 without significant changes in infrastructure and policy.
