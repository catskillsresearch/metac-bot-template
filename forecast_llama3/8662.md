Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 10-15 years, considering the estimates provided. The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be that China's nuclear arsenal will continue to grow at a steady rate, potentially reaching around 800-1,200 warheads by 2035.

A scenario that results in a No outcome (China not reaching 1,000 warheads by 2030) could be driven by significant global events or shifts in international politics. This might include the emergence of a new global security architecture, major diplomatic breakthroughs, or unforeseen economic or environmental concerns that make nuclear weapons development less appealing.

On the other hand, a scenario that results in a Yes outcome (China reaching 1,000 warheads by 2030) would be driven by China's ongoing rapid economic growth and modernization, coupled with the country's increasing military ambitions and desire to become a global superpower. This could be fueled by advancements in technology, increased defense spending, and a willingness to challenge international norms.

While there are various factors that could influence the outcome, it is likely that China will continue its nuclear modernization at a moderate pace, potentially reaching around 800-1,200 warheads by 2035. However, significant global events or shifts in international politics could alter this trajectory and result in a No outcome.
