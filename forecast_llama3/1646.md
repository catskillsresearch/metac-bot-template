Here is a consistent rationale combining the best of each individual rationale:

The human condition will change fundamentally by 2100 if humanity continues to experience rapid technological advancements, environmental pressures, and societal shifts. While some minor changes may occur due to natural selection or genetic adaptations, it is likely that significant breakthroughs in areas like artificial intelligence, biotechnology, and space exploration will drive more substantial transformations.

A "no" outcome could result from a complacent attitude towards global challenges, leading to stagnation and limited progress in addressing issues like climate change, overpopulation, and technological inequality. In this scenario, humanity may only experience minor changes over the next 75 years.

On the other hand, a collaborative effort to address these challenges could lead to a "yes" outcome, where human civilization enters a new era characterized by unprecedented cooperation, scientific progress, and societal advancement. This might involve significant breakthroughs in areas like quantum computing, gene editing, or advanced materials science, leading to exponential growth in our understanding of the world.

The time left until the outcome is known is approximately 75 years, providing ample opportunity for changes to occur or not. Considering current trends and available data, it is more likely that human evolution will continue at its current pace with gradual adaptations, but significant changes are possible if we experience major technological or environmental shifts.

Overall, while there is always a chance for unexpected events or changes in the global environment to alter the course of human evolution, the likelihood of these predictions coming true is high due to current trends and available data.
