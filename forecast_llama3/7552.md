Here's a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

**(a) Time left until the outcome to the question is known**: The outcome is uncertain and dependent on external factors, such as decisions made by individuals or organizations. While some forecasts suggest the outcome has already occurred, others assume it hasn't.

**(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed**: If nothing changes, the Confederate monument will likely remain in place, with ongoing debate and controversy surrounding its existence and historical significance. This scenario assumes that there is no sudden change in public opinion or decisive action from governing bodies.

**(c) Scenario that results in a No outcome (removal of Confederate monuments)**: A scenario where the Confederate monument is removed could be driven by increasing public pressure, growing awareness of potential harm caused by these symbols, and changing societal attitudes. This might lead to concerted efforts by local authorities, historians, and community members to address the controversy surrounding the monument.

**(d) Scenario that results in a Yes outcome (keeping Confederate monuments)**: A scenario where the Confederate monument remains intact could be fueled by strong opposition from those who believe these monuments are an important part of history and cultural heritage. This might lead to ongoing efforts to preserve and protect the monument, with no significant changes or threats to its existence.

**(Consolidated Rationale)**: The outcome is uncertain, but it's likely that the status quo will prevail, with the Confederate monument remaining in place unless there is a concerted effort by local authorities, historians, and community members to address the controversy surrounding its existence. This could be driven by changing societal attitudes and growing awareness of potential harm caused by these symbols.
