Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to this question is unknown, as it depends on various factors such as international relations, military deployments, and political decisions. The timeline can be assumed to be in the short-term (days, weeks), medium-term (months), or long-term (years).

Currently, there are no combat troops from European countries deployed in Ukraine or along the line of contact. The situation remains volatile, with tensions between Russia and NATO countries ongoing. If nothing changes, it's likely that this status quo will continue, with both sides remaining cautious but vigilant.

A scenario that results in a No outcome (no deployment of NATO troops to Ukraine) could be if diplomatic efforts continue to gain traction, leading to a negotiated peace agreement between Russia and Ukraine. This could lead to a decrease in tensions, making the deployment of NATO troops unnecessary.

On the other hand, a scenario that results in a Yes outcome (deployment of NATO troops to Ukraine) could be if Russia's military build-up in Belarus continues to escalate the situation, leading to increased concerns about a potential invasion of a NATO country. This could prompt NATO countries to take collective action and deploy troops to Ukraine to deter Russian aggression.

Given the complexities of international relations and military deployments, it is difficult to predict with certainty which scenario will unfold. However, there are some factors that suggest a Yes outcome (combat troops deployed) could become more likely over time, such as ongoing tensions between Russia and NATO countries, the need for European leaders to demonstrate their commitment to Ukrainian security, and the potential for diplomatic efforts to fail.

Ultimately, the probability of deploying combat troops from NATO countries to Ukraine is uncertain, but it seems that the status quo outcome (no deployment) remains the most likely scenario.
