Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome of the conflict between India and Pakistan is uncertain, as it depends on various factors such as diplomatic efforts, military actions, and international pressure. The status quo outcome if nothing changed would likely be a continuation of the current conflict, with both sides exchanging fire and neither side able to gain a decisive advantage.

A scenario that results in a No outcome (no conflict) might involve intense international pressure and diplomacy leading to a peaceful resolution of the Kashmir dispute, or the Indian government addressing concerns about terrorism and Kashmir through peaceful means, reducing tensions with Pakistan. A brief de-escalation of tensions followed by meaningful dialogue could also lead to a peaceful outcome.

On the other hand, a scenario that results in a Yes outcome (conflict escalation) might involve further military actions, diplomatic stalemate, or international pressure failing to curb the situation, allowing the conflict to continue. The possibility of nuclear weapons being used cannot be ruled out, which would have devastating consequences for the region and potentially global implications.

The likelihood of a peaceful resolution depends on the ability of India and Pakistan to compromise and find common ground on key issues, as well as the effectiveness of international diplomacy and pressure. However, considering the rapid escalation of tensions between India and Pakistan, there is also a higher likelihood of further conflict if diplomatic efforts fail or military actions escalate.

Ultimately, the probability of conflict escalating or not depends on various factors that are difficult to predict with certainty.
