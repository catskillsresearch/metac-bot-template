Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to be known is uncertain, as the World Cup has not yet taken place. Historically, Brazil has not won a World Cup since 2002, so the status quo outcome would be a No outcome if nothing changed. However, there are scenarios that could lead to a Yes outcome, such as significant changes in team chemistry and performance.

One possible scenario resulting in a No outcome is if Brazil continues to struggle with injuries and squad issues, leading to poor performance on the field. On the other hand, if they can maintain consistent team performance, capitalize on their strengths, manage their weaknesses effectively, and have a bit of luck on their side, they could potentially emerge victorious.

Another factor that could contribute to Brazil's success is the emergence of key players like Neymar or Alisson, who could make all the difference in a tight match. Additionally, unexpected upsets and surprises by other teams could give Brazil an opportunity to capitalize on another team's misstep.

Overall, while there are valid reasons for predicting a No outcome, such as historical trends and potential setbacks, there are also scenarios that could lead to a Yes outcome, such as improved team performance and strategic coaching decisions. Therefore, it is difficult to say with certainty whether Brazil will win the World Cup by the end of 2050.
