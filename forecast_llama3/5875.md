Here's a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The status quo outcome is likely, as it often takes time for significant changes to occur. However, it's also important to consider alternative scenarios that could impact the outcome. In this case, the growth and popularity of online poker, as well as potential backlash against the industry, could influence the outcome.

While some forecasters have placed weight on the status quo outcome, others have considered the possibility of a significant shift in public opinion or IOC priorities. However, it's also important to acknowledge that online poker is still a relatively niche activity compared to traditional sports like soccer or basketball, which may make it less likely to be added to the Olympic Games.

Ultimately, predicting the future is uncertain, and there are many factors that could influence the outcome. By considering both the status quo outcome and alternative scenarios, we can gain a more comprehensive understanding of the likelihood of online poker being added to the Olympic Games by 2031.
