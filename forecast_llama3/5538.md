Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The likelihood of California carrying through with Governor Newsom's plan to sell only zero-emission electric cars and passenger trucks by 2035 depends on various factors. Firstly, it is crucial to consider the time left until the outcome is known, which can influence the probability of change. With a few years or months remaining before the decision-making process is complete, there is still room for developments that could impact the outcome.

The status quo outcome suggests that California's plan will continue moving forward, as it has already made significant progress in this direction. This is reinforced by the fact that California has a history of adopting and implementing emission standards ahead of federal regulations.

However, there are scenarios that could lead to a No outcome, such as changes in public opinion or government policy at the federal level, which could block or modify California's vehicle-emission rules. Similarly, strong opposition from the automotive industry, Republican lawmakers, or concerns about national uniformity could also hinder the plan's implementation.

On the other hand, there are scenarios that favor a Yes outcome, such as increased public pressure, environmental concerns becoming more pressing, or alternative solutions being proposed and accepted. Additionally, support from state lawmakers, the Biden administration, and other states that have adopted similar policies could also contribute to the plan's success.

Given these factors, it is essential to consider the weight of evidence and the likelihood of change. While there are challenges ahead, including opposition and concerns about infrastructure development, a combined analysis suggests that California will likely continue moving forward with its plan, albeit potentially facing some delays or setbacks along the way.

This rationale combines the insights from each forecast, highlighting the importance of considering the status quo outcome, potential scenarios for both Yes and No outcomes, and the factors that could influence the likelihood of change.
