Here's a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The likelihood of Puerto Rico becoming a US state prior to 2035 depends on various factors, including changes in public opinion, political dynamics, and external events. The current status quo outcome, where Puerto Rico remains a territory, is more likely given the complexity of the issue and the slow pace of change.

However, there are scenarios under which Puerto Rico could become a state. One such scenario involves significant momentum and support from both major parties in Congress, combined with a strong push from Puerto Rican leaders and stakeholders. This momentum could be driven by factors like economic growth, infrastructure development, or increased public awareness about the island's unique cultural heritage.

Another factor that could influence the outcome is the role of external events, such as changes in the political landscape or shifts in public opinion. For instance, a significant shift in public opinion or a change in the administration's stance on statehood could create an environment conducive to Puerto Rico becoming a state.

Ultimately, while there are valid arguments for and against Puerto Rican statehood, the likelihood of the island becoming a state prior to 2035 is low due to the complexity of the issue and the slow pace of change. Nevertheless, the possibility of significant changes in public opinion or political dynamics cannot be ruled out entirely.
