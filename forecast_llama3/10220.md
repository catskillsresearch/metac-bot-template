Here's a rationale that combines the best of each individual forecast:

The trend towards microfinance banks (MFBs) dominating bank debtors is likely to persist unless there are significant external factors that alter the landscape. The current status quo outcome suggests that MFBs will continue to play a significant role in the country's lending ecosystem, driven by their ability to provide credit at competitive rates and their extensive reach into underserved communities.

While economic growth or changes in interest rates could influence the trend, these factors are unlikely to result in a drastic shift away from the current status quo. Instead, gradual changes in consumer behavior, technological advancements, and regulatory policies may continue to shape the market.

The informal economy and digital loan applications have already had an impact on the lending landscape, and it is likely that they will continue to influence the trend towards MFBs. The Central Bank of Nigeria's (CBN) recent efforts to regulate the microfinance sector could also contribute to the persistence of this trend.

Given the slow pace of change in most economic systems, I believe the status quo outcome is more likely than a drastic shift. However, I have also taken into account the potential impact of external factors, such as policy changes or technological advancements, which could alter the trajectory.

Therefore, it seems reasonable to conclude that the trend towards MFBs dominating bank debtors will continue, with around 95% of bank debtors borrowing from MFBs by 2025.
