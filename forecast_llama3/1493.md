Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to this question is known is significant, with most forecasts suggesting that the outcomes will be revealed over the next few decades. The current trend suggests that population growth rates are slowing down and may eventually decline due to decreasing birth rates and increasing life expectancy.

The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be a continued decline in population growth rates globally, driven by demographic changes such as fertility rates and life expectancy. This is supported by the data showing a peak and subsequent decline in many countries' populations.

A scenario that results in a No outcome could be one where there are significant increases in fertility rates or reduced mortality rates, potentially driven by advancements in healthcare technologies, education, or economic stability. On the other hand, a scenario that results in a Yes outcome could be one where demographic transition continues, with people choosing to have fewer children due to increased life expectancy and economic stability.

Given the slow-changing nature of demographics and the weight of the status quo outcome, it is likely that the global population will peak around 10.3 billion by 2100 and then decline. However, it is also essential to consider both the No (population growth continues) and Yes (population decline) outcomes to provide a comprehensive assessment.

Overall, while there are many factors that could influence the outcome, the current trend suggests that the global population will eventually decline due to demographic changes.
