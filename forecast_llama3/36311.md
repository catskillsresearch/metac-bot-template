Here's a rationale that combines the best of each individual rationale:

The likelihood of the size of the US Supreme Court increasing before 2029 depends on various factors and scenarios. A key consideration is the status quo outcome, where the current trend of increasing court fees continues, with no significant changes in government policy or public opinion prioritizing reducing court fees and making justice more accessible to all citizens.

However, a shift towards a more progressive agenda or a crisis that highlights the issue of affordability in the justice system could result in a scenario that leads to a No outcome. On the other hand, continued pressure from various stakeholders, including advocacy groups and lawmakers, to reform the Supreme Court's fee structure and make it more affordable for individuals who cannot afford to pay, could lead to a Yes outcome.

Additionally, as a forecaster, one should also consider the possibility of incremental changes or minor adjustments that might not drastically alter the current situation. While these changes may not be significant enough to result in a major overhaul of the Supreme Court's size and fees, they could still contribute to a gradual shift towards greater accessibility and affordability.

Ultimately, a consistent rationale for predicting whether the size of the US Supreme Court will increase before 2029 should balance the status quo outcome with the potential for gradual changes or crisis-driven reform.
