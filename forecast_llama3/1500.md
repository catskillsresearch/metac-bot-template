Here's a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The likelihood of a global catastrophe occurring due to either human-made climate change or geoengineering depends on various factors, including the pace of global warming, international cooperation, technological advancements, and societal transformations. The current status quo outcome is likely a continuation of the current situation, where global warming accelerates and geoengineering may be considered as a potential solution.

However, there are several scenarios that could lead to a No outcome, such as concerted efforts by governments and international organizations to address climate change through policy changes, technological innovations, and sustainable practices. These efforts could involve reducing greenhouse gas emissions, promoting renewable energy sources, and increasing the use of electric vehicles.

On the other hand, a scenario that could lead to a Yes outcome is if geoengineering becomes widely accepted as a viable solution to address climate change. This could involve large-scale projects aimed at reflecting sunlight back into space or deploying mirrors and sunshades. However, this approach has its own set of risks and uncertainties, which would need to be carefully considered before implementation.

The likelihood of a catastrophic event occurring also depends on the potential for sudden and drastic changes in international relations, such as an unprecedented surge in nationalism, militarization, and environmental degradation. This could trigger a catastrophic conflict or a devastating natural disaster that imperils human civilization.

Overall, the probability of a global catastrophe occurring due to either human-made climate change or geoengineering is uncertain and depends on various factors beyond our control. However, it's essential to remain vigilant and adapt to new information as it becomes available, considering both the potential risks and uncertainties involved in each scenario.
