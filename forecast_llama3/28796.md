Here's a rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome is known is relatively short, with most predictions taking place within the next few years. The status quo outcome is that humans will continue to drive cars themselves for the foreseeable future, due to regulatory hurdles, public concerns, and high upfront costs.

However, there are scenarios where autonomous vehicles could become widely adopted. One possible scenario involves significant advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and sensor technology, making autonomous vehicles safer and more reliable. Another scenario requires governments to create favorable regulations and incentives for the adoption of autonomous vehicles, such as tax breaks or special lanes for self-driving cars.

On the other hand, there are also scenarios where autonomous vehicles might not become widely adopted. For example, if there is a major regulatory setback or series of accidents involving autonomous vehicles, public concern and mistrust could delay or even reverse the adoption of autonomous vehicles.

Furthermore, it's essential to consider the slow pace of change in the automotive industry, which often favors continuity over disruption. While there are significant advancements being made in autonomous driving technology, regulatory hurdles and public concerns remain significant obstacles to widespread adoption.

Ultimately, the key factor that will determine whether at least 95% of all new road vehicles with 4+ wheels sold in the US in 2075 have SAE Level 5 autonomy is the level of investment in developing clear guidelines and standards for autonomous vehicle deployment. If governments and regulatory bodies invest heavily in this area, it's likely that widespread adoption will occur.
