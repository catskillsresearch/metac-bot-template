Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The likelihood of Donald Trump winning the Nobel Peace Prize before 2029 depends on several factors. First, it's essential to consider the status quo outcome: given Trump's track record and the committee's past decisions, it's unlikely that he will win the prize. However, there are scenarios where he could potentially win.

One possible scenario leading to a "Yes" outcome is if Trump successfully negotiates a lasting peace agreement between Israel and Hamas or makes significant progress in resolving the Russia-Ukraine conflict. If he can demonstrate tangible results that benefit multiple parties and promote international cooperation, it's possible that the Nobel Committee may consider awarding him the prize.

Another factor to consider is the pace of change in the world. While significant events can occur quickly, the Nobel Peace Prize committee tends to favor nominees who have demonstrated a consistent track record of promoting peace and resolving conflicts through diplomatic means. Therefore, it's crucial to evaluate Trump's actions and policies in the context of these values.

Additionally, the Nobel Committee's past decisions and trends should be taken into account. While the status quo outcome may seem likely, there is always the possibility that an unexpected event or development could influence the committee's decision.

Overall, a balanced approach considering both the likelihood of Trump winning based on his track record and the potential for significant events to occur is essential in evaluating this question.
