Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The US Dollar Index (DXY) is likely to continue its gradual decline or remain stable around current levels unless there are significant changes in global economic conditions. The status quo outcome is more probable, as markets tend to change slowly and unexpected events are rare. However, it's essential to consider extreme scenarios that could lead to a Yes outcome. These might include a sharp deterioration in global economic conditions, a sudden escalation in trade tensions, or a major shock to the global economy.

On the other hand, a No outcome could occur if there is a significant improvement in global economic growth, leading to increased demand for US dollars as investors seek refuge in the currency. This might happen if there's a sudden resolution to trade tensions or a major breakthrough in economic policy.

Overall, while the probability of the DXY falling below an average of 88 for any 90-day period before the 2029 presidential inauguration is not zero, it is still relatively low due to the stable global economic conditions and lack of significant market-moving events.
