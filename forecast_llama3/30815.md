Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to this question is known is relatively short, which suggests that the market trends and data points emerging in the coming months will play a significant role in determining whether electric vehicles make up more than 10% of new light duty vehicle sales in the United States before October 2025.

In the absence of any significant changes or disruptions, it's likely that electric vehicle adoption will continue to grow at a moderate pace. This status quo outcome would be driven by factors such as ongoing investment in electric vehicle technology and infrastructure, government incentives, and consumer demand for environmentally friendly options.

However, there are potential risks and challenges ahead that could impact adoption rates. These include concerns about charging infrastructure, battery durability, or other factors that could lead to a decrease in electric vehicle adoption. On the other hand, scenarios where governments continue to offer generous incentives for electric vehicles, infrastructure development accelerates, or advancements in battery technology make electric vehicles more appealing and practical for consumers could drive up demand.

Ultimately, the likelihood of electric vehicles making up more than 10% of new light duty vehicle sales in the United States before October 2025 depends on a complex interplay of these factors. While there are potential risks and challenges ahead, the trend towards increased adoption seems likely to continue, driven by ongoing investment in technology and infrastructure, government incentives, and consumer demand for environmentally friendly options.
