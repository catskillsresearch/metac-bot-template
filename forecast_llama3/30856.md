Here is a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The number of farmed birds killed in the United States due to bird flu in 2025 will be influenced by several factors, including the ongoing trends and efforts to control the outbreak, expert expectations, market reactions, and potential unexpected scenarios. The time left until the outcome is known is approximately 6-12 months, considering the rapid spread of the disease and the increasing number of outbreaks reported worldwide.

The status quo outcome if nothing changed would likely continue the trend of significant losses for the poultry industry, with millions of birds being euthanized to prevent the spread of the disease. If the current trend continued, it's possible that the total number of birds affected could reach or exceed 100 million or more in the coming months.

Experts and markets are likely expecting a significant impact on the poultry industry's productivity and profitability, with potential long-term consequences for the sector as a whole. An unexpected scenario that could result in a low outcome is if a highly effective treatment or vaccine were developed and rapidly deployed to control the spread of the disease. Conversely, an unexpected scenario that could result in a higher outcome is if the virus mutated into a more transmissible form, spreading rapidly across different species and potentially leading to a global pandemic.

The development and distribution of effective vaccines or treatments for birds could significantly reduce the number of affected birds, while a significant relaxation of biosecurity regulations or a catastrophic failure in disease containment efforts could lead to a rapid spread of the virus. The poultry industry's productivity and profitability will likely be impacted by these factors, with potential long-term consequences.

Overall, it is difficult to predict exactly when we'll know the outcome, but considering the recent trends and ongoing efforts to control the outbreak, I would say we have approximately 6-12 months before more accurate data becomes available.
