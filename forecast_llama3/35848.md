Here's a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome is known is uncertain, as it depends on various factors such as Congressional actions, negotiations, and votes. The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be the expiration of the TCJA provisions at year-end 2025, resulting in an increase in personal income tax rates from 37% to 39.6%, among other changes.

One scenario that could result in a No outcome is if Congress becomes gridlocked due to political disagreements, leading to a failure to pass any legislation extending the TCJA provisions. This could happen if there are significant differences between the House and Senate on the issue or if other priorities take precedence.

Conversely, a scenario that could result in a Yes outcome is if Congressional lawmakers come together to pass legislation extending or making the TCJA provisions permanent, which would avoid the expiration and rate increases. This could occur if there is broad bipartisan support for the measure or if one party has a strong enough majority to pass it without Democratic support.

Given the complexity of the issue, the lack of action so far, and the history of Congressional gridlock, it seems more likely that the TCJA provisions will not be extended or made permanent. However, there is also a possibility that Congress may prioritize fiscal responsibility and economic growth, leading to a Yes outcome.

Overall, while the exact timing of the outcome is unknown, the status quo outcome of expiration seems more likely given the current political climate and lack of action so far.
