Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

Peru's GDP per capita (PPP) by 2030 will likely continue growing at a moderate pace, driven by various factors such as its favorable business environment, young population, and natural resources. The country has made significant progress in recent years, with a GDP per capita increase from $1,945 in 2000 to $7,906 in 2023.

Assuming a moderate annual GDP growth rate, Peru's GDP could potentially reach around $550-600 billion by 2050, as the country continues to diversify its economy and invest in infrastructure and human capital. Experts and market analysts expect that Peru has a high potential for growth, driven by its favorable business environment, young population, and natural resources.

However, there are also potential risks and challenges that could impact Peru's economic growth. A global economic downturn or a major shock to the world economy could significantly impact Peru's exports and foreign investment, potentially leading to a GDP of around $250-275 billion by 2050. On the other hand, an unprecedented advancement in technology and innovation could lead to significant productivity gains and new industries emerging in Peru, propelling its GDP to over $600 billion by 2050.

Despite these uncertainties, it is likely that Peru's economic growth will be influenced by a combination of factors, including its current trends and historical data. A rough estimate might be around $450-650 billion by 2050, with a wide range of possible outcomes depending on various scenarios.
