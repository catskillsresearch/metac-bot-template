Here's a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The likelihood of Israel being the first country to embryo select >10% of its newborns for intelligence depends on various factors. One crucial factor is Israel's continued investment in research infrastructure, which has contributed to its status as a leader in medical innovation and technological advancements. This includes fostering collaborations between academia, industry, and government, as well as maintaining a favorable business environment that attracts private investment and startup ecosystems.

Another important consideration is the development of AI-assisted IVF technology, which has already shown promise with the creation of an AI system that evaluates sperm without chemical staining. The widespread adoption of this technology could lead to increased success rates, reduced costs, and improved patient outcomes, making Israel a hub for medical innovation in the field of reproductive medicine.

However, there are also scenarios where Israel's efforts may not result in achieving >10% embryo selection. For instance, if the international scientific community raises concerns about the safety or efficacy of AI-assisted IVF technology, or if alternative methods become more popular, then Israel's innovation may not gain widespread acceptance.

Ultimately, the probability of Israel being the first country to achieve this outcome depends on a complex interplay of these factors. While there are no guarantees, Israel's strong research infrastructure and favorable business environment make it an attractive location for medical innovation, increasing the likelihood that the country will continue to be at the forefront of reproductive medicine advancements.

Please note that I have not provided a final probability or assessment in this rationale.
