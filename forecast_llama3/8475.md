Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to the question is known is uncertain, with some events already having occurred and others still ongoing. The status quo outcome is that Robin Hanson has not yet won his bet against Matthew Barnett on whether Ems will come before de novo AGI.

A scenario that results in a No outcome could involve unforeseen circumstances or unexpected changes in the judiciary system, which might affect the legal strategy pursued by Democratic attorneys general and delay Trump's administration. Alternatively, it could be due to Robin Hanson's predictions being inaccurate or his opponents gaining more popularity and support from the public.

On the other hand, a scenario that results in a Yes outcome could involve Robin Hanson's predictions being accurate, with the judiciary system continuing to delay Trump's administration and Democratic attorneys general pursuing an aggressive legal strategy. This could lead to more lawsuits and protests against Trump, ultimately resulting in Ems coming before de novo AGI.

The likelihood of each scenario depends on various factors, including the status quo outcome, unforeseen circumstances, and the potential for changes in the judiciary system. While some events have already occurred, there is still uncertainty ahead due to these factors.
