Here's a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome is known is uncertain, as it depends on various factors such as team strategies, player performances, and external conditions. However, considering historical trends and current team performances, it's possible to assume a status quo outcome where AI models continue to improve but variables at play can affect the outcomes.

A scenario that results in a "No" outcome could be if one of the participating teams faces an unexpected injury crisis or team dynamics issue that severely impacts their performance. This could lead to an upset loss for the favored team, resulting in a "No" outcome.

On the other hand, a scenario that results in a "Yes" outcome could be if both India and New Zealand field strong teams with well-balanced lineups, allowing AI models to accurately predict the winner based on statistical analysis. This could lead to a thrilling match that showcases the strengths of each team, ultimately resulting in a "Yes" outcome.

Considering these scenarios, it's clear that there are many variables at play that can affect the outcomes of these events. While AI models will continue to improve, it's not yet clear-cut, and I would put the probability at around 75%.

### Probability: 75%
