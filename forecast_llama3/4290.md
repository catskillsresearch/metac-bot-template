Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The likelihood of NAD+ boosters increasing human lifespan by >=5% by 2030 depends on various factors, including market trends, consumer behavior, scientific research, and regulatory environments. As a baseline, it's likely that the status quo will prevail, with NAD+ supplements remaining a niche product and not becoming widely accepted or mainstream.

However, scenarios can emerge that could drive growth and adoption in the market. For instance, new scientific research demonstrating the effectiveness of NAD+ supplements in addressing specific health concerns, such as age-related diseases or metabolic disorders, could drive further growth and adoption. Additionally, changes in consumer behavior, such as increased awareness about the importance of cellular health, could lead to a surge in demand for NAD+ supplements.

On the other hand, scenarios can also emerge that would hinder the growth and adoption of NAD+ supplements. For example, if new research challenges the benefits of NAD+ supplements or if regulatory bodies impose restrictions on their use, consumer interest may decline. Furthermore, increased competition from other supplement categories or a lack of scientific evidence supporting the effectiveness of NAD+ supplements could also limit their mainstream acceptance.

Ultimately, the likelihood of NAD+ boosters increasing human lifespan by >=5% by 2030 depends on the interplay between these various factors and scenarios. While there is no guarantee that NAD+ supplements will become mainstream or have a significant impact on human lifespan, it's possible that new evidence, market trends, and consumer behavior could drive growth and adoption in this area.
