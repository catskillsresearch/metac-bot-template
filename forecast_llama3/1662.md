Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The vastness of space and the unpredictability of celestial bodies' gravitational forces make it unlikely for an asteroid or comet to impact Earth in the near future. Historically, asteroids have a low probability of impacting Earth, and the majority are small and burn up in the atmosphere. While there is a non-zero probability of an unexpected event occurring that could result in an impact, this likelihood is further reduced by the slow pace of changes in the asteroid/comet population.

The status quo outcome, where no asteroids or comets have been mined for commercial purposes before 2030, is supported by current trends and data. The rarity of collisions with our planet and the unpredictability of celestial bodies' gravitational forces make it more likely that the status quo outcome will prevail.

However, there are scenarios that could result in a Yes outcome, such as significant changes in the orbits of celestial bodies or unexpected discoveries. These scenarios would require significant and unforeseen events to occur, making them less likely.

Overall, while there is some uncertainty surrounding the likelihood of an asteroid or comet being mined for commercial purposes before 2030, the status quo outcome appears more probable given the vastness of space and the unpredictability of celestial bodies' gravitational forces.
