Here's a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The likelihood of Georgia controlling South Ossetia and Abkhazia before 2028 depends on several factors. Firstly, it's essential to consider the status quo outcome, which suggests that the current diplomatic stalemate is likely to persist unless significant external factors drive change. This means that Russia's recognition of South Ossetia and Abkhazia as independent nations will likely remain unchanged unless there are major shifts in the political landscape.

Secondly, the scenarios outlined by each forecast highlight the importance of diplomatic efforts between Georgia and South Ossetia/Abkhazia. A breakthrough in negotiations could lead to a peaceful resolution, potentially paving the way for Georgia to exert control over the regions. However, this scenario is contingent upon both sides being willing to compromise on issues such as autonomy and sovereignty.

Thirdly, it's crucial to consider Russia's role in the conflict. If tensions escalate between Georgia and South Ossetia/Abkhazia, and Russia continues to support their independence, it becomes less likely that Georgia will control the regions in the near future. Similarly, if international intervention or significant incentives for a peaceful resolution are lacking, the status quo is more likely to persist.

Finally, it's essential to recognize that time is not on Georgia's side. The longer the conflict persists, the more entrenched the diplomatic stalemate becomes, making it increasingly difficult for Georgia to regain control over South Ossetia and Abkhazia.

Taking these factors into account, a comprehensive rationale for predicting whether Georgia will control South Ossetia and Abkhazia before 2028 is as follows:

The likelihood of Georgia controlling South Ossetia and Abkhazia before 2028 depends on the successful negotiation of a peaceful resolution to the conflict. This requires both sides being willing to compromise on issues such as autonomy and sovereignty, while also considering Russia's continued recognition of independence for these regions. The status quo outcome suggests that this scenario is less likely, especially given the time already lost since the conflict began. However, if diplomatic efforts can lead to a breakthrough, and international support or incentives are provided, then it becomes more plausible that Georgia could control South Ossetia and Abkhazia in the near future.
