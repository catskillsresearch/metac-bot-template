Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome is known is significant, with multiple years remaining before 2046. This allows us to observe and analyze current trends, technological advancements, and innovative developments in the field.

In terms of the status quo outcome if nothing changed, it is likely that existing technologies and methods for space travel and transportation will continue to dominate the landscape, with no significant breakthroughs or milestones achieved. This scenario assumes that the challenges and complexities involved in building a space elevator or cargo rocket capable of landing anywhere on Earth in under 90 minutes remain unresolved.

However, there are also potential scenarios that could result in a Yes outcome, driven by government initiatives, private investments, or international collaborations to achieve these ambitious goals. Breakthroughs in materials science, engineering, and technological advancements could lead to the development of space elevators or cargo rockets capable of landing anywhere on Earth in under 90 minutes.

Furthermore, considering the potential benefits of such technologies, it is likely that continued investment and innovation will drive progress towards achieving these goals. Momentum generated by recent advancements and the potential for game-changing breakthroughs also suggest that there may be a likelihood of significant progress or even realization of these ambitious goals before 2046.
