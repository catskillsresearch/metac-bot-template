Here's a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome is known is uncertain, but we can estimate it based on the timeline provided. The status quo outcome if nothing changed would likely result in California's ban on gas-powered cars being upheld, with many other states following suit. However, this assumption may not hold true if there is significant opposition from the automotive industry, fuel distributors, or lawmakers.

A scenario that results in a No outcome (i.e., the ban is not implemented or is delayed) could be if governments do not prioritize environmental concerns or fail to provide sufficient incentives for the adoption of electric vehicles. Additionally, if alternative energy sources become more viable and widespread, reducing the need for electric vehicles, the market demand might decrease.

On the other hand, a scenario that results in a Yes outcome (i.e., the ban is implemented) could be if there is continued momentum behind electric vehicles and a growing demand for cleaner air quality. For instance, if multiple countries set ambitious targets for reducing carbon emissions, or if there are breakthroughs in battery technology that make electric vehicles more affordable and practical.

The likelihood of these scenarios playing out will depend on various factors, including government policies, technological advancements, and shifts in public opinion. Considering the recent announcements and trends towards stricter emissions standards, I believe there is still a possibility for a Yes outcome. However, given that the world changes slowly most of the time, the status quo outcome may be more likely.

Overall, the probability of over half of US states forbidding affirmative action before 2035 will depend on the complex interplay of these factors and the relative likelihood of each scenario playing out.
