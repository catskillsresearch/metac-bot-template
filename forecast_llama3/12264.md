Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The likelihood of successfully bringing back the Tasmanian Tiger from extinction before 2035 depends on various factors. Firstly, significant progress has already been made in de-extinction technologies, which increases the chances of success. However, there are still significant scientific and logistical challenges to overcome, including unforeseen complications, inadequate funding, or regulatory hurdles.

The status quo outcome, where nothing changes, is that the Tasmanian Tiger remains extinct, with no attempts or efforts made to revive it. This outcome has a high probability due to the fact that species extinction is often irreversible, and the natural world can be very slow to change.

However, there are scenarios where conservation efforts focus on protecting endangered species rather than trying to revive extinct ones, which could divert attention away from de-extinction projects. Additionally, public support and government funding for these efforts are crucial, and a shift in global priorities towards preserving biodiversity could also impact the likelihood of success.

On the other hand, breakthroughs in genetic engineering and stem cell technology make de-extinction a reality, and if the public becomes more accepting of the idea, governments may begin to support conservation efforts by reviving select species like the Tasmanian Tiger. As a result, it is possible that the thylacine could be successfully brought back from extinction.

Overall, while there are valid concerns about de-extinction, advancements in science and technology will make it increasingly possible to revive extinct species. Additionally, growing awareness of conservation and environmental issues may lead more people to support efforts to bring back iconic species like the Tasmanian Tiger.
