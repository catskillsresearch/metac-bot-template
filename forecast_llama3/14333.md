Here's a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 74 years (based on Forecast 1, 2, and 4). The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be around 115-120 years old, assuming current trends in human longevity continue. However, it's possible that humans may experience some physical changes due to technology use, such as hunched backs or claw-like hands, which could impact human lifespan.

If the current trend continued, humans might reach an age of 125-130 years old (based on Forecast 1), but this is uncertain and could be influenced by unexpected scenarios. Experts predict that technological advancements will lead to increased life expectancy, while others warn about the negative effects of excessive screen time on physical health (Forecast 4). Markets tend to reflect optimism about human lifespans, with predictions ranging from 75 to 90 years old.

Unexpected scenarios could include breakthroughs in anti-aging research or regenerative medicine that lead to significant increases in human lifespans, or a catastrophic event like environmental disaster or war that accelerates human evolution and adaptation, leading to extraordinary longevity (Forecast 1). Alternatively, an unexpected scenario could be the discovery of a revolutionary anti-aging treatment that leads to a decrease in human age.

On the other hand, a shift towards more sustainable and healthy lifestyles, combined with advances in medicine and technology, could also lead to higher average lifespans. The key takeaway is that predicting human longevity in 2100 requires considering multiple factors, including technological advancements, lifestyle choices, and unexpected scenarios.

Given these considerations, a final combined rationale might look like this:

The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 74 years. If nothing changed, humans would likely reach an age of around 115-120 years old, assuming current trends in human longevity continue. However, unexpected scenarios could influence human lifespan, including breakthroughs in anti-aging research or regenerative medicine that lead to significant increases in human lifespans, or a catastrophic event like environmental disaster or war that accelerates human evolution and adaptation.

Ultimately, the best guess for the age of the oldest living person in 2100 is around 125-130 years old, with a range of possible outcomes depending on various factors.
