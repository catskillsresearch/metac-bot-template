Here is a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to this question is unknown, as it depends on various factors such as parliamentary decisions, public opinion, and court rulings. However, considering the ongoing efforts to ban the AfD party and the complexities involved in this process, it is likely that the status quo outcome will persist for some time.

Currently, there are ongoing efforts to ban the AfD party, but it remains unclear whether these attempts will be successful. The status quo outcome would likely be that the AfD party continues to operate, albeit with increased scrutiny and potential legal challenges. This scenario assumes that the current political landscape and momentum remain unchanged, with the AfD continuing to radicalize and the German authorities not taking significant action to ban the party.

However, it is also possible that a significant change could occur if the AfD party's radicalization leads to widespread condemnation and protests across Germany, sparking a national debate on extremism and free speech. In this scenario, the Federal Constitutional Court, influenced by public opinion and the growing consensus among lawmakers, ultimately decides to ban the AfD party.

Overall, it is difficult to predict with certainty which outcome will occur, as both the status quo and a ban are plausible scenarios given the complexities of the political process and the potential risks involved in attempting to ban a political party.
