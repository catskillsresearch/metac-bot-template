Here's a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome is known depends on various factors such as political developments, public opinion, and economic conditions. However, considering the history of Irish reunification efforts, it may take at least a few years for a clear outcome to emerge. The status quo suggests that Northern Ireland will remain part of the United Kingdom, with some degree of autonomy and cooperation with the Republic of Ireland.

A scenario where public opinion remains divided, and there is no significant shift in political momentum or economic conditions that would lead to a unified Ireland could occur. This might be driven by unionist concerns about identity and cultural differences remaining prominent, making the prospect of reunification seem distant.

On the other hand, a scenario where Irish unity is achieved could arise if Sinn FÃ©in's popularity continues to grow, and more moderate unionists begin to see the benefits of reunification. This might be driven by economic factors, such as increased trade opportunities and investments, or a sense of shared identity and cultural heritage.

Given these considerations, it seems likely that the status quo will prevail, with Northern Ireland remaining part of the United Kingdom unless there is a significant shift in public sentiment or political circumstances that would lead to a clear outcome.
