Here is a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 2-5 years, considering the predicted timelines mentioned in some of the articles (2026, 2027, 2029-2030). The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be that there is no direct military conflict between Russia and NATO.

If all parties involved continue to engage in diplomatic efforts and negotiations, and the situation remains stable with no significant changes in the political or military landscape, it's possible that a direct conflict between Russia and NATO can be avoided. This could include continued sanctions and economic pressure on Russia, as well as increased defense spending and cooperation among NATO countries.

However, there are scenarios that could lead to a conflict. For example, if tensions continue to rise and there is no significant progress made in resolving the Ukrainian crisis or addressing the concerns of the West regarding Russian aggression, it's possible that Russia could launch a surprise attack on a NATO country, potentially triggering a wider conflict.

Additionally, if Russia perceives a significant threat to its interests or security, it may be willing to engage in a direct conflict to protect itself. This could be driven by a desire to weaken NATO's cohesion, gain strategic advantages, or protect its own interests.

Considering these scenarios and the slow pace of change in international relations, it seems that the status quo outcome (no conflict) is more likely than the alternative scenarios (conflict). However, there are still risks involved, and the probability of a direct conflict remains low but not impossible.
