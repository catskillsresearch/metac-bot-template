Here's a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 13-20 years, allowing for many potential events and developments that could impact the outcome. As a result, it is essential to consider both the status quo outcome and possible scenarios that could lead to a China-Russia war or no war.

The status quo outcome is that Russia will continue to be a regional player in Eastern Europe, with tensions between Russia and NATO countries remaining high due to its military build-up and strategic planning. This scenario assumes that there are no significant changes in Russia's policies or intentions, which is unlikely given the dynamic nature of international relations.

However, it is also important to consider potential scenarios that could lead to a China-Russia war or no war. A possible scenario for a No outcome is that Russia's economy experiences a decline, its military capabilities remain limited, and it focuses on internal development rather than external aggression. This could lead to a decrease in tensions with NATO countries, reducing the likelihood of a military conflict.

On the other hand, a possible scenario for a Yes outcome is that Russia's economy experiences a significant surge, it modernizes its military capabilities, and it becomes more assertive in its international relations. This could lead to an increase in tensions with NATO countries, potentially resulting in a military conflict.

Given these scenarios and considering the slow-changing nature of international politics and Russia's consistent record of military expansion, it is likely that the status quo outcome will prevail. However, there are also potential events or developments that could alter the trajectory of global politics and lead to a No outcome.
