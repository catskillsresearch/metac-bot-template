Here's a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The most important factor influencing housing prices in Madrid is the status quo outcome, which assumes that current trends and conditions will continue. This means that housing prices are likely to rise moderately, driven by factors such as limited supply, sustained demand, and economic growth. The world changes slowly most of the time, so it's reasonable to expect a continuation of these trends unless there are significant external shocks or policy changes.

While there are potential scenarios that could lead to a decrease or increase in housing prices, they are less likely than the status quo outcome. A severe economic downturn or unexpected policy changes could lead to a decline in housing prices, but such events are relatively rare and usually have a significant impact on the market. Similarly, sustained economic growth, low interest rates, and limited supply of new housing units could drive up demand and prices, but these factors are not guaranteed to continue.

Overall, it's most likely that housing prices in Madrid will continue to rise moderately, driven by the status quo outcome.
