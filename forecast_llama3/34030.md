Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome is known is relatively short, and Elizabeth MacDonough's previous rulings suggest a tendency to follow Senate rules and traditions. The status quo outcome is that she will likely continue to serve as the Senate parliamentarian and make decisions based on her nonpartisan interpretation of Senate rules and precedents.

However, there are factors that could influence her ruling. A strong opposition from Democratic senators and members of Congress could lead to significant changes in the bill or even its rejection, prompting MacDonough to rule against the Republicans. Additionally, a shift in public opinion against Trump's policies or an unexpected event could divert attention away from the tax agenda.

On the other hand, if Elizabeth MacDonough rules in favor of Senate Republicans, it would be due to her finding that their proposed changes to the current policy baseline are consistent with existing Senate rules and procedures. This could occur if she believes the benefits of passing the bill outweigh any potential procedural irregularities or if she determines that the 2017 tax cuts are already part of the current budget.

Overall, while there is a possibility for MacDonough to rule in favor of Republicans, it seems more likely that she will continue to follow Senate rules and traditions, which would result in her ruling against their attempts to pass Trump's tax agenda.
