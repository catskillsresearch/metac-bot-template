Here's a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to this question is known: With more than 20 years remaining, we have ample opportunity to observe trends and make adjustments before the outcome becomes clear.

Status quo outcome if nothing changed: Based on current GDP growth rates and trends, India's economy is expected to continue growing at a moderate pace, potentially reaching $4-5 trillion by 2047.

Outcome if the current trend continued: Assuming the current economic growth rate of around 6.5% per annum continues, India's GDP could reach $8-10 trillion by 2047, driven by factors like increasing investment in infrastructure, a growing middle class, and expanding services sector.

Expectations of experts and markets: Vary widely depending on the source, but many experts predict that India will become a high-income country with a GDP ranging from $15 trillion to over $30 trillion by 2047. Markets also reflect this optimism, as many investors are eager to tap into India's growth potential.

Unexpected scenarios: An unexpected global economic downturn or a sudden decline in foreign investment could lead to a slower-than-expected GDP growth rate, potentially resulting in an outcome of around $3.5 trillion. On the other hand, rapid technological advancements, significant investments in infrastructure and human capital, or a surge in entrepreneurship and innovation could propel India's economy forward, leading to a higher outcome.

This rationale combines the best elements from each individual forecast, providing a comprehensive and consistent framework for understanding the potential outcomes for India's GDP by 2047.
