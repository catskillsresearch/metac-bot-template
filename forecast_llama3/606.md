Here is a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The detection of a message originating from Luyten's Star before 2046 depends on various factors such as the sensitivity of telescopes and the location of potential messages. It's difficult to predict exactly when a new message will be detected.

The status quo outcome is that no message will be detected, based on current trends and data showing no indications of significant advancements or changes in detection capabilities.

A scenario that results in a No outcome would involve the continuation of existing detection methods and technologies without major breakthroughs or changes in Luyten's Star's celestial activity. This assumes no unexpected increase in signal strength or improved detection capabilities.

On the other hand, a possible scenario for detecting a message from Luyten's Star before 2046 could involve an unexpected change in its celestial activity, such as an unusual increase in stellar flares or gravitational interactions that enhance the detectability of signals. Alternatively, advancements in detection technologies or improved coordination among astronomers and space agencies could lead to the discovery of a new message.

It is also important to consider that the outcome may not be solely determined by the status quo, but rather influenced by various factors such as the evolution of our understanding of Luyten's Star and potential breakthroughs in detection technology.
