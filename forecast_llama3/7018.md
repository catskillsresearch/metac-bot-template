Here is a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to the question is known is uncertain, as economic trends and factors are complex and subject to change. However, if current trends continue, India's real GDP growth rate might stabilize around 6-7% per annum. Experts and markets are generally optimistic about India's economic prospects, with some projecting higher rates driven by AI advancements and others anticipating more modest growth. An unexpected shock could be a global economic downturn caused by the sudden adoption of protectionist trade policies, leading to a GDP growth rate as low as 4-5%. Alternatively, an unexpected technological breakthrough in AI or renewable energy could lead to increased productivity and economic growth, potentially driving GDP growth rates above 10% annually.

Assuming a moderate pace of economic growth, it's likely that India's real GDP will continue to grow at a rate similar to the current trend, with some fluctuations due to global economic conditions and domestic policy decisions. However, there are also potential risks and opportunities that could impact the economy, such as unexpected shocks or technological breakthroughs.

Overall, the uncertainty surrounding the outcome is significant, and it's difficult to predict exactly when India's real GDP will reach 25% higher than every previous year for the first time. Nevertheless, a consistent growth rate of around 6-7% per annum over the next decade would likely be required for this outcome to occur.
