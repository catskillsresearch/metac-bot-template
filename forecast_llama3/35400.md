Here is a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to this question is known depends on various factors such as diplomatic efforts and military actions. The situation is rapidly evolving, and new information may emerge in the coming days or weeks.

The status quo outcome if nothing changed is that Russia and Ukraine continue their conflict with no significant progress towards a ceasefire or peace agreement. This scenario assumes that the current dynamics of the conflict persist, with both sides continuing to exchange blows without any meaningful efforts at dialogue or compromise.

An unexpected outcome could be a surprise breakthrough in negotiations between Russia, Ukraine, and other global powers, potentially driven by changes in public opinion or new diplomatic initiatives. Alternatively, an unexpected escalation of violence or a sudden shift in attitudes or positions among the parties involved could also lead to a significant change in the status quo.

Considering these factors, I assign my probabilities as follows:

* January 2025 - March 2025: 10% (a low probability that some progress will be made, but the conflict is unlikely to end immediately)
* April 2025 - June 2025: 30% (a moderate probability that diplomatic efforts and military actions may lead to a temporary ceasefire or increased negotiations)
* July 2025 - September 2025: 20% (a possibility that international pressure and diplomacy might lead to a more significant breakthrough)
* October 2025 - December 2025: 15% (a chance for renewed focus on peace talks or increased military action, but no conclusive outcome)
* Not before 2026: 25% (an outside chance that the conflict will drag on without any meaningful progress)

Total Probability: 100%

Note: The probabilities are subjective and based on my analysis of the available information. They do not represent any official forecast or guarantee.
