Here's a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The US plant-based meat market is expected to continue growing at a rapid pace, driven by increasing consumer demand for sustainable and healthier food options. The current trend suggests that the market size could reach $17-18 billion by 2032, with some experts predicting even higher growth rates.

However, there are also potential risks and uncertainties that could impact the market's growth. For example, a sudden increase in animal-based meat prices due to supply chain disruptions or environmental concerns could lead to decreased demand for plant-based alternatives, resulting in a lower market size of around $9-10 billion by 2032. On the other hand, breakthroughs in food technology leading to more affordable and appealing plant-based meat products could accelerate market growth, potentially reaching a market size of over $20 billion by 2032.

Another unexpected scenario that could result in a higher outcome is a surge in demand driven by rapid growth in online sales, increased availability of plant-based meat options at mainstream restaurants and grocery stores, and government policies promoting sustainable agriculture. This could cause the market to reach USD 22-25 billion by 2032.

Moreover, the development of new, highly effective marketing strategies or innovative products that capture a larger share of the market could also lead to higher-than-expected outcomes.
