Here is a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The China-to-USA GDP ratio in 2050 will be influenced by various factors, including demographic changes, technological advancements, and policy decisions. First, it is essential to consider the current trend of demographic changes, which suggests a continued decline in birth rates and aging populations in many countries, including Spain. This could lead to a reduction in working-age populations, potentially resulting in lower economic growth.

However, unexpected scenarios can also impact the outcome. For instance, an unprecedented increase in life expectancy and fertility rates across the globe, driven by advancements in medicine and technology, could result in an unexpectedly large and youthful population, leading to higher economic growth. On the other hand, a severe economic downturn or crisis could lead to a decline in GDP growth.

Additionally, technological breakthroughs or innovations can drive economic growth and increase the expected outcome. For example, a breakthrough in energy storage technology or a massive investment in renewable energy infrastructure could significantly boost China's clean-energy sectors, contributing to higher GDP.

In light of these factors, it is crucial to consider the expectations of experts and markets. Experts and financial markets are likely to continue factoring in the impact of demographic changes on economic growth, leading to adjustments in investment strategies and policy decisions. Furthermore, governments may need to implement policies to address these demographic changes, such as increasing labor participation and productivity.

Ultimately, the China-to-USA GDP ratio in 2050 will depend on a complex interplay of factors, including demographic trends, technological advancements, policy decisions, and unexpected scenarios.
