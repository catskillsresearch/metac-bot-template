Here's a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome is known is still uncertain, as it depends on various factors and developments in the coming years. However, considering the current market trends and technological advancements in augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR), a possible status quo outcome would be continued growth and improvement of AR and VR technologies, with increased adoption across industries and applications.

A scenario that results in a No outcome could involve major setbacks or challenges in the development and implementation of AR and VR technologies, such as regulatory hurdles, lack of standardization, or high costs. This could lead to slower adoption rates or even stagnation in the growth of the market.

On the other hand, a scenario that could result in a Yes outcome is if there are breakthroughs in areas like AI, cloud computing, and 5G networks, enabling more widespread and seamless use of AR and VR technologies across various industries. This could lead to increased adoption rates and further growth in the market.

Overall, while unforeseen events or disruptions could impact market growth, the current trends and technological advancements suggest that the status quo outcome is likely, with a possible Yes outcome if breakthroughs occur.
