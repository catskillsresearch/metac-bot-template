Here is a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The likelihood of Obergefell v. Hodges being overturned by the US Supreme Court before 2030 depends on various factors. The slow pace of legal changes and the history of landmark decisions like Obergefell suggest that the status quo outcome, where same-sex marriage remains legal in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, is more likely to prevail. Additionally, public opinion on LGBTQ+ issues continues to evolve in a positive direction, which could further reduce the likelihood of a reversal.

However, there are scenarios where the Court might reconsider its decision. For example, if anti-LGBTQ activists bring a successful case before the Court or if a new justice is appointed who shares the views of Justice Clarence Thomas, there could be an opportunity for the court to revisit and potentially overturn the decision. Furthermore, recent developments, such as resolutions urging the Supreme Court to overturn Obergefell, suggest that there is a small but real chance that the Court could reconsider its decision.

Ultimately, while the status quo outcome is more likely, there are enough uncertainties surrounding same-sex marriage and LGBTQ+ rights that the possibility of a change cannot be ruled out entirely.
