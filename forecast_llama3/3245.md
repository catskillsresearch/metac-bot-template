Based on the rationales provided, a consistent and comprehensive rationale can be developed as follows:

The time left until the outcome is known is approximately 4 months (120 days or 2880 hours), giving us ample opportunity to analyze current trends and market expectations. The status quo outcome if nothing changed would likely involve continued moderate growth in non-farm employment, potentially exceeding market expectations.

Experts and markets are expecting steady job growth, possibly beating consensus estimates. However, there is a risk of an unexpected scenario resulting in a low outcome, such as a sudden and severe economic downturn caused by unforeseen global events or domestic policy changes, which could lead to a decline in non-farm employment.

On the other hand, an unexpected scenario that could result in a high outcome might involve a rapid technological innovation or a major government stimulus package, leading to increased job creation and economic growth. Additionally, there is always a possibility of unanticipated global events or domestic policy changes that could have a significant impact on the labor market.

In developing this rationale, it is essential to consider both the current trend and the expectations of experts and markets. This will enable us to provide a more comprehensive and well-rounded forecast for the U.S. average weekly hours of all employees (total non-farm private) in October 2025.
