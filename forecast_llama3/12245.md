Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

SpinLaunch's kinetic launch technology has already made significant progress, with successful tests and partnerships with prominent organizations like NASA and Airbus. The company's momentum and existing partnerships should help mitigate any initial hurdles or setbacks. Additionally, the growing demand for satellite services and the potential cost savings offered by SpinLaunch's innovative technology could further drive their success.

While unforeseen challenges or regulatory hurdles may arise, SpinLaunch's ability to overcome these obstacles and continue developing its technology is a key factor in determining the outcome. The company's commitment to deploying satellite constellations into low Earth orbit without rocket fuel is a significant step forward, and if successful, could disrupt the satellite launch industry by offering a more cost-effective and environmentally friendly solution.

Overall, SpinLaunch's current status quo outcome, momentum, and partnerships suggest that it is likely that they will continue to make progress on their kinetic launch system, potentially launching constellations of satellites into low Earth orbit.
