Here is a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to the question is known: Unknown, as it depends on various factors such as dark energy's weakening or constant expansion, among others. However, considering the slow pace of change in the universe, we can assume that any changes will occur over a vast period of time.

The status quo outcome if nothing changed: The universe will continue to expand indefinitely, growing colder and lonelier. This is supported by the majority of research suggesting that dark energy might be weakening or constant, leading to either eternal expansion or the Big Crunch.

A scenario that results in a No outcome: If dark energy remains constant and does not weaken, the universe would continue to expand indefinitely, with no significant changes in its fate. Alternatively, if dark energy is accelerating the expansion of the universe, it could continue to grow forever.

A scenario that results in a Yes outcome: If dark energy weakens, causing the universe to eventually stop expanding and collapse inward, it could lead to the Big Crunch scenario, signaling the end of the universe.

Overall, considering the uncertainty surrounding the universe's fate, prioritizing the status quo outcome as more likely given the slow pace of change, and acknowledging the possibility of various scenarios that could result in a No or Yes outcome, we can conclude that:

The universe will continue to expand indefinitely, growing colder and lonelier, unless dark energy weakens, which would lead to the Big Crunch and the end of the universe.
