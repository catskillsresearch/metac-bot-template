Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to the question is known depends on various factors. Considering the current status quo and historical trends, it's likely that tensions between China and the US will continue to remain high. However, this doesn't necessarily mean that a war is inevitable.

A scenario where diplomatic efforts intensify and both countries engage in constructive dialogue to address their differences could lead to a reduced risk of conflict. This might involve agreements on trade, military presence, or other issues, ultimately resulting in the status quo outcome: continued competition, trade disputes, and diplomatic tensions without a full-scale war.

On the other hand, a series of provocative incidents or missteps could escalate tensions between China and the US, leading to a war. This might happen if both sides are unable to find common ground and tensions spiral out of control.

Historical trends suggest that while tensions tend to remain high, they often do not escalate into conflict. However, ideological differences or power struggles could fuel an escalation of tensions, potentially leading to a war.

Considering these scenarios, it's likely that the status quo outcome (no war) is more probable than not. While there are certainly risks and uncertainties involved, it seems that both countries will ultimately seek to avoid conflict and find ways to manage their differences through diplomacy and economic means.
