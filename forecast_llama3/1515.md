Here's a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to the question is known will likely be several years, considering predictions made in some articles and advancements in AI, neuroscience, and biohacking. The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be that humans continue to develop and use technology, leading to gradual increases in cognitive abilities and enhanced focus, but without significant changes to their daily lives or brain function.

A scenario that results in a No outcome could occur if there are unforeseen consequences from the rapid adoption of AI, neuroscience, and biohacking that negatively impact human development. Alternatively, humans could drastically change their lifestyles, embracing more physical activity, social interaction, and healthier habits, leading to a slowdown or reversal of cognitive decline and neurodegenerative diseases.

On the other hand, a scenario that results in a Yes outcome could involve significant advancements in AI, neuroscience, and biohacking, leading to the development of personalized and effective tools for enhancing cognitive abilities, focus, and memory. This could result in significant improvements in human potential and overall well-being.

The possibility of major breakthroughs in genetics, biotechnology, and medicine could also lead to increased human lifespan, with a cure for age-related diseases such as Alzheimer's being a key factor. Additionally, advances in medical research, improvements in healthcare infrastructure, and widespread adoption of healthy lifestyle habits could contribute to an increase in the average human lifespan.

Overall, while there are various factors that could impact the outcome, it is possible that significant advancements in AI, neuroscience, biohacking, and medicine could lead to a Yes outcome, with humans experiencing functional important neurogenesis throughout their lives.
