Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to this question is unknown, as it depends on various factors such as diplomatic efforts, military posturing, and regional stability. The status quo outcome is likely, given the relative calm in the region compared to hypothetical scenarios, but there are also factors that could lead to a nuclear conflict.

A scenario resulting in a "No" outcome would involve ongoing diplomatic efforts, international pressure, and economic cooperation, leading to a decrease in military posturing and an increased focus on stability in the region. On the other hand, a scenario resulting in a "Yes" outcome would be characterized by rapid escalation of tensions, regional involvement, and nuclear warhead deployment.

The complexities and uncertainties involved in predicting the outcome of international events mean that it is difficult to assign a precise probability to either outcome. However, considering the factors that contribute to or mitigate the likelihood of a nuclear conflict, a balanced approach suggests that the status quo outcome is more likely, but not guaranteed.
