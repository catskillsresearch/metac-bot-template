Here is a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The status quo outcome for the value of the Euro against the US Dollar is for it to remain relatively stable, with some fluctuations due to market forces and macroeconomic factors. This is because economic changes tend to occur gradually, and major shocks or disruptions are uncommon. However, external factors such as trade policy decisions can have significant effects on currencies.

A strong European economy, driven by investments in infrastructure and industry, could lead to an increase in exports and a subsequent appreciation of the Euro against the US Dollar. On the other hand, global trade tensions and tariffs imposed by major economies like the United States could cause a decrease in European exports and a depreciation of the Euro.

While some forecasters may emphasize the potential for sudden changes in the currency market, it is also essential to consider the status quo outcome since economic changes tend to occur gradually. Nevertheless, we must not overlook external factors that can have significant effects on currencies, such as trade policy decisions and global trade tensions.

Ultimately, the value of the Euro against the US Dollar will likely be influenced by a combination of these factors, and it is challenging to predict with certainty which scenario will unfold. However, by considering both the status quo outcome and potential external factors, we can develop a more informed understanding of the likelihood that 1 Euro will be worth less than 1 US Dollar before 2026.
