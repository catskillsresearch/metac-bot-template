Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

**(a) Time left until the outcome is known:** The time left until the outcome becomes clear is unknown, as we are dealing with hypothetical scenarios and uncertainties related to international conflicts, global catastrophes, and nuclear wars. This means that there is still some time before the outcome becomes clear.

**(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed:** The status quo outcome is likely a "No" outcome, where no catastrophic event or war occurs. International relations continue to evolve, with ongoing diplomatic efforts and negotiations aimed at preventing conflict. Countries are unlikely to engage in military action without first exhausting all peaceful options.

**(c) Scenarios that result in a No outcome:** A scenario that results in a "No" outcome could involve successful diplomacy and international cooperation, where nations resolve their differences peacefully. This could be achieved through continued dialogue, compromise, and mutual understanding between countries.

**(d) Scenarios that result in a Yes outcome:** A scenario that results in a "Yes" outcome could involve the escalation of tensions between nations, leading to military action and potentially catastrophic consequences. However, this outcome is less likely than the status quo "No" outcome, as most of the available information highlights the devastating consequences of a global nuclear war.

**(Consistent Rationale)**

Considering these scenarios, it seems that the status quo outcome (no catastrophic event or war) is more likely than either a catastrophic event or complete conflict avoidance. The world tends to change slowly, and international relations are shaped by complex factors, including economic interests, historical rivalries, and diplomatic efforts.

Given this, my final assessment would be:

Note that the exact probability estimate will depend on the relative weights given to each scenario, as well as the degree of uncertainty surrounding the outcome.
