Here is a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The world changes slowly most of the time, so it's reasonable to expect that current trends will continue unless significant disruptions or external shocks occur. China's economic growth has been slowing down in recent years due to structural issues such as debt, demographic changes, and over-reliance on exports. However, if China addresses its internal issues, such as reducing debt and increasing domestic consumption, it could create opportunities for economic growth.

On the other hand, the US economy faces challenges that could slow down its growth rate, such as rising national debt, trade tensions, or demographic changes. If these challenges persist, China might capitalize on them to narrow the gap with the US. Additionally, if China experiences rapid technological advancements, leading to significant increases in its productivity and competitiveness, it could further accelerate its economic growth.

Ultimately, the likelihood of China's GDP surpassing that of the United States by a certain year depends on how well these two economies adapt to their respective challenges and opportunities.
