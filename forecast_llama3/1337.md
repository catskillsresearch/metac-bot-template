Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The average rate of formation of suitable stars (stars/year) in our galaxy is uncertain, as it depends on various factors such as advancements in astrobiology and exoplanet discoveries. The current trend suggests that there may be some form of extraterrestrial life, but we have not yet made contact or found definitive evidence. Therefore, the expected outcome remains uncertain.

Experts in astrobiology and the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) remain optimistic about the possibility of finding life elsewhere in the universe, while acknowledging the uncertainty surrounding this outcome. However, unexpected events could lead to a low outcome, such as a sudden, unforeseen event that renders Earth uninhabitable or creates a global catastrophe.

On the other hand, an unexpected discovery of evidence for intelligent life elsewhere in the universe, such as a clear signal or a visitation, could revolutionize our understanding of the cosmos and spark new areas of research. The discovery of a nearby exoplanet with conditions similar to those on Earth, followed by the detection of a signal that is conclusively identified as intelligent life, would significantly increase the likelihood of detecting alien life.

Overall, the uncertainty surrounding this outcome means that it is difficult to predict with certainty. However, considering the advancements in astrobiology and exoplanetary science, as well as the ongoing search for extraterrestrial intelligence, it is possible that we will eventually make contact with intelligent extraterrestrial life.
