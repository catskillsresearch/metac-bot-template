Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

Time left until the outcome to the question is known:
The time left until the outcome of World War III is uncertain, with estimates ranging from 3 years to 100 years. Considering the current events and trends, it's likely that we're still several years away from knowing whether or not WWIII will occur.

Status quo outcome if nothing changed:
If nothing changes, tensions between countries are likely to continue escalating, but a full-blown war might not break out immediately. The risk of miscalculation or unintended escalation remains high in this scenario.

Outcome if the current trend continued:
If the current trends of military spending, geopolitical tensions, and misinformation continue, it's likely that we'll see more frequent and severe conflicts. However, there are also many who remain skeptical about the likelihood of a global conflict.

Expectations of experts and markets:
Experts and market analysts are divided on the issue, with some predicting a significant conflict in the near future, while others believe that diplomacy and international cooperation can prevent such an outcome. Some predict that the escalating tensions will lead to a full-scale conflict, while others believe that meaningful diplomatic efforts can reduce tensions and promote peaceful resolution.

Unexpected scenario resulting in low outcome:
One unexpected scenario that could lead to a low outcome (i.e., no WWIII) would be if world leaders suddenly prioritize diplomacy and cooperation over military posturing. This could be facilitated by game-changing technologies, shifts in economic power dynamics, or a surprise breakthrough in international relations.

Unexpected scenario resulting in high outcome:
An unexpected scenario that could lead to a high outcome (i.e., a global conflict) would be if a major country's leadership becomes increasingly erratic and aggressive, leading to a chain reaction of military responses. This could be exacerbated by the proliferation of autonomous weapons or cyber attacks.

Note: These values are estimates and reflect a range of possible outcomes, considering the uncertainty surrounding the question.
