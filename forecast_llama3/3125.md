Here's a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The fragility of states can be influenced by various factors, including economic instability, political uncertainty, natural disasters, and global commodity prices. It is essential to consider the status quo outcome, where many countries continue to struggle with economic instability, poverty, and political uncertainty. However, it's also crucial to acknowledge that scenarios could arise that exacerbate fragility, such as ongoing conflicts, climate-related events, or severe economic downturns.

The resilience of some economies, like the United States, is a significant factor in determining their stability. The US economy has historically been stable, but this can change rapidly due to unexpected events or policy decisions. A rapid decline in economic stability could be triggered by a global financial crisis, severe pandemic, or political instability. Similarly, natural disasters or climate-related events could push countries closer to the brink.

The key factors that contribute to fragility include poverty, income inequality, and limited resources. Addressing these underlying issues through effective policy interventions, structural reforms, or external factors can help stabilize economies. Conversely, a lack of investment in education, infrastructure, or social programs can exacerbate fragility.

Overall, the likelihood of the United States continuing to be among the 20 countries with the largest deterioration in state stability over the 2019-2029 period is influenced by these various factors.
