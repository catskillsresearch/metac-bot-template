Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 6-8 years. The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be a continued decline in population growth rate, potentially reaching as low as a negative growth rate. However, it's possible that an unexpected scenario could lead to an increase in births or a decrease in deaths, resulting in a higher outcome.

The current trend suggests that the population growth rate will continue to decline due to declining fertility rates and increased mortality rates. Experts predict a continued decline in population growth rate, while markets are likely expecting a similar outcome. However, unexpected scenarios such as an unexpected surge in immigration or unforeseen advances in medicine and healthcare could result in a higher outcome.

On the other hand, unexpected scenarios such as a sudden and severe pandemic or widespread natural disaster could lead to an unexpected decline in population growth rate, potentially resulting in an even lower outcome than predicted. The expectations of experts and markets are that the population growth rate will continue to decline, but it's possible that an unexpected scenario could result in a higher outcome.

Overall, the likelihood of a continued decline in population growth rate is high, but there is also a possibility that an unexpected scenario could result in a higher outcome. The combined rationale suggests that the probability of a low outcome (i.e., a continued decline in population growth rate) is high, while the probability of a high outcome (i.e., an unexpected surge in births or a decrease in deaths) is lower but still possible.
