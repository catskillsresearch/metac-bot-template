Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to the question is known can be estimated based on current trends and data. With approximately 15-20 years remaining before the outcome is fully known, it is essential to consider the status quo outcome if nothing changes. Current data suggests that obesity rates are increasing globally, with over 60% of adults projected to be obese by 2030, as warned by experts like Dr. Mehmet Alper Öztürk and Dr. Simón Barquera, President of the World Obesity Federation.

If current trends continue, we can expect an even higher percentage of Americans to be affected by obesity in the future. A possible scenario could be around 70-75% of American adults being affected by obesity by 2050. Experts and markets likely reflect this expectation, as companies involved in the food industry may see a decline in demand for unhealthy products.

However, unexpected scenarios can result in either a low or high outcome. A sudden shift towards healthy lifestyle choices, increased physical activity, and reduced processed food consumption could lead to a slowdown in the rate of obesity growth, resulting in a lower outcome. On the other hand, a global economic downturn leading to increased stress levels, decreased access to healthy food options, and reduced physical activity could accelerate the rate of obesity growth, resulting in a higher outcome.

Considering these factors, it is essential to recognize that the future is uncertain and can be influenced by various variables. Nevertheless, based on current trends and data, it appears likely that the percentage of Americans affected by obesity will continue to rise unless significant changes are made to address this issue.
