Here is a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The number of nuclear weapons that will be detonated offensively by 2050 is uncertain and dependent on various factors, including international relations, diplomatic efforts, and global security dynamics. In the short term (2025-2030), it's possible that North Korea could continue to develop its nuclear arsenal at a moderate pace, potentially reaching around 150-200 nuclear warheads.

If current trends continue, China is likely to increase its nuclear capabilities, but at a slower rate than North Korea's. However, international relations and diplomatic efforts can greatly impact nuclear proliferation, leading to unexpected scenarios that could result in significant changes to the number of nuclear weapons.

Experts and markets expect North Korea's nuclear capabilities to continue growing, potentially reaching around 300-400 warheads by 2035. China is also expected to increase its nuclear arsenal, but at a slower rate than North Korea's. However, an unexpected diplomatic breakthrough or international agreement could lead to significant reductions in nuclear weapons worldwide.

A major conflict or crisis could prompt countries to rapidly increase their nuclear arsenals, leading to a higher number of warheads. On the other hand, an unlikely diplomatic breakthrough or a significant change in international relations could lead to a reduction in North Korea's nuclear program.

Overall, the uncertain nature of global security dynamics and international relations makes it challenging to predict with certainty how many nuclear weapons will be detonated offensively by 2050. However, considering the current trends, expert expectations, and potential scenarios, it's possible that the number of nuclear warheads could range from approximately 500 to over 1,000 by 2035.
