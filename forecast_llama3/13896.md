Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 5 years, allowing for significant changes and developments in various fields. The status quo outcome if nothing changed would likely see modest progress in healthcare and medical research, technological advancements, and demographic changes.

However, it's essential to consider unexpected scenarios that could result in a low or high outcome. For instance, breakthroughs in disease treatments or cures could lead to improved health outcomes and reduced mortality rates. On the other hand, unforeseen events like economic downturns or pandemics could slow down market growth and reduce consumer spending.

Furthermore, experts' opinions and market analysts' predictions vary, but some anticipate significant growth in specific areas like tourism, technology adoption, or renewable energy. Markets may also influence the outcomes, as investor sentiment can impact industries.

Taking these factors into account, it's reasonable to assume that the outcome will fall within a range of possibilities. The combined rationale suggests that the ASAT tests will occur within this range:
