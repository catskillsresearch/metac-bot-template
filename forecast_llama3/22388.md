Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The likelihood of the US, UK, China, or any EU country enacting Universal Basic Income (UBI) before 2030 depends on various factors such as political developments, economic conditions, and public opinion. The status quo outcome would be the continuation of the current social welfare system in these countries, which may remain unchanged without significant reforms or crisis.

One possible scenario leading to a "Yes" outcome could be if a global crisis or pandemic were to occur, causing widespread economic instability and highlighting the need for a safety net like UBI. This hypothetical scenario would require governments to reassess their priorities and consider implementing UBI as a way to mitigate poverty and ensure basic living standards.

Another possibility would be if a charismatic leader or movement gains traction behind the idea of UBI, which could build momentum and attract support from both political parties. Additionally, successful pilot programs in select countries demonstrating the effectiveness of UBI in reducing poverty and improving economic mobility could lead to a global consensus on the benefits of UBI.

However, there are also scenarios that could result in a "No" outcome, such as strong political oppositions to the idea of UBI or a lack of consensus among policymakers. In addition, some argue that the current social welfare system is sufficient, and that UBI would not be necessary.

Considering these factors, it is difficult to estimate a specific timeline for the implementation of UBI, but it may take several years or even decades for widespread adoption.
