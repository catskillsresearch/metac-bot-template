Here is a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The development of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) depends on various factors, including breakthroughs in AI research, advancements in computing power, and societal investments in this area. The current pace of AI research has accelerated in recent years, with many experts predicting significant progress within the next decade. However, achieving AGI is a complex problem that requires substantial advancements in multiple areas.

If nothing changes, it's likely that significant progress will be made in AI research, but AGI might not be achieved within the next few decades. The development of AGI is uncertain and depends on various factors, including breakthroughs in AI research, advancements in computing power, and societal investments in this area.

Despite the uncertainty, some experts predict that AGI could be developed within the next 5-10 years, driven by rapid progress in machine learning, neural networks, and computational power. However, others are more cautious and predict a longer timeline or even question whether it's possible at all.

An unexpected scenario that could lead to a low outcome is if AI research focuses too heavily on narrow applications and forgets the importance of general intelligence, leading to a prolonged delay or even stagnation in AGI development. On the other hand, an unexpected scenario that could lead to a high outcome is if breakthroughs are made in areas like quantum computing, nanotechnology, or cognitive architectures, accelerating AI development and enabling the creation of AGI within a shorter timeframe.

Overall, while there is uncertainty around the timeline for developing AGI, it's likely that significant progress will be made in AI research, and the possibility of achieving AGI within the next few decades cannot be ruled out.
