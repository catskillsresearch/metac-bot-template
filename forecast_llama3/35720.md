Here's a combined rationale:

The time left until the outcome is known is uncertain and dependent on various market and economic conditions, which are constantly changing. The current status quo suggests that the US dollar will continue to be the dominant global reserve currency, with its share of global foreign exchange reserves remaining around 57.8% (as reported by the IMF). However, there are potential risks and uncertainties that could impact this outcome.

A significant event or policy change could cause a shift in investor sentiment and lead to a decrease in the demand for US Treasuries, causing the dollar's share of global reserves to decline further. On the other hand, if the global economy continues to grow and the US dollar remains a stable store of value, it is likely that its status as the dominant reserve currency will persist.

However, there are also scenarios where the US dollar could remain the global reserve currency due to factors such as continued low interest rates, a strong US job market, and confidence in the US financial system. Additionally, international cooperation and coordination to promote alternative reserve currencies could drive a shift away from the US dollar, but this is not a likely outcome at present.

In conclusion, while there are potential risks and uncertainties that could impact the outcome, the current status quo suggests that the US dollar will continue to be the dominant global reserve currency, with its share of global foreign exchange reserves remaining around 57.8%.
