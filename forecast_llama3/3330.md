Here's a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to the question is known is relatively long, considering that cryopreservation technology is still in its early stages and many hurdles need to be overcome before it can become a viable means of achieving immortality. The status quo outcome if nothing changed is that cryopreservation will continue to be a highly speculative and experimental procedure with no guarantee of success or revival. However, significant breakthroughs are possible in the fields of cryobiology and regenerative medicine, allowing for the successful revival of cryopreserved individuals.

The likelihood of such breakthroughs depends on various factors, including advancements in medical technology, understanding of brain function, and the complexity of reviving a frozen body. Despite these challenges, there is a possibility that scientists will make significant progress in developing reliable methods for freezing and reviving human bodies. This could be driven by significant investments in research and development, as well as the emergence of new technologies that make it possible to revive cryopreserved individuals.

However, the slow pace of change in most fields means that the status quo outcome is likely to persist unless there is a major breakthrough. Even if such a breakthrough occurs, it may not necessarily lead to the successful revival of cryopreserved individuals, as there are significant ethical and regulatory hurdles to overcome.

Overall, while there is a possibility for a breakthrough in the field, the likelihood of success depends on many factors, including the pace of scientific progress, societal attitudes towards death and dying, and the emergence of new technologies.
