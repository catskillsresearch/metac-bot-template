Here's a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to this question is known is likely to be several months or even years, as it depends on various factors such as political developments and public opinion shifts. The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be that Puerto Rico remains a US territory rather than becoming the 51st state, given the slow pace of change in political processes and the ongoing complexities surrounding the issue.

A scenario that could lead to a No outcome is if Puerto Rico's political leaders continue to face challenges in achieving statehood due to opposition from US politicians, particularly Republicans who control Congress. Additionally, public opinion in both Puerto Rico and the US mainland remains divided on the issue, making it difficult for proponents of statehood to gain momentum.

On the other hand, a scenario that could lead to a Yes outcome is if Puerto Rico's government and people are able to demonstrate significant progress on addressing the issues that have historically hampered its statehood bid, such as fiscal responsibility, governance reform, and economic development. This could be driven by changes in US politics, shifting public opinion, and successful advocacy efforts.

Ultimately, while there may be some uncertainty surrounding the outcome, it's essential to consider both the potential obstacles and opportunities that could influence the process of Puerto Rico becoming a state.
