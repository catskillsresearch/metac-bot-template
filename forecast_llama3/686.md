Here's a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

Time left until the outcome to the question is known: The time frame for the re-entry of Kosmos 482 into Venusian atmosphere has not been specified, but considering the pace of technological advancements and celestial mechanics, it's reasonable to assume that there may be some uncertainty or unpredictability in the exact timing.

Status quo outcome if nothing changed: The most likely scenario is that Kosmos 482 will continue on its expected trajectory and re-enter the Venusian atmosphere without any significant disruptions or external factors altering its course. This is because the spacecraft has been stuck in orbit for a long time, and it's more likely that it will follow its predicted path rather than experiencing an unexpected change.

Scenario that results in a No outcome: One possible scenario where Kosmos 482 doesn't re-enter the Venusian atmosphere is if some unforeseen event or anomaly occurs, such as a sudden change in atmospheric conditions, asteroid impact, or technological advancements that alter the spacecraft's trajectory. These events are relatively rare and unpredictable, but they cannot be ruled out entirely.

Scenario that results in a Yes outcome: The most likely scenario where Kosmos 482 re-enters the Venusian atmosphere is if it maintains its current trajectory and speed, which would allow it to enter the atmosphere without any significant disruptions or external factors altering its course. This is because the spacecraft has been stuck in orbit for a long time, and it's more likely that it will follow its predicted path rather than experiencing an unexpected change.

Considering these scenarios, it's reasonable to assume that the probability of Kosmos 482 re-entering the Venusian atmosphere before 2030 is high, but not certain. The uncertainty arises from the possibility of unforeseen events or anomalies that could alter the spacecraft's trajectory. However, based on the current information and trajectory, the likelihood of Kosmos 482 re-entering the Venusian atmosphere seems higher than the alternative.
