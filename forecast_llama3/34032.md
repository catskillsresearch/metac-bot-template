Here's a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The National Archives' stance on the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) is well-established and rooted in legal precedents. As such, it is reasonable to assume that the status quo outcome, where the ERA is not recognized as part of the Constitution, is the most likely scenario. This is supported by the fact that the National Archives has consistently reaffirmed its position despite various attempts to ratify the amendment.

However, it is also important to consider the possibility of changes in the political environment or court decisions that could alter the situation. For instance, a significant shift in Congressional sentiment or a favorable court ruling could potentially pave the way for the ERA's recognition as part of the Constitution.

While there are scenarios where the President could direct the archivist to publish the ERA or Congress takes action to change the ratification deadline, these outcomes are less likely and would require significant changes in the legal framework or political landscape. As such, they should be given less weight in the assessment.

Ultimately, a consistent rationale that balances the status quo outcome with the possibility of changes in the political environment or court decisions suggests that the most probable outcome is the National Archives not recognizing the ERA as part of the Constitution by June 30, 2025.
