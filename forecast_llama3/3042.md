Here's a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The likelihood of wildfires destroying a total exceeding 10Mha of global tree cover by 2031 depends on various factors. If nothing changes, it is possible that forest loss will continue to increase at an alarming rate in the coming years, driven by climate change and human activities such as agriculture. The current trends and patterns suggest that tropical forest loss will persist unless there are concerted efforts to address this problem.

However, a scenario where governments and international organizations take immediate and drastic action to address the root causes of deforestation, such as poverty, lack of sustainable livelihoods, and corruption, could lead to a decrease in forest fires. Similarly, if there is a sudden and significant shift in global policies or practices that rapidly reduces greenhouse gas emissions, slows climate change, and leads to a decrease in tropical forest fires, this could also contribute to a "No" outcome.

On the other hand, a scenario where climate change continues to accelerate, leading to more frequent and intense wildfires, droughts, and heatwaves, would exacerbate existing environmental issues, causing an increase in forest loss. Additionally, if there are no effective measures taken to address deforestation and habitat destruction, this could also contribute to a "Yes" outcome.

Ultimately, the likelihood of reaching the threshold of 10Mha of global tree cover destruction depends on the balance between these factors. While there are scenarios that could lead to a decrease in forest loss, it is more likely that the current trend of increasing forest loss will continue unless significant changes occur in the coming years.
