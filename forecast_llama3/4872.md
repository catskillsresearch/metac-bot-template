Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to the question is known depends on various factors, including technological advancements, societal trends, and market demand. Currently, AI and machine learning technologies are rapidly advancing and becoming more integrated into various industries, leading to increased automation and efficiency. However, this trend may also lead to job displacement and changes in the workforce.

The status quo outcome if nothing changed is that photonic computing will likely continue to advance and become more widespread, driven by the demand for high-speed data transmission and AI integration. If AI and machine learning adoption slows down or does not become more widespread, the demand for photonic computing solutions may decrease.

A possible scenario that results in a No outcome is if there is a significant slowdown or reversal of the growth in AI and machine learning adoption, perhaps due to regulatory barriers or concerns about job displacement. This could lead to a reduced demand for photonic computing solutions. Alternatively, breakthroughs in traditional computing methods or alternative technologies could render photonic computing obsolete.

On the other hand, continued advancements in photonic computing, leading to further miniaturization, increased processing speeds, and expanded applications across industries such as healthcare, finance, and manufacturing, could result in a Yes outcome. This could be driven by breakthroughs in areas like data transmission rates, energy efficiency, and processing power.

Overall, the future of photonic tensor cores in machine learning depends on various factors that are not yet fully understood or controlled. However, given the current trends and advancements in AI and machine learning, it is possible that photonic computing will become more widespread and ubiquitous in machine learning by 2030.
