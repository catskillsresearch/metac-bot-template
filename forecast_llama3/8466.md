Here is a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome is known depends on various factors, including market trends, government policies, and technological advancements. However, it's likely that we have around 1-2 years before the outcome becomes clearer. 

If nothing changes, the percentage of primary energy production from solar energy will remain steady at around 21.9% (as reported in one article). However, if current trends continue, we can expect solar and wind power to account for approximately 25-30% of primary energy production by the end of 2025.

Experts and market analysts are optimistic about the growth potential of solar energy, citing factors such as declining installation costs, increasing demand, and supportive government policies. They predict that solar energy will continue growing at a rapid pace, potentially reaching levels of 40-50% or more of new electricity generation capacity within the next decade.

An unexpected scenario that could result in a lower outcome is if there's a significant increase in the cost of manufacturing solar panels due to supply chain disruptions or regulatory changes. This could lead to reduced adoption rates and slower growth in the solar energy sector. On the other hand, an unexpected scenario that could result in a higher outcome is if there's a breakthrough in solar panel technology, making them even more efficient, cost-effective, or easy to install.

Overall, considering these factors, it's likely that the percentage of primary energy production from solar energy will continue growing at a rapid pace, reaching levels of 40-50% or more within the next decade.
