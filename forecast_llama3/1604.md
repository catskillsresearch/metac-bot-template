Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome of this question is unknown, with predictions ranging from approximately 1 year to 30 years. However, considering the current trend of overpopulation and biodiversity decline, it's reasonable to assume an average timeframe of around 20-25 years.

The status quo outcome if nothing changed would likely continue to be a steady increase in global population, with potential consequences such as resource scarcity, environmental degradation, and potential social and economic issues. According to the IPBES report, this could lead to significant losses in biodiversity, with some species facing extinction, and ecosystems degrading or collapsing.

A possible scenario that could result in a No outcome is if humanity makes drastic changes to its consumption patterns, technological advancements accelerate at an exponential rate, and global cooperation leads to sustainable resource management. In this scenario, overpopulation becomes less of an issue as fertility rates decline, and innovative technologies allow for more efficient use of resources.

On the other hand, a scenario that could result in a Yes outcome is if humanity continues to ignore the warning signs of biodiversity decline and overpopulation. As natural resources become scarcer, conflicts arise over remaining resources, leading to global instability and potential collapse. The consequences of this scenario could be catastrophic, with mass extinctions, ecosystem collapses, and significant human suffering.

Considering the weight of the status quo outcome, it's essential to recognize that there are many obstacles and potential risks that could lead to a catastrophic outcome. However, it's also crucial to acknowledge the possibility of positive changes or adaptations that could mitigate the risk of extinction.
