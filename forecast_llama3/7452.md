Here's a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The likelihood of a US-Russia war before 2050 is influenced by the slow pace of global change and the complexity of international conflicts. The status quo outcome, where Russia continues to focus on Ukraine without launching a major attack on Europe, is more likely due to the stability and inertia that often characterize international relations.

However, there are scenarios where tensions could escalate and lead to a war in Europe. One such scenario involves a rapid end to the war in Ukraine, followed by Russia redirecting its resources towards Europe and testing NATO's collective defense capabilities. This could create an environment where Russia feels emboldened to launch a military campaign against European countries.

Another scenario that increases the likelihood of a war is a significant shift in international relations, such as a major diplomatic breakthrough between Russia and Western nations, which could reduce tensions but also lead to miscalculations and unexpected consequences.

Furthermore, while there are no immediate signs of a crisis, the ongoing tensions between Russia and Ukraine create an environment where sudden changes can occur. As a result, it is essential to consider not only the status quo outcome but also the scenarios that could lead to a war in Europe before 2050.

Ultimately, the likelihood of a US-Russia war before 2050 depends on the specific circumstances that unfold over the next few years.
