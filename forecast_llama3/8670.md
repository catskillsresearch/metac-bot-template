Here is a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

While it's impossible to predict with certainty, I believe that the use of nuclear weapons by the US President (or any other leader) will require extraordinary circumstances and a significant escalation of tensions. The devastating consequences of such an action would likely lead to widespread international condemnation, making it a less likely outcome.

Historically, there have been few instances of nuclear weapon use, and efforts to reduce the role of nuclear arms in national security strategies suggest a trend towards de-escalation rather than escalation. Additionally, the complexity of nuclear disarmament and the interests at play make it unlikely that the US will pursue significant changes in its nuclear policy without a major shift in global circumstances.

While scenarios that result in the use of nuclear weapons are possible, they are less likely due to the far-reaching consequences and international condemnation that would follow. The trend towards diplomatic efforts and dialogue as primary means of resolving international conflicts also suggests a move away from the use of force.

Furthermore, the likelihood of significant events or policy shifts that would lead to a change in this status quo outcome is low. As such, I believe that the status quo outcome (no use of nuclear weapons) is more likely than not.

This rationale takes into account the complexities and uncertainties surrounding the use of nuclear weapons, as well as the historical trend towards de-escalation and the devastating consequences of their use.
