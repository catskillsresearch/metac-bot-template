Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 15 years, considering that we are currently in the year 2025 and the target date is 2100. The status quo outcome if nothing changed would likely be a continued increase in global warming, with temperatures rising by another 2.7°C (as mentioned in some of the sources) to reach around 4.7°C above pre-industrial levels.

A scenario that results in a No outcome would require significant and immediate actions worldwide to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, leading to a decrease in global warming and the avoidance of catastrophic climate change consequences. This would involve a coordinated effort from governments, industries, and individuals worldwide, as well as a rapid deployment of clean energy technologies.

On the other hand, a scenario that results in a Yes outcome would be one where little to no action is taken to address climate change, and the world continues on its current trajectory, leading to even more severe and widespread climate-related disasters. This would likely result in a temperature increase of more than 1.5°C by 2100, with potentially catastrophic consequences such as sea-level rise, more frequent and severe weather events, and altered ecosystems.

Given the current trends and predictions, it is likely that the world will continue to warm up at a rate of around 1.3°C per decade, which would put us well above the 2.7°C threshold by the year 2100 if nothing changes. However, there are multiple studies and predictions made on different dates up to June 2025, suggesting that the outcome is not yet certain.

Overall, it appears that the world is headed towards a scenario where global temperatures exceed 1.5°C by 2100, but there is still time for significant action to be taken to avoid this outcome.
