Here's a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome is known is unknown, as it depends on various factors such as technological advancements, funding, and international cooperation. The status quo outcome if nothing changed is unlikely, given the current pace of space exploration and technological advancements.

If the current trend continues, it's uncertain whether Turkey will land humans on the Moon by 2030. However, a sudden breakthrough in propulsion technology or significant increase in investment from the government could accelerate their space program and achieve this ambitious goal earlier than expected.

Experts' expectations and markets are varied, with some predicting success while others are more skeptical. A significant setback or funding cut for space exploration programs could stall progress towards establishing a human settlement on Mars or landing humans on the Moon. On the other hand, breakthroughs in technology or international cooperation could accelerate progress and exceed current predictions.

Unexpected scenarios that result in low outcomes include catastrophic events like asteroid impacts or global economic downturns, which could divert resources away from space exploration. Unexpected high-outcome scenarios include innovative breakthroughs or significant increases in investment that accelerate progress towards establishing human settlements on the Moon or Mars.

Incorporating these rationales, we can create a consistent rationale that considers various factors and uncertainties:

The likelihood of Turkey landing humans on the Moon by 2030 is uncertain, but considering various factors, we can create a consistent rationale that considers uncertainties:

Percentile 10: The uncertainty is high (20-30%), as there are many unknowns and potential setbacks. However, there's also the possibility of breakthroughs or significant increases in investment that could accelerate progress.

Percentile 20: As we approach the midpoint, the probability increases slightly (40-50%) to reflect the possibility of breakthroughs or international cooperation.

Percentile 60: By this point, the likelihood has increased further (70-80%) to account for potential breakthroughs or significant increases in investment.

Percentile 90: The probability is high (90-95%) that Turkey will land humans on the Moon by 2030, reflecting the possibility of breakthroughs, international cooperation, and continued progress towards establishing a human settlement on Mars.
