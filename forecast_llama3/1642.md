Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The world changes slowly most of the time, so it's reasonable to assume that the status quo outcome (no commercial supersonic flight from London to New York in under three hours) will likely persist unless significant advancements are made. Regulatory hurdles and technological challenges will continue to slow progress, making it difficult for supersonic aircraft to operate safely and sustainably.

However, considering the rapid progress being made in supersonic technology and the growing demand for faster travel options, there is a possibility that breakthroughs or significant advancements could alter the timeline. NASA's X-59 project and private companies like Radian Aerospace or Venus Aerospace are making progress towards developing supersonic aircraft capable of traveling at Mach 1.4 while minimizing sonic booms.

Additionally, if governments and regulatory bodies relax or revise their rules regarding supersonic flight over land, it could pave the way for commercial supersonic flights. The development of quieter engines or more efficient designs could also lead to a revised regulatory framework that accommodates commercial supersonic flights.

Ultimately, the outcome will depend on a combination of technological advancements, regulatory frameworks, and public opinion shifts. While the status quo outcome is likely, there are scenarios where significant breakthroughs could lead to alternative outcomes.
