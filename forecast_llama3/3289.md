Here is a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until we know the outcome to this question is significant, with forecasts ranging from 0 years (already knowing) to 15 years (in Forecast 5). However, it's unlikely that all babies will be gene-edited without any advancements in technology or medical breakthroughs.

If current trends continue, gene editing technology will become increasingly refined and efficient, allowing for its widespread adoption. Experts and markets are expecting significant growth in the field, with many predicting moderate to high levels of adoption in the coming decades.

However, unexpected scenarios could impact the outcome, such as a sudden ban on gene editing due to unforeseen ethical concerns or public outcry (Forecast 2), a major breakthrough in alternative disease treatments slowing down adoption (Forecast 4), or a widespread public backlash against gene editing leading to decreased funding and investment (Forecast 5).

On the other hand, an unexpected scenario that could result in a high outcome is if gene editing technology becomes even more advanced and efficient than expected, leading to rapid adoption and significant changes in the way we treat genetic disorders and other conditions.

Ultimately, the future of gene editing technology will depend on a complex interplay of factors, including technological advancements, medical breakthroughs, public perception, and regulatory environments.
