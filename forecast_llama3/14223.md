Here's a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The key to predicting whether a US president who's not a Democrat or Republican will be inaugurated before 2080 is to consider both the status quo outcome and the potential for significant changes in public opinion, political scandals, or external factors. 

Historically, the world tends to change slowly most of the time, which means that the status quo outcome should carry more weight. However, unexpected events or changes in public opinion can also alter the course of events. This is particularly true in the context of presidential elections, where a strong candidate, scandals, or economic trends can significantly influence the outcome.

In this case, it's essential to balance the likelihood of Trump remaining as President (status quo) with the possibility of external factors influencing the election, such as political scandals, public opinion shifts, or unexpected events.
