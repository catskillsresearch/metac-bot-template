Here's a rationale that combines the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to the question is known is relatively short, considering the pace of technological advancements in IVF technology and embryo selection. The status quo outcome, if nothing changed, would likely be continued growth in IVF services driven by demographic trends, increased awareness of reproductive technologies, and the development of more accurate and efficient IVF techniques.

However, a scenario that results in a No outcome could involve significant backlash against eugenics and designer babies, leading to stricter regulations on IVF clinics and embryo screening practices. Alternatively, unforeseen events or changes in societal attitudes could also lead to a decline in the adoption of IVF technology or a shift towards more traditional family-building methods.

On the other hand, if advancements in AI-assisted IVF technology continue to accelerate, we might see the development of more accurate and efficient IVF techniques, making it possible for parents to select embryos with higher IQs or other desirable traits. This could lead to an increase in demand for IVF services and further innovation.

Given these scenarios, I believe that the trend towards increased use of reproductive technologies, driven by demographic changes and societal demands, will continue to shape the future of IVF technology and embryo selection. The weight of evidence suggests that this trend is less likely to be reversed than a scenario where IVF technology becomes more widely adopted.
