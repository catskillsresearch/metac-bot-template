Here's a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The status quo outcome is likely to be "No" for most questions, as the current political climate and investigations will continue without significant changes or conclusions reached. However, it's essential to acknowledge that sudden changes can occur due to new evidence or unforeseen circumstances. New information could emerge or investigations could continue, which could influence the outcome.

A possible scenario that leads to a "No" outcome is if all current investigations and lawsuits conclude without finding any wrongdoing by the individuals involved. This could lead to a status quo outcome where nothing changes. On the other hand, new evidence or previously overlooked information could come to light, leading to a re-examination of the cases and potentially result in charges being filed or convictions.

The time left until the outcome is known varies across questions, but for most, it's still uncertain. The Justice Department has a history of being cautious in its decision-making, and significant changes often require new evidence or unforeseen circumstances.

In considering these scenarios and the weight of the status quo outcome, we can develop a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The likelihood of an investigation or prosecution depends on the emergence of new information or unforeseen circumstances. If nothing changes, the current political climate and investigations will likely continue without significant conclusions being reached. However, if new evidence or previously overlooked information comes to light, it could lead to a re-examination of the cases and potentially result in charges being filed or convictions.

This combined rationale provides a consistent framework for understanding the likelihood of an investigation or prosecution based on the current status quo and potential scenarios that could influence the outcome.
