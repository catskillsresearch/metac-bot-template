Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 6-12 months, allowing for some uncertainty and potential changes in Harvard's financial aid policy. The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be a continuation of Harvard University's financial aid program, which has been trending towards making education more accessible and affordable for students from diverse backgrounds.

If the current trend continued, we might see even more significant changes to their financial aid policy, potentially making it more accessible to a broader range of students. Experts in higher education anticipate that universities will continue to prioritize affordability and accessibility, with many institutions offering generous financial aid packages. Markets are uncertain about the long-term impact on student enrollment and academic programs.

An unexpected scenario that could result in a low outcome is if Harvard University faces significant budget constraints or financial challenges, which might force it to reduce its financial aid program. This could lead to a decrease in students receiving full financial aid. On the other hand, an unexpected scenario that could result in a high outcome is if Harvard University receives a significant donation or grant for its financial aid program, allowing it to increase the number of students receiving full financial aid.

The university's commitment to diversity and inclusivity also plays a crucial role in shaping their financial aid policy. If Harvard continues to prioritize these values, we might see even more generous financial aid packages and expanded access to education for students from lower-income families.
