Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The number of foreign nationals in Mainland China between 2010 and 2030 will likely be influenced by various factors. The status quo outcome would be a continued increase in international travelers crossing China's borders, driven by growth in global trade and economic ties, as well as improvements in travel infrastructure and services.

However, external events such as severe pandemics or widespread travel restrictions could lead to a decline in cross-border travel. On the other hand, sustained economic growth, improved infrastructure, and increased connectivity between countries could drive an increase in international travelers.

Considering that the world changes slowly most of the time, it seems reasonable to expect some continuity in current trends. Nevertheless, it is also important to acknowledge the potential for significant events or disruptions that could impact the number of foreign nationals in Mainland China.

Ultimately, a comprehensive analysis would take into account both the status quo outcome and the possibility of external factors influencing the outcome, as well as the various scenarios that could result in an increase or decrease in international travelers.
