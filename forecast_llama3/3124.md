Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to the question is known depends on various factors such as military decisions, war progression, and logistical constraints. The status quo outcome would be that US Non-Combat Experienced Employees continue to work in their current roles without being sent to the front lines, unless significant changes occur in the Ukrainian Military's priorities or operational requirements.

A scenario that results in a No outcome is one where the Ukrainian military prioritizes sending combat-experienced personnel to the front lines and continues to focus on improving its overall effectiveness. This could lead to a reassessment of recruitment strategies, with a focus on training and retaining existing personnel rather than sending non-combat experienced employees to the front lines.

On the other hand, a scenario that results in a Yes outcome is one where the Ukrainian military faces significant losses or struggles to find sufficient combat-experienced personnel, leading them to decide that sending non-combat experienced employees to the front lines is a necessary measure to maintain troop numbers. This could be driven by a sudden shift in the war's momentum, such as a major Ukrainian victory or a ceasefire agreement, which could lead to a reassessment of military priorities.

The likelihood of US Non-Combat Experienced Employees being sent to the front lines depends on various factors, including the progress of the war, changes in the Ukrainian Military's priorities and operational requirements, and logistical constraints. While there are scenarios where non-combat experienced employees might be deployed, these appear less likely given the current situation and available information. However, it is also possible that significant changes could occur to drive a different outcome.
