Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The cultivated meat market is likely to continue growing at a rapid pace, driven by increasing consumer interest in sustainable and ethical food options, advancements in cellular agriculture technologies, and regulatory approvals. The current trend suggests that the market will reach significant sizes by 2026, potentially exceeding $1.78 billion.

However, there are also factors that could slow down or even reverse this growth, such as regulatory barriers, supply chain disruptions, or unforeseen setbacks in production processes. If these challenges arise, the market size could stagnate at around 5% of well-known QSRs offering cultivated meat products by 2026.

On the other hand, breakthroughs in cellular agriculture technology, combined with increased investment and government support, could drive the adoption rate of lab-grown meat even faster than expected. In this scenario, it's possible that up to 30% of well-known QSRs could offer cultivated meat products by 2026.

The key factors driving growth in the cultivated meat market include increasing consumer demand for sustainable protein sources, advancements in cellular agriculture technologies, and regulatory approvals. However, there are also challenges that could slow down or reverse this growth, such as regulatory barriers, supply chain disruptions, or unforeseen setbacks in production processes. Ultimately, the pace of growth will depend on a combination of these factors, as well as unexpected events that may arise.
