Here is a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to the question is known is uncertain, as some outcomes are already known (e.g., India's GDP doubling in the last 10 years), while others may still be unfolding or uncertain. The status quo outcome if nothing changed is likely that current economic trends and growth rates would continue, with India potentially continuing its strong economic growth momentum driven by factors such as effective policy implementation, business-friendly reforms, and innovative entrepreneurship.

A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome is if India experiences significant disruptions due to internal or external factors, such as widespread power outages, water shortages, or severe weather events, leading to stagnation or decline. On the other hand, a yes outcome could be achieved if India's government implements effective policies and reforms to boost economic growth, such as increasing investments in infrastructure, promoting trade, and fostering innovation.

The key to this rationale is acknowledging that some outcomes are already known, while others may still be unfolding or uncertain. This uncertainty highlights the importance of considering both the status quo outcome and potential scenarios that could result in a different outcome. By weighing these factors, we can develop a more informed understanding of the likelihood of a yes or no outcome.

Note: I've combined the rationales from FORECASTS 1-5 to create a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale.
