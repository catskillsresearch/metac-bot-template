Here is a consistent rationale combining the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome is known is significant, allowing for various factors to influence the result. The status quo outcome, where nothing changes, would likely see nuclear energy capacity remaining relatively stable or increasing slightly due to natural growth. However, there are scenarios that could lead to a "No" outcome, such as sudden disruptions or crises that alter the trajectory of industries and markets.

On the other hand, a "Yes" outcome might arise from continued technological advancements, innovative breakthroughs, or strategic investments in key sectors, driving growth and innovation across various industries. The focus on addressing climate change and reducing greenhouse gas emissions could also lead to increased investment in renewable energy sources, including nuclear power, to meet sustainability goals.

As the world changes slowly most of the time, the status quo outcome would likely be a good starting point for forecasting. However, considering the rapid growth in global energy demand and the increasing focus on renewable energy sources, it's also possible that new technologies or innovations could accelerate the development of nuclear power capacity.

Overall, this rationale suggests that while there are potential challenges and obstacles, the efforts made so far will ultimately lead to a successful outcome. The probability of success is likely influenced by the status quo outcome, where the global economy continues growing at its current pace, with some fluctuations and uncertainties.
