Here's a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The feasibility of faster-than-light communication hinges on significant breakthroughs in our understanding of fundamental physics and/or the development of new technologies. The status quo outcome, where no progress is made in faster-than-light travel, is more likely than not due to the current state of scientific knowledge and technological advancements. However, it's essential to acknowledge the potential for rapid advancements in fields like AI, biotech, and materials science, which might accelerate or alter the pace of breakthroughs in physics and engineering.

The likelihood of a Yes outcome depends on the emergence of significant scientific discoveries or technological innovations that enable faster-than-light travel. This could involve a deeper understanding of quantum mechanics, general relativity, or exotic matter, leading to the creation of stable wormholes or Alcubierre warp drives. A concerted effort by governments, industries, and scientists would be necessary to realize this outcome.

Given the uncertainty surrounding the pace of scientific progress and technological advancements, it's difficult to predict with certainty whether faster-than-light communication will become possible before 2300. However, considering the status quo outcome and the potential for rapid advancements in various fields, a probabilistic assessment could suggest that the possibility of achieving faster-than-light communication is higher than initially thought.

Note: I've tried to combine the rationales from each forecast while ignoring the final predictions. The resulting rationale aims to provide a consistent and comprehensive explanation for the feasibility of faster-than-light communication.
