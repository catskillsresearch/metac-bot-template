Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The development of an AI system that can solve one of the remaining Millennium Prize Problems before July 2025 is a complex task that depends on various factors. On one hand, the current pace of progress in AI research suggests that incremental advancements will continue to be made, but the prospect of achieving true AGI remains elusive. This status quo outcome is likely, given the complexity and uncertainty surrounding the development and deployment of AGI.

On the other hand, breakthroughs in areas such as natural language processing, computer vision, or expert-level reasoning could lead to significant progress and innovation in AI research. The rapid evolution of AI research means that it's possible that we'll see major advancements in the next 1-2 years. However, it's also important to consider the potential roadblocks and challenges that may arise, such as unforeseen technical or ethical issues.

The development of AGI is a multifaceted field that can be affected by many factors, including societal and regulatory changes. While significant progress has been made in recent years, there are still many challenges to overcome before achieving true AGI. The weight I give to the status quo outcome suggests that it's likely that researchers will continue to make incremental advancements, which might eventually lead to the creation of AGI.

Overall, while there is potential for breakthroughs and innovation in AI research, the complexity and uncertainty surrounding the development and deployment of AGI suggest that a "No" outcome is more likely.
