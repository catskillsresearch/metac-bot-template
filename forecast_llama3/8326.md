Here is a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The likelihood of a university-based research group developing the first AGI depends on various factors. Firstly, there is currently no specific information about the future development of AGI, leaving us uncertain about when the outcome will be known (similar to Forecast 1 and 3). Secondly, the status quo outcome would likely be that AGI remains an ongoing area of research with little progress made towards developing a systemwide solution (in line with Forecast 3).

A scenario that results in a No outcome could involve the research group facing significant challenges or setbacks, such as lack of funding or internal conflicts, which might hinder their ability to develop AGI (similar to Forecast 1). Alternatively, if the focus of AI research remains on specific applications rather than general intelligence, the risk associated with AGI development would remain low (in line with Forecast 3).

On the other hand, a scenario that results in a Yes outcome could involve the research group receiving sustained support and funding, as well as a concerted effort to address AGI development through policy changes, consumer education campaigns, and innovative technologies (similar to Forecast 1). Additionally, if the research group is actively seeking new talent and has identified the necessary skills and expertise, it would be more likely that they will make significant progress in developing AGI (in line with Forecast 4).

Overall, while there are uncertainties surrounding the development of AGI, a consistent rationale for assessing the likelihood of a university-based research group being responsible for its development could incorporate factors such as funding support, internal conflicts, and the focus of AI research.
