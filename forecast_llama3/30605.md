Here is a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The world tends to change slowly over time, which suggests that the status quo outcome (Elon Musk remaining the richest person) has a higher likelihood of occurring unless there are significant external factors that affect Tesla's stock or Elon Musk's other ventures. While it is possible for unforeseen circumstances or regulatory changes to impact his net worth, such events are unlikely to occur in the near future.

Moreover, Elon Musk's recent performances with companies like SpaceX and Starlink have been promising, which could further increase his wealth and solidify his position as the world's richest person. Additionally, Tesla's autonomous driving technology has the potential to become a game-changer, leading to increased demand for the company's stock and potentially boosting Elon Musk's net worth.

However, it is also important to consider scenarios that could result in a different outcome, such as market fluctuations or changes in government policies that affect Tesla's performance. Nevertheless, given the slow pace of change and the potential for growth from existing ventures, I believe that the status quo outcome has a relatively high likelihood of occurring.
