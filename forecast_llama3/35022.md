Here's a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual forecast:

The time left until the outcome to this question is known is approximately 1.5 years (considering recent market fluctuations). The status quo outcome if nothing changed would likely be a slight decline or stabilization of the Ibex 35 index, given its natural market fluctuations and the uncertainty surrounding global economic conditions.

There are two main scenarios that could influence the Ibex 35's performance: one resulting in a No outcome (a decline in the index) and another leading to a Yes outcome (an upward trend). The No outcome scenario involves significant external shocks, such as severe global economic downturns or major financial crises, which would likely cause widespread investor pessimism and a subsequent decline in stock prices. In contrast, the Yes outcome scenario assumes sustained economic growth, stability in global markets, or breakthroughs in various industries, leading to increased investor confidence and a subsequent rise in stock prices.

As a good forecaster, it is reasonable to give extra weight to the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Additionally, considering recent market fluctuations, there is still a chance for the index to reach or surpass certain levels, making it more likely that the current trend will continue rather than experience a drastic change.

Overall, the likelihood of the Ibex 35 reaching new heights by the end of the year is higher due to the assumption that global markets will remain stable, with some potential ups and downs along the way.
