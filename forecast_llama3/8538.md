Based on the individual rationales, here is a consistent and comprehensive rationale that incorporates the best of each:

The time left until the outcome to the question is known: As we approach 2050, there are approximately 25 years left before the outcome of this question is known.

Status quo outcome if nothing changed: If nothing changes, it's likely that electric vehicles will continue to gain traction and market share, driven by government incentives, decreasing battery costs, and growing environmental concerns. A reasonable estimate for the status quo outcome might be around 20-25% of US car sales being electric vehicles.

Outcome if the current trend continued: If the current trend continues, with increasing adoption rates and declining battery costs, it's possible that electric vehicles could reach 30-40% market share by 2050. Some countries may implement stricter emissions regulations, incentivizing EV adoption even faster than expected.

Experts' expectations and markets: Many experts and market analysts predict that electric vehicles will continue to gain popularity and account for a significant portion of new car sales. Some projections suggest that as much as 50-70% of US car sales could be electric vehicles by the mid-2020s, with some countries reaching even higher shares.

Unexpected scenario resulting in low outcome: An unexpected scenario that might result in a lower outcome is if there's a significant increase in fuel prices or a shift in consumer preferences away from EVs, leading to slower adoption rates. This could bring the percentage of US car sales that are electric vehicles down to around 10-15%.

Unexpected scenario resulting in high outcome: Another unexpected scenario that could result in a higher outcome is rapid advancements in battery technology, making electric vehicles even more affordable and desirable. If such breakthroughs occur, it's possible that electric vehicle adoption could accelerate even faster than expected, leading to significantly higher market shares by 2050.

With these factors considered, here is the final probability assessment:

Percentile 10: 15-20%
Percentile 20: 18-22%
Percentile 40: 25-30%
Percentile 60: 35-40%
Percentile 80: 45-50%
Percentile 90: 55-60%

This rationale incorporates the best of each individual forecast, considering both the time left until the outcome is known and the various factors that could influence electric vehicle adoption.
