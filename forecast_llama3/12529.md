Here's a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome is known is relatively short, with only a few months or years remaining before King Charles III's health issues potentially force him to abdicate. However, the uncertainty surrounding his cancer diagnosis and treatment makes it difficult to predict exactly when this might happen.

The status quo outcome would be for King Charles III to continue ruling as monarch, with Prince William taking on more responsibilities but not necessarily assuming the throne immediately. This is a likely outcome given the king's determination to maintain the crown until his death and Prince William's lack of urgency in seeking an ascension.

However, there are scenarios that could result in a No outcome, such as King Charles III's health improving significantly or Prince William becoming more involved in royal duties without necessarily taking over as king. On the other hand, if King Charles III's ongoing health issues continue to affect his ability to perform his royal duties, leading to speculation about his potential abdication and Prince William being groomed to take over as king sooner rather than later, it could lead to a Yes outcome.

Considering the weight of the status quo outcome, it is more likely for King Charles III to continue ruling without abdication. However, there are factors at play that suggest he may not be willing to leave the throne until his death, such as his determination to maintain the crown and Prince William's lack of urgency in seeking an ascension.

Moreover, the possibility of a sudden improvement in King Charles' health, followed by his continued involvement in royal duties without any signs of abdication, could also lead to a No outcome. Additionally, if there is no major controversy or crisis within the monarchy that would prompt him to step down, it may not happen either.

Overall, while there are various scenarios at play, the status quo outcome seems more likely, but there are factors that suggest an abdication might still occur.
