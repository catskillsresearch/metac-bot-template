Here is a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The effective US tariff rate on goods being imported into the United States at the end of 2026 will be influenced by various factors, including the time left until the outcome is known, the status quo outcome if nothing changed, and the current trend. If the current trend continues, there is a possibility that the effective tariff rate could increase due to new tariffs on specific products or industries.

Experts and markets are expecting a slight slowdown in economic growth due to trade tensions and tariffs implemented by the US government, with some predicting GDP growth could slow down to around 2% or lower. However, unexpected scenarios such as an improvement in US-China relations or a global recession could result in a lower or higher effective tariff rate than expected.

The US economy is likely to continue growing at a moderate pace, but the impact of tariffs on international trade and economic growth cannot be ruled out. A decline in global economic growth or a major trade conflict with China could exacerbate the negative effects of tariffs, leading to a higher-than-expected decrease in GDP. On the other hand, an unexpected surge in global economic growth could reduce the negative effects of tariffs.

Overall, the effective US tariff rate at the end of 2026 is likely to be influenced by a combination of these factors and could range from around 5% to over 15%.
