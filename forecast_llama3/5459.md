Here's a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The likelihood of psilocybin being removed from Schedule I List before 2036 depends on the pace and direction of changes in laws and regulations regarding drug policy. The status quo outcome, where current laws remain unchanged, is more likely given the slow and incremental nature of legislative changes. However, there are scenarios where a Yes outcome could occur, such as increased public awareness and support for psilocybin legalization, advancements in research demonstrating its therapeutic benefits, or shifts in political priorities.

One factor that could contribute to a Yes outcome is the ongoing discussion and debate around drug policy reform, which may lead to a reevaluation of the scheduling status of psilocybin. Additionally, the emergence of strong scientific evidence highlighting the potential therapeutic benefits of psilocybin could shift public opinion and influence lawmakers' decisions.

On the other hand, the DEA's continued denial of requests for legal access to psilocybin, as well as concerns over public health and safety, could maintain the status quo outcome. Moreover, anti-drug advocacy groups may continue to emphasize the risks associated with psilocybin use, further solidifying its illegal status.

Overall, while there are scenarios where a Yes outcome could occur, the likelihood of significant changes in drug policy is uncertain. As such, the probability of psilocybin being removed from Schedule I List before 2036 is still relatively low.
