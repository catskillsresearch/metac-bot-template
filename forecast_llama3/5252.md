Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to this question is approximately 2 years and 4 months, giving AOC a significant window for her popularity and momentum to grow or decline. The status quo outcome is that AOC is currently considered a strong contender for the Democratic Party's presidential nomination, with some polls suggesting she could be the nominee. 

A scenario that results in a No outcome could be if AOC faces significant backlash from moderate Democrats and establishment figures within the party, causing her to lose support and ultimately not receive the nomination. This could happen if her far-left views and socialist ideology are perceived as too extreme for general election voters.

On the other hand, a scenario that results in a Yes outcome is if AOC continues to build momentum among progressive voters and successfully appeals to a broader range of Democrats. Her association with Bernie Sanders' national network of socialist activists might also contribute to her momentum. Additionally, some moderate Democrats may come to accept or even support her candidacy due to her perceived authenticity and ability to energize the party's grassroots.

Considering these factors, it seems that AOC's popularity and momentum are key indicators of her chances of becoming the Democratic nominee. Her ability to build on her existing base and appeal to a broader range of voters will be crucial in determining her outcome.
