Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 3 months and 2 weeks (as of today). The status quo outcome if nothing changed is that the US stock market remains open, as it typically operates without any major holidays on June 14th. A sudden, unexpected event such as a major financial crisis or a severe pandemic could lead to widespread panic and closure of the US stock market for an extended period. On the other hand, sustained economic growth, low inflation rates, and stable global conditions could lead to continued market confidence, resulting in the US stock market remaining open with minimal disruptions.

Given that market trends tend to persist until there is a major catalyst for change, it's likely that the status quo outcome will prevail unless an extraordinary event or crisis occurs. However, it's also important to consider alternative scenarios, such as national emergencies or unexpected events, which could lead to the closure of markets and government offices.

Overall, while it's difficult to predict with certainty what might happen in 2020, it's likely that the status quo outcome will prevail unless an extraordinary event or crisis occurs.
