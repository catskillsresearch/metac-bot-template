Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 2-3 years, considering Elon Musk's previous statements and SpaceX's plans for sending humans to Mars. The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be that Elon Musk does not personally go to Mars as part of the SpaceX mission, aligning with current trends and priorities. However, a scenario that results in a Yes outcome could be if Musk decides to prioritize this project over other initiatives or makes the trip as part of a publicity stunt or to demonstrate the feasibility and safety of the SpaceX technology for human travel.

The challenges and risks associated with sending humans to Mars are significant, but breakthroughs in areas like propulsion technology, radiation shielding, and life support systems, combined with sufficient funding and government support, could lead to a successful mission. On the other hand, setbacks, delays, or changes in Musk's priorities or circumstances could result in a No outcome.

Ultimately, while there are some potential risks and challenges that could impact SpaceX's timeline, it is more likely that Elon Musk will not personally go to Mars as part of the SpaceX mission, given his current focus on developing technology for space travel rather than personally embarking on missions. However, it is still possible that he may make the trip if he decides to prioritize this project or uses it as a publicity stunt.

This rationale provides a balanced view of the potential outcomes and challenges involved in Elon Musk's decision to personally go to Mars.
