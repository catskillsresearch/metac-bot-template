Here is a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to this question is known is approximately 2-5 years, which suggests that short-term trends and factors will likely influence Hungary's fertility rate in the near future.

Currently, the status quo outcome if nothing changed would be a continued decline in fertility rates, potentially reaching around 1.3 children per woman. This decline is driven by various social, economic, and cultural factors that have been contributing to low birth rates over time.

If the current trend continues, the fertility rate could further decline due to factors such as aging populations and decreasing birth rates. However, experts and market analysts generally expect Hungary's fertility rate to remain stable or continue declining slightly in the short term, with some optimism that policies aimed at increasing birth rates may show positive results in the longer term.

An unexpected scenario that could result in a low outcome is a significant economic downturn or financial crisis, which could lead to increased uncertainty and reduced fertility rates. On the other hand, an unexpected scenario that could result in a high outcome is a major breakthrough in family planning policies or a widespread cultural shift towards larger families, leading to an increase in fertility rates.

Overall, considering both short-term trends and potential long-term factors, it appears that Hungary's children per woman in 2031 will likely be around 1.2-1.3 children per woman, with some uncertainty surrounding the exact outcome.
