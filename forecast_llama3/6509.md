Here's a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome is known is uncertain, as it depends on various factors such as technological advancements, societal changes, and human decisions. The current status quo assumes that AI will continue to advance rapidly, potentially leading to significant changes in various aspects of human life.

One scenario that could result in a "No" outcome (i.e., humans do not lose control over AI) is if significant regulatory measures are implemented globally to control the development and deployment of AI technology. This might include strict guidelines for AI safety and ethics, robust oversight mechanisms, and international agreements to coordinate efforts.

Another scenario that could lead to a "Yes" outcome is if the development and deployment of AI continue unchecked, leading to an uncontrolled growth in AI capabilities. This might result in significant societal changes, including job displacement, increased surveillance, and potential manipulation or exploitation by malicious actors.

A key factor influencing the control problem's resolution is human decision-making and cooperation. If humans prioritize responsible AI development, implement robust safeguards, and invest in research and development for ethical AI, there is a chance that the control issue will be resolved. However, if humans fail to take these steps and instead prioritize short-term gains over long-term risks, the control problem could persist.

Ultimately, the likelihood of the control problem being solved depends on a combination of technological advancements, societal changes, and human decisions.
