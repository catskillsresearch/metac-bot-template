Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The current state of AI development and regulation is fragmented across countries and regions, with various initiatives and organizations addressing specific aspects of AI. This status quo outcome is likely to continue unless there are compelling reasons or circumstances that drive change. One possible scenario leading to a No outcome is if AI becomes increasingly decentralized, with individual nations or companies developing their own autonomous systems without international coordination. This could lead to a lack of standardized regulations and oversight, making it more challenging for an international AI agency to be established.

However, there are also scenarios under which an international AI agency could be established. For example, growing recognition of the need for global cooperation on AI development and regulation could drive governments and organizations to come together and establish such an agency. This could be driven by concerns about AI's impact on jobs, security, and human rights, as well as the potential benefits of AI-driven innovation and economic growth.

Ultimately, the likelihood of an international AI agency being established depends on the interplay between these factors. While the status quo outcome is likely to continue unless there are compelling reasons or circumstances that drive change, there are also scenarios under which cooperation and establishment of such an agency could occur.
