Here's a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome is known is approximately 3-4 years, considering the current trends and macroeconomic indicators. If nothing changes, India's GDP would likely continue growing steadily, potentially reaching around USD 5-6 trillion by 2028, driven by factors like digital economy expansion, industrial growth, and financial discipline.

Experts and markets are optimistic about India's economic prospects, with many predicting it will become the third-largest economy by 2028. However, unexpected scenarios could lead to a lower outcome, such as an unforeseen global economic downturn or trade tensions significantly impacting India's exports and industrial growth. On the other hand, significant breakthroughs in Indian industries like IT, pharma, or manufacturing, combined with effective government policies and investments, could lead to an unexpectedly high GDP outcome.

To account for unknown unknowns, it is essential to consider both optimistic and pessimistic scenarios. A consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale would be:

Time left until the outcome is known: Approximately 3-4 years, considering current trends and macroeconomic indicators.

Status quo outcome if nothing changed: India's GDP could continue growing steadily, potentially reaching around USD 5-6 trillion by 2028, driven by factors like digital economy expansion, industrial growth, and financial discipline.

Outcome if the current trend continued: Experts and markets predict that India will become the third-largest economy by 2028, with a projected GDP of USD 5.7 trillion or more.

Unexpected low outcome scenario: An unforeseen global economic downturn or trade tensions significantly impacting India's exports and industrial growth could lead to a lower GDP outcome.

Unexpected high outcome scenario: Significant breakthroughs in Indian industries like IT, pharma, or manufacturing, combined with effective government policies and investments, could lead to an unexpectedly high GDP outcome.

By considering these factors, we can develop a more informed and nuanced forecast that takes into account both the likely and unlikely scenarios.
