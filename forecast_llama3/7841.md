Here is the combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 5 years, considering the timeframe mentioned in some articles (e.g., reaching a per capita income of over $20,000 by 2047) and the potential for significant changes or disruptions to occur within this timeframe. The status quo outcome if nothing changed would likely be continued economic growth and global emergence for India, with some fluctuations but no significant shocks or disruptions.

A scenario that results in a "No" outcome could involve significant economic downturns or structural issues that hinder India's growth prospects, such as prolonged periods of low growth, high inflation, or corruption. Alternatively, unforeseen factors like global recessions, regional conflicts, or internal political instability could also lead to stagnation or decline.

On the other hand, a scenario that results in a "Yes" outcome would involve continued focus on renewable energy sources, policies aimed at reducing India's carbon footprint, and effective implementation of reforms. This could lead to significant increases in non-fossil fuel energy, meeting goals under the Paris G20 agreements, and even surpassing $20,000 per capita income by 2047.

The likelihood of a "Yes" outcome is dependent on various factors, including India's ability to implement policies that promote economic growth, innovation, and entrepreneurship. The country's success in diversifying its economy, building strong relationships with other nations, and capitalizing on emerging opportunities like green energy and technology could also contribute to its global prominence.
