Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The necessary computational power to replicate human mental capability will depend on various factors, including advancements in neuromorphic computing, artificial intelligence, and cognitive modeling. As interest in these areas continues to grow, it's likely that breakthroughs will be made, leading to increased capabilities.

However, there are also potential setbacks or failures that could impact the development of neuromorphic computing. Unforeseen technical challenges, regulatory hurdles, or societal concerns about the ethics of advanced AI could slow progress or even reverse trends.

Despite these uncertainties, experts in the field of artificial intelligence, computer science, and neuroscience remain optimistic about the potential of neuromorphic computing to augment human brain functions. Some experts predict widespread adoption across various industries and applications, while others are more cautious due to the complexity and limitations of current technology.

The trend of increasing pressure on attention and mental fatigue due to excessive information intake and digital distractions is likely to continue unless significant changes occur in societal habits or technological innovations. This could lead to a decrease in overall cognitive abilities and a decline in the ability of humans to adapt to new information.

On the other hand, unexpected breakthroughs or innovations could significantly accelerate progress and widespread adoption of neuromorphic computing. For example, major advances in materials science, nanotechnology, or biotechnology could make it possible to create more efficient and effective neuromorphic devices.

Ultimately, the necessary computational power to replicate human mental capability will depend on a complex interplay of technological, societal, and market forces. While there are many uncertainties, experts and markets remain optimistic about the potential for AI-powered solutions to augment human brain functions and improve cognitive abilities.
