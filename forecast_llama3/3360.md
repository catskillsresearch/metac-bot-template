Here's a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The key factor to consider when evaluating whether ≥8% of U.S. adults will self-report following a vegetarian diet by 2036 is the status quo outcome. The world changes slowly most of the time, so it's likely that current trends and patterns will continue unless significant and sustained efforts are made to address the root causes of obesity.

The urbanization trend is expected to continue, driving increased consumption of processed and high-calorie foods, which could exacerbate the issue. Additionally, the lack of effective policies or interventions to address the problem may hinder any potential progress towards a healthier lifestyle.

However, it's also important to consider the possibility of significant changes in global food systems, diets, and physical activity levels. Widespread adoption of healthy eating habits, increased investment in nutrition education, and development of more accessible and affordable healthy food options could lead to a decline in obesity rates.

Ultimately, the probability of ≥8% of U.S. adults self-reporting following a vegetarian diet by 2036 depends on the balance between these factors.

### Probability: 85%
