Here's a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome is known is approximately 10 years, considering the French government has announced its new energy strategy for 2035. The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be the current trend of increasing renewable energy sources and reducing dependence on fossil fuels.

If the current trend continues, France will likely make significant progress in reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 2035, with a focus on nuclear power and renewable energies. Experts and markets expect France to make progress towards its energy goals, but they also caution that achieving these targets will require significant investments in renewable energy infrastructure and grid modernization.

An unexpected scenario that could result in a low outcome is a significant delay or cancellation of planned nuclear power plants, leading to increased dependence on fossil fuels and higher emissions. Alternatively, an unexpected scenario that could result in a high outcome is a rapid and sustained increase in clean energy production, driven by advances in technology, changes in government policy, or shifts in public opinion.

The pace of regulatory changes and investment decisions will also play a crucial role in determining the outcome. A global economic downturn or significant increase in policy risks could lead to reduced investment in renewable energy infrastructure and slower growth rates, resulting in a lower outcome. On the other hand, breakthroughs in energy storage technology or rapid declines in solar panel costs could accelerate the transition to renewable energies and result in even more significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.

Overall, the key factors influencing the outcome are the pace of regulatory changes, investment decisions, technological advancements, and shifts in public opinion.
