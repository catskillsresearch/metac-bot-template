Here's a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The likelihood of fewer than 375M people living in extreme poverty by 2030 depends on various factors. The status quo outcome is likely to be continued high levels of poverty and economic stagnation, as well as ongoing challenges related to climate change, global inequality, and other systemic issues. However, there are scenarios where significant progress or breakthroughs could lead to a reduction in extreme poverty.

A scenario that results in a "No" outcome would involve sustained economic growth, increased investments in education and healthcare, widespread adoption of climate-resilient practices, and coordinated efforts from governments, international organizations, and the private sector. This would require a combination of rapid and sustained economic growth, significant investments in human capital and infrastructure, and successful implementation of policies aimed at addressing climate change.

On the other hand, a scenario that results in a "Yes" outcome could involve prolonged economic stagnation, limited investment in human capital and infrastructure, continued climate-related disruptions, and ongoing challenges related to low-income economies experiencing slow economic growth, high levels of corruption, and limited access to education and healthcare. This would lead to a higher likelihood of 375M people or more remaining in extreme poverty by 2030.

Given the slow pace of change in many developing economies, it's likely that the status quo outcome will persist without significant changes or interventions. However, there is also a possibility of breakthroughs or significant progress that could lead to a reduction in extreme poverty.
