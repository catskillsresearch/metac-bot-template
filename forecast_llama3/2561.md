Here's a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The timeline for achieving General Artificial Intelligence (AGI) is uncertain and subject to various factors, such as technological advancements, market trends, and company decisions. However, considering the current trends in the XR industry, where many companies are investing heavily in metaverse and AR/VR technologies, it's likely that Meta will continue to invest in its metaverse vision.

The pursuit of AGI will remain a top priority for many companies, governments, and experts worldwide, driving progress toward achieving this goal. The weight of expert opinions, including those from the Future of Humanity Institute, suggests that most predictors expect AGI achievement beyond 2030.

However, it's also possible that significant breakthroughs are made in understanding human consciousness or neural networks, potentially pushing back the expected achievement date. Alternatively, unforeseen technological advancements or new discoveries could accelerate the pace of progress in AI, leading to widespread consensus among experts that General Artificial Intelligence will be achieved by a certain date, possibly even sooner than 2030.

In conclusion, while it's difficult to predict the exact timing of AGI development, considering the current trends and expert opinions, as well as the possibility of significant breakthroughs or setbacks, it seems likely that Meta will continue to invest in its metaverse vision and make progress toward achieving General Artificial Intelligence.
