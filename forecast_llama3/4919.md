Here's a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

A consistent approach to considering multiple scenarios is essential when making predictions about complex issues like deworming programs. A good starting point is to acknowledge the status quo outcome, which assumes continued momentum behind these initiatives. This is because many children will still receive deworming tablets unless there are significant changes in global priorities or funding allocation away from public health initiatives.

However, it's also important to consider potential variations or deviations from this outcome, such as regional challenges or successes. For instance, some regions may experience hiccups in their deworming efforts due to conflict, corruption, or lack of resources, leading to a failure to reach target populations and ultimately resulting in no significant impact on the prevalence of intestinal worms.

On the other hand, widespread adoption of deworming campaigns, combined with effective resource allocation, targeted interventions, and community engagement, could lead to a significant reduction in the prevalence of intestinal worms, improving overall public health outcomes. This scenario highlights the importance of continued efforts by governments, NGOs, and healthcare organizations to expand their deworming initiatives.

Ultimately, a balanced view that takes into account both the status quo outcome and potential variations or deviations is essential for making an informed prediction about whether any of GiveWell's top charities will perform mass deworming as their primary intervention at the end of 2025.
