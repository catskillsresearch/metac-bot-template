Here's a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The status quo outcome is likely to be the most plausible scenario for Russian territory being reduced by at least 1% before 2040. This is because global trends and international relations suggest that borders tend to remain relatively stable, with minor adjustments or territorial disputes occurring occasionally.

However, it's also important to consider potential scenarios that could lead to a change in the outcome. For instance, significant macroeconomic shocks, such as deep recessions or sharp declines in global commodity prices, could lead to a loss of jobs and income for many Russians, potentially resulting in poverty rates increasing rather than decreasing. Additionally, corruption and inefficiencies in social welfare systems could hinder the effectiveness of anti-poverty programs.

On the other hand, scenarios that result in a reduction in poverty rates include continued investment in education and infrastructure, as well as targeted social programs and effective policy implementation. Furthermore, significant increases in job opportunities, especially for low-skilled workers, could also contribute to reducing poverty.

Overall, while the status quo outcome is likely, it's essential to consider both positive and negative scenarios that could lead to changes in Russian territory before 2040.
