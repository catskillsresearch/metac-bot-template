Here is a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 6 months, considering recent trends and available data. The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be a relatively stable participation rate, potentially around 54.8%. If current trends continue, there may be a slight decrease in the global participation rate, potentially reaching around 53-54.5%. Experts and markets are generally pessimistic about the future, considering factors like economic instability or technological advancements that could impact young people's participation in the labor market.

An unexpected low outcome scenario could be a significant economic downturn or global recession, leading to an increase in joblessness among young people, causing their participation rate to drop sharply. On the other hand, an unexpected high outcome scenario could be innovative industries and job opportunities emerging, potentially driving up the overall participation rate.

The rationale also considers that experts and markets may have varying opinions on this topic, with some expecting a decline in participation rates while others predict a stable or improving situation.
