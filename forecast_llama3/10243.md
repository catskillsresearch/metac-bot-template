Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The status quo outcome, where humanity continues to exist on Earth, is the most likely scenario. This is because human societies have demonstrated resilience in adapting to changing circumstances throughout history. Additionally, there are many factors at play that could lead to humanity's extinction, such as climate change or pandemics, but these can be mitigated through collective action and technological advancements.

However, there are also external factors that could lead to humanity's demise, such as catastrophic events like asteroid impacts or supervolcanic eruptions. The likelihood of such events is difficult to estimate, but they are possible and would have significant consequences for human survival.

The development of advanced technologies could be a key factor in determining whether humanity survives or becomes extinct. If we prioritize short-term gains over long-term sustainability, it's possible that our species could face a high risk of extinction due to climate change, pandemics, or other global challenges.

On the other hand, if we continue to evolve and adapt to our environment, potentially developing sustainable energy sources, advanced biotechnology, or artificial environments, it's possible that humanity could survive in the long term.
