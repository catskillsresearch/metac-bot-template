Here's a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The most likely scenario is that the status quo will prevail, with no significant changes in the global security landscape or international relations leading to the development of nuclear weapons by non-state actors. This is because the current international norms and agreements against nuclear proliferation are still in place, and there has been a trend towards increased cooperation and diplomacy among nations.

However, there are certain scenarios that could lead to a departure from this status quo outcome. For instance, if regional or global tensions escalate, leading to an increase in instability and conflict, it is possible that countries may feel compelled to develop nuclear capabilities as a means of deterrence or self-defense. Additionally, the proliferation of advanced technologies and the rise of new players on the global stage could create opportunities for non-state actors to acquire nuclear weapons.

Despite these potential risks, it is still important to recognize the importance of international cooperation and diplomacy in preventing the spread of nuclear weapons. This includes robust export controls, effective monitoring mechanisms, and sustained efforts to address security concerns through dialogue and negotiation.

Overall, while there are certainly challenges and uncertainties on the horizon, the most likely scenario remains one where the status quo prevails, and nuclear weapons development is not a significant concern in the near future.
