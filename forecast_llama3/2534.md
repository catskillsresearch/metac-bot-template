Here's a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The world has a tendency to change slowly, with global events unfolding gradually over time. This slow pace of change suggests that the status quo outcome - no third world war - is more likely. However, there are many complex variables at play, and unexpected events can occur. 

One possible scenario for a No outcome is if international cooperation and diplomacy lead to significant progress on pressing global issues like climate change and security concerns. This could involve the establishment of new global institutions or agreements that promote transparency, accountability, and trust among nations.

On the other hand, a series of unfortunate events could unfold, leading to a Yes outcome. For instance, tensions between major powers could escalate due to conflicting interests, territorial disputes, or ideological differences. The conflict could spread from a single region to multiple fronts, involving nuclear weapons and potentially even space-based warfare.

While there are risks and challenges ahead, the slow pace of change and ongoing efforts to build international cooperation and address pressing global issues suggest that the status quo outcome is still the most likely scenario.
