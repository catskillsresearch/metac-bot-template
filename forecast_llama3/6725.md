Here is a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The likelihood of a large American city fully abolishing its police department before 2035 depends on various factors. Firstly, the status quo outcome, where the police department continues to operate as usual, is more likely due to the inertia of established institutions and societal norms. However, this status quo can be disrupted by unforeseen events or systemic issues that prompt calls for reform.

One such scenario could involve persistent allegations of corruption, excessive force, or racial bias within the police department, leading to widespread public outcry and demands for fundamental change. Alternatively, a major incident (e.g., a fatal shooting or mass protest) could spark a city-wide movement calling for significant reforms or even abolition.

On the other hand, a scenario that results in no outcome (i.e., the police department remains intact) could involve factors such as stable crime rates, effective community engagement, and satisfactory accountability mechanisms. In this case, the city's residents and officials might be satisfied with the performance of the police department, leading to no significant changes.

Ultimately, the likelihood of abolition depends on the balance between these two scenarios. While there are valid concerns about animal welfare, public safety, and accountability, it is also important to consider the potential consequences of abolishing a police department, including the potential loss of public services and increased crime rates.

Therefore, while some events or issues could prompt calls for reform, the likelihood of a large American city fully abolishing its police department before 2035 remains relatively low.
