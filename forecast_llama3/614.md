Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The status quo outcome suggests that many European countries will continue to experience a decline in population by 2100, driven by low fertility rates and aging populations. However, it's essential to consider alternative scenarios that could lead to different outcomes.

One possible scenario is significant changes in government policies or societal attitudes towards family planning and migration, which could lead to an increase in birth rates and offset the decline. Another scenario is continued high levels of population growth in countries like Nigeria, Pakistan, and Indonesia, driven by factors such as improved healthcare, increased access to education, and changes in social norms around family planning.

It's also important to acknowledge that demographic trends tend to persist unless significant changes occur, which suggests that there may be a decline in birth rates globally. However, it's not impossible for there to be a global shift towards increased fertility rates, resulting in an increase in population growth and reversing the current decline.

Ultimately, predicting whether there will be a vegan country by 2100 requires considering both the status quo outcome and potential alternative scenarios that could lead to different outcomes. While some factors may contribute to increased fertility rates or changes in societal attitudes towards animal agriculture, it's unclear what specific events or circumstances would need to occur for these changes to materialize.

This combined rationale takes into account the possibility of significant changes in government policies, societal attitudes, and demographic trends, while also acknowledging the potential for sudden breakthroughs or unforeseen events that could impact the outcome.
