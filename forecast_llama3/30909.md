Here's a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to the question is known is relatively short, with most data already available. This suggests that any changes in Google's search market share will likely be based on recent trends and developments.

If nothing changed, Google would maintain its dominant position with a market share above 90%. However, there are scenarios where this could change. A significant improvement in AI-powered search engines like ChatGPT Search and Perplexity could lead to users seeking alternative options, potentially causing Google's market share to decline. Additionally, if Google fails to adapt to changing user preferences and the rise of AI-powered search engines, it may struggle to maintain its dominance.

On the other hand, if Google continues to innovate and improve its search engine capabilities, it may be able to maintain its dominant position. The company's strong brand and user base provide a foundation for maintaining market share. Furthermore, if competitors like Microsoft Bing or other AI-powered search engines fail to deliver comparable search results, users might not abandon Google.

Overall, the likelihood of Google's search market share dropping below 85% in 2025 depends on the pace of innovation and adaptation by both Google and its competitors. While there are scenarios where Google could maintain its dominant position, there is also a reasonable chance that AI-powered search engines could gain traction and erode Google's market share.

### Probability: 65%
