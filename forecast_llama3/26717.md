Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The status quo outcome is often a good indicator of what might happen, as companies and individuals tend to maintain their trajectory unless significant external factors intervene. In many cases, things don't change much, so the status quo outcome would be "No" or a continuation of current trends.

However, there are also scenarios that could result in a positive outcome. Advances in medical technology, changes in societal attitudes, and shifts in market conditions can all contribute to increased possibilities for life extension treatment. Similarly, regulatory frameworks and laws can have a significant impact on the accessibility and implementation of life-extending treatments.

In the case of AGI's Lynn Lake project, the company's announced plans to extend the mine life and enhance economics suggest that they are likely to continue moving forward with their expansion plans unless unforeseen challenges or external factors intervene. Similarly, the oncological oblivion law in Spain has already had an impact on cancer survivors' access to financial services, and clarification on the right to oncological oblivion could further solidify its effectiveness.

Ultimately, while there is always uncertainty surrounding any outcome, considering both the status quo outcome and potential scenarios that could result in a positive or negative outcome can provide valuable insights into what might happen.
