Here's a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The likelihood of mind uploading happening before AGI depends on the pace and nature of technological advancements in relevant fields, such as neuroscience, cognitive psychology, computer science, and artificial intelligence. The status quo outcome is uncertain progress towards AGI development, with no significant breakthroughs or widespread adoption expected in the near future.

However, it's also possible that rapid innovations or breakthroughs could accelerate the development of mind uploading technology. Factors such as advancements in brain-computer interfaces, quantum computing, and advanced algorithms could contribute to the creation of a functional "mind uploading" technology.

The likelihood of significant progress towards mind uploading is higher if there are compelling needs or incentives driving research and innovation in related fields. For instance, breakthroughs in understanding human consciousness, cognitive psychology, or neuroscience could lead to the development of mind uploading technology.

On the other hand, the lack of significant advancements in these areas could hinder the development of AGI and, subsequently, mind uploading technology. The pace of technological progress is often gradual, with most advancements occurring over time rather than suddenly.

Considering these factors, it's essential to weigh the likelihood of uncertain progress towards AGI development against the possibility of breakthroughs or innovations that could accelerate the development of mind uploading technology.
