Here is a final consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to the question is known is considerable, as we are still decades away from reaching 2050. The current trend or status quo outcome would likely continue, with Nigeria's population growth rate remaining high. A scenario where Nigeria implements effective family planning policies and education campaigns could lead to a decrease in its population growth rate, resulting in a lower projection by 2050.

On the other hand, another possible scenario is that Nigeria's population continues to grow rapidly due to factors such as high fertility rates, limited access to education and healthcare, and economic stagnation. This would likely result in a higher population projection by 2050.

Given the slow pace of change in demographics, it is reasonable to put extra weight on the status quo outcome. The data suggests that Nigeria's population will continue growing at its current pace unless significant improvements are made in family planning, education, and economic opportunities for its citizens.

Therefore, it is likely that Nigeria's population will reach or exceed 400 million by 2050 if current trends continue.
