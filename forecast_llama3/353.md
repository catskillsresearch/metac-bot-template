Here's a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to the question is uncertain, as it depends on various factors and uncertainties. The status quo outcome if nothing changed is that someone born before a certain year (let's say 1985) has not yet lived to be 150 years old, given the scientific consensus on the maximum human lifespan and the lack of conclusive evidence supporting claims of supercentenarians.

A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome is if human aging remains a complex process influenced by multiple factors, including genetics, lifestyle, and environmental conditions. This would likely result in no significant increase in human lifespan, with people living to their typical life expectancy. In this scenario, the physiological resilience of the body would continue to decline with age, making it difficult for people to live beyond the established biological limit.

On the other hand, a brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome is if advances in biotechnology, regenerative medicine, and cellular reprogramming lead to breakthroughs in understanding and combating aging. This could result in significant increases in human lifespan, allowing people to live longer and healthier lives.

Furthermore, societal and lifestyle factors, such as better healthcare access, healthier habits, and stress management, might also contribute to increased lifespans. Additionally, medical advancements in fields like cancer treatment or age-related disease research might enable people born before a certain year to live longer than expected.

Overall, the likelihood of someone born before 2001 living to be 150 years old depends on various factors, including scientific breakthroughs and societal developments.
