Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome is known is relatively long, with most of the time already passed. The status quo outcome would be for there to be no significant changes in monetary policy and interest rates to remain stable. However, unexpected changes in economic indicators could lead to a decrease in interest rates if inflation rises unexpectedly.

On the other hand, if the economy continues to grow steadily and inflation remains under control, the Federal Reserve may decide to maintain or even increase interest rates to prevent overheating. The likelihood of a new Federal Open Markets Committee member being appointed before any member's term is over and before January 20, 2029, depends on unforeseen events or significant economic changes.

The possibility of unforeseen events or shifts in the global economy could lead to the appointment of a new committee member. However, considering that the world changes slowly most of the time, it is more likely for the status quo outcome to prevail. Nevertheless, there are scenarios where unexpected changes could lead to the need for a new Federal Reserve Bank or a change in monetary policy.

Overall, the likelihood of a new Federal Open Markets Committee member being appointed before January 20, 2029, depends on unforeseen events or significant economic changes that may arise in the coming years.
