Here's a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The status quo outcome, where China does not control at least half of Taiwan before 2050, is likely due to the historical tensions between China and Taiwan and the current diplomatic efforts by both sides. However, there are factors that could lead to a change in the status quo.

A significant shift in global power dynamics, such as the emergence of a new superpower or a major realignment of international alliances, could potentially reduce China's influence over Taiwan and lead to a less aggressive approach from Beijing. Additionally, a prolonged economic downturn or stagnation in China could impact its ability to exert pressure on Taiwan.

On the other hand, if China's economy continues to grow rapidly, allowing it to invest heavily in its military capabilities, and if the United States is distracted by other global issues or unable to effectively respond to an invasion, China may feel emboldened to launch a military campaign against Taiwan. Similarly, if China's domestic political situation remains stable, with President Xi Jinping seeking re-election and needing to assert his authority, this could lead to increased military pressure on Taiwan.

Furthermore, the continued escalation of tensions between the US and China, driven by issues such as trade policy, human rights concerns, and military competition, could lead Beijing to become more assertive in pursuing reunification with Taiwan. However, if the international community, particularly the United States, increases diplomatic efforts and provides additional security guarantees to Taiwan, this could deter China from taking military action.

In conclusion, while there are factors that could lead to a change in the status quo, I believe that the continued diplomatic efforts by both sides, combined with the potential for global power dynamics or economic stagnation to reduce China's influence over Taiwan, make it likely that the status quo outcome will hold.
