Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to the question is unknown, as the reports and forecasts provided do not specify a precise timeline for extinction. However, considering current trends and estimates, it appears that the likelihood of extinction is increasing. The status quo outcome if nothing changed would likely be a continuation of the current trend towards biodiversity loss, with species populations continuing to decline and ecosystems degrading.

The continued decline in species populations would lead to further degradation of ecosystems, potentially exacerbated by climate change, pollution, and other human activities that disrupt the natural balance. This scenario could result in a catastrophic outcome where humanity fails to address the root causes of biodiversity loss, leading to mass extinction.

On the other hand, a brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome (extinction does not occur) would be a global effort to reverse the trend of biodiversity loss through sustainable practices, conservation efforts, and climate change mitigation. This would require significant changes in human behavior, policy-making, and technological innovations.

The weight of evidence suggests that the status quo outcome is more likely than the No outcome, as the world changes slowly most of the time. However, there are ongoing efforts to address biodiversity loss and promote conservation, which could potentially slow or reverse the trend.
