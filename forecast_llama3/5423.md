Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The likelihood of Stripe reaching a valuation of $1 trillion (2020 USD) before 2027 depends on various market and economic factors. The status quo outcome, which is the current valuation of around $91.5 billion, is likely to remain stable in the short term given Stripe's recent performance and industry trends.

While there are potential scenarios where Stripe's valuation could increase or decrease, such as changes in e-commerce growth rates, regulatory issues, or shifts in consumer behavior, these factors do not seem to have a significant impact on Stripe's valuation in the near future. Instead, Stripe's continued investment in emerging technologies like machine learning and artificial intelligence, expansion into new markets, and strong growth trajectory are more likely to drive its valuation upward.

In addition, Stripe has already achieved a high valuation through previous share sales and buybacks, which suggests that it may take some time for the company to achieve this level again. However, there is also potential for Stripe's valuation to increase significantly if the company experiences rapid growth or makes strategic acquisitions or investments that enhance its capabilities and competitive position.

Overall, while there are risks and uncertainties that could impact Stripe's valuation, the current status quo outcome of around $91.5 billion seems more likely given Stripe's recent performance and industry trends.
