The time left until the outcome is known can be considered uncertain, as it depends on various factors and uncertainties. The status quo outcome would likely result in a No outcome if nothing changed, with the projects facing delays or financial issues due to bureaucratic hurdles, unforeseen challenges, or reduced funding.

However, a scenario that could lead to a Yes outcome is increased cooperation between governments and stakeholders, driving innovation and progress in the rail industry. This could include advancements in technology, improvements in infrastructure, and increased demand for high-speed rail services. Additionally, significant investments and support from governments and private companies can also contribute to a positive outcome.

Furthermore, it's essential to consider the potential risks and challenges that could hinder the progress of the projects. These might include severe financial constraints, regulatory hurdles, or unforeseen technical challenges. Nevertheless, recent advancements in international cooperation and infrastructure development suggest that the likelihood of a positive outcome is higher than initially expected.

Ultimately, the outcome will depend on how effectively governments and stakeholders work together to overcome these challenges and drive progress forward.
