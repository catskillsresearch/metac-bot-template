Here is a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The percentage of top colleges in the United States that will not require the SAT or ACT for freshman admittance in 2030 is influenced by various factors. Firstly, the time left until the outcome is known is approximately 5-7 years (by 2030), which allows for some uncertainty to be factored in. The status quo outcome if nothing changed would likely be a continued trend of increasing focus on education and workforce development, leading to more students attending college.

If the current trend continues, we could see an even higher percentage of colleges adopting alternative testing methods or moving away from standardized tests altogether, driven by factors such as improved guidance from school counselors, increased awareness of the benefits of post-secondary education, and a growing recognition of the value of a college degree in the job market. Experts' and markets' expectations are likely centered around this trend, with some optimism about future growth.

However, unexpected scenarios could result in a low outcome, such as an unforeseen global economic downturn or significant shifts in the job market that make vocational training or apprenticeships more attractive to students. On the other hand, breakthroughs in online learning or alternative credentialing programs could lead to an increase in college applications and enrollment rates.

Taking these factors into account, we can expect a consistent trend towards increased adoption of alternative testing methods and a shift towards more holistic admissions processes that consider various aspects of a student's application. This trend is likely to continue, driven by the growing recognition of the value of a college degree in the job market and the increasing importance of post-secondary education for workforce development.

The final probability assessment would be based on this consistent rationale, taking into account the uncertainty and potential unexpected scenarios that could affect the outcome.
