Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The key factors influencing human lifespan enhancement by 2100 include current trends, technological advancements, investments in research and development, and societal resilience. On one hand, humanity has shown an ability to adapt and overcome adversity, which could lead to continued population growth and increased life expectancy through improvements in medicine, technology, and sustainability.

On the other hand, there are potential risks and challenges that could impact human lifespan enhancement, such as catastrophic events or gradual decline due to environmental degradation, war, or economic collapse. However, these scenarios are less likely given the slow pace of change in most aspects of life and humanity's ability to adapt.

Significant investments in emerging technologies like artificial intelligence, biotechnology, and space exploration could lead to breakthroughs that increase human lifespan and capabilities. Additionally, rapid advancements in medical technology, coupled with improvements in healthcare infrastructure and public health policies, could also contribute to a substantial increase in human lifespan.

Overall, the most likely scenario is one where humanity continues to make progress in areas like medicine, technology, and sustainability, leading to increased population growth and life expectancy. However, there are still uncertainties and risks that need to be considered, making it essential to continue investing in research and development to mitigate potential challenges and ensure a thriving human population by 2100.
