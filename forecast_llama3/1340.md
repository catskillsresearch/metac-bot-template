Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The likelihood of any form of life emerging on habitable planets depends on various factors, including the complexity of life itself, the availability of resources, and the presence of environmental conditions conducive to life. The most likely scenario is one where life arises in simple forms, such as microorganisms or single-celled organisms, which are more resilient to environmental fluctuations and can adapt to changing conditions.

One unexpected scenario that could lead to a low outcome is a sudden shift in public opinion or a major breakthrough in astrobiology revealing that the probability of intelligent life arising on other planets is much lower than previously thought. This could lead to a significant decrease in the estimated probability of contacting extraterrestrial life.

On the other hand, an unexpected scenario that could result in a high outcome might be the discovery of a nearby exoplanet with conditions similar to those on Earth, increasing the chances of detecting signs of intelligent life or even establishing contact. This could lead to a significant increase in the estimated probability of contacting extraterrestrial life.

Experts and markets may have nuanced views on the matter, acknowledging both the challenges and the potential breakthroughs. The current lack of concrete evidence and the complexities involved in detecting life beyond Earth would continue to dominate our understanding.
