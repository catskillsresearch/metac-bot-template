Here's a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome is known is unknown, as it depends on various factors such as scientific achievements and Nobel Committee decisions. The status quo outcome if nothing changed is that Stephen Wolfram has not won a Nobel Prize in Physics.

A scenario resulting in a No outcome could be if Stephen Wolfram does not continue to make significant contributions to the field of physics or if his work is not recognized by the Nobel Committee, the scientific community, and experts. This could include a lack of groundbreaking discoveries, innovative theories, or practical applications that benefit society.

On the other hand, a scenario resulting in a Yes outcome could be if Stephen Wolfram makes significant breakthroughs in areas like artificial intelligence, machine learning, data science, or physics, which have garnered increasing attention and importance in recent years. His work would need to have practical applications that benefit society and be widely recognized by experts, the scientific community, and the Nobel Committee.

For a Nobel Prize in Physics, Stephen Wolfram's research would need to significantly impact the field of physics, and his peers would need to widely recognize his contributions. A scenario resulting in a Yes outcome could also involve groundbreaking discoveries or innovative theories that have far-reaching implications for the field of physics.
