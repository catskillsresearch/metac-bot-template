Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 5 years, allowing for diplomatic efforts, economic trends, and political shifts to influence the number of UN member states that will formally recognize Taiwan. The current trend suggests an increase in support for China's claim over Taiwan, with around 70 countries currently backing China's authority.

If nothing changed, I expect this trend to continue, potentially reaching a total of around 85-90 countries recognizing China's sovereignty over Taiwan by the end of 2025. Experts and markets anticipate that China will continue to gain ground in its diplomatic efforts, which could lead to an increase in international recognition of its claim.

However, unexpected scenarios could result in either a low or high outcome. A sudden shift in global politics, such as a significant change in US-China relations or a unified response from Western countries, could cause some countries to reevaluate their relationships with Taiwan and reconsider recognizing China's sovereignty. On the other hand, a major economic or security crisis could lead countries to turn to China for support and cooperation, resulting in an increase in international recognition of its sovereignty over Taiwan.

Overall, while there is uncertainty regarding the exact outcome, it is likely that more countries will continue to recognize China's claim over Taiwan, potentially reaching around 80-90 countries by the end of 2025.
