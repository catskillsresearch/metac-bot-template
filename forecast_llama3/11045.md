Here is a final rationale that combines the best of each individual rationale:

The key factors to consider when predicting whether a Democrat will win the 2028 US presidential election are the current political climate, party dynamics, and demographic trends. The status quo outcome, based on recent trends and party dynamics, suggests that Democrats tend to perform well nationally, particularly among young voters, minorities, and urban areas.

However, there are also scenarios under which a Republican could win. For instance, if Republicans can successfully mobilize their base, capitalize on Democratic infighting and divisions, or present a strong candidate who appeals to swing voters, they may be able to secure the presidency.

On the other hand, Democrats have an opportunity to win if they can unite behind a strong candidate, address internal divisions, and present a compelling vision for the country's future. This could involve capitalizing on their existing strength among certain demographics, such as young voters, minorities, and urban areas, while also appealing to independents and moderate Republicans.

Ultimately, the probability of a Democrat winning the presidential election in 2028 will depend on how these factors play out over the next three years. While there are certainly challenges and uncertainties ahead, it is possible that Democrats can capitalize on their existing strengths and present a unified front against Republicans to secure victory.
