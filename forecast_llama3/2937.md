Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome is known is significant, with approximately 20-25 years remaining. The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be an increase in antibiotic resistance, leading to a significant number of deaths and illnesses worldwide.

One possible scenario that could lead to a decrease in the number of deaths from antibiotic-resistant infections is widespread adoption and effective implementation of infection prevention strategies, such as proper hand hygiene and vaccination campaigns. Additionally, advances in medical research and development of new antibiotics or alternative treatments could also contribute to a decline in the number of deaths.

On the other hand, a scenario that could lead to an increase in the number of deaths from antibiotic-resistant infections is the continued overuse and misuse of antibiotics, leading to further resistance development and limited treatment options. This could be exacerbated by factors such as climate change, urbanization, and population growth, which can contribute to increased rates of disease transmission.

Furthermore, significant advances are needed in antibiotic research and development to curb the rise of antimicrobial resistance and reduce the number of deaths attributed to it. Effective policies and regulations are also necessary to address antibiotic misuse and promote sustainable use practices.

Overall, while there are scenarios where antimicrobial resistance could decrease, the status quo outcome (continued rise in antimicrobial resistance) is more likely to occur if nothing changes.
