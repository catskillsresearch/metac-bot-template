Here is a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The status quo outcome is often the most likely scenario, as changes occur slowly over time. However, significant events or policies can influence outcomes. In this case, the doubling of global nuclear power generation by 2050 requires a combination of factors, including government support, technological advancements, and public acceptance.

While it is possible that current trends may not change significantly, and the world continues to rely heavily on fossil fuels and alternative energy sources, there are also reasons to believe that investments in nuclear technology and policy changes could drive growth in nuclear power generation. 

Governments can play a crucial role by implementing supportive policies and regulations, such as investment incentives, regulatory frameworks, and public education campaigns to address concerns about safety and environmental impact.

Additionally, advancements in small modular reactors (SMRs) and other technologies could make nuclear power more cost-competitive with fossil fuels, driving increased adoption.
