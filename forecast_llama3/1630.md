Based on the individual rationales, a consistent and comprehensive rationale can be formed as follows:

The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 25 years, considering the current pace of progress in medicine, technology, and societal changes. The status quo outcome if nothing changed would likely result in a significant increase in life expectancy due to advances in medicine, improvements in healthcare, and changes in lifestyle.

If the current trend continued, we could expect to see an increase in life expectancy, potentially reaching levels of over 100 years old for certain age groups. This could be driven by advances in medicine, better living conditions, and increased access to healthcare. Experts and markets are likely expecting a significant increase in life expectancy due to advancements mentioned above, with some projecting that average lifespan could reach or exceed 100 years old by mid-century.

However, unexpected scenarios can lead to either low or high outcomes. A global pandemic or environmental disaster could result in decreased life expectancy, while breakthroughs in medicine or regenerative biotechnology could lead to increased life expectancy and a higher percentage of people living to be at least 100 years old.

Overall, the consistency of these rationales suggests that:

* The current pace of progress in medicine, technology, and societal changes will continue to drive increases in life expectancy.
* Experts and markets expect significant gains in life expectancy due to advancements in medicine, healthcare, and lifestyle.
* Unexpected scenarios can either accelerate or decelerate the increase in life expectancy.

This comprehensive rationale provides a solid foundation for understanding the factors influencing the percentage of US residents aged 100 years or older on January 1, 2050.
