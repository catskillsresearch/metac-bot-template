Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to the question is known is relatively short, considering Norway has already taken steps towards acquiring new frigates. The recent agreements with Thyssenkrupp Marine Systems (TKMS) and Ulstein Verft collaboration are significant indicators that the country is moving forward with its plan to acquire new frigates.

The status quo outcome if nothing changed would likely mean that Norway will not acquire new frigates, possibly due to ongoing evaluation or consideration of alternative options. However, considering the pace of military procurement and the recent agreements with TKMS, it's possible that we'll know within a few months whether Norway will announce the replacement design for the Fridtjof Nansen-class before September 2025.

Scenarios resulting in a No outcome include potential budget constraints, changes in global security priorities, or alternative defense strategies. On the other hand, scenarios resulting in a Yes outcome involve Norway proceeding with its plan to acquire new frigates and signing an agreement with TKMS or another supplier.

The likelihood of a positive outcome is high, given that there is a clear need for replacement and the partnership between TKMS and Ulstein Verft has already been formed. The possibility of significant changes in the country's security environment or budget constraints does exist, but these factors are not currently hindering the procurement process.

Overall, while there are some uncertainties surrounding Norway's plans to acquire new frigates, the recent agreements with TKMS and the need for replacement suggest that the likelihood of a positive outcome is high.
