Here is a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The likelihood of a CANZUK Free Movement Treaty being adopted before 2029 depends on various factors. The timeline for this question is uncertain, as diplomatic negotiations can take time and are influenced by complex international dynamics. 

If nothing changes, it is likely that no formal treaty will be established in the near future. This status quo outcome reflects the current global landscape where countries tend to prioritize their own interests and maintain independence.

A scenario that could result in a No outcome would be if significant disagreements arise among member countries on key issues, such as trade policies or security arrangements, making it difficult to reach an agreement. 

On the other hand, a scenario that could lead to a Yes outcome would involve strong leadership from one country, combined with shared interests and a desire for cooperation among the four nations. This could drive successful diplomatic efforts and result in a CANZUK treaty.

The complex international dynamics involved, including geopolitics, diplomacy, and shared values, will play a crucial role in determining whether a CANZUK Free Movement Treaty is adopted before 2029.
