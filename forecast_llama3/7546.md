Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until we know the exact outcome is roughly 2-3 years (until 2027-06-13). Assuming no significant changes in global response, vaccination rates, or virus mutations, I expect an ongoing decline in COVID-19 mortality rates. However, this trend may not continue indefinitely, and there are still concerns about potential variants or mutations that could impact the trajectory of the pandemic.

Experts predict a continued decline in COVID-19 mortality rates due to increased vaccination rates and improved global preparedness. Markets also expect a steady decrease in COVID-19-related fatalities. However, there is always the possibility of an unexpected scenario, such as a sudden and effective global vaccine distribution or widespread adoption of public health measures, which could lead to a significant decrease in COVID-19-related deaths.

On the other hand, there are also concerns about potential low-scenario outcomes, such as the emergence of highly transmissible and severe variants of the virus, coupled with complacency or decreased public health measures. This could result in an unexpected increase in COVID-19 deaths.

In terms of time left until the outcome is known, it's more than a year, as new variants and mutations of the virus can emerge, affecting the death toll. The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be a continued decline in COVID-19 mortality rates, potentially reaching around 15,000 to 20,000 deaths per year.

Overall, while there are many uncertainties surrounding the future trajectory of the pandemic, I expect an ongoing decline in COVID-19 mortality rates due to increased vaccination rates and improved global preparedness. However, there is always the possibility of unexpected scenarios that could impact this trend.
