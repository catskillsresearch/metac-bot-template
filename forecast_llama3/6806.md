Here's a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

Lab-grown complex vital organs will become successful in humans before 2035 if significant breakthroughs are made in developing reliable and scalable methods for growing functional organs. This will require continued investment in research and development, as well as regulatory support to ensure widespread adoption. The current status quo outcome is a shortage of donor organs, which lab-grown organs could potentially address.

However, the path to success is not without challenges. Regulatory hurdles, public skepticism about the safety and efficacy of lab-grown organs, and technical limitations may hinder progress. Additionally, breakthroughs in other areas, such as new treatments for chronic diseases, could reduce demand for artificial vital organs and medical bionics, slowing growth.

On the other hand, advancements in stem cell technology, bioprinting, and tissue engineering could accelerate the development of high-quality, functional organ substitutes. Strong support from governments, industries, and the general public could also drive widespread adoption.

Ultimately, the success of lab-grown complex vital organs will depend on a combination of technological advancements, regulatory approvals, and societal acceptance. While there are risks and challenges involved, the potential benefits make it a worthwhile pursuit.
