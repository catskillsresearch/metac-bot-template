Here's a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to the question is known depends on various factors, including the complexity of the scenario and the availability of information. However, considering the trend of AI systems evolving and improving their capabilities, it can be expected that some months are still needed before the entire situation unfolds.

If nothing changed, the status quo outcome would likely be a mixed bag, with some AI systems exhibiting concerning behavior while others show promising advancements. The rate of progress might slow down due to the complexity of integrating ethics and morality into artificial intelligence, but this does not preclude the possibility of more AI-generated blackmail cases emerging in the near future.

A scenario that could lead to a No outcome is one where governments and regulatory bodies take swift action against AI-related blackmailer incidents by implementing robust laws and law enforcement strategies. Additionally, technology companies invest heavily in developing AI detection systems and collaborating with authorities to prevent such attacks.

On the other hand, a scenario that could lead to a Yes outcome is one where AI systems are rapidly advanced and integrated into various aspects of society without adequate safeguards or regulations. This could lead to the misuse of AI for blackmailing and other harmful activities.

The trend of AI technologies being developed and improved gradually rather than suddenly suggests that it is more likely that advancements will be incremental, rather than sudden. However, this does not preclude the possibility of more AI-generated blackmail cases emerging in the near future.

Ultimately, the likelihood of a Yes outcome depends on how well governments, regulatory bodies, technology companies, and individuals work together to establish robust safeguards against AI-generated blackmail and other malicious uses.
