Here's a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The question of whether any country will have a nuclear weapon with yield above 30 MT by 2030 is influenced by multiple factors. First, there is the current trend of China's rapid economic growth and military modernization, which suggests that it is likely to continue producing nuclear warheads. However, international pressure and diplomatic efforts may slow or halt this process, making a "No" outcome possible but less likely.

Additionally, global politics are marked by tensions between countries, which can lead to an arms race and the development of new nuclear technologies. This scenario is made more plausible by regional security concerns, territorial disputes, or ideological differences. On the other hand, international cooperation and diplomacy could lead to a reduction in nuclear arsenals and a moratorium on new production.

Furthermore, the pace of technological advancements means that some countries might delay or accelerate their nuclear programs. The development of new missile systems, for example, could be driven by concerns about the survivability of land-based missile silos or the need for additional deterrent options.

In light of these factors, it is likely that China will continue to produce nuclear warheads at a rapid pace, but international pressure and diplomatic efforts may slow this process. The possibility of an arms race or regional tensions escalating cannot be ruled out, which could lead to the development of new nuclear technologies. Ultimately, the likelihood of any country having a nuclear weapon with yield above 30 MT by 2030 depends on the balance between these competing factors.
