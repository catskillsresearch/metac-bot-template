Here is a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to this question is unknown, as it depends on various factors and circumstances that may unfold in the future. However, considering recent developments and trends in the Taiwan situation, we can assume that the events will continue to unfold over the next few weeks or months.

The status quo outcome if nothing changed is likely that Taiwan will continue to maintain its de facto independence and diplomatic relations with countries like the United States, despite China's claims of sovereignty over the island. This scenario assumes that there will be no significant changes or events that would prompt Taiwan to declare independence or the United States to alter its policy towards Taiwan.

A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome (Taiwan does not declare independence) could be one where China continues to apply diplomatic and economic pressure on Taiwan, making it increasingly difficult for the Taiwanese government to maintain its current level of international recognition. Alternatively, if there's a significant shift in global power dynamics, such as a change in U.S. administration or a major regional conflict, it could create an opportunity for Taiwan to reconsider its declaration of independence.

On the other hand, a scenario that results in a Yes outcome (Taiwan declares independence) could be one where Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen or her successor decides to declare independence, potentially due to growing public support for self-determination. This could prompt China to take further action, potentially leading to a declaration of independence from Taiwan.

Given these scenarios, we can conclude that the probability of Taiwan declaring independence is relatively low due to the complexities and risks involved, as well as the potential consequences for international relations and regional stability. However, there's always a possibility that unforeseen events or changes in global dynamics could create an opportunity for Taiwan to make such a declaration.
