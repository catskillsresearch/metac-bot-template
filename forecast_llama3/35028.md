Here's a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome is known is approximately 1 year and 3 months (from December 2026). If nothing changed, based on current trends, global average wealth would continue to grow at a moderate rate, with the wealthiest individuals accumulating wealth at an unprecedented rate. However, there are scenarios that could result in a No outcome: significant economic downturns or major global crises that could lead to a reduction in global average wealth; or changes in government policies that redistribute wealth and reduce income inequality.

On the other hand, if current trends continue, sustained economic growth, technological advancements, and increased globalization could drive continued wealth creation. Factors such as innovation, favorable government policies, and the rising middle class in emerging economies could contribute to an increase in global average wealth.

While some forecasts predict a moderate likelihood of global average wealth continuing to grow due to current trends and economic resilience, others highlight the possibility of unexpected events or market fluctuations that could impact the outcome. Therefore, it is essential to consider both the status quo outcome and potential scenarios that could result in a No or Yes outcome when assessing the probability of an increase in global average wealth per adult in 2024 compared to 2023.
