Here is a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 5 years. The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be a continued increase in global violence and conflict, driven by various factors such as political instability, economic strain, and social unrest. This trend has been observed over several years, and without significant changes in global politics or international relations, it is likely to continue.

A scenario that results in a No outcome would require a sudden and drastic change in human behavior, a significant reduction in global tensions, and the resolution of ongoing conflicts through peaceful means. This could be achieved through concerted efforts from governments, international organizations, and civil society to address root causes of conflicts, promote cooperation, and build trust.

On the other hand, a scenario that results in a Yes outcome would involve continued escalation of conflicts worldwide, with major powers failing to curb the violence, resulting in further humanitarian crises, increased displacement, and a growing sense of global instability. This could be triggered by a combination of factors, including the ongoing rivalry between nations, regional power shifts, and the increasing importance of strategic resources.

Overall, it is likely that the status quo outcome will continue unless there are significant changes or breakthroughs in international relations.
