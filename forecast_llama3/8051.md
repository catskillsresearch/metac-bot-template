Here's a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The timeframe for the outcome to this question being known is uncertain, with some events already having occurred and others yet to unfold. The current status quo is characterized by volatile global politics, military tensions, and economic instability, which may lead to a moderate level of conflict.

However, there are two possible scenarios that could influence the likelihood of armed conflicts between the United States and China resulting in at least 100 deaths before 2050. On one hand, if China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) faces significant setbacks or resistance from other countries, leading to decreased cooperation and increased tensions, the world might move towards a more fragmented global security landscape with multiple powers competing for influence.

On the other hand, if China continues to promote cooperation through its BRI and other global projects, this could lead to increased economic interdependence, cultural exchange, and diplomatic dialogue among nations, potentially shifting the world away from great power rivalries and towards more collaborative international relations.

The likelihood of these scenarios playing out depends on various factors, including the ability of countries to engage in diplomatic efforts, the success of international organizations or third-party mediators in de-escalating tensions, and the potential for external pressures or internal changes within conflicting parties to influence their behavior.

Ultimately, the probability of armed conflicts between the United States and China resulting in at least 100 deaths before 2050 is uncertain, with both a moderate level of conflict and a multipolar reality being possible outcomes.
