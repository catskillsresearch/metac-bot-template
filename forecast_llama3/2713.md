Here's a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 5 years (from 2025 to 2030). Assuming nothing changes, it's likely that HIV/AIDS will continue to be a significant public health concern globally. Current trends suggest that new HIV infections could remain high, with around 1.3 million cases per year (based on the 2023 data).

A scenario where HIV/AIDS does not continue to be a significant public health concern could involve a concerted global effort, increased funding, and innovative solutions to prevent new infections. This might include widespread adoption of effective prevention strategies, improved access to treatment and care for those already infected, and reduced stigma surrounding the disease.

On the other hand, a scenario where HIV/AIDS continues to be a significant public health concern could involve ongoing challenges with funding, lack of effective prevention strategies, and persistent stigma surrounding the disease. This might lead to continued high rates of new infections, making it more difficult to achieve the goal of ending AIDS by 2030.

Given these scenarios, it's clear that the status quo outcome (continued decline in HIV infections) is unlikely without significant changes in global health policy and funding. The current trend of high HIV infection rates is unlikely to change significantly within the next 5 years without a major breakthrough or significant changes in global efforts.
