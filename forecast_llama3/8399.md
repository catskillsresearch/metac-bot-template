Here is the combined rationale:

The time left until the outcome is known is approximately 9-10 years. The status quo outcome would likely be a continued increase in nuclear weapons worldwide, with no significant decrease or elimination of existing arsenals. This scenario assumes that current trends and international dynamics remain unchanged.

Global instability and conflicts could lead to a breakdown in international agreements and cooperation, allowing countries like North Korea to continue expanding their nuclear capabilities. However, considering the recent trends and developments in global politics, particularly regarding North Korea's nuclear program, it is possible that tensions could escalate and lead to an increase in nuclear weapons.

Additionally, the slow pace of change in international relations and technological advancements means that the world changes slowly most of the time. Therefore, we should place extra weight on the status quo outcome. However, this does not rule out the possibility of significant changes or breakthroughs, such as global efforts to reduce nuclear stockpiles leading to successful disarmament agreements.

The likelihood of a drastic change in either direction (i.e., a rapid increase or decrease in nuclear weapons) is low. Instead, it's likely that the number of nuclear weapons will continue to increase slowly but steadily due to ongoing geopolitical rivalries, regional conflicts, and internal power struggles.

Overall, while there are possibilities for significant change or agreements, the baseline scenario of slow and steady increases in nuclear weapons seems more likely.
