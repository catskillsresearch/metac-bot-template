Here is a rationale that combines the best of each individual rationale:

The slow pace of change in the global economy suggests that I should put extra weight on the status quo outcome. However, India's robust economic growth momentum and favorable demographic trends create opportunities for upward revisions to its nominal GDP. The possibility of positive or negative shocks affecting India's economy cannot be ignored, but the current trends and forecasts suggest a higher likelihood of India surpassing Japan's GDP in 2025.

The IMF projections confirm that India is on track to surpass Japan's nominal GDP in 2025, driven by domestic demand and structural reforms aimed at boosting productivity. A significant global economic downturn or severe recession in India could slow down its economic growth, but the current trends do not suggest such an outcome.

Favorable demographic trends and robust domestic demand are likely to continue driving India's economy forward, making it more likely that it will surpass Japan's GDP in 2025. However, a significant slowdown in global economic growth or unforeseen events affecting India's exports and foreign investment could impact its economic growth.

Overall, considering the status quo outcome, trends, and forecasts, I believe there is a higher likelihood of India surpassing Japan's GDP in 2025, making it more likely that its nominal GDP will exceed $4 trillion.
