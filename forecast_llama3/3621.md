Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to this question is known is approximately 2-6 years, depending on various factors. The status quo outcome if nothing changed would likely be a continuation of the current political parties in power and their respective leaders. This is based on historical trends, where established parties tend to dominate electoral outcomes.

A scenario that results in a No outcome (third-party candidate winning) could occur if there are significant external factors or disruptions that affect the election outcome. For example, a sudden shift in voter preferences towards more progressive and independent political options, potentially driven by disillusionment with the current ruling party's performance. This could be fueled by significant changes in government policies, scandals involving prominent figures, or unexpected events that shake up the political landscape.

On the other hand, a scenario that results in a Yes outcome (status quo) would likely involve a continuation of the current political climate, where the dominant parties maintain their hold on power and resources. This could happen if there are no major external factors or disruptions that affect the election outcome, such as economic crises or significant changes in public opinion.

Ultimately, the likelihood of a third party winning is influenced by various factors, including the ability of new entrants to mobilize voters and create compelling narratives around their platforms. However, historical trends suggest that established parties tend to dominate electoral outcomes, making it more likely for the status quo to persist.
