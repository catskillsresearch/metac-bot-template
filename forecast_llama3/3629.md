Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to this question is known is significant, with several months still remaining before the deadline. As a result, it is reasonable to expect that the current status quo outcome will persist unless there are unexpected events or changes in public opinion.

One possible scenario is that Pennsylvania does not join the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, similar to Forecast 1 and 2's assumptions about the status quo outcome. This could occur if Democratic lawmakers in Pennsylvania are unable to garner sufficient support from Republican colleagues and Governor Tom Wolf, as suggested by Forecast 2.

On the other hand, there is also a possibility that Pennsylvania joins the compact, which could be driven by growing support for a popular vote system among lawmakers or voters, as hinted at by Forecast 5. This scenario would require significant changes in public opinion or external factors influencing the decision, but it is not entirely implausible.

Given these possibilities and the slow pace of change, I argue that the most likely outcome is that Pennsylvania does not join the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, similar to the status quo outcome described by Forecast 1-2. However, there is a non-negligible chance that unexpected events or changes in public opinion could lead to Pennsylvania joining the compact and potentially other states following suit.

Ultimately, the key factor will be whether there are significant external factors influencing the situation, such as presidential politics or shifts in public opinion. If these factors remain unchanged, it is likely that the current status quo outcome will persist.
