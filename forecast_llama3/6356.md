Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to the question is known is significant, with several years remaining before the outcome is certain. The status quo outcome assumes that AES-256 encryption will continue to be widely used and considered secure unless significant advancements are made in quantum computing or alternative cryptography methods emerge.

A scenario that could result in a "No" outcome is if breakthroughs are made in quantum computing or alternative encryption methods, rendering AES-256 vulnerable to attacks. On the other hand, a scenario that could result in a "Yes" outcome is if further research and development in cryptography continue to validate the security of AES-256, leading to its continued adoption and widespread use.

The pace of change in this field is slow, with significant breakthroughs or vulnerabilities required to alter the landscape and make AES-256 less secure. While it is possible that new technologies could emerge or new vulnerabilities are discovered, the current status quo outcome of AES-256 remaining widely used and considered secure seems likely to continue unless a major breakthrough occurs.

Overall, the uncertainty surrounding this question reflects the potential for significant breakthroughs or advancements in cryptography, but also acknowledges the slow pace of change in this field.
