Here is a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 6-12 months, as some economic data may be released in the next few months that could influence the actual outcome. The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be around 3.1% (the current GDP growth rate). If the current trend continued, the outcome could be slightly higher at around 3.2%. Experts and markets are generally cautious about the global economy's prospects, with many predicting slower growth rates in the coming years due to various factors like demographics, debt, and technological disruption.

However, unexpected scenarios that could result in a low or high outcome include sudden and severe economic shocks, such as large-scale trade wars or pandemics, which could lead to sharp declines or surges in global GDP growth rates. On the other hand, unprecedented breakthroughs in sustainable energy or massive investments in infrastructure projects could also boost economic activity.

Overall, the likelihood of a low outcome (e.g., global pandemic) is relatively high, while an unexpected surge in global trade and investment driven by innovative technologies and policies that foster international cooperation and economic growth is less likely but still possible.
