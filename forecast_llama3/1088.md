Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until the outcome to the question is known is unknown, as we are forecasting events that may not occur for decades. However, it is likely that the status quo outcome if nothing changed would be a continuation of the current trends in life expectancy and mortality rates.

Assuming the current trend continues, it's possible that people born between 1910 and 1950 will live longer than their predecessors, with some experts suggesting that by 2080, approximately 300,000 people will be living to 110 years. This is based on the assumption that advancements in healthcare, lifestyle changes, and medical technology will continue to drive improvements in life expectancy.

Experts and market analysts are generally optimistic about the future of life expectancy, with many predicting significant increases in average lifespan over the coming decades. Some projections even suggest that we may see a "longevity revolution" in which humans live well into their 150s or beyond.

However, unexpected scenarios could also result in lower outcomes, such as an unexpected pandemic or widespread environmental disaster that significantly slows down progress in healthcare and medicine. This could lead to a decrease in life expectancy, potentially resulting in an average lifespan of around 90-100 years by the end of the century.

Conversely, significant breakthroughs in regenerative medicine and biotechnology could lead to major advances in human longevity, potentially resulting in an average lifespan of 150-160 years or more by the end of the century.

Ultimately, the future of life expectancy is uncertain and will depend on a complex interplay of factors, including technological advancements, societal changes, and unforeseen events.
