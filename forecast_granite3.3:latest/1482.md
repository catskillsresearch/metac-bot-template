## Combined Rationale

The question pertains to forecasting the percentage of Americans who will be obese or overweight by 2030. Given the time constraints, we consider recent data and expert opinions up to March 2025, acknowledging the inherent uncertainty due to unforeseen global events that could significantly alter current trends.

### Status Quo and Current Trends
- If current trends persisted without intervention, more than half of the adult population globally might be obese by 2030 or 2050 (Forecasts 2, 3, 4). This is consistent with projections from health organizations like the World Obesity Federation and studies such as those published in The Lancet.
- However, some experts predict obesity rates could exceed 60% globally by 2030 (Forecaster 4) or specifically for adult Americans (Forecaster 5).

### Expert Expectations
Experts and markets largely agree that without significant intervention, obesity rates will continue to rise. There is a consensus among various forecasts regarding the upward trajectory, albeit differing in magnitude and specific targets. Public health organizations anticipate an increase, while some individual experts project even higher rates.

### Unexpected Scenarios
- A low outcome could occur if successful public health initiatives were globally implemented, significantly reducing obesity rates (Forecasts 2e, 3e, 5e). These scenarios rely on effective interventions and widespread changes in diet and lifestyle that mitigate the anticipated rise.
- Conversely, unexpected high outcomes might arise from global economic shifts towards diets higher in processed foods and more sedentary lifestyles (Forecasts 2f, 4f, 5f). This scenario highlights how unforeseen societal or policy changes could exacerbate existing trends.

## Final Forecast
Given the rationale constructed from various forecasts' individual considerations and acknowledging uncertainties:

Percentile 10: 20  
Percentile 20: 35  
Percentile 40: 55  
Percentile 60: 70  
Percentile 80: 82  
Percentile 90: 88  

This forecast acknowledges a range of possible outcomes, reflecting both the projected rise in obesity due to current trends and potential impact from unforeseen interventions or accelerating factors.
