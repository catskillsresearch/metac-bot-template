### Combined Rationale:

1. **Timeframe Uncertainty**: The precise time until the outcome is known remains unstated in the given information, making definitive time-based analysis impossible without further context.

2. **Status Quo Consideration**: Current global nuclear arsenals comprise approximately 13,000 warheads, with key players including the US (around 5,800), Russia (approximately 6,375), China (~320), France (about 300), and the UK (roughly 215). Without changes in international treaties or national policies, these numbers could remain relatively stable.

3. **Trend Analysis**: The rationale collectively suggests that current trends such as nuclear modernization programs (e.g., US and Russia's $2 trillion modernization efforts) and geopolitical tensions (notably in regions like South Asia or the Korean Peninsula) may lead to either incremental increases or, in more dramatic scenarios, significant expansions of nuclear arsenals.

4. **Expert Expectations**: Experts are divided but generally converge on a cautious outlook, anticipating some level of nuclear proliferation due to regional instabilities and technological advancements that democratize access to nuclear capabilities. Yet, there's an undercurrent of optimism regarding disarmament efforts, particularly if international cooperation strengthens or a major power commits to substantial reductions.

5. **Unexpected Scenarios**:
   - **Low Outcome Scenario**: A hypothetical unforeseen global consensus for nuclear disarmament backed by robust enforceable treaties could dramatically reduce existing stockpiles, potentially below current levels.
   - **High Outcome Scenario**: Conversely, an unexpected major geopolitical conflict could trigger widespread proliferation as nations perceive a heightened security necessity, leading to substantial increases in the total number of nuclear weapons.

### Final Forecast:

Percentile 10: 400  
Percentile 20: 550  
Percentile 40: 800  
Percentile 60: 1,000  
Percentile 80: 1,700  
Percentile 90: 2,500  

This forecast range integrates potential increases due to modernization and geopolitical tensions while acknowledging the possibility of a lower outcome through successful disarmament negotiations. The upper bound reflects caution against overly optimistic scenarios, given inherent uncertainties in predicting future geopolitical and technological developments related to nuclear weapons.
