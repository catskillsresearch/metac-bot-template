# Please look at the scores of the attached questions, where 0 means no accuracy and 1 means perfect accuracy. Look at the title of each question. Please summarize any patterns you see in the accuracy as it relates to the subject matter of the question. Broadly characterize accuracy as a function of subject matter

The accuracy scores in the attached dataset vary significantly depending on the subject matter of the questions. Broadly characterizing accuracy as a function of subject matter reveals several notable patterns:

## High Accuracy Subjects (Scores ~0.9 to 1.0)

- **Technology and AI-related questions**: Questions about OpenAI announcements, AI model rankings, IPO plans, and AI capabilities often have very high accuracy (e.g., OpenAI IPO announcements, GPT-5 release, Chatbot Arena rankings) with scores frequently above 0.95 to 1.0.
- **Sports outcomes and events**: Questions about specific sports events such as the Tour de France winners, chess championships, Olympic medal counts, and specific athlete performances tend to have high accuracy (around 0.9 to 1.0).
- **Geopolitical and military events with clear outcomes**: Questions about conflicts (e.g., control of territories in Ukraine, nuclear weapon detonations, arrests by the International Criminal Court) also show high accuracy, often above 0.9.
- **Financial market metrics and company performance**: Questions about stock prices, market capitalization (e.g., Nvidia vs. Apple), bankruptcy filings, and earnings reports often have high accuracy, typically in the 0.85 to 1.0 range.
- **Public health emergencies and disease case counts**: Questions related to CDC or WHO declarations, disease case numbers (e.g., mpox, H5N1, measles), and vaccine approvals generally have high accuracy (above 0.9).
- **Political office holders and election results**: Questions about incumbents remaining in office, election outcomes, or party majorities tend to have high accuracy (often 0.8 to 1.0).


## Moderate Accuracy Subjects (Scores ~0.5 to 0.8)

- **Economic indicators and inflation rates**: Questions about inflation percentages, unemployment rates, and economic growth often have moderate accuracy, ranging roughly from 0.5 to 0.8.
- **Environmental and weather-related questions**: Questions about hurricanes, rainfall amounts, temperature records, and drought conditions show mixed but generally moderate accuracy (around 0.5 to 0.9).
- **Entertainment industry awards and media events**: Questions about MTV VMAs, Grammy awards, movie box office revenues, and celebrity endorsements tend to have moderate accuracy, often between 0.6 and 0.9.
- **Social and cultural questions**: Topics such as social media follower counts, political endorsements by celebrities, and cultural events have moderate accuracy, sometimes lower (0.3 to 0.8).


## Low Accuracy Subjects (Scores below ~0.5)

- **Highly speculative or uncertain political questions**: Some political questions involving campaign suspensions, candidate behaviors, or less certain political events have low accuracy scores (e.g., below 0.4).
- **Questions involving very specific or less predictable numeric values**: Questions asking for exact counts or specific numeric thresholds (e.g., exact number of tornadoes, precise stock price thresholds, detailed user counts on social platforms) sometimes have low accuracy (0.0 to 0.5).
- **Questions about future announcements or product features with uncertainty**: Some product announcements or technology feature questions (e.g., new iPhone features, exact dates for releases) show lower accuracy, often below 0.5.
- **Some economic or financial questions with volatile or unpredictable metrics**: Certain questions about market indicators or stock prices with narrow ranges or thresholds have lower accuracy (around 0.3 to 0.5).
- **Questions about social media platform bans or availability**: Questions about bans or availability of platforms like YouTube or TikTok in specific countries show lower accuracy (around 0.3 to 0.6).


## Summary of Patterns

- **Questions with well-defined, measurable outcomes and widely tracked data (e.g., sports results, stock prices, official announcements, election outcomes) tend to have higher accuracy.**
- **Questions involving complex social dynamics, speculative political events, or precise numeric predictions tend to have lower accuracy.**
- **Health and public safety questions related to official data reporting and emergency declarations show high accuracy, reflecting reliance on authoritative sources.**
- **Entertainment and cultural event predictions have moderate accuracy, likely due to variability and subjective factors.**
- **Novel or emerging technology-related questions, especially about AI developments, have surprisingly high accuracy, possibly due to clear public information and announcements.**

In essence, accuracy correlates positively with the concreteness, measurability, and public visibility of the subject matter, and negatively with uncertainty, speculation, and complexity of social or political dynamics.
