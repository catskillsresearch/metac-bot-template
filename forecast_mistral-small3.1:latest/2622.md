To determine the highest level of annual GDP growth in the US before 2030, we need to consider several key factors that influence economic growth. These factors include demographic trends, fiscal policies, economic cycles, and potential unexpected events.

Firstly, the demographic trends in the US are crucial. The US population is aging, and birth rates are declining. Without significant immigration, the US population is projected to start declining around 2033. This demographic shift will likely lead to a shrinking workforce, which can slow economic growth. However, immigration policies and birth rates can significantly alter these projections. A sudden surge in birth rates or a significant increase in immigration could counteract the predicted decline and boost economic growth.

Secondly, fiscal policies play a pivotal role in economic growth. The current US federal debt-to-GDP ratio is around 100%, and it is expected to increase gradually due to ongoing government spending and interest payments. If current policies remain unchanged, the debt-to-GDP ratio could reach 107% by 2029 and continue rising. This increasing debt burden could constrain fiscal space, limiting the government's ability to stimulate the economy during downturns. However, significant fiscal reforms, such as cutting expenditures and increasing revenues through tax reforms, could alleviate this constraint and support higher economic growth.

Thirdly, economic cycles and potential unexpected events must be considered. Economic growth is subject to cycles of expansion and contraction. A significant economic boom, coupled with drastic fiscal reforms, could lead to sustained high economic growth. Conversely, a severe economic downturn, such as a major recession or financial crisis, combined with increased government spending to stimulate the economy, could lead to a much higher debt-to-GDP ratio and slower economic growth.

Given these factors, the highest level of annual GDP growth in the US before 2030 is likely to be influenced by a combination of demographic trends, fiscal policies, and economic cycles. While the current trend suggests a gradual increase in the debt-to-GDP ratio and potential slowing of economic growth due to demographic shifts, there is a possibility of higher growth if favorable conditions align.
