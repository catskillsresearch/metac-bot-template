To forecast the percentage of Americans who will be obese or overweight in 2030, we need to consider several factors that influence the prevalence of obesity and overweight conditions. These factors include current trends, expert opinions, potential public health interventions, economic conditions, and technological advancements.

The timeframe until 2030 is approximately 15 years, providing a window for various influences to shape the outcome. Historically, the trend has shown a steady increase in obesity and overweight rates globally. If this trend continues, the percentage of the American population affected by obesity and overweight conditions is expected to rise significantly.

Current data suggests that around 40% of the world's population is currently overweight or obese. Experts predict that this figure could reach 50% by 2030 and potentially 60% by 2050 if current trends persist. This projection is supported by multiple studies and reports from organizations such as the World Obesity Federation and The Lancet.

Several scenarios could influence the outcome:

1. **Low Outcome Scenario:** A global health crisis, such as a pandemic, could lead to widespread lifestyle changes, including improved diets and increased physical activity. Additionally, significant advancements in medical technology or the implementation of strict public health policies, including taxes on unhealthy foods and mandatory physical education, could lead to a substantial decrease in obesity rates.

2. **High Outcome Scenario:** A global economic downturn could lead to increased consumption of cheap, high-calorie foods, exacerbating the obesity problem. Technological advancements that reduce physical activity, such as the widespread adoption of autonomous vehicles or further sedentary lifestyles due to work-from-home trends, could accelerate obesity rates. Furthermore, a rapid increase in sedentary lifestyles combined with the widespread availability of highly processed, high-calorie foods could drive obesity rates higher.

Considering these factors, the forecast for the percentage of Americans who will be obese or overweight in 2030 is as follows:
