Bitcoin's price trajectory by 2030 is influenced by a multitude of factors, including historical trends, expert opinions, and potential geopolitical and regulatory scenarios. The current price of Bitcoin is approximately 97,615 dollars. If this price remains unchanged, it is unlikely that Bitcoin will reach 1 million dollars by 2030. However, historical data shows that Bitcoin has experienced exponential growth, increasing in value by 100 times over the past decade. This trend, if continued, suggests that Bitcoin could reach significant price increases by 2030. Experts and market analysts have varied predictions, with some estimating prices as high as 1.5 million dollars by 2030, while others are more conservative, placing the price around 1 million dollars.

Several unexpected scenarios could impact Bitcoin's price. A significant regulatory crackdown on cryptocurrencies globally could severely limit Bitcoin's growth, leading to a stagnation or decline in its value. Conversely, widespread adoption of Bitcoin as a global reserve currency or a major technological breakthrough that enhances its scalability and security could drive its price to unprecedented heights. Additionally, geopolitical events or economic crises could lead to a surge in demand for Bitcoin as a safe haven asset, further boosting its price.

Technological advancements, such as improvements in blockchain technology or increased institutional adoption, could also contribute to Bitcoin's price appreciation. However, major security breaches or hacking incidents affecting Bitcoin exchanges could erode investor confidence and negatively impact its value.

Given these factors, a probabilistic assessment of Bitcoin's price by 2030 can be made. The following percentiles reflect the range of possible outcomes:
