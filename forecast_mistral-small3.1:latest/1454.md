China's current political and civil liberties landscape suggests a consistent trend of repression and control, which is likely to persist or even intensify in the coming years. The status quo indicates that China will continue to be classified as "not free," with a score around 9 points, based on recent reports from Freedom House. This assessment is supported by the expectations of experts and market analyses, which predict that China will maintain its authoritarian grip, leading to a stable or slightly declining score.

The current trend of increasing repression in China and Hong Kong further reinforces the likelihood of China's score decreasing. This trend is driven by continued suppression of political dissent, civil society, and human rights, which could push China's score below its current level. Conversely, Taiwan's score might remain stable or even increase slightly if it continues to strengthen its democratic institutions.

Unexpected scenarios that could result in a low outcome include significant political upheaval leading to an even more repressive regime in China. This could involve a crackdown on civil society, increased surveillance, and stricter controls on freedom of speech and assembly, pushing China's score below 9 points. Conversely, an unexpected scenario that could result in a higher outcome would be a sudden and substantial relaxation of political controls in China, leading to greater freedoms for its citizens. This could involve the release of political prisoners, the allowance of independent media, and the promotion of human rights, potentially pushing China's score above 9 points.

Given the consistent trend of repression and the expectations of experts, it is reasonable to forecast that China's aggregate score for the calendar year 2028 will likely remain around its current level or slightly decline. However, considering the possibility of unexpected scenarios, a probabilistic assessment can be made as follows:
