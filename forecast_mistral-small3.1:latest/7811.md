### Rationale

#### Time Frame
We have approximately 15 years until 2035, which is the midpoint for our analysis. This period allows for significant geopolitical shifts, technological advancements, and potential nuclear proliferation.

#### Status Quo Scenario
If current trends remain unchanged, the global nuclear stockpile is likely to stay relatively stable. As of now, the world has around 12,000 nuclear warheads. Without major disruptions or new agreements, this number could see a slight increase due to ongoing nuclear programs in countries like North Korea and Iran. Major nuclear powers like the US, Russia, and China will likely maintain their current arsenals with minor upgrades.

#### Continuation of Current Trends
If the current trends continue, we can expect a more significant escalation in nuclear weapons stockpiles. North Korea, with potential Russian assistance, could increase its arsenal from 50 to 300 weapons by 2035. Iran might develop nuclear weapons, adding to the global stockpile. China and Russia might expand their arsenals in response to perceived threats, while the US and UK could modernize their arsenals without a dramatic increase in numbers.

#### Expert and Market Expectations
Experts and markets anticipate a mixed scenario. There is a consensus that North Korea's arsenal could grow significantly, with Iran's nuclear ambitions being a major concern. Russia and China are likely to maintain or increase their arsenals due to geopolitical tensions. The US and UK are expected to modernize their arsenals but not dramatically increase the number of weapons.

#### Low Outcome Scenario
A low outcome could occur if significant international diplomacy leads to nuclear disarmament agreements. Economic sanctions and technological barriers could prevent North Korea and Iran from expanding their arsenals. A global shift towards renewable energy could reduce the strategic importance of nuclear weapons, leading to a decrease in stockpiles.

#### High Outcome Scenario
A high outcome could occur if geopolitical tensions escalate significantly, leading to a new arms race. Technological advancements could make nuclear weapons more accessible and cheaper to produce. A major conflict or crisis could prompt countries to rapidly increase their nuclear arsenals, leading to a substantial rise in the global stockpile.
