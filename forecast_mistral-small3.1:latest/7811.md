The timeframe for the outcome is approximately 9.5 to 10 years, until 2035. The current status quo, assuming no changes, suggests that the UK has around 225 nuclear warheads, while North Korea possesses an estimated 50 nuclear warheads. If current trends continue, these numbers are likely to shift. The UK may slightly reduce its arsenal due to aging infrastructure and maintenance issues but could modernize its remaining weapons, potentially reducing the number to around 180 warheads by the mid-2020s and 120 by the mid-2030s. Conversely, North Korea, with possible assistance from Russia or other rogue states, could significantly increase its arsenal, potentially reaching around 300 warheads by 2035.

Experts generally anticipate that the UK will maintain its nuclear deterrent, possibly reducing the number of warheads but enhancing the sophistication of its arsenal. Similarly, analysts expect North Korea to expand its nuclear capabilities, potentially surpassing the UK's stockpile. This expectation is bolstered by projections that China's nuclear arsenal will grow substantially, reaching around 1,500 warheads by 2035, and other countries may follow suit, contributing to a global increase in nuclear weapons.

Several unexpected scenarios could result in lower outcomes. For instance, significant economic constraints or political pressures could force the UK to drastically reduce its nuclear stockpile. Similarly, severe international sanctions or internal political instability could halt North Korea's nuclear program, limiting its arsenal to around 100 warheads. Conversely, escalating geopolitical tensions or substantial technological and material support from other nuclear states could lead to a rapid increase in nuclear arsenals. For example, if North Korea receives advanced nuclear technology from China or Russia, it might develop over 400 warheads by 2035. Additionally, a major global conflict or a significant increase in nuclear proliferation could lead to a rapid escalation in the number of nuclear weapons worldwide.

The global nuclear landscape is influenced by multiple factors, including technological advancements, geopolitical tensions, and international relations. Countries like the UK and North Korea are at different stages of nuclear development, with the UK focusing on modernization and reduction while North Korea aims for rapid expansion. The expectations of experts and the potential for unexpected scenarios highlight the dynamic and uncertain nature of nuclear proliferation.
