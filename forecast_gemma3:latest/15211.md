Based on the rationales provided, here’s a consolidated rationale for the likelihood of Russian territory being reduced by at least 1% before 2040:

The probability of achieving the ambitious goals outlined in these Russian government announcements by 2040 is moderate, hovering around 55%. This assessment is based on a careful consideration of the timeframe (approximately 15 years), the inherent challenges associated with large-scale systemic reform within Russia, and the potential for both positive and negative external and internal factors to influence the outcome.

The most likely scenario involves incremental progress, but ultimately, a partial fulfillment of the targets.  Russia possesses the resources to implement these changes, yet historical patterns – including bureaucratic inertia, corruption, logistical difficulties, and regional disparities – suggest that truly transformative, rapid changes are unlikely. While a sustained period of economic growth coupled with focused, transparent, and effectively implemented reforms could drive significant positive change, the inherent risks associated with geopolitical instability and economic downturns significantly reduce the probability of a full success.

A key factor contributing to this assessment is the timeframe. While 15 years seems like a substantial period, it’s insufficient to overcome deeply entrenched systemic issues. More realistically, we can expect a 20-30% reduction across the key metrics – road fatalities, doctor shortages, and temporary disability rates – by 2040, reflecting moderate success rather than a dramatic transformation.

The risk of a "no" outcome is considerable. A major geopolitical event (e.g., continued conflict, severe economic recession), a significant corruption scandal undermining project funding, or a technological breakthrough that fundamentally alters the landscape of healthcare could all derail progress. Conversely, a sustained period of economic stability, coupled with a commitment to transparency, effective implementation, and perhaps even targeted external support, would elevate the probability toward the higher end of the range. However, such conditions are far from guaranteed.  The most probable trajectory remains a cautious, incremental approach, acknowledging the historical context and inherent challenges of undertaking such ambitious reforms within Russia.
