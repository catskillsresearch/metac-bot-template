The most likely outcome, given the available information and the inherent uncertainties, is a slow, incremental shift towards greater cooperation between Saudi Arabia and Israel. This would involve continued discreet communication channels, gradual expansion of security cooperation (likely focused on missile defense and counter-terrorism), and potentially limited economic engagement. However, a full-fledged normalization agreement – with all its political and diplomatic implications – remains unlikely in this timeframe. The key obstacles – Iran’s nuclear program, Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and human rights concerns in Saudi Arabia – would remain significant barriers. While a definitive "Yes" outcome (normalization agreement) is still a significant challenge, there is a moderate chance of progress if certain conditions align. A major breakthrough hinges on verifiable progress regarding Iran’s nuclear ambitions, a demonstrable de-escalation of regional tensions, and a shift in US policy, most likely orchestrated by a pro-Israel administration. The possibility of a comprehensive agreement is therefore linked to a confluence of events – a breakthrough in the nuclear negotiations, a significant shift in regional dynamics, and a supportive political environment. This represents a cautious, phased approach, acknowledging the complexity of the situation and the multiple factors that could derail progress.
