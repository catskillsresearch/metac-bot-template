Based on the rationales provided, the most likely outcome is that significant international recognition and commercial success for any science fiction literature originally written in Spanish winning a major science fiction award before 2031 is still a relatively low probability. The key drivers of this outcome are contingent on a confluence of factors, primarily involving increased global attention to Spanish-language science fiction and a degree of fortuitous circumstance.

The most probable scenario involves sustained positive media coverage surrounding a specific title, most notably “Expediente Hermes,” culminating in a significant international translation and marketing campaign. This would need to be supported by a positive reception from influential science fiction reviewers and, crucially, a successful translation that resonates with a wider audience. A further element of luck would be required - the emergence of a genuine, sustained trend within the science fiction genre that elevates the visibility of Spanish-language works. Without this sustained momentum, the awards themselves would likely remain relatively niche, and the potential for significant, global recognition for the winners remains limited. The possibility of a large, established publisher taking an interest in "Expediente Hermes" and investing in its translation and promotion is a critical factor, alongside a review by a major publication that generates substantial buzz.  Ultimately, the overall probability remains relatively low, driven by the competitive nature of the literary awards landscape and the challenges of gaining international recognition for works originating in a language other than English.
