Based on the rationales provided, here’s a synthesized rationale for the likelihood of a significant shift in Venezuela’s political landscape by 2050:

The probability of a substantial, positive shift in Venezuela’s political landscape by 2050 remains low, but not negligible. The prevailing status quo – characterized by continued authoritarian rule under Nicolás Maduro, economic hardship, and international isolation – is the most likely outcome if nothing changes. This scenario, mirroring the consolidated assessments across all forecasts, points to a continued frozen conflict, a stalemate marked by instability and limited progress. The fragmented opposition, the entrenched power of the regime, and the geopolitical realities (including Russia’s support for Maduro and China’s economic ties) create significant barriers to change. A decisive “No” outcome – involving a military coup, a widespread uprising, or a dramatic shift in international policy resulting in Maduro’s downfall – is considered highly improbable given the current trajectory.

However, a “Yes” outcome, while less probable, is not entirely dismissed. This requires a complex and unlikely convergence of factors, including a united and powerful opposition movement, a significant change in international policy (perhaps driven by an economic collapse or Maduro’s miscalculation), and a critical mass of public discontent within Venezuela. The timeframe – approximately 14 to 18 months – provides a limited window for such a dramatic shift to occur before the end of the forecasting period. Despite the potential for a significant, positive transformation, the inherent instability, the entrenched power structures, and the persistent challenges facing Venezuela suggest that a sustained, democratic transition is a long shot. Therefore, based on the combined assessment, a moderate probability of approximately 20% is assigned to a significant positive shift.
