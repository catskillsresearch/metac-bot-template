Given the current political climate, Pierre Poilievre’s path to becoming Prime Minister of Canada within the next 60-65 days leading up to the October 2025 election is marked by considerable uncertainty, but leans toward a probable victory. The remaining time provides ample opportunity for shifts in public opinion and unforeseen events to influence the outcome. The Conservative Party’s momentum, built on a focused message addressing economic concerns and perceived Liberal shortcomings, currently holds a significant advantage. However, a crucial factor is the ability of the Conservatives to maintain this momentum and effectively counter potential challenges, including a potential economic downturn or a rapid shift in Liberal messaging. The status quo, characterized by a close race with the Liberals retaining a slight lead, remains a plausible scenario. Unexpected events, such as a major economic crisis or a significant scandal, could dramatically alter the landscape and shift the probability towards a ‘No’ outcome. Conversely, a sustained Conservative lead, coupled with Poilievre’s continued ability to frame the debate around economic issues and resonate with disaffected voters, suggests a strong likelihood of victory. The overall probability, therefore, reflects this complex interplay of factors, centering around a probable Conservative win, although a close and contested election.
