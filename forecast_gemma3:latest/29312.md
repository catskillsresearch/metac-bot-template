Given the rationale from all five forecasts, the most probable outcome regarding the respiratory virus landscape by June 23, 2025, is a continuation of elevated, fluctuating activity across multiple viruses (influenza, RSV, and COVID-19). While significant shifts are possible, the prevailing trend suggests a persistent “quad-demic” situation with ongoing regional variations, reliance on existing mitigation strategies, and moderate hospitalization rates. The possibility of a dramatically different outcome – such as the rapid emergence of a highly virulent new virus or the development and widespread deployment of a truly broad-spectrum antiviral – remains, but is considered less likely given the inherent adaptability of viruses, the complexities of antiviral development, and the limitations of current predictive models. The most plausible scenario involves a cyclical, sustained level of respiratory illness activity, managed through ongoing public health efforts and the availability of treatments, but without a fundamental shift in the overall landscape.
