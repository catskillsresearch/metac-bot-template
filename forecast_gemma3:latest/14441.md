Based on the rationales provided, the following constitutes a consolidated rationale for assessing the likelihood of at least three lithium mines operating in the US before 2030:

The likelihood of three or more lithium mines operating in the US by 2030 remains uncertain, exhibiting a moderate probability of approximately 45%. The primary driver of this uncertainty stems from a confluence of factors, including technological development, geopolitical risks, permitting complexities, and fluctuating market demand. While incremental progress is expected, a significant shift in the global lithium supply landscape is not guaranteed.

Currently, the most probable near-term scenario involves continued, albeit slow, development of existing projects like the Silver Peak expansion. However, substantial delays remain due to the typical challenges associated with large-scale mining projects – permitting processes, environmental reviews, and potential opposition. The outcome for Russia's lithium production plans remains highly sensitive to geopolitical developments and the ability to overcome significant production hurdles.

Technological advancements, specifically the adoption of Direct Lithium Extraction (DLE) technologies, represent a key wildcard. While pilot projects and smaller-scale deployments are expected, widespread commercialization and a truly transformative impact on global supply are not assured. Success hinges on overcoming technological challenges, achieving cost-effectiveness, and navigating regulatory approvals.

Looking further out, a "yes" outcome – characterized by multiple operating mines, including a substantial contribution from Russia – requires a favorable combination of circumstances: continued strong global demand for EVs, relatively stable geopolitical conditions, and successful technological breakthroughs in DLE. Conversely, a “no” outcome could materialize due to severe geopolitical instability, a decline in EV demand, or continued technological stagnation. The overall outlook is therefore characterized by a measured degree of optimism, tempered by substantial risk. Achieving a significant and sustained increase in US lithium production before 2030 remains plausible, but dependent on navigating complex and evolving circumstances.
