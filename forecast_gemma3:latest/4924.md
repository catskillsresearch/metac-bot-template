The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints’ stance on same-sex marriage by 2030 is a complex issue deeply rooted in theological tradition, historical practices, and evolving social pressures. Given the current state of affairs, a conservative outcome remains the most probable, though the situation is dynamic and subject to shifts. The core of this forecast rests on the recognition of persistent internal divisions and external pressures.

If nothing changes, the Church will likely maintain a cautious, traditional approach, continuing to defend its historical stances on marriage and family, while navigating ongoing debates within its global membership. This trajectory is reinforced by a significant conservative element within the Church and a resistance to rapid social change. The church’s global reach and historical practices offer considerable inertia. However, this scenario is tempered by a substantial segment of younger members who increasingly question traditional views, contributing to a persistent, if contained, pressure for greater inclusion.

A “No” outcome, wherein the Church steadfastly rejects further engagement or modification of its policies, remains a significant possibility. This could be fueled by sustained resistance within the church itself – perhaps through organized petitions, continued theological arguments, or a political backlash against any attempts at reform. Furthermore, a global rejection of the prompt's premise – an insistence on maintaining the existing, more conservative stance – would solidify this outcome.

Conversely, a “Yes” outcome, involving a dramatic shift in the Church’s stance towards LGBTQ+ issues, although less probable, is not entirely dismissed. This would require a demonstrable and widely accepted shift within the Church leadership, possibly driven by new doctrines, softened restrictions, or a greater emphasis on inclusivity. This could be facilitated by a growing number of younger members, but such a transition would need to overcome considerable resistance. It is dependent on an internal realignment within the Church, influenced by evolving public opinion and potentially combined with a supportive legal environment.

The timeframe until 2030 provides approximately 65 days of potential developments, and the current legal and social landscape, particularly the Supreme Court’s ongoing involvement, significantly influences this probability. A likely scenario involves ongoing legal challenges, continued public debates, and fluid legal interpretations, but ultimately, a sustained conservative stance remains the more probable outcome, placing the likelihood of a significant change at approximately 45%.
