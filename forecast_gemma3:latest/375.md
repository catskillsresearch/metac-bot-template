The European banking sector faces ongoing competitive pressures from the US, with a gradual, slow shift towards greater regulatory harmonization within the EU. The European Commission will likely continue to explore ways to support its banking system, but with a cautious approach, influenced by concerns about debt sustainability and the potential for further political fallout. The sporting landscape regarding Russia will remain largely unchanged – Russia will continue to be excluded from UEFA competitions and the 2028 Olympics. However, the situation is dynamic and influenced by a range of factors. A significant, though unlikely, catalyst for change could arise from a substantial economic downturn across Europe, leading to widespread bank failures or near-failures, combined with a renewed push for competitive banking regulations. Alternatively, a dramatic geopolitical event – such as a significant escalation of the Russia-Ukraine conflict – could disrupt the status quo, forcing a rapid reassessment and potentially accelerating regulatory changes. The overall likelihood of a substantial, coordinated shift in the European banking landscape remains moderate, contingent on a confluence of economic, political, and potentially, disruptive external events.
