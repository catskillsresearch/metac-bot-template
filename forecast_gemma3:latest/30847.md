Here’s a synthesized rationale incorporating the best elements from all five forecasts:

The assessment of Argentina’s economic outlook for December 2025, specifically the likelihood of year-over-year inflation remaining below 30%, hinges on a complex interplay of factors and a significant degree of uncertainty. The timeframe available – roughly 13 months as of June 23, 2025 – represents a considerable period for economic developments to unfold, but also a period of heightened vulnerability to unforeseen shocks.

The most probable scenario, representing approximately 65-75% of the likelihood, is a continuation of the existing trends established by the February 2025 forecasts. This entails inflation remaining stubbornly high, hovering around the 23.2% projection, driven by structural economic weaknesses – including high debt levels, a volatile exchange rate, ingrained inflationary expectations, and the continued impact of austerity measures. Economic growth would likely remain subdued, fluctuating between 1-3%, influenced by agricultural exports and external factors. The peso would continue to experience periods of devaluation, exacerbated by capital flight. However, this baseline scenario reflects the market’s reasonable confidence in the Milei administration’s policy changes and the initial positive impact of those changes.

However, a “No” outcome – a significant deviation from the projected 23.2% inflation – carries a notable probability, roughly 20-30%. This could materialize from several disruptive events. A severe shock, such as a collapse in agricultural exports due to global weather events or a dramatic deterioration in international relations leading to trade restrictions, would dramatically alter the economic landscape. Equally concerning is a complete failure of the austerity measures to control inflation, coupled with a loss of investor confidence.  A major IMF funding withdrawal would also trigger this outcome.

Conversely, a “Yes” outcome – a reduction in the inflation forecast – represents a less likely, but still plausible, scenario, holding roughly 10-20% probability. This would necessitate sustained macroeconomic stability, fueled by the successful implementation of Milei’s reforms, robust export growth, and a coordinated effort by the central bank to maintain a credible monetary policy.  Furthermore, a favorable global economic environment – continued moderate global growth and stable commodity prices – would bolster this outcome. Ultimately, a sustained shift in Argentinian economic psychology, believing that the reforms were working, would be essential.  The existing forecasts reflect a cautiously optimistic assessment, grounded in the recognition of significant challenges and the potential for disruptive events.
