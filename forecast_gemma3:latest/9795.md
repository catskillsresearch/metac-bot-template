The gradual adoption of AI in reproductive technologies, driven by continuous innovation and regulatory uncertainty, is likely to continue. A significant shift in global attitudes and a technological breakthrough – specifically, a reliable method for predicting intelligence through preimplantation genetic testing – could accelerate the trend. However, stringent regulatory action, triggered by ethical concerns or a catastrophic technological failure, could halt the development and deployment of this technology. A confluence of factors—a strategic breakthrough, a cultural shift, and the potential for disruption—suggests a probability of 68% for widespread adoption.
