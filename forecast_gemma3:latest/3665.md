Based on the rationales provided, here’s a consolidated rationale for the likelihood of renewable energy contributing between 25% and 48% to global electricity production in 2030:

The likelihood of this outcome is significantly influenced by a complex interplay of economic, technological, and political factors. The most probable scenario envisions a gradual, yet substantial, increase in renewable energy’s contribution to global electricity production.  A baseline assumption is that continued, albeit measured, growth will continue, driven by sustained reductions in the costs of solar and wind technologies, alongside the ongoing implementation of supportive government policies – including incentives and mandates. However, this growth is not guaranteed. 

A major disruptive event, such as a severe global recession coupled with heightened geopolitical instability, could significantly hinder progress, returning investment towards traditional energy sources and halting, or reversing, the current trajectory. The key challenge remains intermittency, but a breakthrough in energy storage, like significantly improved and cheaper battery technology, would be pivotal in addressing this constraint.  Furthermore, a coordinated global agreement on ambitious carbon reduction targets, combined with robust financial investments and streamlined permitting, would accelerate deployment. 

A critical factor is the pace of innovation in materials science, specifically in reducing the waste from aging renewable infrastructure, particularly wind turbine blades.  A “no” outcome, while plausible, is contingent on a series of negative events, including an economic downturn, geopolitical conflict, or a failure to address the intermittency challenge.  Conversely, a “yes” outcome relies on a perfect storm: a technological breakthrough in storage, a coordinated global effort, and innovation in materials science. Considering all of these uncertainties, the most realistic probability lies around 65%, acknowledging that this is a dynamic landscape, susceptible to significant shifts based on unforeseen developments.
