Here’s a consolidated rationale, synthesizing the best elements from all five forecasts:

The prospects for a sustained bilateral ceasefire or peace agreement in the Russo-Ukraine conflict remain exceptionally uncertain, with a high probability of continued conflict over the next 18-24 months. The situation is characterized by a complex interplay of military actions, diplomatic efforts, and shifting geopolitical alliances, creating a volatile and unpredictable environment.

The most likely immediate outcome is a continuation of the ‘grinding war of attrition’ – a protracted, low-intensity conflict with fluctuating front lines, sporadic ceasefires (often fragile and short-lived), and continued Western support for Ukraine, potentially subject to fluctuating intensity based on political considerations. Diplomatic efforts will likely remain largely unproductive, hampered by deeply entrenched positions and disagreements, particularly regarding territorial integrity and security guarantees. The overall situation will continue to drain resources and lives, with no readily apparent path towards a definitive settlement. This scenario – a continuation of the current state of affairs – carries approximately 60% probability.

However, several potential, albeit less probable, developments could shift the trajectory. A significant and sudden escalation – perhaps triggered by a tactical intelligence failure or a coordinated cyberattack – could shatter the existing fragile ceasefire, triggering a more intense phase of the conflict. Conversely, a major economic downturn or a leadership change could create an opportunity for a negotiated settlement, though the terms of such an agreement remain highly uncertain. A sudden, coordinated intervention by a previously unheard-of mediating power, offering substantial financial guarantees and facilitating rapid negotiations, represents a smaller but significant possibility. The probability of a rapid, decisive Ukrainian counteroffensive supported by a dramatic shift in Western military aid, leading to a swift and comprehensive peace agreement, remains low but cannot be entirely discounted.

Ultimately, the outcome hinges on a confluence of unpredictable events – tactical intelligence failures, leadership changes, shifts in the global economic landscape, and the willingness of both sides to compromise. The near-term outlook suggests a continued, difficult struggle, with a reasonable chance of a more substantial shift occurring only if multiple, unlikely factors converge simultaneously. The period up to December 2025 is likely to be characterized by incremental advances and setbacks, with the possibility of a breakthrough agreement remaining elusive.
