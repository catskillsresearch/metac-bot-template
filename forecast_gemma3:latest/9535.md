Here’s a synthesized rationale incorporating the best elements from each forecast, aiming for a cohesive and detailed assessment:

The likelihood of the USA becoming the first country to routinely select newborns for intelligence based on embryo screening is subject to considerable uncertainty, but leans towards a significant, though not absolute, probability of success over the next 18-24 months. Initial estimates suggest a baseline of around 30-40% probability, largely driven by the existing, albeit cautious, interest in PGD and preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD). However, several factors suggest a rising trend. 

The current status quo, characterized by incremental advancements in IVF technology and ongoing ethical debates, represents a stability at approximately 35%. However, several emerging trends point towards a significant shift. The rapid pace of technological development in artificial intelligence and genetic engineering, as highlighted in forecasts 1, 4, and 5, presents the most compelling drivers. Specifically, breakthroughs in AI algorithms capable of reliably assessing “intelligence potential” – coupled with decreasing costs and increased accessibility – could dramatically alter the landscape.  Furthermore, a gradual shift in public perception, fueled by media narratives (as suggested in forecasts 3 and 4), may normalize the concept of “optimizing” human traits, particularly among affluent segments of the population.

A major impediment remains the potential for regulatory backlash. Forecasts 2 and 3 emphasize the risk of a coordinated global response, potentially triggered by ethical objections, religious concerns, or legal challenges. This represents a substantial downside risk, potentially reducing the probability to 20-25%. However, a sustained period of unchecked technological advancement, combined with limited international cooperation, favors a gradual erosion of these restrictions. 

The most likely scenario – achieving a 50-60% probability within the timeframe – involves a confluence of factors: continuing AI advancements, a degree of public acceptance (driven by successes and a normalization of genetic enhancement), and a lack of immediate, effective global regulation. The influence of a charismatic public figure, as suggested in forecast 3, could further accelerate this trend. While a catastrophic regulatory response remains a possibility (reducing the probability to 15-20%), the momentum towards embryo selection for intelligence appears to be building and is likely to result in substantial, if not complete, adoption within the next decade.
