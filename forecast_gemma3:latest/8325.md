The Nigerian agricultural research landscape is likely to experience a gradual, incremental shift, albeit with significant underlying challenges. The most probable outcome is a continuation of the existing situation: Nigerian agricultural research institutions will operate under constraints – underfunded, outdated infrastructure, and a lack of impactful research due to a persistent lack of political and budgetary support. The evaluation will be completed, its recommendations largely ignored, and the institutes will remain largely ineffective, contributing minimally to the country’s food security goals. However, a sustained, visible commitment from the Tinubu administration, coupled with substantial and consistent investment—financial, infrastructural, and human capital—into the research institutes, aligned with the “Economic Development” project goals, carries a 45% probability of success. This hinges on several critical factors: consistent funding, infrastructure improvements, a shift in research priorities, strengthened partnerships, and a demonstrated commitment to tangible results, including technology transfer and increased agricultural productivity. The inherent risk remains high due to Nigeria's history of underinvestment in research and the potential for political instability or economic downturns to derail the initiative.
