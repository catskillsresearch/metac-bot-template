Here’s a consolidated rationale, drawing the best elements from all five forecasts:

The core question centers on the likelihood of the United States returning military hardware left behind in Afghanistan following the 2021 withdrawal. Predicting this outcome is profoundly complex, driven by a confluence of political, security, and strategic factors. Given the current timeframe – approximately 18-24 months from June 2025 – a definitive resolution appears unlikely. The most probable scenario, representing roughly 60-70% of the probability, is a persistent ‘status quo’ – a continuation of the existing dynamic. This involves the Taliban maintaining control of the equipment, utilizing it for propaganda and consolidating its authority, while the US continues a cautious, largely symbolic engagement, focused primarily on counterterrorism and intelligence gathering. Diplomatic exchanges will remain strained, and the issue will largely fade from the headlines. However, a significant degree of uncertainty remains due to the volatile nature of the Afghan situation and potential shifts in US foreign policy.

Several potential scenarios could disrupt this equilibrium. A "No" outcome – a continued stalemate – is possible if the Biden administration maintains its current approach, compounded by the Taliban’s strengthened position. Alternatively, a more destabilizing “Yes” outcome – the return of some equipment – could materialize under specific, albeit unlikely, conditions. This would likely require a dramatic shift in US policy, potentially driven by a renewed strategic imperative related to China’s influence in the region. Such a shift would necessitate a willingness to engage with the Taliban, possibly facilitated by a third party, and would require the Taliban to demonstrate a commitment to security and cooperation. Furthermore, a heightened level of instability within Afghanistan – a major escalation of violence, perhaps linked to ISIS-K – could force the US to re-evaluate its position. Conversely, a protracted, low-level conflict, such as the one envisioned in Forecast 3, representing roughly 15-20% of the probability, is another potential outcome. Finally, a less likely but impactful “Yes” outcome, potentially triggered by Donald Trump's return to power and a renewed focus on the issue, carries approximately 15-20% probability.

Ultimately, forecasting this situation requires acknowledging the interconnectedness of these factors and the inherent unpredictability of the Afghan context. The prevailing conditions – the Taliban’s consolidated power, the US’s cautious approach, and the broader regional security landscape – strongly suggest a continued state of frozen tension, rather than a rapid and decisive resolution.
