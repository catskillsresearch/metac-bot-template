Based on the provided forecasts, the most probable scenario regarding Emmanuel Macron’s continued presidency involves a cautious approach, prioritizing stability and avoiding immediate action. The dominant factors influencing this assessment are a recognition of significant political risks associated with dissolving parliament and holding early elections, alongside a need to maintain a majority within his government. The core rationale is as follows:

The most likely outcome remains that Emmanuel Macron will not dissolve parliament and hold early elections within the next 65 days. Macron’s administration is operating with a careful awareness of the considerable risks associated with early elections, particularly the potential for the ‘National Rally’ to capitalize on any perceived weakness or instability. Current polling data show a slight rise in Macron’s approval rating, contributing to this cautious stance. The administration’s strategy involves navigating ongoing challenges within the existing parliamentary framework, seeking incremental policy adjustments, and attempting to maintain a majority through careful management.

However, several scenarios could trigger a shift away from this status quo. A significant, unforeseen economic downturn—a major recession or a sharp increase in inflation—could dramatically alter the political calculus, potentially strengthening Macron’s hand by presenting him as a responsible leader. Alternatively, a major security crisis – a terrorist attack or a heightened escalation of the conflict in Ukraine – could galvanize public support and force Macron’s hand.  A sustained, significant surge in support for the ‘National Rally’, coupled with worsening economic conditions, would also present a compelling argument for a change in leadership.  Crucially, this ‘Yes’ outcome requires that the ‘National Rally’ fails to successfully exploit any of these vulnerabilities. Therefore, a key element driving the overall probability remains the ongoing stability of the political landscape and the continued efforts of Macron’s administration to manage the risks associated with his position.
