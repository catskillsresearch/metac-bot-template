The most likely scenario over the next 1.5 years is continued heightened tensions, but no open, large-scale conflict. The US and China will continue to engage in a strategic competition, focusing on technological dominance (particularly AI), economic influence, and geopolitical positioning. There will be further export controls, sanctions, and diplomatic pressure. Military exercises will continue, and rhetoric will remain firmly anti-competitive. The world will remain in a state of cautious vigilance, with periodic flare-ups of incidents (e.g., cyberattacks, maritime standoffs) but no escalation into all-out war. The situation will largely remain within the parameters of the current strategic competition. A significant and unexpected diplomatic breakthrough occurs. Perhaps a high-level summit produces a comprehensive agreement on AI development standards and safeguards. A major economic downturn globally – a truly devastating global recession – dramatically alters the strategic calculus for both sides, prioritizing economic stability over geopolitical competition. Or, a major, truly disruptive technological advance occurs that shifts the balance of power in a way neither side can immediately capitalize on, diverting attention away from the existing tensions. The world remains in a state of heightened tension, characterized by strategic posturing, trade disputes, and military exercises, all while avoiding a catastrophic, full-scale war.  The risk of miscalculation and escalation remains persistent due to the complex geopolitical landscape and the lack of robust de-escalation protocols. The dynamics are fluid, and the potential for unintended consequences remains a key factor in assessing the probability of conflict.
