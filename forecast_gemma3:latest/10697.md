Given the diverse forecasts, a consolidated rationale for estimating the percentage of new car sales in China that will be electric by 2035 reflects a cautious yet optimistic outlook. The inherent uncertainty surrounding technological advancements, policy shifts, and global economic conditions dictates a range of potential outcomes.  The most plausible scenario acknowledges the current trajectory, incorporating the most frequently cited expectations while accounting for potential disruptions.

The baseline expectation is a significant shift toward electric vehicles. Given the numerous projections ranging from 30% to 98%, a reasonable estimate, based on consolidating the forecasts, is a market share of approximately 60% by 2035. This aligns with the core consensus: China's aggressive policies and global efforts are driving adoption, and technological improvements – particularly in battery technology – will continue to fuel growth. However, several factors could influence the actual outcome.

A moderately conservative estimate places the percentage in the range of 55-65%, acknowledging that China's leadership will likely remain a key driver.  The potential for a significant technological breakthrough—specifically, the widespread adoption of solid-state batteries—could push the market share considerably higher, potentially exceeding 75%. Conversely, an unexpected global economic recession or a major technological setback could reduce the market share to around 40-50%, highlighting the sensitivity to external shocks.  Therefore, while the long-term trend is undeniably towards increased EV adoption, it’s crucial to recognize that the precise percentage by 2035 remains subject to a degree of uncertainty.  Ultimately, a 60-75% market share by 2035 seems the most probable, given the combined insights of the available forecasts.
