Based on the rationales provided, the following constitutes a consolidated rationale:

The likelihood of Donald Trump winning the 2024 election and retaining supreme executive power past 2028 remains a significant, though not assured, probability. The timeframe – roughly 3 to 4 years – presents both opportunity and challenge. The most probable outcome, representing approximately 65-70% of the likelihood, is a continuation of the status quo. This stems from several key factors. Firstly, Donald Trump’s continued political activity, his established base of support, and his focus on contentious issues—particularly those revolving around transgender athletes, immigration, and Title IX—remain central to the political landscape. Secondly, the deeply polarized electorate and the existing mechanisms of the Electoral College provide a stable environment for his continued influence. The Republican party, largely aligned with his views, presents a formidable obstacle to any alternative candidate. 

However, a “No” outcome – a significant shift in the political landscape – is not entirely out of the question. This would necessitate a substantial disruption, such as a complete fracturing of the Republican party, a surge in progressive policies gaining widespread national support, a major economic downturn damaging Trump’s image, or a dramatic, unforeseen geopolitical event. 

Ultimately, a “Yes” outcome—Trump’s re-election—depends on his ability to maintain his current trajectory: successfully navigating ongoing legal challenges, effectively mobilizing his base, capitalizing on anxieties, and leveraging events like the 2028 Olympics. The news snippets themselves become relevant precisely because they demonstrate Trump's strategic activity and the continuing relevance of his policies. Despite the uncertainty and the potential for disruption, the existing conditions – particularly Trump’s sustained influence – favor a continuation of the status quo and a significant chance of him securing a second term.
