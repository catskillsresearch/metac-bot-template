Based on the provided forecasts, a consistent rationale for predicting the number of communist states in 2050 can be constructed as follows:

The future state of communist states in 2050 is deeply uncertain, heavily influenced by a complex interplay of economic, geopolitical, and technological forces. The most likely scenario reflects a world facing persistent challenges – sluggish global growth, increasing geopolitical instability, and significant technological disruption. These factors are expected to continue hindering the expansion and consolidation of communist states. The current trend points towards a moderate decline in the number of states achieving high-income status by 2030, with approximately 8-12 high-income states globally. This trend suggests a further contraction in communist states, though the precise number is subject to considerable volatility.

The most significant risk factor is a severe global recession or geopolitical crisis, which could dramatically exacerbate existing vulnerabilities in developing economies and further undermine the viability of communist systems, potentially pushing the number of such states below 10 by 2030. Conversely, a transformative technological breakthrough – particularly in energy (like fusion) or advanced manufacturing – could inject a significant boost into certain developing economies, potentially allowing for a modest increase in communist states. However, this is considered a low-probability event.

The pace of progress in developing economies remains crucial. While individual states like Vietnam demonstrate potential, broader economic stagnation or increased instability could negate this. Furthermore, the continued rise of protectionism and fragmentation of the global economy will create headwinds for countries attempting to adopt communist models. Given the inherent challenges associated with centralized economic planning and the lack of responsiveness to market signals, the long-term sustainability of communist systems is questioned. 

The forecasts consistently highlight a period of considerable uncertainty and volatility. The possibility of a major, unforeseen geopolitical event or a technological setback significantly increases the risk of a dramatic decline in the number of communist states. While advancements in technology offer potential avenues for growth, their implementation and impact remain highly uncertain. The global landscape is characterized by competing economic models, and the future of communist states will ultimately depend on their ability to adapt to this complex and dynamic environment.  Therefore, a conservative estimate suggests that around 8-12 states will likely retain a communist system by 2050, although this figure is highly susceptible to unforeseen events and shifts in the global political and economic order.
