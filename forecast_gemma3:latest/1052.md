Here's a synthesized rationale incorporating the best elements from all five forecasts, aiming for a comprehensive and consistent picture:

**Synthesized Rationale:**

The question – “Will there be a city on Earth with a population of over 100 million by 2100?” – hinges on the broader question of global population size by that time. Analyzing the available information, the most likely scenario reflects a continuation of existing trends, albeit with some inherent uncertainty.

The core of the projection rests on a sustained, though decelerating, increase in global population.  The time frame – roughly 75-80 years – allows for significant shifts, but the underlying drivers of population growth – births exceeding deaths – are deeply ingrained. The UN's projections of around 10.8 billion by 2100 represent a conservative, yet plausible, outcome. Factors supporting this include continued population growth in developing nations (particularly Africa), ongoing advancements in healthcare extending lifespans, and gradual declines in fertility rates in developed countries. Technological progress in areas like food production and resource management would likely mitigate some of the pressures associated with population growth, though regional disparities would persist.

However, several “no” scenarios represent potential disruptions. A catastrophic global event – such as a severe pandemic with extremely high mortality, a large-scale nuclear war, or a sudden and irreversible climate catastrophe – could dramatically alter the trajectory, leading to a substantial population decline. Equally plausible, though considerably less likely, is a global shift in social norms leading to near-total abstinence from reproduction. 

Despite these potential disruptions, the underlying demographic trends—births outweighing deaths—remain the dominant force.  While a precise population number is difficult to pinpoint, the probability of exceeding 10.8 billion by 2100 is high, likely falling within the range of 11-12 billion. The uncertainty is considerable, influenced by unpredictable events, but based on the totality of the evidence, a substantial global population by 2100 is a highly probable outcome.

Considering all factors, a final probability assessment is: 80%.
