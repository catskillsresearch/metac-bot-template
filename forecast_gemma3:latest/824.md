The most likely outcome of continued development in Chinese fusion research is a gradual, albeit sustained, progression towards fusion technology. Over the next 1.5 to 2 years, we can expect continued investment and expansion of facilities like Shenguang-IV and the Xinghuo project, alongside incremental improvements in plasma confinement, energy gain, and materials science. While achieving sustained, commercially viable fusion power by 2050 remains a significant challenge, China will likely maintain a leading role in fusion research, producing steady, slow increases in energy output, likely staying below 100MW for many years. There is a reasonable chance of encountering technical hurdles, delays, or budgetary constraints, potentially pushing back the 2050 goal. However, a major, unforeseen setback—such as a catastrophic failure in a key experimental facility, or a fundamental limitation discovered in materials science—could derail the entire endeavor, triggering a reassessment and potentially halting progress. Conversely, a confluence of factors—a breakthrough in plasma confinement, advancements in materials, and sustained strong government support—could accelerate progress, bringing the timeline closer to 2045. The most plausible trajectory involves persistent, incremental development, with China continuing to be a global leader in fusion research, even if widespread commercialization remains a distant prospect.
