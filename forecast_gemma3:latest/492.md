Okay, here's a synthesized rationale incorporating the best elements from all five forecasts, aiming for a cohesive and robust explanation:

**Synthesized Rationale for Assessing the Likelihood of a Nuclear Conflict by 2035**

The probability of a major nuclear conflict (defined as a large-scale conflict involving multiple nuclear-armed states) by 2035 warrants careful consideration given current geopolitical trends. While a full-blown, global nuclear war remains unlikely in the immediate term, the underlying risks are demonstrably increasing.

The most likely scenario, assuming *no major shifts* occur, is a continuation of the existing trajectory. The world will likely experience a gradual, slow expansion of nuclear capabilities, primarily driven by regional powers—particularly Iran and Saudi Arabia—responding to perceived threats and maintaining a state of strategic deterrence. South Korea's progress towards nuclear weapons will be slow due to international pressure and technical challenges, while North Korea's trajectory will remain unpredictable. The global number of nuclear weapons will continue to hover around the current level, with ongoing discussions regarding arms control but no breakthroughs. The core dynamic of “mutually assured destruction” (MAD) will continue to provide a degree of restraint.

However, a “No” outcome – the avoidance of large-scale nuclear conflict – hinges on a series of highly unlikely but necessary events. These include a major breakthrough in global arms control and disarmament, coupled with a sustained reduction in regional tensions and a significant increase in international pressure to curtail nuclear programs. This might involve a revitalized New START treaty, a genuine thaw in US-China relations, and a dramatic decrease in regional conflict intensity.  Alternatively, a significant technological shift—such as the development of more accurate or miniaturized nuclear weapons—could drastically alter the risk equation.

Conversely, a "Yes" outcome – a large-scale nuclear conflict – becomes increasingly plausible if several key factors converge. A combination of escalating regional conflicts (particularly in the Middle East and/or East Asia), coupled with a perceived failure of international diplomacy, and advances in nuclear technology, would create a destabilizing environment. A miscalculation, a chain reaction of escalating responses, or a deliberate act of aggression by a rogue state could push the world toward a conflict, with North Korea remaining a consistently disruptive element.  The continued pursuit of nuclear capabilities by nations like Iran and Saudi Arabia significantly elevates this risk.

The timeframe remaining – approximately 1 year and 4 months – represents a critical window. The actions taken (or not taken) in this period will profoundly shape the outlook.  The inherent inertia of international relations, combined with the persistent tensions and uncertainties, suggest that the probability of a nuclear conflict by 2035 is not negligible.
