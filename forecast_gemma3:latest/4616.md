The most likely scenario for life expectancy projections is a gradual, incremental increase, reflecting ongoing advancements in healthcare, public health, and lifestyle factors.  A significant portion of the projected increases would likely be seen among younger generations. However, the trajectory of human lifespan is inherently vulnerable to catastrophic global events – a pandemic of unprecedented severity, a large-scale nuclear conflict, or a sudden, irreversible environmental disaster – which could dramatically reduce life expectancy and invalidate existing projections.  While breakthroughs in areas like senolytics, gene editing, and regenerative medicine hold the *potential* to significantly extend human lifespan, these advancements are likely to occur over a longer timeframe, and their impact would be contingent on substantial scientific and technological progress.  The probability of achieving substantially extended human lifespans within the next few decades, as suggested by some of the projections, remains relatively low, given the inherent challenges of aging and the unpredictable nature of global events.  The overall likelihood of the projections holding true, considering the inherent uncertainty, is estimated to be approximately 55%. This reflects a cautious, realistic assessment that acknowledges both the potential for progress and the significant risks involved.
