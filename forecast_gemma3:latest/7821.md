Based on an analysis of the provided forecasts, a comprehensive rationale for the projected fertility rate in Hungary in 2031 can be constructed as follows:

The prediction of Hungary’s children per woman in 2031 is inherently uncertain, reflecting the complex interplay of demographic, economic, social, and technological factors. Given the current data, which represents a snapshot in June 2025, and acknowledging the limited time horizon for reliable projections, a conservative approach is warranted. The established trend within the EU, specifically the declining fertility rate of 1.38 children per woman, is a dominant factor.  Hungary’s own situation, with a current rate of 1.31, is significantly below this level and indicates a continued downward trajectory unless substantial intervention occurs.

Extrapolating from the existing trend, considering the projected decline of approximately 0.08 children per woman per year, suggests a further decrease in the Hungarian fertility rate over the next decade. However, the exact rate is highly sensitive to unforeseen events.  A moderate projection, reflecting the current trend and incorporating a conservative estimate of 0.15 decline per year, yields a projected rate of approximately 1.16 in 2031. This acknowledges the existing pressures—including economic instability, high living costs, and the general European trend—while allowing for a potential, though not guaranteed, localized boost through government policies.

Furthermore, expert expectations and market sentiment consistently point to a continued decline in European fertility rates. The implications of this decline—including an aging population, shrinking workforce, and increased strain on social security systems—add considerable weight to a pessimistic outlook. While a significant shift in societal attitudes or a technological breakthrough could alter this trajectory, these remain speculative. 

Unforeseen events, such as a major economic recession or a pandemic-induced disruption, could dramatically accelerate the decline. Conversely, a robust, globally coordinated intervention—perhaps involving substantial government support for families, childcare subsidies, and enhanced parental leave—could partially counteract the trend. However, given the established downward momentum, a scenario of dramatic improvement is considered less probable.

Therefore, a reasonable projected fertility rate for Hungary in 2031, based on the available information and considering the inherent uncertainties, is estimated to be around 1.20 children per woman. This rate represents a cautious assessment, acknowledging the significant pressures contributing to a declining fertility rate while allowing for a limited potential for mitigation through policy interventions.
