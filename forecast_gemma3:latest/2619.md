The selection of an openly LGBT Pope before 2050 is a complex and highly uncertain prospect. The primary factors driving this assessment are the current state of the Catholic Church, the health and willingness of Pope Francis to remain in office, and the potential for significant shifts within the Vatican hierarchy and broader global dynamics.

Given the remaining timeframe of approximately 76 days until June 23, 2025, the immediate outlook favors the status quo. Pope Francis’s age (88) and existing health challenges – specifically hospitalization and ongoing respiratory issues – strongly suggest he will remain in office until his natural death or resignation. The Church’s inherent conservatism, coupled with the Vatican’s risk-averse nature, further reinforces this expectation. The ongoing reform process, while initiated by Francis, is likely to proceed slowly and with incremental changes, focusing on areas of least resistance and careful management of internal debates. The issue of LGBTQ+ inclusion, while discussed, remains a highly contentious area with significant resistance from within the Church.

However, several scenarios could alter this trajectory. A catastrophic, irreversible medical event impacting Pope Francis’s health, coupled with a demonstrated loss of cognitive abilities, could trigger a premature resignation. Alternatively, a sustained and dramatic deterioration in his health – perhaps a prolonged period of incapacitating illness – could force a Vatican advisory board to recommend stepping down to protect the Church’s long-term stability. Similarly, the failure of the 2028 Church Assembly to achieve substantive reform could create pressure for a new leader.

Despite these possibilities, the probability of a sudden, transformative shift within the Vatican – a younger, more progressive Cardinal emerging as a strong candidate advocating for radical change – appears relatively low in the near term. The influence of the established Vatican Curia and the traditional power structures will likely continue to shape the selection process. Furthermore, the entrenched conservative elements within the Church are expected to resist significant departures from established doctrine.

The greatest chance of an outcome – an openly LGBT Pope before 2050 – relies on a confluence of events: a significant and sustained deterioration in Pope Francis's health coupled with a realization within the Vatican that a change is necessary; alongside a shift in the broader Catholic landscape, driven by a groundswell of support from younger generations and a willingness within the Curia to embrace a more progressive approach. Given the considerable timeframe and the inherent conservatism of the institution, this scenario remains a relatively low probability, but it is not entirely discounted.

Therefore, considering all factors, a conservative estimate for the probability of an openly LGBT Pope being selected by 2050 is approximately 20%.
