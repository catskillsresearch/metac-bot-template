Based on the provided forecasts, a consolidated rationale for the question “How many years before (or after) AGI is developed, will the world real GDP be 25% higher than every previous year for the first time?” can be formulated as follows:

The estimation of when global real GDP will achieve a 25% sustained increase compared to previous years, driven by AGI, is profoundly uncertain. The timeframe for achieving this outcome is heavily influenced by a confluence of unpredictable factors. Initially, a reasonable timeframe for a more concrete understanding – roughly 5 to 15 years – appears justifiable, reflecting the volatile nature of technological adoption, potential “AI winters,” and the inherent difficulties in predicting the transformative impact of a technology as complex as AGI.

However, a more detailed assessment reveals a range of possibilities. In the near-term (5-10 years), most forecasts suggest a GDP growth rate of between 6.5% and 8.5% annually, with India playing a pivotal role. This growth is predicated on continued AI investment, structural reforms, and a favorable global economic environment. However, significant risks—including recessionary pressures, geopolitical instability, and regulatory hurdles—could significantly curtail this trajectory, potentially pushing India’s growth rate down to 4.5% or lower.

A more optimistic, though still contingent, scenario anticipates accelerated growth over the next 10-15 years, potentially reaching 7.8% to 9.5% annually. This is driven by the potential for widespread AI adoption across all sectors, spurred by breakthroughs in AGI and potentially transformative advancements in areas like renewable energy. A key factor is India’s demographic advantage and a workforce that, with appropriate skills development, could fully capitalize on the productivity gains.

Conversely, a significantly more pessimistic outlook estimates an average growth rate of 0.1% to 1.3% over the next 5 years, primarily due to the possibility of a major unforeseen negative event – such as a global recession, significant cyberattacks, or the “AI Alignment Problem,” where AGI systems become uncontrollable and cause widespread chaos.  A truly transformative scenario – with AGI leading to an unprecedented productivity surge – suggests a growth rate of 8.3% to 12.5% over the next 10-20 years, contingent on the successful and rapid integration of AGI into the global economy.

Therefore, while a precise timeline remains elusive, the estimates paint a picture of a transformative but potentially turbulent journey.  The likely range for achieving the 25% sustained growth is most realistically between 6.5% and 9.5% within the next 10-15 years, but with substantial downside risks that could dramatically reduce this growth potential.  Ultimately, the trajectory will hinge on navigating the complex challenges posed by AGI and its integration into the global economy.
