The likelihood of geoengineering becoming a seriously considered and actively researched solution by June 23, 2025, hinges on a confluence of escalating environmental pressures and a demonstrable shift in confidence surrounding the technology. The most probable scenario involves a period of significantly accelerated global warming – exceeding current projections – coupled with a credible breakthrough in the modeling and control of a specific geoengineering technique, most likely stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI). This breakthrough would need to convincingly demonstrate both the efficacy and the safety of SAI, addressing the longstanding concerns regarding unintended consequences and potential regional climate disruptions. Simultaneously, the continued failure of traditional mitigation efforts – emissions reductions and adaptation – would create an undeniable political and economic imperative to explore and rapidly deploy geoengineering as a “last resort” measure. Public opinion, currently skeptical, would likely shift due to the intensifying consequences of climate change, albeit driven by desperation rather than reasoned endorsement. The critical element is not simply increased research, but a demonstrable ability to safely and effectively alter the planet's radiative balance, underpinned by a level of international cooperation and substantial financial investment. The potential for a catastrophic environmental event – a sudden, irreversible climate disaster – could expedite this process, but the more likely path involves a slow, accumulating crisis pushing humanity toward a radical, albeit risky, solution.
