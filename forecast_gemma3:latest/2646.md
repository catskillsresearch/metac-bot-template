The convergence of research into neuromorphic computing, coupled with advancements in materials science and algorithmic design, suggests a trajectory of substantial growth in computational power capable of replicating human mental capability. The timeframe for achieving significant breakthroughs in FLOPS output is highly uncertain, but a reasonable projection points to a period of approximately 5-10 years. However, this trajectory is subject to considerable volatility, influenced by unforeseen technological hurdles and potentially disruptive innovations.

The status quo, if nothing changes, would result in incremental improvements, likely reaching 100 GFLOPS by 2025. Assuming the current trend of architectural innovation and hardware advancements continues, a more aggressive growth trajectory is conceivable, potentially reaching 1 TFLOPS by 2028. Experts and markets anticipate a substantial shift towards neuromorphic computing, driven by increasing recognition of its potential for energy efficiency and performance advantages.  Investment is expected to increase, with consensus ranging from 50-100 ExaFLOPS achievable within 6-8 years.

A significant degree of volatility exists. A major setback – a fundamental limitation discovered in memristor technology preventing scaling or a critical failure in neural network architecture research – could lead to a stagnation in FLOPS growth, perhaps resulting in 50-75 GFLOPS by 2028. Conversely, a truly disruptive innovation – a new class of 3D stacked neuromorphic chips or the successful commercialization of a fundamentally different, highly energy-efficient neuromorphic architecture – could dramatically accelerate progress, potentially reaching 10 TFLOPS by 2030. The most optimistic scenarios, incorporating multiple breakthroughs across materials science, architecture, and algorithms, suggest potential FLOPS levels of 200-350 or even higher within a decade. The overall expectation is a substantial increase – ranging from 100-175 FLOPS within 730 days – heavily dependent on continued technological advancements and strategic investment.
