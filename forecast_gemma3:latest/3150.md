The current global landscape is characterized by heightened geopolitical tensions, a proliferation of nuclear weapons technology, and persistent instability across multiple regions. The most likely outcome, if current trends continue, is a gradual deterioration of international security, marked by escalating regional conflicts, increased cyber warfare, and continued, albeit incremental, increases in nuclear arsenals. The world remains a volatile place, with no immediate, dramatic shifts predicted to fundamentally alter the trajectory. However, a significant, unforeseen global event – a technological breakthrough, a catastrophic economic collapse, or a truly unified global movement for peace and cooperation – is required to avoid a catastrophic outcome. The risk of miscalculation, escalation, or deliberate use of nuclear weapons by a major power remains substantial, fueled by existing tensions and the potential for a cascading chain reaction. Despite the warnings from experts like the Atlantic Council, the inherent instability of the global system presents a persistent threat. Therefore, the probability of a third world war involving nuclear weapons by 2035 remains a serious concern, though not the most likely scenario.
