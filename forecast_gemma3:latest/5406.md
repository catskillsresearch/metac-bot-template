Okay, here's a synthesized rationale incorporating the best elements from all five forecasts, aiming for a consistent and robust assessment:

**Synthesized Rationale:**

The likelihood of achieving a doubling of global nuclear power generation by 2050 is significantly below 100%, but also not negligible. The timeframe – approximately 25 years – presents considerable uncertainty.  Initial assessments suggest a probability around 55-65%, influenced heavily by the alignment of numerous complex and interacting factors.

The most likely scenario, if “nothing changes,” is a gradual increase in nuclear capacity, primarily driven by existing projects and continued demand. This would likely result in a 30-40% expansion by 2050 – a significant increase, but falling short of the doubling target. This baseline reflects the current state of technological development (particularly with SMRs still facing commercial viability challenges), geopolitical considerations, and public perception, which consistently pose headwinds to accelerated nuclear deployment.

However, a “Yes” outcome – achieving the doubling – hinges on a remarkably favorable confluence of circumstances. Crucially, this requires sustained, high levels of global investment, pushing beyond the current, relatively cautious approach. Technological breakthroughs, particularly in SMR technology (reducing costs and improving safety profiles) and advanced reactor designs, are absolutely vital. Furthermore, supportive government policies – including streamlined permitting processes, carbon pricing mechanisms, and long-term investment commitments – would be necessary to create a stable investment environment.  The acceleration of African gas production would also be a critical supporting factor.

The risk of a “No” outcome – a scenario where the doubling fails to materialize – is substantial.  A major, unforeseen global event (e.g., a catastrophic nuclear accident triggering a global moratorium or a truly revolutionary breakthrough in fusion energy) could derail the entire trajectory.  Alternatively, a significant shift in global priorities away from carbon reduction, or a severe economic downturn, would likely reduce investment in nuclear, regardless of its potential.  Furthermore, ongoing geopolitical instability and potential conflicts could disrupt supply chains and slow down deployment.

Considering the balance of these factors – the inherent uncertainties and the demanding conditions required for a “Yes” outcome – a conservative probability estimate is 60-70%.  This acknowledges the potential for positive developments, but also the substantial obstacles that need to be overcome.  A key driver of this assessment is the acknowledged time frame - with 25 years, there's a considerable margin for error.

Final Answer: Probability: 68%


### Probability: 65%
