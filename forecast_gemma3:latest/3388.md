Based on the provided rationales, the following represents a consolidated rationale for predicting the percentage of U.S. adults who will self-report to follow a vegan diet in 2028.

The most probable outcome reflects a trajectory of gradual, yet uneven, expansion in plant-based dietary adoption. Initial forecasts suggest a stabilization around 15-20% within the next 18-24 months, driven by continued momentum from campaigns like Veganuary alongside growing awareness of sustainability and health concerns. However, this growth is heavily influenced by persistent headwinds, including high costs, consumer skepticism regarding the complexity of veganism, and occasional negative media coverage highlighting potential issues within the plant-based food sector – particularly concerning sustainability or food safety. 

A significant, globally coordinated public health campaign promoting the benefits of plant-based diets, combined with targeted subsidies and innovation in affordable, accessible plant-based alternatives, could push adoption rates significantly higher, potentially exceeding 30% within this timeframe. Conversely, a major global economic downturn or a significant negative event highlighting the sustainability challenges of plant-based food production could lead to a sharp decline, bringing adoption rates back down to around 10-15%. 

Ultimately, the trajectory will be shaped by a complex interplay of factors – technological advancements, governmental policies, market innovation, and shifting consumer attitudes. Despite underlying trends favoring plant-based options, achieving widespread adoption requires ongoing effort to address cost barriers, overcome consumer skepticism, and establish a robust, sustainable food supply chain. The likely range of adoption within 2028 is therefore estimated to fall between 15% and 25%, with a substantial degree of uncertainty surrounding the precise outcome.
