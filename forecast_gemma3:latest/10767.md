Considering all the rationales, here's a consolidated rationale for the likelihood of a resolution to the Transnistrian conflict by June 2028:

The situation surrounding Transnistria remains characterized by a complex and deeply entrenched frozen conflict. The probability of a fully resolved outcome by June 2028 is low, estimated at approximately 30%. This assessment is based on a convergence of factors: significant time remaining, the persistent involvement of external actors, and the deeply rooted, multifaceted nature of the dispute.

The most likely immediate scenario is a continuation of the ‘frozen conflict’ status quo, as highlighted across all forecasts. This involves a managed tension dynamic: Russia maintains a significant military and economic presence within Transnistria, providing support and leveraging security guarantees. Moldova, bolstered by ongoing EU support, continues its efforts to assert territorial integrity, navigating the complexities of economic interdependence and security concerns. Sporadic incidents—border skirmishes, energy disruptions, and disinformation campaigns—will continue to punctuate the landscape, preventing any momentum towards a final resolution.

However, several pathways towards a more positive outcome remain plausible, albeit with substantial uncertainties. A “no” outcome—a significant escalation leading to a wider conflict—represents a credible risk, as repeatedly emphasized by several forecasts. This could materialize through miscalculations, spillover effects from the ongoing war in Ukraine, or deliberate Russian provocations.

More realistically, a gradual, multi-stage process—a “yes” outcome—could unfold if specific conditions align. Firstly, internal dynamics within Transnistria shift, leading to a growing recognition of the benefits of closer integration with Moldova, driven by economic hardship and a desire for stability. Secondly, Russia, facing evolving strategic priorities and increasing costs, demonstrates a willingness to gradually reduce its military and political influence in Transnistria. Thirdly, the EU and Moldova forge a robust and unified approach, offering sustained economic incentives and security guarantees, fostering a more stable and integrated Moldovan state. This scenario requires sustained diplomatic engagement, a willingness to compromise on all sides, and a recognition of the need for long-term solutions. The key lies in a shift in strategic calculations – a move away from a purely security-oriented approach towards one that incorporates economic cooperation and political integration.

Ultimately, the outcome is deeply intertwined with broader geopolitical developments. The war in Ukraine, the evolving relationship between Russia and the West, and the internal political dynamics within Moldova will continue to exert considerable influence. While a rapid resolution is improbable, sustained efforts towards dialogue, confidence-building measures, and incremental steps could gradually pave the way towards a more stable and predictable future for the region, though a fully resolved status remains unlikely within the specified timeframe.
