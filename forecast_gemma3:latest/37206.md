The most likely outcome is a gradual, incremental evolution of the BRICS group, characterized by continued discussions around de-dollarization, multipolar governance, and the promotion of alternative financial systems. The group's core functions—albeit sometimes contentious—will persist. However, a significant geopolitical event, like a major, protracted war, could drastically alter the landscape, potentially leading to the collapse of BRICS. Conversely, if global tensions ease and cooperation increases, particularly on initiatives like sustainable development and a multi-polar financial system, the group’s influence will strengthen, and a sustained push for alternative currencies could trigger significant expansion in membership. The key factor is the continuation of a relatively stable global environment, allowing for ongoing dialogue and cooperation amongst the existing members, rather than a major disruptive event.
