The most likely path to Norway joining the European Union by 2035 hinges on a complex interplay of geopolitical, economic, and domestic factors. Over the next 18-24 months, the situation will remain characterized by cautious, incremental progress. The EU will continue its efforts to bolster Ukraine, pursue energy diversification, and navigate ongoing geopolitical tensions. Within Norway, the status quo – a non-committal approach – is expected to persist, driven by a reliance on Russian gas (at least for the immediate future), public skepticism about EU membership, and a prioritization of national sovereignty. However, a protracted and escalated conflict in Ukraine, potentially leading to a frozen situation, represents a significant risk, increasing the probability of a “No” outcome due to exacerbated public sentiment and a perceived lack of EU stability.

Conversely, a rapid resolution of the Ukraine conflict, coupled with sustained progress in Ukraine’s reforms and a genuine economic recovery within the EU, would be crucial to fostering a “Yes” outcome. This necessitates a strengthened and unified EU, demonstrating a clear commitment to enlargement and offering compelling incentives for Norway. Furthermore, a shift in Norwegian public opinion, driven by a recognition of the strategic benefits of integration and fueled by a perception of heightened security within a larger European framework, would be a pivotal catalyst. The possibility of a major geopolitical breakthrough – perhaps involving a thaw in relations between Russia and the West – would also dramatically enhance the likelihood of accession.  Ultimately, the timing and nature of these interwoven developments will determine the ultimate probability of Norway joining the EU by 2035, with a stable and decisively resolved Ukraine conflict currently offering the most favorable pathway.
