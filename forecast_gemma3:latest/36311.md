The current situation, characterized by existing plans and established trends, suggests a high probability of continued incremental adjustments, particularly in Brazil and Russia, where ongoing efforts to modify judicial fee structures and salaries are already underway. The forecasts consistently highlight the influence of political shifts, bureaucratic processes, and judicial interpretations. A “No” outcome – predicated on significant political upheaval, a reversal of court rulings, or a major constitutional challenge – is viewed as less likely due to the persistence of the existing trajectory and the potential for continued political and judicial support for these changes.  While delays and uncertainties remain, the rationales collectively point to a 65-75% probability of an increase, reflecting the gradual, trend-driven nature of the potential developments.
