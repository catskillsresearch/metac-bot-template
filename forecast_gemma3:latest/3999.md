Based on the provided forecasts, the following represents a consolidated rationale for predicting the peak population of Antarctica by 2075:

The projection of Antarctica’s population by 2075 is inherently complex and subject to significant uncertainty. The dominant factors influencing population trends are global demographic shifts, particularly declining fertility rates in developed nations and continued population growth in Africa, combined with the potential for disruptive events. Current trends, as reflected in the forecasts, suggest a peak population, likely occurring sometime in the mid-2080s, stabilizing around 10-12 billion people globally. This peak will be driven by sustained population growth in Africa alongside a continuing slow decline in fertility rates in developed countries. However, this projection is highly sensitive to unforeseen events. 

A major disruption, such as a severe global pandemic, or a significant technological advancement in reproductive technologies, could dramatically alter this trajectory.  A rapid and widespread adoption of advanced reproductive technologies or a sustained global event dramatically reducing fertility rates would significantly increase the population. Conversely, a major global catastrophe – such as a widespread climate event or a devastating pandemic – could sharply reduce population levels. 

Given the inherent uncertainties and the reliance on trends extrapolated over several decades, a moderate projection of approximately 8-10 billion people by 2075 represents a cautious and reasonable estimate, acknowledging the possibility of significant deviations based on complex, interacting factors. Continuous monitoring of global demographic trends, technological advancements, and potential disruptive events remains crucial for refining these projections.
