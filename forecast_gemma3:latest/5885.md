Based on the provided forecasts, the most likely outcome is a delayed launch, with a significant probability of failure to achieve a crewed landing by the end of 2026. A recurring theme across all forecasts is the inherent complexity and risk associated with the Starship project, coupled with the substantial technological hurdles that remain. While SpaceX’s rapid iteration and “fail fast, learn fast” approach are acknowledged, the forecasts consistently highlight the difficulty of overcoming the challenges in propulsion, life support, radiation shielding, landing accuracy, and regulatory approvals. A catastrophic failure during a critical test flight, particularly during the initial launch attempt, is identified as the most likely scenario leading to a ‘no’ outcome, reflecting a significant statistical risk given the scale and ambition of the project. Despite ongoing progress and testing, the timelines presented by SpaceX appear overly optimistic, with delays and setbacks consistently predicted.  Furthermore, the consensus suggests that external factors, such as regulatory delays or changes in NASA priorities, could significantly impact the schedule. The probability of achieving a soft landing and initial data collection by 2026 is low, with delays pushing the mission towards 2028 or beyond.
