Okay, here’s a synthesized rationale incorporating the best elements from all five forecasts, aiming for a cohesive and robust assessment:

**Synthesized Rationale:**

The question of whether the poverty rate in Argentina will be lower in the first half of 2025 compared to the second half of 2023 is complex, heavily dependent on factors that are still unfolding. As of June 23, 2025, the primary information source – the INDEC’s poverty index for the second half of 2024 – is still forthcoming (scheduled for release in March 2025).  The remaining timeframe presents a significant degree of uncertainty, roughly 31 days until the initial data release.

Assuming “status quo” – that is, no major, unforeseen shocks – the most likely outcome is a modest decrease in the poverty rate.  The initial trends, stemming from President Milei’s policies (inflation control, economic stabilization), suggest a potential reduction of approximately 1-2 percentage points, placing the poverty rate at around 40.5-41.5% by the end of 2024. The indigence rate remains a significant concern, likely holding steady around 9.5%.

However, several significant risks exist that could dramatically alter this outlook. A major, unexpected economic downturn – such as a sharp decline in commodity prices or a further banking crisis – carries a considerable probability of triggering a reversal, potentially pushing poverty rates back towards or above levels seen under the Fernández administration. The INDEC’s data reliability is also a critical consideration. A major data processing error or, even more concerning, deliberate manipulation by political actors, would undermine confidence in the index and require a new, independent survey, effectively resetting the forecast.

A “yes” outcome – a substantial decrease in poverty (below 38%) – is possible, but relies on a sustained period of positive economic trends. This would necessitate continued inflation control, a measured increase in employment driven by Milei’s reforms, and a favorable global economic environment. A successful framing of the INDEC data by the government as evidence of positive outcomes would bolster this optimistic scenario. The key remaining factor is the continued, relatively stable, operation of the INDEC and the acceptance of its data by the administration.  Given the inherent risks and the complex interplay of economic and political forces, the probability of a significant and sustained reduction in poverty by the end of 2025 remains moderate but with a considerable degree of uncertainty.

Probability: 65%
