Given the ongoing tensions between the United States and Panama regarding the Panama Canal, the most likely outcome remains a continuation of the existing status quo. The timeframe remaining—approximately 18 months—allows for ongoing diplomatic posturing, continued US concerns regarding China’s influence, and Panama’s resolute defense of its ownership and control of the canal. The US will likely continue to utilize the canal under existing treaties, punctuated by occasional diplomatic friction driven by political rhetoric, without undertaking any concrete action to challenge Panama's control. A significant escalation, such as a major conflict in the South China Sea, or a complete operational shutdown of the canal due to a technological disruption, would fundamentally alter the dynamic, but these scenarios are considered highly contingent and improbable. Furthermore, a shift in global geopolitical priorities, or a domestic US political change, could easily sideline the canal dispute altogether. The most plausible future involves a persistent, low-level conflict—a simmering background tension rather than a major crisis—reflecting the entrenched positions of both sides.
