Here’s a synthesized rationale, incorporating the best elements from each forecast while presenting a cohesive and consistent narrative:

**Synthesized Rationale: Probability of Over Half of US States Forbidding Gasoline Cars by 2035**

The likelihood of over half of US states implementing bans on the sale of new gasoline-powered cars by 2035 is assessed as moderately high, estimated at approximately 70%. This probability is driven by a confluence of factors, operating within a relatively short timeframe – roughly 60-75 days (as of June 23, 2025) – that will determine the trajectory of this significant shift.

The most probable immediate outcome hinges on the Congressional review of the EPA’s waivers to California’s Advanced Clean Car regulations. While a complete reversal—a “no” outcome—remains a possibility, driven by a dramatic shift in political leadership or a resurgence of anti-environmental sentiment, it's considered less likely given the current political climate and substantial investments already underway. The Congressional review is anticipated to be largely symbolic, potentially resulting in minor adjustments requested by Congress, but ultimately affirming the EPA’s authority.

However, a more likely scenario—a “yes” outcome—is predicated on a coordinated effort from Congress to support California’s regulations. This would involve acknowledging the momentum already established by California and the broader trend toward electrification within the automotive industry. This would likely lead to the EPA maintaining its waivers, and potentially issuing more nuanced guidance to automakers.

A key element contributing to this probability is the time remaining. The 60-75 day window presents a crucial inflection point. Further complicating matters, the potential for a “no” outcome is heightened by the possibility of a significant economic downturn or widespread environmental disaster, which could fuel a desire to rollback regulations and prioritize short-term economic concerns.

Ultimately, a continuation of the current trajectory – with California leading the way and other states following – is the most probable outcome. This necessitates ongoing investment in EV infrastructure, continued technological advancements in battery technology, and a sustained political commitment to reducing carbon emissions. The underlying rationale leans towards a gradual, albeit significant, transformation of the US automotive landscape by 2035, driven by a combination of regulatory pressure and market forces.
