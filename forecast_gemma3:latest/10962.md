Based on the rationales provided, the following represents a consolidated and consistent rationale for the likelihood of the US offering India a nuclear submarine before 2026:

The probability of the US offering India a nuclear submarine before June 2026 is influenced by a complex interplay of factors, primarily centered around regional geopolitical tensions and the slow, deliberate pace of international military development.  The most likely scenario (65%) remains a continuation of the current state of affairs – a gradual escalation of tensions between India and Pakistan, punctuated by occasional skirmishes and naval deployments. The AUKUS submarine project will proceed, but its impact on the India-Pakistan dynamic will be limited.  Turkey’s foray into submarine technology will likely remain a project with limited tangible progress for the next few years, primarily focused on domestic development and collaboration with existing partners.  Furthermore, the global arms race will continue, driven primarily by existing nations, but with no dramatic shifts in dominance. 

However, a significant, though less probable (35%), outcome hinges on a sustained period of heightened strategic collaboration between India, Australia, and Turkey on advanced naval technologies, specifically centered around a new, joint submarine design – SSN-AUKUS – driven by a convergence of shared strategic interests. This would require a willingness to overcome diplomatic hurdles and political sensitivities from all involved parties.  A key element in this scenario would be a growing concern about China's expanding influence in the Indian Ocean and South Pacific, or a shift in the US-China relationship which favors a more cooperative US-India partnership. 

Importantly, the possibility of a dramatic escalation remains, though considered relatively low (25%). This hinges on a miscalculation, accident, or deliberate provocation triggering a rapid chain reaction, such as a heightened conflict in Kashmir, a dangerous naval encounter, or Pakistan’s nuclear posturing.  A ‘black swan’ event – such as a catastrophic terrorist attack or a major geopolitical shift – could also dramatically alter the situation, but is considered a low probability.  Ultimately, the timeline – approximately 33 days remaining until June 2025 – suggests a constrained timeframe for significant transformative change, further favoring a continuation of the existing trends.
