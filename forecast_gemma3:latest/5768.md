Given the fragmented nature of the individual forecasts, a consolidated rationale for predicting the likelihood of senior executives of major public companies being imprisoned for corporate crimes before 2026 is as follows:

The probability of a definitive, impactful outcome – specifically, the imprisonment of senior executives – remains relatively low. The most likely scenario is a continuation of existing legal processes, characterized by incremental progress, appeals, and ultimately, a partial resolution. Over the next approximately 68 days, the case surrounding François Fillon and similar corruption investigations across Europe and Nigeria will continue to move through their respective legal systems. The Court of Cassation in France is likely to uphold the existing sentence, albeit potentially with minor adjustments or modifications related to procedural details.  Similarly, the complex web of investigations and prosecutions across multiple jurisdictions will likely continue without a dramatic shift towards widespread convictions.

However, a ‘No’ outcome – meaning no imprisonment – is not entirely assured. A significant, unifying legal ruling emanating from a major court (such as the European Court of Human Rights or the Supreme Court of Nigeria) could dramatically alter the trajectory of these cases. Alternatively, a substantial, newly discovered piece of evidence could re-open the investigation and trigger a new trial. Conversely, a complete ‘Yes’ outcome – a widespread wave of convictions – is improbable given the established timelines and the complexity of the legal battles. 

The most plausible path forward involves a persistent state of uncertainty, with legal processes unfolding gradually and with limited impact on high-level executives. The probability of a decisive outcome – either a conviction or a dismissal of all charges – remains low, primarily due to the difficulty of securing irrefutable evidence and the inherent complexities of navigating the numerous legal challenges and appeals. The situation is likely to remain a slow, protracted series of legal proceedings, with a high likelihood of partial resolutions rather than a definitive conclusion leading to imprisonment.
