Based on the rationales provided, a comprehensive rationale for the likelihood of Puerto Rico becoming a US state prior to 2035 emerges as follows:

The probability of Puerto Rico achieving statehood before 2035 remains low, estimated at approximately 35%. This outcome hinges on a complex and unlikely convergence of factors across both the island and the United States. The most probable scenario – representing roughly 45% of the assessment – is a continuation of the *status quo*, characterized by a slow, incremental energy transition, ongoing political debate, and reliance on fossil fuels. This status quo is maintained due to legislative gridlock, political resistance, and a lack of decisive action on either side. 

However, a more optimistic, yet still challenging, pathway exists, representing approximately 25% of the potential outcome. This pathway requires a coordinated, sustained effort encompassing shifts in US federal policy and significant public pressure. It’s dependent on a proactive legislative response, fueled by a combination of factors including a successful transition to 100% renewable energy by 2050, accompanied by legal safeguards and strong US federal support.

The most volatile element is the potential for a shift – representing 45% of the likelihood – triggered by a confluence of events. This could be driven by a change in governorship, a significant public health crisis, or a substantial influx of federal funding supporting renewable energy. The most critical component remains the ability of progressive legislators to overcome political resistance and secure a decisive vote in favor of mandated decommissioning of the AES coal plant and accelerated deployment of clean energy technologies – underpinned by strong US federal support. 

Ultimately, the path to statehood remains fraught with challenges, requiring sustained political will, significant financial investment, and a willingness to confront deeply entrenched interests. The probability of this occurring before 2035 is therefore deemed relatively low, influenced heavily by a complex web of political, economic, and environmental considerations.
