Based on the rationales provided, a comprehensive rationale for the likelihood of a functioning space elevator being built on Earth before 2100 is as follows:

The probability of a fully functional, reliably operational space elevator being established by 2100 is significantly influenced by the confluence of technological breakthroughs, sustained investment, and overcoming substantial systemic challenges. Currently, the overall probability is assessed as roughly 35%. However, a more nuanced understanding reveals a complex spectrum of possibilities.

The most immediate obstacle remains material science. While advances in carbon nanotube production and novel composite materials are critical, the required strength-to-weight ratio for a space elevator cable represents a significant, unsolved engineering problem. A 35% probability reflects the considerable uncertainty surrounding this core technology – a catastrophic materials failure during early testing (around 20%) or a prolonged period of stalled development due to material limitations (around 15%) are key risks.

However, a positive scenario—one that elevates the probability— hinges on a combination of factors. A sustained, multi-billion dollar investment program (around 45%), driven by government and private entities, is crucial. This investment would address not only material science but also engineering challenges, infrastructure development, and regulatory hurdles. A pivotal breakthrough in cable technology—likely stemming from continued advancements in carbon nanotubes or a radically new material—would be a necessary catalyst. Furthermore, strategic international collaboration—pooling resources and expertise—would accelerate the process. The initial operational focus would likely be on lower Earth orbit, with gradual expansion to Mars and beyond. The overall probability of success by 2100 remains relatively low, but it’s not zero, and a continued push for advancements in materials science, combined with strategic investment and global collaboration, could shift the balance towards a greater likelihood. It's a challenging endeavor, but not an impossible one.
