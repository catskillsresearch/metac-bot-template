Given the rationales provided, the most likely outcome regarding a conflict between China and Taiwan leading to at least 100 deaths before 2026 is a sustained state of heightened tension and strategic ambiguity, characterized by continuous military posturing and a risk of miscalculation. This represents the baseline scenario, appearing across all forecasts. 

The core drivers of this outcome are the deeply entrenched positions of China and Taiwan, the ongoing “strategic ambiguity” policy maintained by the US, and the continuous escalation of military exercises and provocations by both sides.  The risk of a miscalculation – stemming from a misunderstanding, a deliberate act of escalation, or an unintended consequence – is consistently highlighted as the most plausible pathway to conflict. 

Several factors contribute to this scenario. Firstly, China’s increasing military capabilities and demonstrated willingness to challenge Taiwan’s status quo, combined with a perception of potential weakness or division within the US, create a dangerous environment. Secondly, Taiwan’s efforts to strengthen its defense capabilities, supported by US security assistance, further heighten the tension. Finally, the inherent volatility of the situation – characterized by frequent near-miss incidents, diplomatic skirmishes, and the potential for unintended escalation – elevates the probability of a conflict occurring, even if a large-scale invasion remains a relatively low-probability event. 

While scenarios leading to a "no" outcome – involving a diplomatic breakthrough or a significant global event diverting attention – are acknowledged, they are considered less likely than the continued escalation driven by miscalculation and strategic maneuvering.  The persistent tension, the military build-up, and the lack of a clear resolution to the underlying disputes suggest that the probability of a conflict resulting in at least 100 deaths by 2026 remains substantial, hovering around 65%, reflecting a consistently observed judgement across all forecasts.
