Based on the rationales provided, a consolidated rationale for the likelihood of China meeting its 2030 carbon intensity reduction target (greater than 65% reduction from 2005 levels) is as follows:

The probability of China achieving the ambitious 2030 carbon intensity reduction target is significantly challenged by a confluence of factors, suggesting a baseline probability of around 30%. The most immediate obstacle is the established trajectory: recent performance has consistently fallen short of targets, hampered by challenges within the clean energy sector – including profitability issues and overcapacity – alongside continued reliance on fossil fuels and China’s industrial growth. A severe global recession, disrupting economic activity and international investment, significantly increases the likelihood of a ‘No’ outcome, as would a geopolitical crisis impacting supply chains.

However, a successful outcome is not entirely ruled out. It hinges on a dramatically altered set of circumstances. Critically, this requires a sustained period of robust global economic growth, supportive of continued investment in clean energy technologies and infrastructure. More fundamentally, China needs to implement a transformative and rapidly accelerating shift away from fossil fuels, encompassing a nationwide phase-out of coal-fired power plants, massive investment in renewable energy infrastructure (including advancements in energy storage and carbon capture technologies), and a fundamental restructuring of the Chinese economy to prioritize low-carbon industries. Furthermore, this shift necessitates strong, sustained international cooperation, including mechanisms like carbon pricing, technology transfer, and financial support. The success of this undertaking is inextricably linked to the stability of the global economy and the willingness of the international community to engage in effective collaborative action. Given these considerable uncertainties and the complexities inherent in China’s political and economic system, the baseline probability of achieving the 65% reduction target by 2030 remains relatively low, although a significant shift in global conditions and a genuinely radical transformation of China’s economic policy would dramatically increase the possibility of success.
