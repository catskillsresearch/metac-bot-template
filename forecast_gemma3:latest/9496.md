Based on the rationales provided, a comprehensive rationale for the forecast of France's electricity consumption supplied by nuclear power in 2035 can be constructed as follows:

The assessment of France’s electricity mix in 2035 hinges on a complex interplay of factors, with a timeframe of approximately 18-24 months offering the most clarity. The current energy strategy, characterized by a measured balance between nuclear power and renewable energy deployment, is expected to remain the dominant force. However, a conservative baseline scenario, mirroring the status quo, suggests a moderate, incremental shift, with a likely 65-70% reliance on nuclear power and a 30-40% share for renewables. This is influenced by ongoing adjustments to the energy strategy, stakeholder consultations, and a deliberate slowdown in solar deployment to maintain energy security and grid stability.

Several key uncertainties remain. The pace of renewable energy deployment is heavily dependent on technological advancements, policy support, and the government’s ability to address grid integration challenges. A major disruption, such as a severe cyberattack targeting the French grid, a prolonged drought impacting hydroelectric power, or a catastrophic nuclear reactor failure, could significantly reduce electricity production and delay the transition to renewables, potentially pushing production to 600-700 TWh. Conversely, breakthroughs in energy storage technology – particularly highly efficient, affordable, and scalable grid-scale battery systems – combined with aggressive government incentives and streamlined permitting processes, could dramatically accelerate the deployment of renewables, potentially elevating overall production to 753-800 TWh by 2035. 

Expert and market expectations point toward cautious optimism, acknowledging the inherent complexities of transitioning a large economy. While a moderate progress is anticipated, ranging around 65-70%, the outcome remains sensitive to unexpected events and technological advancements. The government’s evolving approach, coupled with careful monitoring and adaptation, indicates a proactive strategy that, despite the uncertainty, is likely to drive a gradual but sustained shift towards a lower-carbon electricity system. The overall probability remains moderately high, situated within the 70-80% range, reflecting the careful balancing act between established technologies and emerging renewable energy sources.
