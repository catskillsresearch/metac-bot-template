Based on the rationales provided, the most likely outcome of faster-than-light communication becoming feasible within the next 2300 is a highly improbable event, characterized by persistent technological and theoretical hurdles. The prevailing scenario centers around a combination of stagnation and incremental, albeit ultimately unsuccessful, attempts to overcome these challenges. 

The core impediment to achieving FTL communication lies in the fundamental nature of established physics, specifically Einstein’s theory of relativity.  The most probable outcome involves a protracted period of research, marked by repeated attempts to validate theoretical concepts – such as warp drives or wormholes – which consistently fail due to insurmountable energy requirements, inherent instability, or undiscovered physical limitations.  A significant “no” outcome would arise from the discovery of a fatal flaw in existing theoretical frameworks, leading to a redirection of resources away from FTL research and a confirmation of the long-held belief that exceeding the speed of light is fundamentally impossible.  Alternatively, external factors, such as geopolitical instability or economic downturns, could disrupt research efforts and contribute to the overall stagnation.

Despite this overwhelming pessimism, a small chance exists for an unexpected breakthrough. This “yes” outcome would require a fundamentally new understanding of physics – possibly involving manipulation of dark energy/matter or the discovery of a novel quantum phenomenon. Such a discovery would necessitate demonstrable, repeatable experiments, requiring validation by independent scientific institutions, and would trigger immediate and substantial global investment. However, even in this optimistic scenario, the practical realization of FTL communication would likely be a long and arduous process. 

Ultimately, the prevailing probability reflects the significant challenges inherent in attempting to circumvent the established laws of physics, highlighting the enduring dominance of established scientific principles and the difficulty in achieving radical breakthroughs in fundamental science.
