Based on the rationales provided, here’s a consolidated rationale for the likelihood of detonating nuclear bombs to combat climate change by 2030:

The probability of a scenario where scientists successfully propose detonating nuclear bombs to combat global warming by 2030 is low, estimated at approximately 15%. This outcome hinges on a confluence of highly improbable events. Initially, the status quo – characterized by scientific skepticism, international treaties against nuclear proliferation, and continued reliance on established mitigation strategies – is highly likely to persist. A major global catastrophe, like a nuclear war or a significant climate tipping point, would further solidify this status quo, reducing the probability significantly (down to 5%).

However, a ‘yes’ outcome requires a dramatic shift in perception and action. This begins with a small, influential group of scientists demonstrating a technically feasible, albeit risky, approach – achieved through a carefully controlled, limited experiment. This requires not only demonstrable positive results but also a critical mass of scientific confidence, fueled by increasingly dire climate models and a willingness to acknowledge the inadequacy of current mitigation efforts. Crucially, this must occur within a timeframe of approximately 1-2 years, given the relative short timeframe assessed by several forecasts. The support would also need to be bolstered by a nation willing to take a substantial investment risk based on the scientific results. 

Alternatively, a technologically advanced nation successfully demonstrating a similar principle – perhaps a modified nuclear technology – would shift the probability to 30% and could be further increased by a global crisis (dropping probability to 5%). Ultimately, the risk of a major, catastrophic event – like a nuclear war – remains a significant deterrent, and the overwhelming complexity and inherent dangers of the proposed solution contribute to the overall low probability. The timeframe available, as indicated across the forecasts, adds another layer of uncertainty, demanding a rapid, decisive, and ultimately improbable series of events to push this scenario into reality.
