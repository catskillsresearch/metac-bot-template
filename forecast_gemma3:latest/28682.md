Okay, here’s a consolidated rationale, incorporating the best elements from all five forecasts, presented as a single, cohesive narrative:

The likelihood of any European country triggering Article 50 to leave the European Union before 2030, or, more significantly, of the EU successfully establishing a significantly enhanced level of strategic autonomy by that date, remains a challenging assessment. Based on the available information and considering the time remaining (approximately 18 months as of June 2025), the probability of a truly transformative outcome is relatively low, estimated at roughly 35%.

The primary obstacle lies in the inherent complexities and divisions within the EU itself. A ‘status quo’ outcome – characterized by incremental progress, persistent national interests, and continued reliance on external powers, particularly the US – represents the most probable scenario. The ‘Readiness 2030’ plan will likely see some limited successes, primarily driven by continued, albeit fragmented, defense spending and collaborative procurement efforts. The ‘Europe of Six’ scenario is fundamentally unlikely, due to the diverse political and economic landscapes of the member states.

However, a ‘No’ outcome – characterized by a geopolitical crisis (such as a prolonged, destabilizing conflict in Eastern Europe or a major trade war) that undermines EU unity and a return to transactional relationships with external powers – is a significant threat.  Furthermore, a severe economic downturn or a resurgence of populist sentiment within Europe could exacerbate existing divisions and derail any progress toward strategic autonomy.

A ‘Yes’ outcome – the scenario where the EU successfully establishes a truly independent defense posture – hinges on a confluence of exceptionally difficult conditions. It requires an unprecedented period of European unity, driven by a shared recognition of the need for strategic autonomy in the face of ongoing, and potentially intensifying, US influence. This would demand a radical restructuring of the EU, with a significantly strengthened central government. A key factor would be a genuine shift in US policy – a reduction in its perceived pressure on the EU and a willingness to acknowledge Europe’s independent role. The likelihood of this happening within the timeframe of 2030 appears low.

Ultimately, while the EU is committed to improving its security capabilities, the existing geopolitical landscape and internal divisions create a formidable barrier to a truly transformative outcome. The probability of this occurring before 2030 remains relatively subdued, highlighting the sustained challenges that the European Union faces in its pursuit of strategic autonomy.
