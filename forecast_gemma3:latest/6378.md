The most likely outcome regarding the adoption of nuclear energy globally within the next 18 months (until June 24, 2026) is a gradual, limited rollout, primarily driven by a handful of nations, with a significant degree of uncertainty. The core factors driving this assessment are persistent challenges related to cost, public perception, and regulatory hurdles.  A consistent theme across all forecasts highlights the dependence on a sustained political commitment and technological advancements – particularly the rapid development and deployment of small modular reactors (SMRs). However, several significant "no" outcomes remain plausible, primarily centered around economic downturns, unforeseen geopolitical events, or a shift in global priorities away from high-investment, long-term projects. A "yes" outcome – a widespread global adoption of nuclear energy – remains less likely, contingent upon a confluence of factors including sustained political will, dramatic technological breakthroughs in SMR technology, and a global shift towards prioritizing nuclear energy as a critical component of climate change mitigation strategies.  Furthermore, the forecasts consistently acknowledge a slow pace of change, suggesting that even with favorable conditions, widespread nuclear deployment is unlikely within the 18-month timeframe.  A critical element influencing the trajectory is the ongoing debate surrounding public acceptance and safety concerns, which represent a constant impediment to broader adoption. The greatest risk, as identified across forecasts, is a significant economic downturn that fundamentally alters global investment priorities, effectively halting or delaying the entire nuclear energy initiative. The overall probability of a widespread rollout within the specified timeframe appears to be moderate, hovering around 35%, with the potential for significant fluctuations based on unpredictable external factors.
