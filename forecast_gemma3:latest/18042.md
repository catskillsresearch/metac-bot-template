Given the provided rationales, a comprehensive rationale for assessing the likelihood of transformative AI resulting in a singleton (as opposed to a multipolar world) by 2025 emerges as follows:

The core uncertainty lies in the speed and nature of technological advancement, particularly concerning Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and the subsequent geopolitical ramifications. The prevailing trend, as suggested by all forecasts, is towards a continued, albeit competitive, dynamic between the US and China, with Russia maintaining a strategic position. However, the potential for a significant, disruptive shift towards a singleton outcome—driven primarily by China’s rapid progress—is substantial.

The most immediate challenge to this multipolar scenario is the potential for China to achieve a decisive breakthrough in AI, fueled by its unique approach to data collection and investment. This breakthrough, coupled with skillful geopolitical maneuvering, could lead to a fundamental reshaping of the global order. Conversely, a major global event—such as a severe recession, a widespread cyberattack, or a significant setback in AI safety research—could significantly impede this trajectory, returning the world to a status quo dominated by US economic and military power. 

Several key factors support the possibility of a singleton outcome. The forecasts consistently highlight China's aggressive investment and strategic focus in AI. Furthermore, the potential for a rapid and transformative technological leap – specifically regarding AGI – introduces a high degree of volatility. If China successfully navigates the technological and political landscape, it could quickly establish itself as the dominant global technological power, reshaping international norms and institutions in its image.

However, the forecasts also acknowledge significant countervailing forces. The risk of a major global event, or a setback in AI safety research, remains substantial, potentially creating a more fragmented and multipolar world.  Ultimately, the probability of a singleton outcome, characterized by China’s dominance, is assessed as roughly 65%, acknowledging the inherent uncertainties and the potential for a range of outcomes, from a continued US-China competition to a more radically transformed global landscape.
