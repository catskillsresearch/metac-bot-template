The most likely outcome regarding whether reducing wild animal suffering will be a mainstream moral issue in America before 2200 is a gradual, incremental shift, driven by a confluence of factors that will likely not result in a dramatic, immediate transformation.  A sustained, systemic change is improbable in the near term. The initial period will be characterized by persistent, albeit limited, awareness and advocacy, largely confined to niche circles. The status quo – a slow trickle of articles detailing incidents of animal cruelty, ongoing animal rights campaigns, and sporadic legal battles – represents the most probable scenario. External shocks, such as major global economic downturns or pandemics, could further derail any progress, effectively silencing the issue.

However, a "Yes" outcome, involving a genuine, systemic shift in attitudes and policy, hinges on a complex chain of events. This requires a key article to gain significant traction, potentially through viral social media engagement, followed by amplification by mainstream media and public figures. Simultaneously, ongoing technological advancements – particularly in areas like conservation and animal welfare technology – could contribute to increased awareness and support for animal protection.  A sustained, coordinated effort by advocacy groups, combined with a receptive public, would be necessary to drive legislative changes and influence corporate behavior.  Ultimately, a gradual accumulation of evidence, coupled with a shift in cultural values, would be required to move animal welfare from the periphery to a central position within American morality.  The timeframe suggests a slow burn rather than a sudden revolution, with the probability of achieving a truly transformative outcome remaining low within the 21st century.
