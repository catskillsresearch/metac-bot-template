Here's a consolidated rationale, synthesizing the best elements from all five forecasts, aiming for a coherent and robust prediction:

**Final Rationale**

The projection of new vehicle production dominated by electric vehicles (EVs) in the US by 2027 remains subject to considerable uncertainty. The timeframe remaining – approximately 2.5 to 5 years – is marked by the potential for significant disruptive forces. The current trend, characterized by a gradual but persistent increase in EV adoption, is underpinned by growing production capacity (10 new battery plants), diminishing misinformation, and ongoing technological improvements. However, the pace of this growth is highly sensitive to external factors.

Considering the range of possible outcomes, we can establish a likely scenario with a reasonable degree of confidence.  Without major political shifts, disruptive economic events, or unanticipated technological breakthroughs, a baseline market share of 25-35% for EVs in new vehicle production by 2027 appears most probable. This is based on a combination of existing trends and the assessments of experts and markets. 

However, several “black swan” events could significantly alter this trajectory. A global recession, coupled with supply chain disruptions specifically targeting battery materials, could push market share down to 15-20%. Conversely, a major breakthrough in solid-state battery technology, combined with ambitious government policies and robust charging infrastructure, could drive adoption to 40-45%.  The most likely scenario sits within the 25-35% range, reflecting a cautious optimism tempered by the numerous uncertainties surrounding policy, economic conditions, and technological advancements. The overall trajectory is likely to be characterized by a gradual expansion, but with significant potential for volatility.  The key factors to watch include the stability of global supply chains, the responsiveness of government policies to climate change, and the pace of innovation in battery technology.
