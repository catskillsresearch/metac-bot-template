**Final Rationale:**

The most likely outcome regarding whether Israel will recognize the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan before 2030 is a continued state of cautious stalemate. The timeframe available—roughly 86 days of news snippets from February 2025 to June 24, 2025—offers limited opportunity for significant shifts. The status quo, as reflected in the snippets, portrays a world where the IEA remains largely isolated, vocally critical of Israel, and navigating a precarious position amidst ongoing conflict and instability in Gaza, with limited external recognition or substantial progress.

Several key factors contribute to this pessimistic outlook. Firstly, the IEA operates within a highly constrained geopolitical environment, marked by international isolation, economic hardship, and persistent security threats stemming from groups like ISIS-K. Secondly, the conflict in Gaza continues to exacerbate tensions and complicate any potential normalization efforts. Thirdly, a “No” outcome—requiring a monumental shift in international opinion, a dramatic change in the IEA's behavior, or a major geopolitical event—remains a low probability.

While scenarios leading to a “Yes” outcome—involving widespread international recognition—are conceivable, they demand a complex and improbable confluence of events. This requires a significant realignment of global forces, a demonstrable commitment to stability and human rights within Afghanistan, and a genuine shift in the dynamic between Israel and the Palestinians.

Therefore, based on the available information, the probability of Israel recognizing the IEA before 2030 is assessed as cautiously pessimistic, hovering around 35%. While unforeseen events could alter this trajectory, the current circumstances strongly suggest a continued period of limited engagement and, ultimately, a lack of formal recognition.
