Given the rationales provided, the most likely scenario for a decision regarding an AfD ban before the 2025 German federal election is a continued lack of decisive action. The core factors consistently cited across all forecasts highlight a complex and challenging political landscape. The timeframe remaining (approximately 60-70 days) contributes to the uncertainty, suggesting a heightened potential for rapid shifts in public opinion or political maneuvering. 

The most probable outcome centers around a persistent status quo. The Bundestag will almost certainly debate a motion to initiate a ban procedure, but the motion will likely fail to pass due to a combination of factors. These include a fragmented coalition government lacking strong, unified resolve, significant opposition from within the CDU/CSU and FDP, concerns regarding the legal and practical complexities of a ban, and a public divided on the issue. Furthermore, demonstrating a clear and unambiguous violation of Article 21 of the Basic Law by the AfD presents a considerable hurdle. 

However, a “No” outcome remains plausible if a significant shift in public opinion occurs – perhaps driven by economic anxieties, a populist messaging campaign by the AfD, or a weakening of the opposition’s resolve. Conversely, a “Yes” outcome hinges on a confluence of events: a major security incident directly linked to the AfD, a definitively favorable ruling from the Federal Constitutional Court, and a sustained, united front from the opposition coalition. The timeframe remaining significantly reduces the likelihood of these more dramatic scenarios unfolding. Therefore, a continued status quo, characterized by debate but ultimately no ban, represents the most probable outcome.
