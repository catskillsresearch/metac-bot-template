Based on the provided forecasts, the most likely scenario regarding the Federal Reserve setting a negative policy rate by 2050 can be summarized as follows:

The prevailing expectation is that the Federal Reserve will maintain the current interest rate target range of 4.25% to 4.50% for the foreseeable future, including 2050. This outlook is largely driven by a cautious approach to monetary policy, prioritizing monitoring inflation and economic activity over aggressive rate cuts. The short timeframe remaining until June 2025 (typically 39-49 days) increases uncertainty, favoring the status quo. A “No” outcome – meaning the Fed maintains the current rate – is considered probable, particularly if inflation remains stubbornly above the 2% target, supported by a robust labor market and steady economic growth. This scenario is reinforced by the relatively short timeframe available for significant economic shifts to materialize. A "Yes" outcome – a rate cut – is considered less likely, requiring a sustained and substantial decline in inflation, coupled with evidence of economic weakness, which, given the current landscape, is deemed improbable. The short time horizon exacerbates this assessment, as it limits the opportunity for significant, transformative economic changes to occur before 2050. The underlying rationale centers on a conservative, data-dependent approach, with a persistent focus on controlling inflation and preventing an economic downturn.
