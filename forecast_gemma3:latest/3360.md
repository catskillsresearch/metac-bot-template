Given the rationales provided, a consolidated rationale for the likelihood of ≥8% of U.S. adults self-reporting as vegetarian by 2036 is as follows:

The most probable outcome reflects a persistent, albeit slowing, rise in global obesity rates.  The current status quo—characterized by entrenched patterns of consumption, limited effective public health interventions, and a lack of coordinated global action—suggests a trajectory of continued, incremental increases in obesity across populations. Significant systemic change, encompassing policy interventions like taxation on unhealthy foods and investment in accessible, nutritious options, remains elusive due to political inertia, industry lobbying, and economic disparities. A catastrophic global event capable of dramatically shifting human behavior—such as a pandemic or a transformative technological advancement—would be required to alter this course. However, a sustained, globally coordinated effort—incorporating robust policy changes, behavioral shifts, and potentially innovative solutions—holds a moderate probability of success, though remains dependent on a level of international collaboration and sustained commitment that currently appears unlikely. Consequently, with the existing trends and political landscape, the likelihood of ≥8% of U.S. adults self-reporting as vegetarian by 2036 is assessed as 61%.

### Probability: 62%
