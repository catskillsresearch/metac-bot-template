The most likely outcome is a slow, incremental increase in the role of nuclear power. Globally, the energy landscape will remain dominated by fossil fuels, with renewables (solar, wind) growing steadily but not rapidly enough to meet the exponential demand increase driven by AI. Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) will be developed and deployed in a limited number of countries (primarily those with existing nuclear expertise like France, South Korea, and potentially the US and UK), but their overall contribution to global electricity supply will remain modest â€“ likely around 8-12% by 2026, due to regulatory hurdles, cost challenges, and public perception. AI-driven electricity demand will be largely met by expanded renewable capacity and, to a lesser extent, natural gas. Globally, public opinion about nuclear has shifted slightly towards acceptance due to discussions around AI applications, but concerns about safety and waste management remain significant hurdles. The 11th Basic Plan, while conceptually sound, will struggle to gain traction and widespread international adoption. This cautious approach reflects a fundamental imbalance between the rapid growth of AI's energy needs and the inherent challenges associated with scaling up nuclear power.
