The global population projections by 2300, conditional on a population exceeding 500 million, are shaped by a complex interplay of factors. The dominant trend, consistently highlighted across all forecasts, points to a peak global population around 10.3 billion by 2100, followed by a gradual decline. However, considerable uncertainty remains due to the potential for significant deviations driven by unforeseen events. The most probable scenario involves a peak population of roughly 10.3 billion, influenced by the continued decline in birth rates and the lengthening of human lifespans.

However, several potential “black swan” events could dramatically alter this trajectory. A highly virulent pandemic, far more lethal than COVID-19, combined with a drastic reduction in life expectancy due to widespread mortality, could push the population to a significantly lower level, potentially stabilizing around 6 billion by 2100. Conversely, advancements in reproductive technologies – such as genetic editing and artificial wombs – coupled with a cultural shift towards larger families, could lead to a population exceeding 18 billion by 2100.  Similarly, a major breakthrough in medical technology dramatically increasing life expectancy to 120 years, alongside increased prosperity, could propel the population to 15 billion or higher. 

The range of potential outcomes is wide. While the most likely scenario suggests a peak population of around 10.3 billion, it's crucial to acknowledge the inherent uncertainty.  A reasonable probabilistic assessment considers the central tendency around 10.3 billion, with a substantial tail extending towards lower levels (6 billion) due to catastrophic events and higher potential levels (15+ billion) if disruptive technological breakthroughs occur.  These projections are continually subject to revision as new data emerges and the future unfolds.
