Based on the provided forecasts, the most probable opening weekend gross for *Superman* (2025) is likely to fall within a range of $175 million to $210 million. The prevailing trend indicates a strong likelihood of exceeding $175 million, driven by a combination of factors including Gunn’s involvement, positive initial buzz, and the extensive marketing campaign. 

The opening weekend is anticipated to be heavily influenced by sustained positive word-of-mouth and audience engagement. While there’s a risk of a significant dip due to negative social media campaigns or critical backlash, the overall expectation is for a blockbuster opening.  The most significant risk is a scenario involving substantial negative public reaction – potentially triggered by perceived shortcomings in the film’s narrative, visual representation, or character portrayal – which could realistically push the opening weekend below $175 million.  Conversely, a sustained positive response, amplified by viral engagement and favorable reviews, has the potential to elevate the opening significantly beyond $210 million.  Therefore, a realistic range, considering all the potential variables, points to an opening weekend gross between $175 and $210 million.
