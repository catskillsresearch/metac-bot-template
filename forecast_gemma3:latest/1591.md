Based on the provided forecasts, the most likely scenario is one characterized by sustained, moderate growth within the Moroccan financial market and a gradual increase in interest in Effective Altruism. The core drivers of this outcome stem from a consistent pattern of low interest rates, driven by the Bank Al Maghrib’s easing policy, coupled with ongoing investment projects and a generally stable global economic environment. Technological advancements, particularly surrounding the 2030 World Cup infrastructure, contribute to a positive investment landscape. Furthermore, sustained low inflation supports continued investor confidence, bolstering the stock market. While a major global economic downturn or significant geopolitical event represent credible “no outcome” scenarios that could disrupt this trajectory, the overall probability leans towards a continuation of the established trends. The increasing interest in Effective Altruism reflects a broader trend of philanthropic engagement and potentially, a growing awareness of global challenges – a trend that would likely continue alongside the broader economic developments.  The key factors supporting this outcome are the relatively stable and predictable macroeconomic environment, combined with the momentum of investment and technological development.
