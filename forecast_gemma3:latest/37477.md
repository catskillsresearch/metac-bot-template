Based on the rationales provided, here’s a consolidated rationale for the likelihood of a federal law, regulation, or executive order mandating safety checks for AI models being enacted in the United States before January 20, 2029:

The probability of a definitive outcome – specifically, the enactment of comprehensive federal AI regulation in the US – within the next six years remains low, estimated at approximately 35%. The current landscape is characterized by a fragmented and evolving regulatory approach, driven by a complex interplay of factors. The most likely near-term scenario reflects a continued status quo, where the US maintains a relatively hands-off approach, prioritizing innovation and economic competitiveness, while the EU and China pursue more stringent regulatory paths. States will continue to introduce localized AI legislation, primarily focused on consumer protection and risk management. 

A significant barrier to a unified US response is the deeply entrenched political divisions regarding AI regulation, compounded by differing technological priorities. A substantial, coordinated global framework – characterized by a binding international summit and widespread adoption – is considered highly improbable given the existing geopolitical dynamics and divergent national interests. However, a “no outcome” scenario – characterized by a prolonged stalemate or a sudden, disruptive global event triggering a reactive, but ultimately fragmented, response – also carries a significant risk. 

A more plausible, though still relatively infrequent, scenario involves a localized shift. This could manifest as a major, unforeseen AI-related incident—perhaps a substantial economic disruption or security breach—forcing a reactive response from the US government. Alternatively, a breakthrough in AI safety research could shift the conversation, prompting a more unified, though likely still incremental, approach. However, a sustained, coordinated global framework remains the least likely outcome within the specified timeframe. The fragmented nature of the current regulatory landscape and the inherent challenges of achieving international consensus suggest that the US will continue to navigate AI governance through a combination of state-level legislation, industry self-regulation, and targeted government initiatives, rather than a comprehensive federal mandate.
