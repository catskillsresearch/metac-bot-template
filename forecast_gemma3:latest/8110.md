Here’s a synthesized rationale, incorporating the best elements from each forecast’s rationale, aiming for a cohesive and realistic assessment of the likelihood of Saudi-Israeli normalization by 2031, given a nuclear Iran:

**Synthesized Rationale:**

The probability of a normalization agreement between Saudi Arabia and Israel by 2031, contingent on Iran achieving a nuclear bomb, remains complex and uncertain, but leans towards a moderate likelihood.  The timeframe – approximately 18-24 months – offers sufficient opportunity for significant shifts in regional dynamics and geopolitical alignments.

The most probable near-term outcome (next 1-2 years) is likely to be a continuation of the *slow, incremental progression* towards normalization, as repeatedly highlighted. Discreet diplomatic channels will continue to operate, along with limited improvements in security cooperation and discussions regarding economic ties. However, fundamental obstacles—primarily Iran’s nuclear ambitions, the unresolved Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and Saudi Arabia’s deep security concerns—will continue to act as significant barriers. The status quo, characterized by cautious engagement and the potential for escalation, is the most likely scenario without a transformative shift.

However, a “yes” outcome – a formal normalization agreement – hinges on a confluence of unlikely, yet plausible, developments. First, a demonstrable, sustained reduction in Iranian influence in the region would be crucial. This might involve a negotiated de-escalation of tensions in the Persian Gulf, or a weakening of Iranian proxy groups. Second, a shift in Saudi Arabia’s internal political landscape, perhaps with a willingness to compromise on certain aspects of the Palestinian issue—enough to appear amenable to a deal—is essential. Third, and critically, a significant breakthrough facilitated by the US is required, potentially occurring during the 2024 US Presidential election cycle. This would likely involve a willingness from the US to actively back Saudi Arabia, providing robust security guarantees, a pathway to acquire nuclear capabilities, and a commitment to countering Iranian influence. The level of US commitment would likely depend on the outcome of the election and the state of the US-Iran relationship at the time. Finally, verifiable intelligence demonstrating tangible progress in dismantling Iran’s nuclear program would be a key catalyst for Saudi willingness to move forward. A significant escalation – whether triggered by a miscalculation by Iran or Israel, or a broadened regional conflict— dramatically increases the probability of a “no” outcome, reinforcing the existing impasse.  The timeframe allows for several different outcomes, and the overall situation remains sensitive and subject to rapid change. The core difficulty lies in aligning the competing strategic interests and deeply rooted historical and security concerns of all the key actors.
