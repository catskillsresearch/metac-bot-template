Okay, here’s a consolidated rationale, synthesizing the best elements from all five forecasts:

**Consolidated Rationale:**

The likelihood of confirmed human-to-human transmission of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 globally before June 23, 2026, remains a complex and uncertain prediction. Based on the available information and considering various scenarios, a probability assessment is warranted.

Currently, the most likely scenario (approximately 30%) is that no sustained, easily transmissible human-to-human transmission event will occur within the next 12-18 months. Existing surveillance systems, coupled with ongoing research into viral adaptation, continue to manage the risk, preventing a large-scale, sustained outbreak. The virus's adaptation remains gradual, and the existing precautions – biosecurity protocols, surveillance programs, and research – are expected to continue holding.

However, the risk is not zero.  Several factors suggest a non-negligible probability of a more significant event. The ongoing presence of the virus in animal reservoirs – particularly cattle and pigs – coupled with the demonstrated capacity for avian influenza viruses to mutate, presents a persistent threat. A significant mutation that dramatically increases transmissibility among humans (approximately 40% probability) remains a key concern. This mutation would likely enhance the virus’s ability to bind to and infect human respiratory cells, while facilitating efficient human-to-human transmission. A global disruption of existing biosecurity measures – a deliberate release or a catastrophic event – could significantly increase the risk.  This could be compounded by increased global travel and trade, exposing a larger population to the virus.

A highly improbable scenario (approximately 15% probability) involves a truly catastrophic convergence of events – a highly advantageous mutation *and* a major ecological shift coupled with a significant disruption of global biosecurity.

Therefore, a combined probability assessment places the likelihood of a confirmed, sustained human-to-human transmission event within the next 12-18 months at approximately 45%. This probability acknowledges both the existing mitigation efforts and the inherent uncertainties associated with viral evolution and global dynamics. Continuous monitoring, rapid response capabilities, and proactive research are vital to manage this ongoing risk.
