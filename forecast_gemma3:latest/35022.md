Based on the rationales provided, the following represents a consolidated and consistent rationale for forecasting the Ibex 35’s performance through June 23, 2025, to July 23, 2025:

The likelihood of the Ibex 35 closing 2025 higher than its starting point (approximately 13,000 points) is moderately high, estimated at around 65%. This projection hinges on a confluence of positive economic and geopolitical factors, tempered by significant underlying uncertainties.

The near-term (approximately 30 days) will likely see continued fluctuation within a band of roughly +/- 2% around the current level, driven by the ongoing, albeit subdued, recovery within the Eurozone and persistent anxieties relating to trade tensions and the Ukraine conflict.  The market’s reactive nature, rather than proactive leadership, suggests that short-term movements will be primarily driven by news events and sentiment shifts. 

However, a “Yes” outcome – a sustained rise above the initial level – is plausible, contingent on several key developments. A continued, gradual easing of inflationary pressures, coupled with cautious signals from the European Central Bank regarding monetary policy, would be a critical positive catalyst. Furthermore, a sustained recovery within the Eurozone economies, particularly Germany, is crucial. A lack of major geopolitical shocks, specifically avoiding escalation of the Ukraine conflict or significant trade wars, is paramount. Positive corporate earnings, particularly from Spanish companies exposed to growth sectors like renewable energy or technology, would bolster investor confidence. Finally, a relatively stable, or even dovish, stance from the US Federal Reserve would provide additional support to the Ibex 35.

Conversely, a “No” outcome – a decline below the initial level – is a realistic possibility, primarily driven by significant shocks. Escalation of the Ukraine conflict, or a major sovereign debt crisis within a key European nation, would trigger investor caution and potentially a market correction. Similarly, a sharp rise in inflation coupled with aggressive interest rate hikes by the ECB could undermine economic growth and negatively impact the Ibex 35.

Ultimately, the Ibex 35’s trajectory will be heavily influenced by the ability of policymakers to manage the complex interplay of economic and geopolitical risks. While the potential for growth exists, investors must remain cognizant of the considerable uncertainties and volatility inherent in the market environment.
