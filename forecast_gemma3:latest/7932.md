The global adoption of solar and wind power by 2030 is subject to considerable uncertainty, driven by a complex interplay of technological advancements, policy decisions, economic conditions, and unforeseen events. Based on current trends and projections, a moderate level of growth is expected, but the precise outcome remains difficult to pinpoint. The status quo scenario suggests a gradual increase, with renewables accounting for approximately 30-35% of global electricity generation by 2030. However, the current trend of rapid growth, fueled by falling costs and supportive policies, points to a significantly higher potential. If this trend continues, renewables could reach 45-55% of global electricity generation by 2030. 

However, several disruptive factors could substantially alter this trajectory. A major global recession, coupled with policy reversals and supply chain disruptions, could push renewable energy penetration down to 30-35%. Conversely, a dramatic breakthrough in energy storage technology, combined with a global carbon pricing mechanism, could trigger a rapid acceleration, potentially reaching 70-80%. Furthermore, unexpected geopolitical events or technological setbacks could introduce considerable volatility. 

Considering all these possibilities, a reasonable estimate for the percentage of electricity produced in the US from solar power by 2030 is within a range of 45-60%. The continued decline in solar and wind costs, along with ongoing policy support and technological advancements, are expected to drive significant growth, but the precise level of penetration will ultimately depend on how these factors evolve over the coming years.  The most likely outcome falls within the 55-65% range, representing a sustained and substantial shift towards renewable energy sources.
