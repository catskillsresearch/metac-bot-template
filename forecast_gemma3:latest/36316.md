Based on the rationales provided, here’s a consolidated rationale for the likelihood of a federal investigation being launched over alleged insider trading relating to Trump’s tariff announcements before September 2025:

The probability of a formal investigation by the SEC being launched within the timeframe remains relatively low, though not negligible. The remaining time until September 2025 (approximately 6 months) presents a window for developments, but the key challenges center on the difficulty of proving insider trading and the potential for political interference. The most likely scenario, if nothing changes, is a continuation of the current situation: ongoing speculation, debate, and monitoring by financial analysts and political commentators. The SEC will likely conduct a preliminary investigation, potentially issuing a statement acknowledging concerns without immediately launching a formal probe. Media coverage would continue, but without a definitive conclusion about illegal activity.

However, several factors could shift this probability. The most significant risk lies in the potential for a “Yes” outcome – a formal investigation triggered by compelling evidence. This requires a substantial breakthrough, most notably the discovery of explicit communications demonstrating that Trump received advance notice of the tariff pause and acted on that information to benefit his financial interests. A credible whistleblower presenting irrefutable evidence, such as a detailed audit trail linking trading activity directly to Trump's communications, would dramatically increase this probability. The DOJ and SEC would then likely launch a formal investigation.

Conversely, a “No” outcome – the complete fizzling out of the investigation – is also plausible. This would depend on a failure to uncover conclusive evidence, a decision by the DOJ to drop the investigation due to lack of resources or political considerations, or a deliberate effort by Trump and his allies to obstruct the inquiry. 

The probability of a formal investigation remains uncertain, hovering around 35-45%, dependent on the ability to establish a clear and demonstrable case of insider trading. The lack of definitive evidence and the potential for political hurdles make a formal investigation a challenging prospect.
