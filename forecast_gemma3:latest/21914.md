Given the diverse forecasts, a consistent rationale for Bryan Caplan’s WGP bet emerges, incorporating the most salient elements from each. The U.S. economy’s trajectory by January 1, 2043, remains subject to considerable uncertainty, largely driven by the confluence of geopolitical risks, trade policy developments, and the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy decisions. While the immediate short-term outlook suggests continued, albeit moderately slow, growth, the potential for significant negative shocks necessitates a cautious assessment. 

The most probable immediate outcome – by 2026 – is a continued, though subdued, expansion, likely hovering around 1.5% - 2% annual GDP growth, coupled with persistent inflationary pressures reflected in an elevated 10-year breakeven rate. This scenario hinges on a relatively stable US political environment and the Federal Reserve maintaining a data-dependent, measured approach to monetary policy. However, several key risks could derail this outlook and increase the likelihood of a recession.

The most significant immediate risk lies in the potential escalation of trade tensions, particularly between the US and China. Further tariffs, particularly broad-based ones, would undoubtedly disrupt global supply chains, dampen business investment, and negatively impact consumer confidence, thereby pushing the economy towards contraction. The Federal Reserve’s reaction to this would be critical. A delayed or insufficient response to rising inflation—coupled with continued trade headwinds—would dramatically increase the probability of a recession.

A prolonged, intense geopolitical crisis, notably an escalation of the Russia-Ukraine war or the emergence of a new international conflict, could also destabilize the global economy and contribute to a U.S. recession. Such events would likely fuel uncertainty, disrupt trade flows, and potentially lead to a sharp decline in consumer spending. 

Furthermore, a significant, unforeseen deterioration in the commercial real estate market – particularly the collapse of a major property holding company – could trigger a broader economic downturn, given its interconnectedness with other sectors.

However, the likelihood of a “No” outcome – a continued stable expansion – is not without its own vulnerabilities. A successful resolution of the US debt crisis, coupled with a thawing of US-China trade relations, would substantially diminish the immediate risks. 

Ultimately, the probability of Bryan Caplan’s bet being correct – that WGP will not exceed 130% of its previous peak – remains tied to the broader economic and geopolitical environment over the next two decades. While a moderate recession within the next few years is possible, a sustained period of economic growth exceeding 130% of its prior peak remains a significant challenge, given the inherent uncertainties and potential for disruptive events.
