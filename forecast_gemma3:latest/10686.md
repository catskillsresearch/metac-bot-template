The Supreme Court overturning *Obergefell v. Hodges* within the next 10 years is a complex issue with significant uncertainty. The most likely outcome, considering the rationales presented, is a continuation of the existing legal landscape, with *Obergefell* remaining the established precedent. However, the possibility of a shift, though currently low, cannot be entirely dismissed.

The key factors driving this assessment are the current composition of the Supreme Court, the level of sustained political and legal pressure to overturn the ruling, and the emergence of a truly compelling legal challenge.  Given the limited timeframe (approximately 6-12 months), the current court’s stability, and the lack of a clear, immediate catalyst for change, a “no” outcome—maintaining the status quo—holds the highest probability.

However, several scenarios could lead to a “yes” outcome, requiring a confluence of events: a shift in the court’s ideological balance through appointments, a highly successful legal challenge leveraging novel arguments, and significant continued pressure from conservative legal and political forces. This combination of factors remains relatively unlikely in the short term.

A “no” outcome is most probable if the Supreme Court declines to hear a challenge, or if efforts to challenge the ruling fail to gain traction due to a lack of a compelling legal argument or sufficient support within the Court. This would be further reinforced by a stable political environment and a continued acceptance of LGBTQ+ rights.

Ultimately, the probability of a shift within the next 10 years is estimated at around 25%, reflecting the current level of uncertainty and the complex interplay of legal, political, and social forces at play. While a reversal isn’t impossible, the existing legal framework and the current judicial landscape suggest a continued defense of *Obergefell v. Hodges*.
