Based on the rationales provided, here’s a synthesized rationale for the probability of Betelgeuse undergoing a supernova within the next few years:

The probability of a significant, observable supernova from Betelgeuse occurring within the next few years remains relatively low, though it’s not zero. Current estimates, ranging from 15% to 35%, reflect a cautious approach given the inherent uncertainties surrounding stellar evolution. The most likely scenario is a continuation of Betelgeuse’s current evolutionary path, characterized by gradual dimming and fluctuations, without a dramatic core collapse. The star’s long timescale for a supernova—typically tens of thousands of years—significantly reduces the probability within a timeframe of a few years.

However, several potential “black swan” events could drastically alter this assessment. A sustained and sharp brightening of Betelgeuse, coupled with detectable changes in its spectral lines indicating core fusion instability, represents a critical trigger. This would necessitate a fundamental shift in our understanding of stellar dynamics. Alternatively, a previously undetected but highly energetic core instability event—perhaps induced by a localized convective disturbance or a subtle magnetic fluctuation—could initiate an abrupt and localized explosion.

While the possibility of a rapid brightening event exists, it’s still considered a low-probability scenario. The greatest potential for a sudden, observable event arises from unforeseen systemic changes, such as a major shift in the star's internal dynamics, or a sudden increase in the star’s brightness, but these remain largely theoretical. Given the extended timescale for stellar events, a significant change within the next few years is considered improbable, and current observations suggest a continuation of the star’s existing evolutionary trajectory. The overall probability remains within the range of 15-35%, contingent on the ability of unforeseen events to significantly influence the star’s internal conditions.
