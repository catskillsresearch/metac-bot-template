Based on the provided forecasts, here's a consolidated rationale for the maximum world real GDP growth in percentage points for a single year in the 21st century:

The global economic outlook for 2025 is characterized by considerable uncertainty, reflecting a landscape of ongoing revisions and potential shocks. While initial forecasts suggested a relatively stable growth rate of around 2.7%, a more nuanced picture emerges when considering the multiple revisions and underlying assumptions. The dominant trend is one of cautious downward adjustments, driven primarily by concerns about trade fragmentation, persistent inflationary pressures (albeit moderating), and ongoing geopolitical risks. Several forecasts highlight a potential for emerging markets, particularly Vietnam, to outperform, but this is often tempered by the potential for a global recession triggered by unforeseen events. 

A central scenario involves continued, albeit slowing, growth in the global economy, likely in the range of 2.7% to 3.0%. This is supported by the relatively consistent forecasts from multiple sources, particularly those focusing on the World Bank and OECD. However, a significant risk remains the possibility of a sharp downturn triggered by heightened geopolitical tensions, a severe supply chain disruption, or a more aggressive monetary policy response to inflation. In a more optimistic scenario, technological breakthroughs – particularly in renewable energy and automation – could unlock significant productivity gains, pushing global growth towards 3.5%. Conversely, a major geopolitical crisis or trade war could easily drag growth down to 1.8% or lower.  The Vietnamese economy stands out as a potentially brighter spot, with growth forecasts ranging from 6.6% to 8.0%, reflecting its relative resilience and favorable investment climate.  

Overall, the consensus suggests a baseline of 2.7% to 3.0% growth, with a considerable degree of volatility stemming from global uncertainties. Therefore, a cautious estimate for the maximum achievable growth rate in percentage points for a single year in the 21st century is 3.0%, acknowledging the potential for both upside and downside risks.
