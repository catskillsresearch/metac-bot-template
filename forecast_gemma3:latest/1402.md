Given the complex and uncertain nature of these predictions, the most probable outcome regarding the long-term survival and potential recovery of the Cosmos 1 probe, and the ongoing operation of the Parker Solar Probe, hinges on a confluence of technological advancements and fortunate observations. The overarching theme is a reliance on unexpected discoveries and late-stage interventions.

The core challenge lies in the inherent difficulties of locating and recovering a defunct spacecraft drifting in deep space, compounded by the passage of time and the increasing degradation of the Cosmos 1 probe’s systems.  A statistically low probability exists for a complete recovery, with the most likely scenario being a silent, ultimately forgotten demise of the probe as it continues its journey through the solar system.  However, there’s a significant chance that a combination of factors – particularly technological leaps and dedicated, focused research – could dramatically shift the odds. 

Specifically, the likelihood of a successful recovery of Cosmos 1 is highest if a dedicated, privately-funded team leverages advancements in AI-powered signal analysis and autonomous probe technology. This approach would focus on utilizing the probe’s faint signal as it continues to drift, aided by improved spectral analysis techniques and potentially, the detection of anomalies due to material degradation.  Conversely, the continued operation of the Parker Solar Probe is significantly more secure, dependent on consistent, reliable performance of its thermal management system, communications array, and navigation systems – a sustained, relatively stable outcome.  The biggest threat to the probe's operation remains a significant solar flare, capable of overwhelming its heat shielding and causing catastrophic damage.  Ultimately, the future rests on the ongoing ability of humanity to detect, analyze, and potentially recover relics from our past space endeavors, driven by curiosity and technological innovation.
