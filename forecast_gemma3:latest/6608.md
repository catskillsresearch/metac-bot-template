The research into primordial black holes will continue, but progress will be slow and incremental. There will be continued theoretical modelling, some potentially inconclusive observational searches (e.g., neutrino experiments like KM3NeT), and maybe a few small, intriguing anomalies that get dismissed as statistical fluctuations or instrumental errors. The overall consensus will remain that primordial black holes *could* be a component of dark matter, but the evidence is weak and the search is challenging. Essentially, we'll be at a plateau of moderate activity, with ongoing research but no major breakthroughs. The core questions – their existence, mass distribution, and contribution to dark matter – will remain largely unanswered, though the public’s interest will remain relatively steady.  Given the varied assessments, the most likely outcome is a continued, albeit fluctuating, level of interest in primordial black holes. Research will continue, fueled by theoretical advances and potential hints from experiments like KM3NeT. The public’s fascination will remain, though likely without a dramatic breakthrough. The number of people directly working on this problem will not change. It will be somewhere around 100 people. However, a “No” outcome could occur if all data collection from instruments like KM3NeT and IceCube produces *no statistically significant results*. Furthermore, theoretical models remain unchanged or are disproven by new observations. This could be driven by a fundamental misunderstanding of the physics at play or by the inherent limitations of the current experimental setup. Alternatively, a “Yes” outcome – meaning that the research and investigation into primordial black holes receives a significant boost and the concept gains substantial traction – would depend on a truly positive result from a major experiment, such as KM3NeT detecting multiple high-energy neutrinos, or a new theoretical breakthrough that convincingly links primordial black holes to dark matter. If the experiment showed definitive evidence, within one year the number of people working on this problem would rise to 200. The overall timeframe for a significant breakthrough is estimated at approximately 1.75 years, a period characterized by ongoing, incremental research with a low probability of a definitive answer.
