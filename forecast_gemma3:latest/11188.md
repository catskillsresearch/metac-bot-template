The widespread adoption of AI in constructing bug-free code of more than 10,000 lines by 2030 is plausible, though not guaranteed. The core drivers of this outcome center around a confluence of technological breakthroughs and significant shifts in industry practices. Initially, the trajectory of development will continue with incremental improvements in AI coding tools alongside persistent concerns about code quality and data center energy consumption. However, a ‘Yes’ outcome hinges on several key developments. First, a significant advancement in AI's ability to truly *understand* and generate code semantics, moving beyond simple code completion to genuine architectural comprehension. Second, the widespread adoption of automated code review tools powered by sophisticated AI. Crucially, this progress would be further amplified by substantial efforts towards standardization and best practices in AI-assisted coding. Finally, supportive regulatory action—prioritizing software quality and security within the context of AI usage—would be essential to drive this change. This would likely be combined with demonstrable cost savings and significant pressure from sustainability advocates to reshape the industry, with organizations prioritizing AI-driven efficiency and automation. While challenges remain—including the potential for technological setbacks or regulatory hurdles—the combination of these factors creates a reasonable probability of achieving the desired outcome by 2030.
