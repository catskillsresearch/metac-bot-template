The most likely outcome regarding the future of smallpox cases globally is a persistent, albeit contained, increase, reflecting a combination of ongoing challenges in achieving widespread vaccination and the potential for viral evolution. The overarching rationale for this assessment draws upon the recurring themes present across all forecasts, emphasizing the critical factors of low vaccination rates driven by misinformation and hesitancy, coupled with logistical and resource constraints hindering effective response measures. While a breakthrough in vaccine technology or a sudden, coordinated global effort to overcome these hurdles remains possible, the forecasts consistently highlight the significant probability of continued localized outbreaks and a gradual increase in global case numbers â€“ approximately 200-400 new cases per year globally, primarily in areas with low vaccination rates. The scenarios projecting rapid escalation, while statistically less probable, underscore the inherent risks associated with complacency, viral mutation, and the failure to effectively address the root causes of the ongoing challenges. Therefore, a robust and sustained response, prioritizing equitable access to vaccines, targeted public health campaigns, and continuous surveillance, is paramount in mitigating the risk of a more catastrophic outcome. The persistent low vaccination rates, combined with the challenges in logistical implementation and effective communication, create a significant vulnerability that will drive a gradual increase in the number of cases in the coming years.
