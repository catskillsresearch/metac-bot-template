Given the rationale from all five forecasts, the most likely outcome is that Donald Trump will *not* win the Nobel Peace Prize before 2029. The consistent themes across all forecasts point to a significant hurdle: the Nobel Committee’s preference for demonstrable, sustained peace efforts, combined with the complex and volatile geopolitical landscape. The committee’s reluctance to easily award the prize to a sitting US president, particularly one with a controversial record, adds another layer of difficulty. 

The key factors contributing to this assessment are: the relatively short timeframe remaining until the announcement (approximately 3-4 months), the persistent instability of the conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza, and the ongoing political polarization surrounding Trump’s actions. While a scenario where Trump successfully negotiates comprehensive peace agreements between these key conflict zones is conceivable, the forecasts consistently highlight the considerable risk and the need for truly transformative, sustained progress – something that, according to these rationales, remains unlikely within the timeframe and given the current situation. The committee’s caution and focus on impactful, long-term peacebuilding efforts appear to outweigh any potential for a sudden, decisive intervention by Trump. Therefore, the prevailing probability remains firmly in favor of a ‘no’ outcome, with a combined probability derived from the forecasts, estimating approximately 40%.
