Based on the rationales provided, a consistent rationale for the percentage of US car sales that will be all-electric in 2050 is as follows:

Given the timeframe remaining until 2050, the overall outlook for EV market share is subject to considerable uncertainty. The current trends—accelerating EV sales, technological advancements, and supportive policies—point to a significant increase in EV market share. However, numerous potential disruptions and unforeseen events could significantly alter this trajectory.

A conservative estimate, assuming a continued but potentially slowing pace of technological development and policy support, suggests a global EV market share of around 37.5% by 2025 and 50% by 2026, rising to approximately 65% by 2027. This scenario accounts for continued investments by major automotive manufacturers and the push for stricter emission standards. 

A more optimistic scenario, assuming a substantial breakthrough in battery technology (solid-state or similar), coupled with rapid deployment of ultra-fast charging infrastructure and continued government subsidies, could push the market share to 70% by 2025 and 85% by 2026. This assumes significant shifts in consumer preference toward larger, practical electric vehicles and widespread global agreement on emission reductions.

However, a significantly less favorable outcome is possible. An unexpected global recession, combined with major supply chain disruptions – particularly impacting battery materials – could dramatically slow EV adoption. Such a scenario could result in a market share of 15% by 2025.

Therefore, considering the range of potential outcomes, a reasonable estimate for the percentage of US car sales that will be all-electric in 2050 lies between 50% and 85%, with a most likely outcome around 65%, acknowledging the significant uncertainties that remain. This range reflects the interplay between technological progress, policy decisions, and unforeseen economic or geopolitical events.
