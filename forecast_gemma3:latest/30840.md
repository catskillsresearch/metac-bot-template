The ongoing efforts to overturn California’s Proposition 12, enacted in 2018, will likely remain largely unsuccessful over the next six months. The primary obstacle to a “Yes” outcome – the passage of federal legislation preempting California’s animal welfare standards – is a significant one, heavily influenced by the shifting balance of power within Congress. If nothing changes, the status quo will persist, with California continuing to enforce its stringent animal welfare standards for pig production and the federal government maintaining a limited role, largely due to legal and political considerations. Key to this outcome is the continued resistance from the pork industry and animal welfare groups defending the law. A “No” outcome, where the status quo is maintained, hinges on several factors: a sustained stalemate in Congress, the continued legal challenges posed by California, and a lack of significant shifts in public opinion. The most probable scenario is a continued legislative standstill, with the EATS Act (or similar legislation) facing staunch opposition in the Senate and the House. A “No” outcome is also dependent on a major shift in the political landscape, such as a realignment within the Republican party, a significant economic downturn affecting the agricultural sector, or a major public backlash against industrial farming practices. A shift in public opinion towards greater support for California's standards would be a critical element.  The likelihood of a Republican-controlled Congress successfully enacting legislation to preempt California’s law remains low, predicated on a sustained Republican majority and a willingness to prioritize political objectives over animal welfare. A highly improbable but possible scenario involves a coordinated effort by a politically motivated alliance, combining sustained pressure on individual senators with a broader public shift in opinion. Ultimately, the most consistent predictor is the expected continued legislative deadlock.
