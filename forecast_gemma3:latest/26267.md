The overarching rationale for the likelihood of nuclear fusion providing >10% of the world’s energy by 2025, based on the provided forecasts, centers on a highly uncertain and challenging technological pathway. The immediate timeframe – roughly the next 12 months – presents a significant obstacle to achieving a transformative outcome. 

The most probable scenario, representing approximately 65% of the collective probability, is one of continued, incremental progress.  This reflects the current state of affairs across various fusion research initiatives – ITER, SMR development, and advanced materials research – which have demonstrated steady, albeit slow, advancements. However, these efforts have yet to overcome the fundamental hurdles of sustained, net-positive energy output. This baseline scenario assumes a continuation of existing funding levels, ongoing technical refinements, and a slow accumulation of knowledge without a major breakthrough. 

A significant risk, representing roughly 35% of the combined probability, involves a “no” outcome. This hinges on an unforeseen, major setback – most likely at ITER, or perhaps a fundamental scientific obstacle revealed that fundamentally alters the trajectory of fusion research. Alternatively, a global economic crisis could dramatically curtail investment, effectively halting progress. 

However, a smaller, but non-negligible, probability – approximately 35% – exists for a “yes” outcome, predicated on a confluence of factors. This necessitates a rapid breakthrough – possibly involving a fundamentally new approach to plasma confinement, a revolutionary materials discovery, or an unexpectedly successful iteration of ITER. This "yes" scenario demands a perfect storm of innovation, rapid investment, and sustained global collaboration, a scenario that, given the complexity and historical challenges of fusion research, remains highly improbable within the specified timeframe. The core assumption underpinning this optimistic scenario is that a critical technological lock will be broken, propelling fusion toward commercial viability with remarkable speed.
