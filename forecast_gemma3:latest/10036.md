Based on a synthesis of the rationales provided, the following represents the most comprehensive and consistent rationale for assessing the likelihood of a World War III by 2060:

The core dynamic driving the risk of a global conflict by 2060 remains a persistent, low-level escalation of tensions centered primarily around Taiwan.  If current trends continue, the status quo – characterized by heightened alert levels, military posturing, and strategic assessments – is highly probable. China’s continued military modernization and strategic assertiveness, coupled with the US response (including reinforcement of alliances and increased military presence in the region), contribute to this ongoing tension. The risk of miscalculation remains a significant concern.

However, a ‘no’ outcome—preventing a full-scale world war—is still possible, primarily dependent on a significant and unexpected diplomatic breakthrough. This requires a substantial shift in China’s approach to Taiwan, potentially involving a concrete commitment to de-escalation and a willingness to engage in serious negotiations. Simultaneously, a similar shift from the US – perhaps involving a reduction in its military presence in the region and a renewed commitment to multilateral diplomacy – would be crucial. Alternatively, a major global crisis – such as a severe pandemic or a catastrophic economic collapse – could temporarily shift the focus of both superpowers, effectively neutralizing the immediate risk factors.

Conversely, a ‘yes’ outcome—a world war—is rooted in a confluence of factors. Primarily, a miscalculation or accident, perhaps involving a Chinese attempt to blockade Taiwan or a direct military incursion, would trigger a chain reaction.  A rapid escalation, fueled by mistrust and a lack of clear communication, could draw in regional allies, leading to a broader conflict.  The inclusion of North Korea’s ongoing nuclear ambitions and the potential for misinterpretation of intentions would add further instability to the situation. While the existing systems of deterrence—nuclear, conventional, and strategic—serve as a mitigating factor, the inherent volatility of the situation and the possibility of a rapid, uncontrolled escalation mean that a catastrophic outcome remains a plausible, though not overwhelmingly likely, possibility. The underlying risk reflects a dangerous combination of strategic competition, geopolitical tensions, and the potential for human error.
