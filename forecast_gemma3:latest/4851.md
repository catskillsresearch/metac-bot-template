Based on the provided forecasts, the overall rationale for predicting the percentage of the world population living in $2.15/day poverty in 2030 is characterized by persistent challenges and a cautious outlook, driven by existing trends of inequality, limited progress in poverty reduction, and significant external shocks. The most likely outcome is a continuation of the current situation, with only modest improvements.

The core of the prediction rests on the recognition that global poverty reduction faces significant headwinds. Existing trends—increasing wealth inequality, a stagnation of progress in poverty reduction efforts, and the expansion of the global population—suggest a continued, albeit slow, increase in the number of people living in extreme poverty. The primary drivers of this outcome are a lack of coordinated global action, persistent systemic issues like limited access to finance and climate change impacts, and the risk of unforeseen global economic or geopolitical shocks.  While a rapid transformation is considered unlikely, the possibility of a significant positive shift relies on a confluence of highly optimistic and potentially disruptive events—namely, a globally coordinated effort involving transformative technological advancements, substantial wealth redistribution, and robust investments in sustainable development.

The forecasts consistently highlight the vulnerability of developing nations to economic crises and climate-related disasters, emphasizing that these factors could easily derail any progress.  The ongoing concentration of wealth and the lack of effective global governance structures further exacerbate the situation.  Despite some forecasts acknowledging the potential for technological breakthroughs and increased foreign aid, the prevailing sentiment is one of cautious pessimism, recognizing the substantial challenges and the high probability of continued inequality and limited poverty reduction. A key element of this outlook is a recognition that any substantial improvement would require a radical departure from the current trajectory, underpinned by unprecedented levels of international cooperation and a fundamental shift in global economic priorities.  The greatest risks stem from continued inaction and a failure to address the systemic drivers of poverty and inequality.
