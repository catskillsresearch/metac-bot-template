Based on the provided forecasts, the overall rationale for estimating global poultry slaughter numbers in 2030 (considering the available data up to June 23, 2025) is as follows:

The prediction of global poultry slaughter numbers in 2030 is inherently uncertain due to the limited timeframe of available data â€“ primarily news articles published between February 13, 2025, and June 23, 2025.  Therefore, any projection relies heavily on extrapolating observed trends while acknowledging the potential for significant disruptions.  The baseline scenario assumes a continuation of the current positive trend, driven by rising global meat consumption and technological advancements, particularly in Turkey, which has seen substantial production increases. This suggests an incremental growth of approximately 10-15 billion units over the next year, building upon the established upward trajectory. However, this projection incorporates substantial uncertainty, primarily due to the risk of unforeseen events.

A conservative estimate would be between 80-90 billion poultry. This is significantly influenced by several factors.  The most likely short-term outcome involves continued growth, driven by existing trends, but with a baseline of 10-15 billion units per year.  However, this projection is vulnerable to major shocks. A significant, geographically widespread avian influenza outbreak, coupled with supply chain disruptions, could dramatically curtail production, potentially reducing global poultry output to 55-65 billion units. Conversely, a revolutionary breakthrough in poultry genetics, combined with widespread adoption of vertical farming and automated production, alongside sustained population growth, could propel production to 102 billion poultry or more.

The projections emphasize the importance of considering both potential positive and negative scenarios. Technological advancements, particularly in efficiency and feed conversion rates, represent a key driver of future growth, but the risks of disease outbreaks, economic downturns, and shifts in consumer preferences remain substantial.  Overall, a realistic estimation requires a cautious approach, recognizing the inherent uncertainty and the potential for unexpected events to significantly alter the trajectory of global poultry production. The final number is likely to fall somewhere between 80 and 102 billion poultry, acknowledging the significant range of possibilities based on the available data and the inherent volatility of the market.
