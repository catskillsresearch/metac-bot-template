Based on the provided forecasts, the most likely scenario is a low probability of the US conducting a nuclear test explosion before 2030. The core rationale integrates the key elements from each forecast, emphasizing a gradual, reactive shift driven by unforeseen events rather than deliberate policy.

The most probable outcome hinges on a confluence of factors: a significant, imminent asteroid threat coupled with a breakdown in international cooperation and a demonstrable, albeit controversial, technological solution involving nuclear weapons. The timeframe – roughly 1-2 years – is critical, allowing for technological development and a heightened state of alert. The current geopolitical climate, characterized by rising tensions, nuclear modernization efforts, and a renewed focus on space defense, significantly increases the risk. However, a major international diplomatic breakthrough leading to comprehensive nuclear disarmament or a significant, globally coordinated effort to address asteroid deflection remains the most significant counterweight. The key driver of a “Yes” outcome isn't a proactive decision by the US government, but rather a reactive response to a perceived existential threat, fueled by a combination of fear, technological advancement, and a lack of viable alternatives. The probability remains relatively low due to the considerable political and ethical hurdles involved, and the reliance on a high-impact, potentially destabilizing event to trigger the necessary shift in priorities. The near-term outlook leans towards continued monitoring of threats and incremental technological advancement, with a persistent, albeit subdued, risk of escalation tied to the unpredictable nature of space hazards and global instability.
