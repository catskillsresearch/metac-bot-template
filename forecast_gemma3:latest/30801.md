The US Congress passing a bill implementing Trump’s tariff policies by June 23, 2025, presents a complex and uncertain prospect. Over the next approximately 18 months, significant factors will shape the likelihood of this outcome. The most probable scenario involves a measured and incremental implementation of some of Trump’s policies, largely driven by the existing political landscape and economic conditions. The immediate future, roughly 1 year and 6 months remaining, is characterized by a moderate, albeit sluggish, US economy, ongoing debates regarding fiscal policy and inflation, and continued technological advancement. The existing status quo, dominated by the Biden administration’s policies, will likely continue, with incremental adjustments potentially occurring due to economic pressures or political considerations. However, several potential ‘no’ scenarios could derail the effort. A major global economic crisis, geopolitical shock, or a drastic shift in the US political landscape – such as a landslide victory for an opposing party – could significantly alter the policy direction. Conversely, a “yes” outcome hinges on sustained Republican control of Congress, a favorable economic environment, and successful renegotiation of trade agreements. While a substantial political shift favoring Trump’s policies is possible, it remains a contingent and less probable scenario. Ultimately, the outcome depends on the delicate interplay of political will, economic conditions, and unforeseen global events.
