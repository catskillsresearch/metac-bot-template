The most likely scenario for the confirmation of extraterrestrial life on K2-18b involves a gradual increase in confidence, driven by accumulating evidence and sophisticated analysis. Initial findings, while suggestive, remain tentative, with a 10-20% probability of a definitive positive result. However, assuming a sustained trend of rapid data acquisition, technological advancements, and successful interpretations, the probability steadily climbs. Within one to two years, the probability of confirming life increases to approximately 30-40%. Continued refinement of atmospheric models and the search for complementary biosignatures push the probability toward 60-70%.  If the current trend continues, a 90-95% certainty of life becomes increasingly likely, contingent upon the discovery of robust and unmistakable biosignatures, such as complex organic molecules or direct evidence of microbial life. A significant, unexpected setback, like a catastrophic geological event or data corruption, could dramatically reduce the probability to around 10-15%.  A truly revolutionary discovery – a clear demonstration of a thriving microbial ecosystem – would elevate the probability to over 90%, triggering a global scientific and economic transformation.

Therefore, the overall probability of confirming life on K2-18b is characterized by a bell curve, peaking around 80-90% with a substantial degree of uncertainty surrounding the precise timing and nature of the confirmation.
