Okay, here’s a synthesized rationale combining the best elements of each forecast, aiming for a consistent and robust assessment.

**Synthesized Rationale: Likelihood of a Negotiated Peace Agreement by June 2029**

The question of whether Ukraine will lose non-Crimean territory by February 2029 compared to 2013 hinges on a complex interplay of military, political, and economic factors. Given the current trajectory, a negotiated settlement by that date appears unlikely, though not entirely impossible.

The most probable scenario, representing approximately 45% of the likelihood, is a continued state of protracted conflict, mirroring the current situation. This "status quo" outcome – characterized by a grinding war of attrition, continued Russian occupation of significant Ukrainian territory (estimated at 55-60%), and ongoing, albeit limited, Ukrainian resistance – is supported by Forecasts 1, 2, and 4. The time remaining (approximately 6 months) offers little prospect of a decisive shift in momentum, and the inherent challenges of achieving compromise between deeply entrenched positions – on both sides – suggest that a rapid resolution is improbable.

However, two significant, albeit low-probability, scenarios could potentially alter this trajectory. The first – a “No” outcome – centers around a catastrophic escalation.  This could manifest as a major Russian offensive successfully breaching Ukrainian defenses, potentially leading to a significant territorial loss for Ukraine, as highlighted by Forecasts 3 and 5. Alternatively, a complete disruption of Western aid to Ukraine, rendering the country strategically isolated and vulnerable, could similarly shift the balance of power. Both these scenarios, however, are considered relatively unlikely given the current patterns of limited, localized advances and counter-offensives.

The ‘Yes’ outcome – a negotiated settlement – represents the least probable scenario, carrying a probability of roughly 35%. This scenario requires a convergence of several factors: a demonstrable stabilization of the front lines, coupled with a sustained commitment to diplomatic engagement, and a willingness from both sides to compromise. Critically, it necessitates a shift in the geopolitical landscape, potentially involving a change in leadership within either Russia or Ukraine, or the emergence of a stronger mediating power (e.g., China or Turkey). Achieving a settlement that includes concrete territorial concessions (perhaps a demilitarized zone or control over certain ports) and guarantees of Ukraine’s future security would remain a formidable challenge.  Forecast 5’s assessment of 35% aligns with this cautious expectation.

Considering the limited time horizon and the entrenched positions of the warring parties, the probability of a negotiated resolution by February 2029 is thus best assessed as moderate, hovering around 35%, influenced largely by the potential for escalation rather than a sudden breakthrough. The ongoing military efforts, the level of Western support, and shifts within the political landscape will continue to be key determinants. 

**Final Assessment: Probability of Negotiated Territorial Concessions by 2029 – 35%**
