Based on the rationales provided, the following represents a consolidated rationale for the likelihood of Vox surpassing 27% voting intention among young people in Spain by the end of 2025:

The probability of Vox achieving this outcome is influenced by a complex interplay of factors, primarily centered around sustained political and economic conditions.  The immediate future (approximately 6-8 months) presents a relatively stable landscape with the PP maintaining a slight lead, Vox continuing its upward trajectory driven by youth support, and the PSOE struggling with declining popularity. Sumar remains a relevant force, but generally held at a lower level of support. However, several key scenarios could significantly impact the outcome.

A primary risk factor is a significant economic downturn. While a recession would likely stabilize the political landscape overall, it could paradoxically strengthen Vox’s appeal by exacerbating anxieties about economic hardship and disillusionment with the established political system. Conversely, a sustained and demonstrably positive economic recovery would likely neutralize Vox's advantage, pushing voters towards the PP or other parties offering more traditional solutions.

More crucially, a "yes" outcome – Vox surpassing 27% – hinges on the successful exploitation of existing frustrations among young voters. This necessitates a combination of factors: a major scandal involving the PP or PSOE, particularly one effectively framed to resonate with youthful anxieties; a sustained negative media narrative amplifying concerns about immigration, national identity, and economic inequality; and a compelling, effectively communicated campaign by Vox directly addressing these concerns.  A charismatic new leader emerging within Vox could also be a catalyst.

Conversely, a “no” outcome – a failure to surpass 27% – would most likely occur if the PP successfully counters Vox’s messaging, demonstrates tangible economic improvements, or if the economy experiences a significant recovery.  A similarly powerful, left-leaning movement, able to effectively mobilize young voters around issues of social justice and innovation, would also pose a substantial impediment.

Considering the current trends and the potential for various scenarios, a probabilistic assessment suggests a 65% likelihood of Vox exceeding 27% voting intention among young Spaniards by the end of 2025, contingent on ongoing political and economic developments, and the effectiveness of Vox's messaging and campaign strategy.
