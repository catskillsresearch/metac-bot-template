The current understanding of caloric restriction’s impact on human lifespan is characterized by cautious optimism, tempered by significant complexity and considerable uncertainty. The most plausible scenario involves incremental, though measurable, improvements driven by ongoing research and refinements in our understanding of aging mechanisms. Over the next 10-20 years, a realistic expectation is a 3-5 year increase in average human lifespan, contingent upon continued progress in research, translation of findings into effective interventions, and overcoming inherent challenges in human studies. This increase will likely be influenced by advances in biomarkers of aging, identification of genetic factors influencing responsiveness to caloric restriction, and the development of targeted dietary strategies. However, a truly transformative impact – a substantial extension of lifespan exceeding 10 years – remains a less likely outcome, heavily reliant on breakthroughs like targeted gene therapies or the discovery of novel, highly effective anti-aging compounds.  A more immediate, but still significant, impact is anticipated, driven by the broader adoption of lifestyle interventions such as intermittent fasting and optimized nutrition, alongside the development of personalized strategies based on individual genetic profiles.  The potential for catastrophic events – such as a global pandemic – or unforeseen scientific setbacks that disrupt research efforts or undermine the effectiveness of interventions adds a considerable layer of risk to these projections. Ultimately, the future impact of caloric restriction on lifespan hinges on a sustained commitment to rigorous scientific inquiry, coupled with the ability to translate complex scientific knowledge into tangible, accessible benefits for human health.
