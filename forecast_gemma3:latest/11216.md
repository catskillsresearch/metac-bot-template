Given the diverse forecasts, the most likely scenario for Ron DeSantis running for president in 2028 is characterized by a complex interplay of factors. The timeframe remaining – approximately 2 years and 10 months – represents a substantial period of potential shifts in the political landscape and within the Republican Party itself. The status quo, representing a “No” outcome, remains the most probable, largely due to DeSantis’s challenges stemming from his 2024 campaign, strained relationship with Donald Trump, and lingering difficulties in rebuilding his standing within the Republican party. However, several critical conditions would need to align for a “Yes” outcome to become more likely. 

These include a significant and sustained decline in Trump’s influence within the Republican Party, potentially driven by legal challenges or a shift in public opinion. Simultaneously, Casey DeSantis would need to effectively leverage her position and garner increasing support, successfully positioning herself as a strong and compelling conservative alternative. Crucially, DeSantis and his team would require the ability to execute a strategic “reset,” crafting a compelling narrative focused on conservative principles and fiscal responsibility – coupled with successful fundraising and campaign organization. A degree of public fatigue with Trump and a desire for a fresh face could also play a role.  Conversely, a failure to navigate these complexities, particularly a continued dominant role for Trump or further setbacks in DeSantis’s campaign, would almost certainly solidify the ‘No’ outcome. The timing and degree of shifts in the Republican Party’s ideological direction represent critical uncertainties.
