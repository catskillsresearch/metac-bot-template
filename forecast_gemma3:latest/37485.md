Based on the provided rationales, a comprehensive rationale for the likelihood of a new package of US sanctions against Russia being officially announced before September 2025 is as follows:

The probability of a new US sanctions package being formally announced before September 2025 is cautiously optimistic, hovering around 70-75%. The core of this assessment rests on the inherent instability of the conflict in Ukraine and the continued geopolitical pressure surrounding it. The timeframe – approximately 20-30 days – suggests a period of heightened activity and potential rapid developments, aligning with the dynamic nature of the situation.

The most likely scenario involves incremental sanctions packages, mirroring the current approach. The EU and the US will continue to react to Russian actions, primarily targeting specific sectors and individuals involved in supporting the war effort. However, this incrementalism is contingent on the conflict remaining largely contained, with no significant escalation leading to direct threats to NATO. The threat of escalation, particularly a major Russian offensive achieving territorial gains or a further deterioration of human rights, remains the primary catalyst for a "Yes" outcome—driving a more substantial, coordinated response.

Conversely, a major shift in the conflict – such as a negotiated settlement, a collapse of either Ukraine or Russia, or a significant economic downturn within the sanctioning nations – would significantly diminish the pressure for further action, representing the “No” outcome. The key factor is the ongoing tension and unpredictability. The incremental approach reflects a cautious, reactive strategy, acknowledging the risks associated with a dramatic escalation. While the timeframe suggests a reasonable likelihood of action, the underlying instability of the situation maintains a degree of uncertainty, leading to a probability assessment of approximately 70-75%.
