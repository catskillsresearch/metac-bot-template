The most likely scenario regarding the emergence of a new nuclear-armed state by 2030 is one characterized by slow, incremental progress, punctuated by potential setbacks and dependent on a confluence of favorable factors. The timeframe remaining – approximately 1.5 to 2 years – highlights the inherent challenges and uncertainties associated with this complex undertaking. The status quo, characterized by ongoing feasibility studies, regulatory hurdles, and political sensitivities, represents the most probable outcome. A major geopolitical event, a significant technological setback, or a dramatic shift in public opinion could easily derail the momentum. Conversely, sustained political commitment, rapid technological advancements in SMR technology, streamlined regulatory processes, and significant international collaboration would be necessary to accelerate the process. A key factor will be the success of pilot projects and small-scale deployments.  The situation remains highly uncertain, with a potential for significant delays and a relatively low probability of a new nuclear-armed state emerging by the target year. The dominant trend is toward cautious assessment and a phased approach, influenced by geopolitical tensions and technological limitations.  Successfully navigating this complex landscape requires both robust technological advancements and a carefully managed political environment, neither of which can be guaranteed.  Ultimately, a substantial shift in global dynamics—perhaps a sudden, severe energy crisis or a major security threat—would be the most likely catalyst for a dramatic change in trajectory, although even then, the likelihood of a new nuclear-armed state within this timeframe remains modest.
