Based on the rationales provided, the most plausible and comprehensive assessment of the potential 2019USD per kg price of 50% clean meat products in 2026 is characterized by significant volatility and a range influenced by a combination of supply-side pressures, demand trends, and unforeseen events. The underlying scenario is one of ongoing, albeit fluctuating, challenges in beef production, driven by climate change, shifting consumer preferences, and global economic uncertainties.

A reasonable baseline expectation is a price range of approximately $8 - $10 per kilogram. However, this is highly susceptible to significant deviations based on several key factors. The most likely scenario – assuming continued drought conditions in key beef-producing regions, persistent supply chain disruptions, and a gradual shift towards alternative protein sources – would push the price towards the upper end of this range, potentially reaching $12 - $14 per kilogram. This scenario is supported by multiple forecasts, including those from Forecasts 1, 2, 3, and 5, which consistently highlight rising production costs and supply constraints.

However, this baseline is vulnerable to substantial upward shocks. The pessimistic outlooks from Forecasts 1 and 5, predicting prices exceeding $18 - $25 per kilogram, are plausible if disruptive events – such as a global pandemic impacting meat processing, a severe and prolonged drought leading to massive livestock losses, or a sudden, widespread adoption of lab-grown meat – were to occur.  Conversely, a surprising surge in cattle production (as posited by Forecast 5) or a dramatic reduction in beef exports could depress prices substantially, potentially falling below $8 per kg.

The forecasts indicate considerable uncertainty, making precise prediction difficult.  Therefore, a central estimate for the 2026 price, incorporating the range of potential outcomes and acknowledging the significant volatility involved, is between $10 and $15 per kilogram. The probability of this outcome is considered high (60-70%), reflecting the convergence of several pessimistic forecasts and the overarching pressure on beef supply.  It's crucial to recognize that this is a dynamic assessment, and the actual price could vary considerably depending on how these factors play out in the coming years.
