Based on the provided forecasts, the most likely outcome regarding the Supreme Court’s ruling on birthright citizenship in 2025 is a reaffirmation of the status quo, though with a significant degree of uncertainty. The Court is likely to uphold the existing interpretation of birthright citizenship, rooted in established precedent like *Wong Kim Ark* and consistently supported by lower courts. However, the conservative leanings of the current Supreme Court majority introduce a notable probability that the Court could, at least partially, limit birthright citizenship to children born in the U.S. to parents who are undocumented immigrants. The key factors driving this probability are the established legal precedent favoring birthright citizenship, coupled with the conservative judicial philosophy currently represented on the Supreme Court.  The timeline – with approximately 20-68 days remaining before a potential ruling – indicates a relatively short period of uncertainty, though the legal challenges and arguments surrounding the case are expected to continue regardless of the Court's decision.  The probability of a significant shift in established constitutional law, while present, remains relatively low compared to the probability of upholding the current status quo.
