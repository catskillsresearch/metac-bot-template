Given the rationales provided, a comprehensive assessment of the likelihood of a self-sustaining city on Mars within the next 20 years suggests a cautious and nuanced perspective. The most significant challenge lies in the confluence of numerous, interdependent factors – technological advancements, sustained funding, political stability, and international collaboration – all of which are subject to considerable uncertainty. 

The most probable outcome remains a delayed, incremental progress towards a Martian settlement. Numerous potential roadblocks exist, including significant technological hurdles relating to radiation shielding, closed-loop life support systems, and the reliable extraction and utilization of Martian resources. The sheer scale and complexity of establishing a self-sustaining ecosystem in such an extreme environment present immense logistical and financial challenges.  Furthermore, the timeline is heavily reliant on the consistent and robust performance of key technologies, particularly SpaceX's Starship, and the sustained commitment of both public and private investment.

A ‘No’ outcome is most likely if sustained global economic instability or geopolitical tensions impede the necessary funding and cooperation. Alternatively, a major technological setback – a catastrophic failure in a key space technology or a significant delay in the development of essential life support systems – could drastically prolong the timeline, potentially indefinitely.

While a ‘Yes’ outcome – a fully self-sustaining Martian city within 20 years – is possible, it requires a remarkably fortunate alignment of circumstances. This includes consistent, substantial investment, proven reliability of Starship, breakthroughs in ISRU, and a stable global political climate. However, the probability of this scenario occurring is comparatively low, considering the high degree of uncertainty surrounding these critical factors. 

Therefore, a reasonable overall assessment, based on the provided rationales, indicates a probability of approximately 30% of humans establishing a self-sustaining city on Mars within the next 20 years. This reflects the considerable challenges and uncertainties involved, acknowledging that while progress is likely, a truly self-sustaining Martian settlement remains a highly ambitious and potentially delayed endeavor.
