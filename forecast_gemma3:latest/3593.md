Based on the rationales provided, here's a consolidated rationale for the likelihood of renewable energy contributing 25% or less to global electricity production in 2030:

The likelihood of renewable energy contributing 25% or less to global electricity production by 2030 hinges on a confluence of factors, primarily centered around sustained economic stability and technological progress. The prevailing trend points towards a gradual, incremental advancement in renewable energy technologies, with significant ongoing challenges related to intermittency, grid infrastructure, and material supply chains. A ‘status quo’ outcome – assuming continued moderate growth in solar and wind, alongside modest improvements in energy storage and hydrogen production – is the most probable scenario. This gradualism is heavily influenced by economic conditions, with a global recession or significant economic instability acting as a primary impediment, drastically slowing deployment and potentially reversing progress.

However, a 'no' outcome – where renewable energy contributions remain below 25% – is more likely than a substantial breakthrough. This scenario is largely driven by unexpected setbacks, most notably disruptions to critical mineral supply chains, or a major, unforeseen technological hurdle, such as a failure in battery technology, hindering energy storage capabilities. Alternatively, a sustained global economic downturn could trigger a reassessment of priorities, leading to reduced investment in renewables and a return to fossil fuels as a perceived short-term solution.

Despite this cautious outlook, there is a possibility of a ‘yes’ outcome, albeit a relatively small one. This hinges on a truly transformative breakthrough – notably, a significant advance in energy storage, or a major, sustained, international commitment to technology development and deployment. However, history suggests such breakthroughs are rare and often take longer than initially anticipated. The most probable path remains one of gradual, iterative improvements, continually battling against economic headwinds and logistical challenges. Therefore, a cautious assessment of the overall likelihood positions the outcome as leaning towards lower renewable energy contributions in 2030.
