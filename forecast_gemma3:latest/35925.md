Based on the rationales provided, a consistent and robust rationale for the likelihood of the 45X Advanced Manufacturing Production Tax Credits starting to require the use of domestic materials or subcomponents by 2025 emerges as follows:

Given the relatively short timeframe (approximately 23-39 days remaining until key dates, including the 2025 presidential election), and the current political landscape, the most probable outcome is that the existing framework of the 45X credit will continue with only minor adjustments. However, significant uncertainty remains. The immediate continuation hinges primarily on the outcome of the 2024 US presidential election and the subsequent actions of the governing administration.

The most immediate risk lies in a Republican victory in 2024, leading to a shift in policy toward dismantling the IRA’s incentives. While a complete reversal appears unlikely due to entrenched investments and existing momentum within the clean energy sector, a significant Republican victory could trigger legislative action to amend or repeal the 45X credit. Moreover, a widespread economic downturn or a technological breakthrough could further undermine the credit’s future.

Conversely, a continuation of the Biden administration and support from key moderate Republicans offers a more stable scenario, where the existing framework is maintained and potentially strengthened. However, even within this scenario, minor adjustments and ongoing scrutiny by the IRS and Treasury Department are anticipated. 

Therefore, considering the combined assessments, a probability of approximately 70-75% suggests the 45X credit will persist, albeit potentially subject to ongoing adjustments and monitoring, primarily due to the short timeframe and the inherent political volatility surrounding the IRA. A substantial shift to requiring domestic materials or subcomponents is less probable given the timeframe, but remains a possibility contingent on a change in political leadership or a significant economic shift.
