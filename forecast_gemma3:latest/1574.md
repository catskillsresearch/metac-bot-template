Based on the rationales provided, the following represents a consolidated rationale for predicting India's GDP in 2028 (in trillions of 2010 USD):

The projection of India’s GDP in 2028 is subject to considerable uncertainty, reflecting the dynamic nature of global and regional economies. While pinpoint accuracy remains elusive given the timeframe and inherent volatility, a reasonable estimate emerges from synthesizing the various forecasts. The most consistent trend across the available information is towards continued, albeit potentially fluctuating, economic growth. 

Initial projections, ranging from approximately 4.27 to 5.6 trillion USD, indicate a baseline of approximately 4.7 - 5.2 trillion USD, largely driven by India's demographic advantage, expanding digital economy, and ongoing infrastructure investments.  Sustained growth rates of 6.5% - 7% – reflected in several forecasts – would push the GDP towards the higher end of this range. However, this optimistic scenario assumes continued macroeconomic stability, supportive government policies, and favorable global economic conditions.

Several potential downside risks could significantly dampen this outlook. A major global recession, a geopolitical crisis impacting trade, or a sharp decline in commodity prices (particularly oil) could negatively impact India’s export revenue and overall growth. This could reduce India's GDP to levels around 4.0 - 4.2 trillion USD. 

Conversely, several factors could drive the GDP significantly higher. Breakthroughs in renewable energy technologies, coupled with sustained government investment and increased foreign direct investment, could unlock substantial economic opportunities. Similarly, a continued surge in domestic consumption, driven by rising incomes and a growing middle class, could contribute to accelerated growth.  Successful navigation of technological advancements, particularly in digital infrastructure and automation, would likely elevate India's economic performance.

Ultimately, given the combined evidence, a realistic probabilistic assessment places India’s GDP in 2028 in the range of 4.8 – 5.4 trillion USD. This acknowledges the influence of both positive and negative external and internal factors, recognizing the considerable uncertainties involved in forecasting economic growth at this scale and timeframe.
