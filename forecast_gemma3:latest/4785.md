The overarching rationale for assessing the probability of revived cryopreserved individuals by 2200 integrates the cautious skepticism inherent in the forecasts while acknowledging the potential for transformative breakthroughs. The core assumption is that while significant technical hurdles remain, continued scientific advancement, potentially spurred by unforeseen discoveries, increases the likelihood of a positive outcome, albeit with considerable uncertainty.

The probability of a meaningful revival (defined as a functional, conscious individual) within 2200 is initially low, reflecting the current state of the field. The initial assessment places this probability at around 10-20%, contingent on sustained research efforts and incremental technological improvements. However, this baseline is significantly influenced by the recognition of potential “black swan” events – unexpected discoveries that could dramatically alter the trajectory of the field. These include the development of a perfect cryoprotective fluid, eliminating ice crystal formation, or a revolutionary understanding of consciousness that allows for its “backup” and restoration.

The rationale emphasizes a phased approach to probability assessment. The short-term (within 18-36 months) probability remains modest (around 15-20%), driven by expected improvements in cryopreservation techniques and sustained investment. Longer-term probabilities (50-75 years) are elevated, but still reliant on transformative breakthroughs. The 18-36 month scenario includes a significant risk of a critical failure (like the enzyme discovery scenario), further reducing the probability.

Crucially, the narrative incorporates the prevalent skepticism among experts and the cautious nature of the market. While investment remains present, it is driven by speculative potential rather than demonstrable progress. The forecasts highlight the potential for market distortions – inflated valuations and hype – to further complicate probability assessments.

Furthermore, the rationale acknowledges the complexity of the underlying challenges.  Cellular damage during freezing and thawing is a fundamental hurdle that requires a fundamental shift in our understanding of biology.  Restoring full neurological function – including memory and consciousness – presents an even greater challenge.

Therefore, the overall probability is positioned as a dynamic function of both technological progress and serendipitous discoveries. A conservative estimate, reflecting the inherent uncertainties, places the probability of a meaningful revival by 2200 in the range of 10-20%, acknowledging that this figure could shift considerably based on unforeseen events. This assessment reflects a balanced viewpoint, acknowledging both the impressive scientific capabilities that will likely be available by 2200 and the profoundly complex nature of the problem.
