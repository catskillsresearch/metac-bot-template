The Hubble tension, the persistent discrepancy between local and cosmological distance measurements, is likely to remain unresolved by 2030. The core issue stems from a fundamental disagreement between measurements of the expansion rate of the universe at different redshifts. While ongoing efforts, primarily driven by the DESI project and future surveys like Euclid, will continue to refine measurements and explore potential systematic errors, a truly transformative resolution is considered unlikely within the next decade. 

The most probable outcome involves a continued status quo.  Measurements will remain inconsistent, with the Hubble tension acknowledged as a significant challenge within the ΛCDM framework. Scientists will diligently investigate potential systematic biases in existing data, explore modifications to the standard model, and develop increasingly sophisticated theoretical frameworks. However, without a fundamentally new observational breakthrough, the tension will persist as a key area of research, demanding continuous refinement of our understanding rather than a definitive solution. 

A significant setback could occur via a critical experimental failure, such as a major malfunction within the DESI instrument or a substantial loss of data due to systematic contamination. Alternatively, a major theoretical model, like modified gravity, could be definitively ruled out due to inconsistent patterns in new data. 

A truly revolutionary outcome – a statistically significant deviation from ΛCDM at a key redshift, coupled with a compelling theoretical explanation – represents a lower probability. This would require an entirely new observational method, perhaps exploiting gravitational waves or revealing a previously unknown property of dark energy, to fundamentally alter our understanding of the universe's expansion.  The chances of this occurring within the timeframe considered, while not zero, are considered relatively small given the established nature of the current observations and the significant investment already made in the standard cosmological model. Therefore, a persistent, but meticulously investigated, tension between local and cosmological measurements remains the most realistic forecast.
