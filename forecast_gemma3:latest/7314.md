The most likely outcome regarding a 50% decline in global meat production by 2040 hinges on a complex interplay of technological advancements, shifting consumer preferences, and policy interventions. The immediate future (approximately 18 months) suggests a gradual, albeit persistent, decline in meat consumption, driven primarily by existing trends like the ongoing reduction in Spanish meat consumption and the increasing availability of plant-based alternatives. This trend, mirroring the estimates of 1-2% per year, is reinforced by a general awareness of sustainability concerns and evolving consumer preferences. However, this gradual decline is subject to significant disruption.

A ‘no’ outcome, representing the continuation of current trends, is predicated on unforeseen global economic crises – specifically, a sustained downturn coupled with increased demand for affordable protein sources. Alternatively, a technological breakthrough solely focused on improving the taste and texture of plant-based alternatives without a corresponding reduction in cost would likely fail to trigger a significant shift.

Conversely, a ‘yes’ outcome – representing the 50% decline – necessitates a multi-faceted, coordinated global effort. This would require the rapid and scalable development of genuinely affordable and appealing lab-grown meat, coupled with significant government investment in alternative protein technologies and aggressive policy interventions, such as carbon taxes or subsidies for plant-based options. Moreover, a sustained and successful public health campaign demonstrating the benefits of reduced meat consumption would be crucial. The simultaneous confluence of these factors – technological breakthroughs, supportive policies, and widespread consumer adoption – presents the most viable pathway toward a dramatic shift in global meat production. The likelihood of this occurring is contingent on a robust and proactive response to the evolving challenges posed by the global food system.
