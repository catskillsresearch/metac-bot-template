Based on the provided forecasts, a consistent rationale for predicting US per capita chicken consumption in 2025 emerges. The outlook is characterized by a dynamic interplay of factors, acknowledging inherent uncertainty but leaning towards continued growth, albeit with potential fluctuations.

The central thesis is that competitive retail pricing, driven by declining feed costs and ongoing efficiency gains, will continue to be a primary driver of increased chicken consumption. This competitive advantage – chicken’s affordability relative to beef and pork – will underpin a moderate, sustained increase in demand.  However, this growth is not guaranteed and is heavily influenced by external variables. 

Several key assumptions underpin this prediction. First, feed costs are expected to remain relatively stable, although volatility remains a concern. Second, consumer preferences will continue to favor chicken’s affordability and versatility. Third, the market will largely maintain its current trend of shifting away from more expensive red meats. 

However, several potential disruptive events could alter this trajectory. The most significant risk is a major, sustained disruption in feed grain supply – a drought or other agricultural crisis – which would immediately increase feed costs and erode chicken’s competitive advantage.  A large-scale avian influenza outbreak, causing significant poultry losses and supply chain disruptions, represents another substantial risk, potentially triggering a sharp price spike and curtailing consumption. Conversely, a sustained shift towards plant-based protein sources, particularly if coupled with technological advancements in alternative meat production, could dampen demand.

Finally, population growth and general consumer spending patterns play a supporting role, with continued population increase contributing to overall demand, while economic conditions could influence consumer spending on protein sources.  The consensus, considering all these factors, suggests a consumption level broadly between 58 kg/person/year and 87.1 kg/person/year by the end of 2025, with a central expectation around 72.1 kg/person/year.  This range reflects the acknowledged uncertainty surrounding the myriad influencing factors, but the core prediction – continued, moderate growth – remains the most plausible given the current landscape.
