Based on the rationales provided, the most likely scenario for the S&P 500 reaching 10,000 points by the end of the decade is characterized by ongoing, moderate economic growth within the US, coupled with a cautiously optimistic outlook from analysts. The timeframe remaining – approximately 2-3 months – introduces a significant degree of uncertainty, but the prevailing sentiment across the forecasts suggests a continued upward trend, albeit with potential volatility.

A key element of this scenario is the absence of major disruptive events. A significant global recession, a major geopolitical crisis (such as a large-scale war), or a drastic, unanticipated policy shift by the Federal Reserve would likely prevent the S&P 500 from reaching the 10,000-point target. The forecasts consistently highlight the importance of continued economic expansion, sustained corporate earnings growth, and a relatively stable global trade environment.  Furthermore, a continuation of the current monetary policy, which favors moderate growth, appears crucial. While analysts acknowledge ongoing uncertainty and volatility, the overall consensus leans towards a gradual, upward movement, driven by existing positive trends and a belief in the long-term resilience of the US economy.  The remaining time period necessitates careful monitoring of economic data and geopolitical developments, but the established trends and the collective judgment of the forecasting community support a positive outlook.
