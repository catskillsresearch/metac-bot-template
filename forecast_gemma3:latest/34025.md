Given the current political climate, characterized by heightened regulatory scrutiny, ongoing legal challenges, and persistent debates surrounding government overreach, the most likely outcome regarding legislative action by Congress in 2025 is a protracted state of uncertainty and incremental change. The EPA and potentially other executive branch departments, the CIA, and the EPA face continued pressure regarding the use of data sources like IRIS. A fundamental shift away from the existing tensions appears unlikely within the immediate timeframe.

The most probable scenario is a persistent stalemate. Without a significant realignment of political priorities, a major shift in executive leadership, or a definitive resolution of legal challenges—particularly the Massachusetts legal challenge—the Soto bill and related issues will remain bogged down in debate and resistance. The EPA will continue to operate under existing regulations, although potentially with increased legal scrutiny and public pushback. The chemical industry will maintain a cautious approach, anticipating ongoing regulatory risks.

However, a "yes" outcome remains possible, contingent on a confluence of factors. This would necessitate a substantial shift in public opinion, alongside a strategically successful legal challenge – perhaps uncovering flaws in the EPA's use of IRIS data – to bolster the industry’s position. Alternatively, a bipartisan consensus might emerge, spurred by a desire to avoid further political division, and result in a legislative clarification of EPA’s data usage. Conversely, a “no” outcome is also probable, primarily fueled by a continued political landscape of obstruction and resistance, mirroring the current situation, where key initiatives are stalled due to partisan disagreements and legal challenges. The ongoing Colchado situation and related controversies will further complicate the situation, contributing to the overall uncertainty. The core tensions surrounding regulatory power and the role of government agencies will likely remain unresolved, highlighting the difficulty of achieving a decisive legislative outcome.
