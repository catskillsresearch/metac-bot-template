Given the rationales above, a consolidated rationale emerges as the most comprehensive and believable assessment of the likelihood of humans experiencing functionally important neurogenesis before 2028.

**Consolidated Rationale:**

The probability of humans experiencing functionally important neurogenesis before 2028 remains uncertain, but leans towards a modest increase with significant caveats. The timeframe – approximately 4-6 years – allows for substantial technological advancement, particularly in AI, neuroscience, and biohacking. However, a complete transformation, as envisioned by some, is unlikely due to the inherent complexities of the human brain and the significant barriers to widespread, safe, and effective interventions.

The most likely scenario involves incremental improvements driven by continued AI integration into daily life, providing enhanced cognitive support and personalized learning tools. Neuroscience research will likely yield further understanding of brain plasticity and potential treatments for age-related cognitive decline, focusing on symptom management and targeted therapies. Biohacking, while holding promise, will remain primarily a niche activity with limited systemic impact.

A “no” outcome – a complete derailment of these advancements – is a significant risk, contingent on catastrophic events like a global technological failure (e.g., a widespread AI disruption), a major pandemic with neurological effects, or a significant setback in research funding. The potential for such events is not negligible.

However, a “yes” outcome – characterized by truly transformative neurogenesis and cognitive enhancement – remains plausible, but requires a confluence of highly significant breakthroughs occurring within the projected timeframe. This would necessitate the attainment of true general artificial intelligence (AGI), alongside the development of non-invasive brain stimulation techniques with proven efficacy, coupled with refined gene editing technologies. Furthermore, it depends on a shift in societal priorities, a globally collaborative research environment, and ethical regulation of these powerful technologies. Even with these factors aligned, a level of sustained investment and a reduction in unforeseen risks would be crucial.  Ultimately, the timeline and the extent of these changes hinge on a series of highly improbable events aligning simultaneously. The overall probability of a profoundly transformative shift in human neurogenesis before 2028 remains cautiously optimistic, estimated at approximately 40%.
