Turkey’s potential acquisition of nuclear weapons by 2030 is a complex issue, fraught with geopolitical uncertainties and significant obstacles. The most likely scenario, if nothing changes, is that Turkey *will not* acquire nuclear weapons within the next 12 months (Forecast 2 & 4), with an estimated 25-35% probability (Forecast 2 & 4). This is due to Turkey’s existing commitments as a NATO member, the substantial international pressure it faces, and the inherent technical and economic challenges involved in developing a nuclear weapons program. However, several factors could shift this probability.

A ‘No’ outcome relies heavily on the continued stability of the Eastern Mediterranean, the sustained effectiveness of international sanctions, and the maintenance of Turkey’s NATO commitments. A major deterioration in Turkey’s relationship with NATO, triggered by events such as a significant escalation in Syria or heightened tensions with Greece, coupled with a severe economic crisis, could significantly alter the calculus. Alternatively, a change in leadership within Turkey, particularly a shift towards a more moderate, pro-Western government, would remove a key driver of this possibility.

Conversely, a ‘Yes’ outcome hinges on a confluence of destabilizing events. Regional instability, particularly a protracted conflict in Syria or heightened tensions with Greece, coupled with a weakening of NATO’s resolve and a successful, clandestine uranium mining agreement in Niger, could create the conditions for Turkey to accelerate its nuclear ambitions. Crucially, this would likely require external support, potentially from states like Russia or North Korea, providing Turkey with access to fissile materials and technical expertise. The ability of Turkey to circumvent international safeguards and sustain its nuclear program despite international pressure would also be a critical factor.  Furthermore, a sustained period of relative stability, allowing Turkey to consolidate its control over Niger’s uranium deposits and continue its clandestine program, significantly increases the probability of a ‘Yes’ outcome.  The time remaining to 2030 is a significant factor, with approximately 374 days remaining (Forecast 5), indicating a window for potential developments.
