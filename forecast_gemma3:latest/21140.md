Given the fragmented political landscape of Germany following the 2023 election and the inherent challenges in forming a stable coalition, a significant shift in public sentiment and a deliberate, strategic approach by key political figures are required for a CDU/AfD coalition to materialize by June 23, 2025. The primary obstacle remains the established "cordón sanitario" – the deliberate exclusion of the AfD from governing – deeply ingrained within the German political system and supported by a substantial portion of the electorate. However, a confluence of factors could conceivably disrupt this status quo.

A significant catalyst would be a dramatic deterioration in Germany’s economic situation, generating widespread public dissatisfaction and potentially fueling a surge in support for populist and anti-establishment parties, including the AfD. Simultaneously, a notable shift in strategy by Friedrich Merz, acknowledging the urgency of the situation and demonstrating a willingness to abandon traditional political norms, would be essential. This would necessitate a pragmatic approach focused on securing a viable majority, even if it meant engaging with the AfD in a carefully managed way. 

Furthermore, a substantial, high-profile political event – perhaps exposing corruption within the established parties or a significant security crisis – could rapidly alter public opinion and create an environment more conducive to considering alternative political options. Successfully navigating these complexities would require a willingness from the CDU/CSU to compromise on key policy areas, specifically regarding immigration and the “cordón sanitario,” and a clear articulation of a compelling vision for Germany’s future. The potential for a rapid shift in public opinion and the need for a decisive, strategic response from CDU/CSU leadership represent the most plausible, albeit still relatively low-probability, pathway to a CDU/AfD coalition by the specified date.
