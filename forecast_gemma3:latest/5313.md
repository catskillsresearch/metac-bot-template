Based on the provided forecasts, the most plausible assessment of the likelihood of discovering Planet Nine by June 24, 2025, is a cautious 35%. This probability stems from a confluence of factors including the inherent challenges of detecting a distant, faint object; the reliance on a partially operational observatory (the Vera C. Rubin Observatory); and the potential for the observed anomalies to be attributed to alternative explanations, such as statistical noise or complex gravitational interactions within the Kuiper Belt. The timeframe remaining (approximately 1 year and 2 months) is significant, offering opportunity for data collection, but also highlights the uncertainty. While a ‘yes’ outcome – the robust discovery of Planet Nine – is possible, it hinges on the successful and rapid deployment of the observatory, coupled with a definitive, reproducible signal. The possibility of significant technical challenges or alternative explanations remains substantial.  The forecasts consistently emphasize the need for a sustained, unambiguous detection, which is a complex undertaking given the current conditions and the inherent difficulties of searching for faint objects at vast distances.
