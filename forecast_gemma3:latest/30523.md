Given the rationale sections from the five forecasts, a consolidated rationale emerges, reflecting the most probable scenario and highlighting key uncertainties.

The situation surrounding the WHO’s declaration of a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) regarding H5 avian influenza, specifically concerning the Klade Ib variant and the ongoing Mpox outbreak, remains highly uncertain. While the immediate timeframe – approximately 66-67 days as of June 23, 2025 – presents a limited opportunity for significant shifts, the overall trajectory is heavily influenced by a convergence of unlikely events. The most probable outcome remains a continuation of the current status quo. The WHO will maintain the PHEIC designation, driven by ongoing reports of cases – largely centered around the DRC – and the persistent emergence of new variants like Klade Ib. Funding will remain inadequate, hampered by complex geopolitical factors and a general reluctance among nations to commit substantial, sustained resources to international health crises. The response will continue to be characterized by incremental improvements in surveillance and containment efforts, struggling to keep pace with the evolving threat. The public awareness of the situation will remain moderate, punctuated by occasional media coverage.

However, a “no” outcome – the continued absence of a PHEIC declaration by the specified deadline – hinges on the failure of several critical elements to align. These primarily relate to a rapid scientific breakthrough. The development and global deployment of a highly effective vaccine offering broad protection against the Klade Ib variant, combined with a demonstrable reduction in new cases, is the most significant impediment to a “yes” outcome. Equally crucial is a stabilizing of the political and security landscape in the DRC, enabling efficient distribution of any such vaccine and facilitating effective containment measures. The emergence of a major geopolitical event – a heightened conflict, a severe economic crisis, or the introduction of a far more virulent pathogen – could dramatically shift the dynamics and derail any attempt to address the situation proactively.

Conversely, a “yes” outcome – the declaration of a PHEIC – would require an exceptionally rare confluence of factors. It demands not only the rapid development and deployment of a highly effective vaccine, but also a dramatic and sustained shift in global political will. This necessitates a significantly increased level of funding commitment, a unified international response, and a demonstrable stabilization of the security situation in the DRC. The scenario’s probability remains low due to the inherent complexities of viral evolution, the challenges of vaccine development and deployment, and the persistent difficulties of coordinating international cooperation in the face of competing national interests and strategic priorities. Despite the significant uncertainties, the continued spread of the Klade Ib variant and the protracted nature of the Mpox outbreak suggest that the “no” outcome – continued PHEIC status – is the most likely scenario within the forecasted timeframe.
