Given the rationales provided, here's a consolidated rationale for the likelihood of Congress extending the 2017 TCJA provisions by 2025:

The prospects of Congress extending the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) provisions by 2025 remain highly uncertain, with a significant probability of inaction. The current political climate, characterized by deep partisan divisions and a reluctance to embrace expansive tax cuts, represents a fundamental barrier. The existing political landscape, marked by intensely polarized views and a strong pushback from progressive groups, significantly reduces the likelihood of a bipartisan agreement. The Congressional Budget Office’s (CBO) projections of a staggering $5 trillion cumulative cost between 2025 and 2034 serve as a major impediment, further solidifying the status quo. 

While several scenarios could theoretically lead to an extension, they are predicated on substantial shifts in the political landscape. A major political realignment – such as a landslide victory for a party with a fundamentally different economic agenda – would be necessary to overcome the current resistance. Similarly, a severe economic shock, like a deep recession, could force a rapid response and compel Congress to reconsider its position. However, these scenarios are considered less probable given the established political dynamics. 

A surprisingly cooperative bipartisan agreement, arguably the most likely pathway to a "Yes" outcome, would require a sustained shift in public opinion favoring tax cuts, coupled with a shared recognition of the potential economic consequences of allowing the TCJA provisions to expire. It’s also conceivable that a newly elected administration, regardless of party affiliation, might leverage the issue strategically to bolster its political standing.  Yet, even in this scenario, the cost projections and partisan divisions would necessitate a significant compromise – perhaps a scaled-back extension focused on targeted tax relief measures – to secure buy-in from both sides. Despite these possibilities, the underlying inertia of the legislative process, combined with the considerable economic and political obstacles, suggests a high probability that Congress will ultimately allow the TCJA provisions to expire, resulting in a shift to a new, albeit likely more complex, tax framework. 

Therefore, the most probable outcome is continued non-extension, with a 65% likelihood.
