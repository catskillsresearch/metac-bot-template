Based on the rationales provided, here’s a consolidated rationale for the likelihood of Argentina fully dollarizing its economy before 2028:

Argentina’s economic trajectory in the near term remains highly uncertain. The primary challenge is the persistent legacy of macroeconomic instability – persistent inflation, a complex exchange rate system, significant external debt, and deep structural issues within the economy. If nothing changes, the most likely outcome is a continuation of the current situation: moderate inflation, cyclical economic improvements and declines, and limited overall transformation. However, a “No” outcome – a severe setback due to political instability, a major economic shock, or failed reforms – represents a significant risk. Conversely, a “Yes” outcome – a sustained and positive shift towards dollarization – requires a confluence of factors: successful implementation of comprehensive economic reforms (including fiscal discipline, exchange rate stabilization, and structural changes), sustained macroeconomic stability, and a shift in public and investor confidence. Given the inherent difficulties within the Argentine economic system and the political sensitivities surrounding such a radical change, the probability of full dollarization before 2028 is relatively low, hovering around a 35% chance. The time remaining, the complexity of the underlying challenges, and the high degree of political and economic uncertainty all contribute to this assessment.
