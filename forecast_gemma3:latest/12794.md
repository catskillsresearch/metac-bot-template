Here’s a synthesized rationale, incorporating the best elements from all five forecasts:

The likelihood of the United States appointing an ambassador to Taiwan within a year of a declaration of independence by Taiwan (by 2035) remains uncertain, with a core probability of approximately 35%. The immediate timeframe – 60-67 days – introduces considerable volatility, making definitive prediction difficult. The most likely near-term outcome is continuation of the current “strategic ambiguity” policy, with the US maintaining robust support for Taiwan’s defense capabilities and diplomatic engagement, while upholding the “One China” policy. However, several key factors could trigger a significant shift in US policy, primarily dependent on the timing of a potential Taiwanese declaration of independence.

A “No” outcome – the continued maintenance of the status quo – is most probable if geopolitical circumstances remain relatively stable. A major escalation of tensions, such as a Chinese military action against Taiwan, is a potential catalyst, but a deliberate and dramatic increase in China’s actions is less likely. Alternatively, a major diplomatic breakthrough between China and the US, even if unexpected, could moderate the situation. Similarly, a significant downturn in the US economy could reduce political pressure for a bold policy shift. Internal US political dynamics, particularly shifts in presidential administrations and the influence of specific congressional factions, will continue to play a crucial role. Public opinion within the US, driven by heightened awareness of the regional implications of China's actions, could also exert influence.

A “Yes” outcome – the appointment of an ambassador and a shift toward formal recognition – is contingent on a confluence of events. This scenario hinges on a truly destabilizing event, most plausibly a forceful Chinese intervention against Taiwan, or, less likely, a dramatic deterioration in US-Japan relations potentially shifting US focus. However, it’s also possible, though less probable, that a new US administration, with a demonstrably stronger pro-Taiwan stance, could initiate a policy shift.  Furthermore, a significant international shift – perhaps due to changes in global alliances – could create the political space for such a move. The timeline remains incredibly sensitive; the probability will continue to fluctuate based on developments in cross-strait relations, US domestic politics, and the broader geopolitical landscape. Ultimately, while significant shifts remain possible, a rapid and decisive move toward formal recognition within a year of a declaration by Taiwan is considered less than likely, with a core probability of approximately 35%.
