Given the available forecasts, the most likely outcome regarding AI foundation model reporting requirements in the US at the end of 2025 under a Trump presidency is a continuation of a trend towards minimal federal regulation of AI development. The most probable scenario involves a sustained effort to dismantle existing oversight mechanisms and promote rapid innovation, driven by a narrative of American competitiveness and “free market” principles. 

Specifically, the forecasts converge on a picture of a deliberate rollback of the Biden administration’s efforts to establish safety standards, mitigate bias, and ensure transparency in AI development. This would be reinforced by executive actions, key appointments within the government (particularly within the Department of Commerce and potentially the Department of Defense), and a concerted campaign to frame AI regulation as a hindrance to economic growth and American leadership in the technology sector. The narrative would consistently emphasize the benefits of “free AI” and the imperative for the US to maintain a competitive advantage by minimizing bureaucratic hurdles.  While a catastrophic AI-related event or a significant economic disruption could theoretically trigger a rapid shift in policy, the most likely trajectory involves a gradual, persistent reduction in regulatory oversight, with a continued prioritization of innovation and investment, largely unfettered by concerns about potential risks. The influence of figures like Elon Musk, along with Trump’s appointment of tech-focused advisors, would be key to this outcome, actively shaping public opinion and political discourse to support a less regulated AI landscape.
