Based on the rationales provided, the most likely scenario for achieving halving of US greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 involves a confluence of factors, primarily driven by a significant shift in global leadership and technological advancements, combined with a decisive response from major economies. 

The most probable outcome hinges on a transformation characterized by rapid technological breakthroughs in renewable energy and carbon capture, coupled with a genuinely transformative global policy shift. This would begin with a commitment from the United States, potentially spurred by a decisive change in leadership, alongside ambitious actions from the European Union and China. These actions would be underpinned by substantial investment in clean energy technologies and the implementation of robust carbon pricing mechanisms. Crucially, this would be accompanied by a surge in public pressure and activism, creating a self-reinforcing cycle of emission reductions. 

However, the likelihood of this occurring is tempered by significant risks. A key “No” scenario involves a rollback of climate policies due to a shift in the US presidency back to a climate-denying administration, further exacerbating global political instability and hindering international cooperation.  A continuation of the status quo, marked by uneven progress, political delays, and economic anxieties, represents another substantial risk. Technological failures, such as a setback in carbon capture or energy storage, could further erode confidence and delay meaningful action.  Ultimately, the pathway to success is fragile and relies on a delicate balance of political will, technological innovation, and sustained global cooperation.
