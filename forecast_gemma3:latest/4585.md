Based on the rationales provided, here’s a consolidated rationale for the question "What annual real return will the global stock market realize 2022-2031?":

The projected real return over the 2022-2031 period is subject to considerable uncertainty. While a baseline scenario anticipates moderate growth, roughly in the 3-4% range annually, adjusted for inflation, this is contingent on continued economic expansion, positive corporate earnings, and a relatively stable global geopolitical environment. However, several potential disruptive factors could significantly alter this trajectory. 

A key risk lies in unforeseen economic shocks, such as a major global recession triggered by escalating geopolitical tensions or a severe supply chain disruption. Such events could depress market returns, potentially pushing them down to around 0.5% annually. Conversely, rapid technological advancements – particularly in areas like artificial intelligence, renewable energy, or biotechnology – alongside supportive government policies, could drive exponential growth, potentially elevating returns to 7-10% annually. 

Considering the diverse forecasts and incorporating the most probable range, a reasonable projection leans towards a core return of 4-6% per year, adjusted for inflation. This acknowledges the cautious optimism of market participants, while allowing for the potential impact of both positive and negative external factors. A conservative overall estimate would fall within the 3.5-5.5% range, recognizing the inherent volatility of global markets and the possibility of significant deviations based on unpredictable events.  The long timeframe necessitates a flexible approach, acknowledging that the actual outcome will likely differ from any single, definitive prediction.
