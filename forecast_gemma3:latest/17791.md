Based on the rationales provided, the following represents a consolidated rationale for the likelihood of Ukraine launching a nuclear weapons program before 2026:

The probability of Ukraine launching a nuclear weapons program by 2026 remains significantly low, though the inherent instability of the global geopolitical landscape presents ongoing risk. The current situation is characterized by a persistent, elevated state of global tension, fueled by numerous interconnected crises – including the ongoing war in Ukraine, escalating tensions in the Middle East, the development of advanced AI technologies with potential military applications, and broader concerns regarding nuclear proliferation. The ‘Doomsday Clock’ continues to approach midnight, reflecting a sustained level of risk.

If no significant changes occur, the situation is likely to remain static, with incremental negative developments continuing to accumulate. However, a “No” outcome – meaning a probability below 50% – would require a substantial and unforeseen shift in global affairs. This could include a genuine breakthrough in nuclear disarmament talks, a lasting peace agreement between Ukraine and Russia, or a dramatic reduction in global risks associated with AI. 

Conversely, a “Yes” outcome – representing a probability above 50% – would necessitate a complex and improbable confluence of events. This would likely involve a sustained and verifiable ceasefire in Ukraine coupled with significant progress on nuclear disarmament verification, a demonstrable pullback by China from aggressive posturing in the Taiwan Strait, and a globally coordinated effort to regulate and control the development and deployment of AI weaponry.  A resolution of the Israel-Gaza conflict, though highly unlikely, would also contribute. 

The timeframe remaining – approximately 16-365 days – is insufficient to expect a rapid, decisive shift. The deeply entrenched positions and long-standing risks remain the dominant factors. While a change in US policy or a significant internal shift within Russia could potentially create an opening for dialogue, the probability of such a transformative event remains low. The current situation is characterized by a fragile equilibrium, highly susceptible to miscalculation or escalation, but the overall likelihood of Ukraine initiating a nuclear weapons program before 2026 is considered relatively small.
