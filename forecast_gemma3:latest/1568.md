Given the diverse forecasts, a consolidated rationale for predicting the likelihood of detecting an exoplanet atmosphere with >5% oxygen before 2030 emerges as follows:

The probability of definitively detecting an oxygen-rich exoplanet atmosphere, specifically one with >5% oxygen, within the next decade is currently assessed at approximately 35%. This assessment is rooted in a complex interplay of technological readiness, inherent observational challenges, and potential for misinterpretation. The Extremely Large Telescope (ELT) and James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), while representing significant advancements in astronomical instrumentation, face considerable hurdles in the remote detection of biosignatures. The immense distance to Proxima Centauri b results in extraordinarily faint reflected light, requiring exceptionally sensitive instruments and sophisticated data analysis techniques – techniques that are still under development.

A key factor contributing to the moderate probability is the susceptibility to false positives. Non-biological processes, such as volcanic activity releasing methane or unusual photochemical reactions, can mimic biosignatures, leading to erroneous interpretations. The “hazy world” biomarker approach, while promising, remains reliant on identifying relatively rare gases and differentiating them from abiotic processes, a task complicated by the uncertainties in Proxima Centauri b’s atmospheric composition. Furthermore, unforeseen events—such as major solar flare activity impacting the ELT and JWST’s observation capabilities—pose a substantial risk of prematurely ending observational campaigns and undermining data collection efforts.

However, several factors support a cautiously optimistic outlook. The ELT’s enhanced resolution and sensitivity, coupled with potential advancements in atmospheric modeling and data analysis (including the possible integration of AI), offer a pathway toward overcoming these challenges. A specific, highly plausible scenario involves the detection of a statistically significant and repeatable increase in the concentration of halogenated methanes, alongside corroborating data from the JWST, definitively indicating a biological origin. This ‘moonshot’ scenario, driven by the ELT’s capabilities and sophisticated modeling, has an estimated probability of 65%. Ultimately, realizing this potential hinges on a confluence of technological advancements and a continued, rigorous approach to data analysis, while mitigating the inherent risks associated with remote biosignature detection.
