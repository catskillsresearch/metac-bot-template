The core narrative across all forecasts centers around a confluence of factors leading to a significant shift in embryo screening for intelligence within the next year. Technological advancements – particularly breakthroughs in accurately predicting cognitive potential – are consistently highlighted as a critical driver. Furthermore, a shift in societal attitudes towards genetic enhancement, coupled with evolving regulatory frameworks, are identified as key enabling elements.

However, the specific probabilities assigned to each scenario vary considerably. Technological breakthroughs are consistently seen as the most significant driver, with estimates ranging from 65% (Forecast 5) to 70% (Forecast 3). Societal shifts and regulatory changes are considered more variable, with probabilities fluctuating between 35% (Forecast 4) and 65% (Forecast 5).

A recurring theme involves a potential “scandal” – a negative consequence of early screening – acting as a significant impediment to widespread adoption. These scenarios tend to dramatically lower the probability of success. The degree of regulatory oversight appears to be a critical factor, with more permissive frameworks leading to higher probabilities of success, while stringent regulations tend to stifle innovation. The role of major tech companies in driving down costs and increasing accessibility is frequently cited as a positive influence.

Ultimately, the most consistent element across all forecasts is the recognition of this as a complex, multi-faceted process driven by a combination of scientific progress, ethical considerations, and societal pressures. The timeline for this shift remains uncertain, with most forecasts placing it within the next 1-2 years, but the precise probability of a substantial, widespread adoption remains highly dependent on the interplay of these various factors. The "scandal" scenario remains a persistent threat, capable of significantly reducing the probability of success.
