Given the entrenched positions of the Democratic parties, and the slow pace of political change, the most likely outcome is that New Hampshire will continue to hold its position as the first state to hold a presidential primary in 2028. The DNC will likely engage in a protracted, somewhat symbolic negotiation process with New Hampshire, resulting in no fundamental change to the existing arrangement. However, a significant shift in the Democratic party’s strategy, coupled with growing public and media pressure, could force the DNC to concede New Hampshire’s position. A major, unforeseen event – such as a significant economic collapse or a major international crisis – could dramatically shift the political landscape and divert all attention from the 2028 primary process. Alternatively, a split within the Democratic party of a significant magnitude could neutralize any coordinated effort to defend New Hampshire’s status. Despite these potential disruptions, the core dynamic – the established order and the resistance to change – suggests a continued, albeit contentious, status quo.  The possibility of a successful push for a broader representation of the party's base and a corresponding shift in priorities remains, but it’s currently considered a less likely outcome than the continuation of the existing arrangement.
