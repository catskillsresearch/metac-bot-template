Based on the rationales provided, the following represents a consolidated and refined rationale for the likelihood of embryo selection using AI leading to over 10% of newborns in Israel:

The probability of a significant shift towards embryo selection utilizing AI to achieve over 10% of Israeli newborns reflects a complex interplay of technological advancement, regulatory environment, and societal acceptance.  Initially, the next 18 months will likely see a continued, incremental expansion of AI within fertility treatment, primarily focusing on refinements of existing technologies such as the AIVF platform and improvements in sperm selection techniques. This will be driven by ongoing research and development within Israel’s thriving technology sector, alongside gradual adoption by forward-thinking clinics. However, a 'status quo' outcome – characterized by limited widespread adoption – remains a plausible scenario, constrained by high costs, regulatory uncertainties, and ethical considerations surrounding genetic screening.  A significant regulatory hurdle, such as a global ban on AI diagnostic tools prompted by concerns about patient safety or bias, could effectively halt this trajectory.

However, a “yes” outcome – one characterized by a substantial increase in the percentage of newborns subjected to AI-driven embryo selection – hinges on a confluence of favorable circumstances. Firstly, a major breakthrough in neuromorphic computing or a comparable advancement that allows for genuinely “intelligent” AI systems to interpret medical data with a level of accuracy exceeding human capabilities is crucial. Simultaneously, sustained investment from both governmental bodies and private companies, coupled with a shift in public perception towards embracing AI in healthcare, will be critical. Perhaps most importantly, the publication of several large-scale clinical trials demonstrating a demonstrable and significant increase in pregnancy rates – alongside a reduction in associated costs – would generate substantial momentum.  Successfully navigating the ethical and regulatory landscape, potentially through international collaboration to establish clear guidelines, is also a key factor.  While a sudden regulatory crackdown remains a risk, a coordinated approach to addressing ethical concerns – rather than a blanket ban – would facilitate a more sustainable and ultimately, more widespread adoption of AI in embryo selection, creating a positive feedback loop and driving the probability of the “yes” outcome upwards. The timeframe for this to manifest – within the next 2-3 years – is contingent upon the successful resolution of these interacting elements.
