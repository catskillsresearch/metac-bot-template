Given the current global economic landscape, characterized by moderate growth, persistent inflation, and ongoing geopolitical uncertainties, a significant shift in investment strategies towards global quality income funds like the First Trust Active Global Quality Income ETF (AGQI) within the next six months (until 2025-12-24) is plausible but not guaranteed. The most likely outcome, if nothing changes, is a continuation of the existing trend: moderate, gradual gains in global equities, combined with a generally cautious investor sentiment and a preference for diversified, passively managed funds. However, several factors could trigger a notable shift. 

Firstly, an unexpected and sustained recovery in global economic growth, particularly in emerging markets like India, coupled with a favorable resolution of geopolitical tensions, would create an environment conducive to higher returns for quality income-generating assets. Secondly, a sharp rise in inflation, leading to aggressive interest rate hikes by central banks, could prompt investors to seek the relative safety and income-generating potential of funds like AGQI. Thirdly, a fundamental shift in investor sentiment, fueled by concerns about low-interest rates and a desire for active management expertise, could drive increased allocations to actively managed global quality income funds. Finally, a disruptive technological breakthrough or a major shift in investor preference towards value-oriented investments could also accelerate the trend towards these funds. 

Considering these potential catalysts, and recognizing that the market's response is inherently uncertain, a substantial positive shift in the market outlook reflected in a significant increase in the price of AGQI is achievable, likely falling within a range of 15-20% over the next six months, assuming favorable economic and geopolitical conditions. The probability of this outcome is estimated to be 65%.
