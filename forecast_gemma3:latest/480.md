Given the evolving landscape of the chess world, characterized by ongoing tournaments, persistent scrutiny surrounding figures like Hans Niemann, and a dynamic environment of tactical training and puzzle challenges, a definitive prediction regarding whether perfect play will result in a white win by 2080 remains challenging. The immediate timeframe, roughly 60-80 days, is dominated by the Norway Chess tournament, and the longer-term prospects are heavily influenced by the resolution – or lack thereof – of the Niemann accusations. 

The most probable near-term outcome maintains the status quo: Magnus Carlsen will likely secure a victory in the Norway Chess tournament, leveraging his experience, strategic depth, and established dominance. However, this outcome hinges significantly on the continued stability of the chess world. A key factor is the Niemann investigation; if it concludes with conclusive evidence of cheating, it would fundamentally alter the competitive landscape. A successful polygraph test for Niemann, even if he doesn't disclose the specific nature of the cheating, would inject significant uncertainty, potentially disrupting Carlsen’s lead and shifting the balance of power.

Conversely, if the Niemann investigation remains unresolved – perhaps due to inconclusive polygraph results or a legal challenge – and if Carlsen continues his consistent, high-level performance, a white win remains more probable. This scenario assumes that established players like Carlsen, Caruana, and Dubov continue to maintain their competitive edge, and that tactical training and puzzle challenges continue to yield measurable improvements. 

However, a significant disruption, like an unforeseen health crisis affecting Carlsen, or a truly remarkable performance from a rising star like Gukesh Dommaraju, could easily derail the status quo.  Furthermore, the ultimate question of perfect play resulting in a white win by 2080 is predicated on the assumption of sustained, unchanging principles of chess strategy and the continued ability of players to flawlessly execute them.  It’s a long timeframe, offering the potential for unforeseen technological advancements or shifts in strategic thinking within the game itself, which could significantly impact the outcome. Therefore, while a white win is the more likely short-term result, a degree of uncertainty remains, heavily influenced by the ongoing complexities within the chess world and the long-term evolution of the game.
