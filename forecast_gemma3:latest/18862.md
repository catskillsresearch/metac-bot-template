Given the varying forecasts, a consistent rationale for the likelihood of Ukraine joining the EU before 2035 emerges. The process is fundamentally characterized by a protracted, incremental progression, heavily influenced by geopolitical factors and Ukraine’s internal reforms. While optimistic assessments acknowledge potential acceleration due to increased pressure and support, the overarching trend remains slow and uncertain. Key obstacles include the ongoing conflict with Russia, persistent internal challenges within Ukraine (particularly corruption and political instability), and the inherent complexity of EU accession negotiations. A “no” outcome remains a significant possibility, contingent on a prolonged conflict, a shift in EU priorities, or a further deterioration in Ukraine’s governance. Conversely, a “yes” outcome hinges on a sustained period of relative stability, robust US support, Ukraine’s continued commitment to reforms, and a favorable shift in the EU’s strategic outlook. Despite the potential for acceleration, the fundamental difficulty and length of the process suggest that full membership before 2035 is unlikely. Considering all forecasts, a probability of approximately 50% representing the core, most consistently highlighted assessment, seems the most reasonable reflection of the situation, recognizing the inherent uncertainties and the complex interplay of factors involved.
