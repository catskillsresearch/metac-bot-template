Based on analysis of the rationales provided, the most likely outcome is that 2025 will be a year of record-breaking heat. The core rationale underpinning this assessment is built upon a consistent observation: the established trend of escalating global temperatures, driven by continued greenhouse gas emissions and the inertia of the climate system.  Multiple forecasts converge on this point, supported by a recognition of the influence of factors like El Niño and atmospheric feedback loops.

The most probable scenario involves a continuation of the current trajectory – high emissions, continued warming, and a lack of significant mitigation efforts. This is reinforced by the acknowledgement that even conservative projections from organizations like the ECCC and WMO consistently point towards a record-breaking year.  A “no” outcome, requiring a sudden and substantial shift in climate dynamics, is considered highly improbable, necessitating a confluence of unforeseen events—such as a massive, sustained volcanic eruption or a rapid, disruptive change in ocean currents—that are currently outside of the realm of reasonable predictability.  The existing data streams, accumulating from January 2025 onwards, overwhelmingly support the continuation of this warming trend.  The likelihood of 2025 surpassing previous records for heat is estimated to be exceptionally high, with a consensus probability approaching 92%.
