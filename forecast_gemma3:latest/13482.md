Given the rationales provided, a comprehensive rationale for the likelihood of a trade war between the EU and the US before 2153 can be constructed as follows:

The probability of a full-scale trade war emerging between the EU and the US within the timeframe of 2153 remains cautiously assessed, leaning towards a moderate likelihood. The core challenge lies in the inherent fragility of the existing trade relationship, characterized by ongoing tensions and sporadic disputes over trade imbalances, particularly concerning steel, aluminum, and automobiles. Despite the interdependence of the two economies and the potential consequences of a large-scale conflict, several factors suggest a non-negligible risk of escalation.

The most immediate threat stems from the possibility of a shift in US political leadership. While the current status quo – characterized by cautious tension and limited retaliatory measures – is the most probable outcome under the present circumstances, the re-emergence of a protectionist administration, particularly one mirroring Donald Trump’s policies, would dramatically increase the risk. Such a scenario, fueled by sustained public pressure, political polarization, and a willingness to disregard international trade agreements, could quickly escalate tensions and trigger a broader trade war. 

However, this escalation isn't guaranteed. A competing, more moderate, and pragmatic US administration, prioritizing diplomacy and collaborative trade relationships, would likely mitigate this risk, shifting the probability downward.  Furthermore, economic forces – such as a significant downturn in the US economy or a global recession – could create pressure for both sides to seek protectionist measures, potentially fostering a coordinated, albeit contentious, response.

Ultimately, the probability of a full-blown trade war remains anchored around 65%. This reflects a delicate balance between the inherent instability of the current trade dynamics and the significant potential for political and economic shifts to alter the course of events. The ability of key actors – particularly within the US – to maintain a commitment to multilateral trade and de-escalation will be crucial in preventing a protracted and damaging conflict.
