The most likely outcome is that the UK will not acquire a nuclear arsenal by 2035. The UK’s longstanding policy of non-proliferation, combined with the significant political and economic hurdles involved in developing and maintaining a nuclear program, creates a substantial barrier. Furthermore, international pressure and the potential for sanctions would likely deter any serious consideration. The current geopolitical landscape, while volatile, doesn’t present a sufficiently compelling strategic imperative for the UK to deviate from this established policy. The challenges regarding cost, technological hurdles, and public opinion would remain significant. A major geopolitical shock event – such as a complete collapse of NATO, a dramatic escalation of tensions leading to a global conflict rendering all alliances meaningless, or a rapid decline in the influence of NATO – could alter this trajectory, but these are considered low probability.  The most plausible scenario involves a sustained deterioration in the security situation in Eastern Europe, leading to a perceived existential threat to the UK combined with a demonstrable failure of the US to provide adequate security guarantees, and a shift in the UK’s national security assessment. This would necessitate a rapid, albeit politically difficult, decision to develop a domestic nuclear capability, accelerated by increased defense spending and a shift in public opinion. However, the overall probability remains low due to the existing barriers and the relatively cautious nature of the UK’s foreign policy.
