Based on the rationales provided, here’s a consolidated rationale for the likelihood of the Baltic States fully disconnecting from the Russian power grid by February 8, 2035:

The probability of the Baltic States achieving full disconnection from the Russian power grid by 2035 is substantial, estimated at approximately 85%. This assessment is built upon a layered understanding of potential scenarios and inherent uncertainties. The immediate timeframe—roughly 22 days—introduces a degree of volatility, but the underlying factors strongly suggest a positive outcome. Currently, the Baltic States are actively engaged in integrating their energy grids with Europe, driven by significant infrastructural investments like the LitPol Link and anticipated connections to Finland. While the recent sabotage incident involving the “Eagle S” vessel and the associated risks from Russia’s “shadow fleet” represent a tangible concern, the redundancy built into the grid and the swift response capabilities of European security forces suggest this will not derail the overall process. 

However, a significant risk remains: a deliberate escalation involving the shadow fleet or a major, unforeseen technical failure.  Furthermore, the broader geopolitical landscape, particularly the trajectory of the conflict in Ukraine and the potential for wider escalation, introduces considerable instability. A prolonged conflict could disrupt supply chains, trigger sanctions, and force a return to Russian power as a temporary measure. Nevertheless, the current trajectory—characterized by determined progress, substantial investment, and a clear commitment from the Baltic States—strongly favors completion. The prevailing probability is heavily weighted towards a successful disconnection, although the shadow of potential disruption requires continued vigilance and preparedness.  Ultimately, a careful balance of infrastructural development, robust security measures, and a stable geopolitical environment will determine the final outcome.
