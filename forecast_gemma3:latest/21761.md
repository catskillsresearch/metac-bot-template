Given the provided forecasts, the most likely scenario regarding the deployment of significant NATO combat troops in Ukraine before 2027 is a continuation of a tense, unstable equilibrium characterized by incremental escalation and de-escalation. The core dynamic remains a precarious balance between deterrence and potential conflict. Russia will maintain a significant military presence in Belarus, conducting exercises and issuing veiled threats, while NATO reinforces its eastern flank and maintains a defensive posture. Diplomacy will continue to be the primary tool for managing the situation, but the risk of miscalculation or unintended escalation remains high.

A “No” outcome – a complete absence of significant NATO troop deployment in Ukraine – is considered improbable, primarily due to Russia’s continued military buildup in Belarus and the inherent instability of the situation. This scenario hinges on a fundamental shift in Russian strategy, a major diplomatic breakthrough, or a genuinely unforeseen global event that dramatically alters the strategic landscape. However, the forecasts consistently highlight the continued tension and the persistent risk of escalation.

A “Yes” outcome – a coordinated Russian offensive utilizing a substantial force in Belarus to threaten or attack a NATO country – is considered less likely than a continued state of heightened tension, but not entirely dismissable. This scenario is predicated on a miscalculation by either side, a rapid deterioration of the security situation, or a deliberate decision by Russia to exploit perceived weaknesses in NATO’s resolve.

Overall, the forecasts converge on a scenario of persistent instability, gradual shifts in military posture, and an ongoing emphasis on deterrence and diplomatic engagement. The risk of a rapid, dramatic escalation remains, but the most probable outcome is a slow, incremental process, punctuated by periods of heightened tension and the potential for unintended consequences.
