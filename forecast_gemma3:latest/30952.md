Based on the available forecasts, the most likely scenario involves a cautious and measured response to economic data. The dominant theme is a stable, moderately rising CPI (around 2.9% year-on-year) combined with the Federal Reserve maintaining a cautiously optimistic, albeit restrained, outlook. The key drivers of uncertainty revolve around potential shocks â€“ geopolitical events, major economic data releases (particularly regarding inflation and employment), and shifts in global trade dynamics. A significant surprise, whether positive or negative, is considered the catalyst for a change in market sentiment. Specifically, a continuation of the current moderately rising CPI alongside a gradual easing of global trade tensions represents the most probable outcome. The market anticipates a shallow rate-cut cycle, influenced by the ongoing threat of tariffs and immigration concerns. The most significant deviation from this baseline would involve a substantial, unexpected increase in inflation or a major, disruptive global event.
