Here’s a consolidated rationale incorporating the best elements from all five forecasts:

The question centers on whether a law allowing states other than California to set stringent vehicle emissions standards will be enacted before January 1, 2027. The timeframe for a definitive outcome is relatively short, estimated at approximately 6-9 months, largely dependent on the pace of legislative action in the House and Senate, coupled with the President’s involvement.

The most likely scenario (approximately 55% probability) remains a protracted legal and political stalemate. The House will continue to attempt to revoke California’s waivers, but the Senate will likely either block these resolutions or delay their consideration. The EPA will continue to defend its actions, and California will continue to challenge, resulting in a continuous cycle of legal maneuvering.  Incremental erosion of California’s ability to push for a rapid transition to EVs is a high probability due to the slow, contentious nature of legislative processes.

However, several other scenarios could unfold. A significant shift in the political landscape, such as a surprise Republican presidential victory in 2024 coupled with a Republican Senate majority, would dramatically increase the likelihood of a ‘No’ outcome (approximately 20%). This scenario would see the federal government explicitly invalidating California’s waivers, effectively ending California’s authority. Alternatively, a Democratic victory alongside a Democratic Senate majority would strongly support California’s position, though this scenario remains reliant on a sustained legal challenge and potentially a major technological breakthrough in electric vehicle technology. 

A more unlikely, but still possible, scenario (approximately 20% probability) is a decisive legal victory for the federal government, potentially culminating in a Supreme Court ruling against California.  This would likely be accompanied by a strongly worded opinion solidifying federal authority over vehicle emissions standards.

Finally, a small, but present (approximately 20% probability) possibility exists that a surprising shift in the political balance, possibly driven by economic concerns about the transition to electric vehicles or a desire to challenge federal overreach, could lead to a swift passage of legislation confirming the waivers and a presidential signature.  This outcome remains reliant on a sustained shift in political will and potentially a major legal challenge.
