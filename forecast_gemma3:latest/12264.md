The Tasmanian tiger de-extinction project faces a complex and uncertain future. Despite significant advancements in genetic sequencing, stem cell technology, and genome editing, the technical hurdles and ethical considerations remain substantial. The most likely scenario involves continued, incremental research with limited tangible results – a process characterized by progress in specific genetic techniques but without a fully viable, self-sustaining population. A major setback, such as a critical DNA fragment loss, a stem cell failure, or a regulatory ban, would significantly reduce the odds of success. While a breakthrough in SCNT or a similar technique, combined with advancements in ecological restoration, could dramatically shift the probability, it remains highly improbable.  The project’s future hinges on sustained funding, effective collaboration, and the ability to address complex ethical and ecological challenges, all of which are subject to considerable uncertainty.  The probability of a successful, thriving Tasmanian tiger population within the next 10 years remains relatively low, reflecting the immense complexity of the undertaking and the inherent risks involved.
