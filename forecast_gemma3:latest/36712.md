Based on the rationales provided, the overall expectation for US crude oil production in the second quarter of 2026 is characterized by cautious optimism, acknowledging significant uncertainty and a gradual, potentially increasing trend, influenced by geopolitical factors and OPEC+ policies.  The prevailing view is one of constrained supply in the near term (2025), with a likely modest rise in US production, but tempered by the risk of disruptions.

The baseline projection reflects a continued trend of modest US production growth, with an anticipated average of approximately 13.75 - 14.25 million barrels per day by the end of 2025. However, several unexpected events could significantly alter this trajectory. A major geopolitical shock – such as a prolonged conflict disrupting key oil-producing regions or a complete shutdown of Iranian oil exports – could drastically reduce global supply, pushing US production down to 12.5-13.25 million barrels per day. Conversely, a revolutionary technological breakthrough or a massive new oil discovery could unlock substantial new reserves, boosting global supply to 14.5-15.5 million barrels per day. 

Given these considerations, a reasonable overall estimate for US crude oil production in the second quarter of 2026 falls within a range of 13.8 - 14.0 million barrels per day. This acknowledges the EIA’s baseline forecast, while accounting for the potential impact of both negative (geopolitical disruption) and positive (technological advancement/discovery) scenarios.  The inherent uncertainty regarding OPEC+ compliance, refining capacity constraints, and evolving market sentiment further contribute to this cautious outlook.
