The global landscape presents a significant challenge in reducing extreme poverty by 2030. The most probable outcome, based on current trends and projections, is a continuation of the existing trajectory, with approximately 622 million people living in extreme poverty. This is largely due to persistent weaknesses in developing economies – characterized by slow growth, stalled reforms, and ongoing vulnerabilities to climate change and global economic instability. A major “no outcome” scenario involves a confluence of negative events: a severe global recession, a catastrophic climate event triggering mass displacement, or a prolonged period of geopolitical instability that disrupts trade and investment. Conversely, a “yes” outcome hinges on a remarkably successful global initiative encompassing accelerated investment in sustainable development, major reforms within developing nations, and a significant shift in global cooperation. However, given the complexity of the challenges, this outcome remains statistically less likely. The existing trends, including slow global trade, geopolitical instability, and the escalating impacts of climate change, strongly suggest a continued, albeit slow, rise in extreme poverty levels.
