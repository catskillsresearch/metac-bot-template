Given the current trajectory of global population trends, technological advancements (particularly in AI and robotics), and the general tendency for slow, incremental change, the most likely outcome if nothing changed is a continuation of these trends. We’d likely see a global population stabilizing around 9.3 billion, with ongoing advancements in AI impacting the workforce and potentially leading to significant shifts in social and economic structures. The rate of change will be slow. A “No” outcome would require a truly disruptive event – something radically altering humanity’s trajectory. This could be a global pandemic far more devastating than COVID-19, a massive asteroid impact, or a sudden, irreversible technological singularity causing AI to surpass human control and essentially halt progress. Alternatively, a major global conflict rendering technological advancement impossible. A “Yes” outcome – a world of “unprecedented levels of well-being” – would involve a significant and unanticipated acceleration in technological progress – specifically in AI and bioengineering. This might involve the development of truly general artificial intelligence far surpassing current capabilities, coupled with breakthroughs in longevity and disease eradication. This could lead to an exponential expansion of human capabilities and potentially a population exceeding 10 billion, dramatically altered by human enhancement. A breakthrough in extending human lifespan significantly beyond current projections (perhaps through radical gene therapy or nanobots) combined with a sustained increase in global birth rates due to shifting social norms and improved economic conditions, would result in a population exceeding 10 billion by 2100.
