Based on the rationales provided, the following represents a consolidated rationale for assessing the probability of AI significantly dominating the NYT Best-Selling Fiction landscape by 2050:

The likelihood of AI writing tools fundamentally reshaping the landscape of NYT Best-Selling Fiction by 2050 is substantial, though not guaranteed. The core drivers of this probability stem from a confluence of technological advancements and evolving societal acceptance. Current trajectories point towards continued AI development, specifically models achieving near-perfect mimicry of human writing styles and, crucially, possessing genuine creative insight and emotional understanding – as envisioned in Forecast 5's “yes” scenario. This capability would be fueled by unprecedented training datasets, blurring the lines between human and AI authorship and redefining the very concept of originality. 

However, the realization of this “yes” outcome is contingent on several factors. The continuation of a trend of accelerating AI development, as highlighted across multiple forecasts, is vital. Equally important is the potential for societal shifts – either through a proactive regulatory response (as outlined in Forecast 2’s “no” scenario) or a significant cultural shift in valuing human creativity (as illustrated in Forecast 4's “yes” scenario). Conversely, potential inhibiting factors include catastrophic technological failures (such as a global cyberattack – Forecast 5) or a regulatory crackdown successfully limiting AI’s creative potential. The status quo, as detailed in Forecast 1’s “status quo” outcome, represents a significantly lower probability scenario, where AI remains a supplementary tool rather than a dominant force. 

Ultimately, the probability rests on the ability of AI to not just replicate, but genuinely innovate and resonate with audiences on an emotional and intellectual level – a capability that, based on the rationales, remains the most critical and uncertain element. The prevailing trend suggests a gradual but significant impact, moving beyond mere assistance to a fundamental transformation in the production and consumption of narrative.
