Based on the provided rationales, here’s a consolidated rationale reflecting the most plausible and consistent assessment of the Economist Democracy Index for the United States in 2026:

The trajectory of the Economist Intelligence Unit’s (EUI) Democracy Index for the United States in 2026 is overwhelmingly characterized by a continuation of a gradual, albeit potentially accelerating, downward trend. The core drivers of this decline are firmly established: persistent issues of political gridlock, increasing corruption, a widening gap between rich and poor, and a sustained erosion of public trust in governmental institutions and the media. While short-term fluctuations are inevitable, influenced by specific political events and global economic pressures, the fundamental direction appears to be one of democratic weakening.

The most likely scenario, given the consensus across the forecasts, anticipates a further reduction of approximately 0.1 to 0.2 points relative to the 2024 EUI score of 5.17. This would position the index around 5.07 – 5.17 by the end of 2026. This decline is expected to be sustained by factors such as continued geopolitical instability, the rise of populist movements, and potential cyberattacks targeting democratic infrastructure – scenarios repeatedly highlighted across the forecasts.

Experts and markets are anticipating increased political risk and volatility. Investors will likely remain cautious, favoring safe-haven assets and carefully assessing countries based on their democratic strength (or perceived lack thereof).  The overall sentiment will reflect a heightened sense of uncertainty and a reluctance to invest in environments perceived as politically unstable. 

While a significant, abrupt reversal is considered improbable based on the available information, an unexpected event – such as a coordinated global effort to actively support democratic institutions or a major, disruptive cyberattack – could exacerbate the downward trend. Conversely, a successful and sustained international response to address the drivers of democratic decline is considered unlikely, though not entirely impossible, given the pessimistic outlook.  The most probable outcome reflects a continued gradual erosion of the US’s position within the EUI Democracy Index, solidifying a future characterized by increased political polarization, economic inequality, and weakened democratic norms.
