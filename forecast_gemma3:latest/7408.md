Based on the provided forecasts, the most probable scenario for Turkey acquiring nuclear weapons within the next 18-24 months is driven by a combination of escalating regional tensions, a perceived failure of the Russia-Belarus security agreement, and covert support from Russia. The core rationale is as follows:

A significant, sustained deterioration in Turkey’s security environment – specifically within the Eastern Mediterranean and potentially elsewhere – will serve as the primary catalyst. Increased tensions with Greece and Cyprus, coupled with a lack of tangible security guarantees from the West, will fuel a perception of vulnerability and strategic isolation. Simultaneously, the security agreement between Russia and Belarus, while a step forward, is likely viewed by Turkey as insufficient to address its core security concerns. This perception will be reinforced by covert assistance from Russia, providing Turkey with the necessary technology, materials, and potentially limited nuclear warheads, bypassing international safeguards. This scenario hinges on a calculated assessment by Turkey that nuclear weapons are a necessary, albeit risky, deterrent to safeguard its interests and regional influence – a decision driven by a confluence of geopolitical pressures and a willingness to defy international norms. The overall probability of this occurring within the specified timeframe is assessed as high, reflecting the inherent instability of the region and Turkey’s strategic ambitions, though the precise timing remains uncertain.
