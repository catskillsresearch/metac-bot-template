Given the current political climate, the likelihood of Canada becoming the 51st US state by 2035 remains exceedingly low. The primary obstacle is the entrenched political divisions within the United States, particularly the continued influence of figures like Donald Trump and the deeply polarized nature of the Republican party. Maintaining this level of division, coupled with significant Congressional opposition and a lack of widespread public support, strongly favors a “No” outcome. 

However, a “Yes” outcome hinges on a radically altered political landscape. This would require a substantial shift in US presidential leadership – ideally a populist president with strong Republican backing – alongside a corresponding surge in public opinion favoring the idea, potentially driven by strategic imperatives like economic integration or a desire to simplify the US-Canada border. Critically, a bipartisan consensus within Congress, willing to navigate the considerable constitutional and logistical complexities, would also be essential. This scenario remains highly improbable given the existing political structures and entrenched positions. 

The short timeframe for achieving this outcome – typically estimated between 6-12 months – further diminishes the likelihood of a “Yes” outcome. The gradual nature of policy shifts, combined with the significant political hurdles involved, suggests that progress towards statehood would be slow and fraught with challenges. A “No” outcome, characterized by a continued status quo of marginal discussion and persistent Congressional opposition, represents the most probable scenario. The existing political landscape – marked by division and resistance – provides the strongest support for this conclusion.
