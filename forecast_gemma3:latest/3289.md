The current trajectory of gene editing technology, characterized by rapid advancements, ongoing clinical trials, and substantial market investment, suggests a gradual but accelerating increase in the number of babies treated with gene editing therapies by the end of 2029. However, the precise number remains highly uncertain due to inherent technological and regulatory challenges. The rate of development is influenced by multiple factors, including breakthroughs in precision editing tools, improvements in delivery methods, successful navigation of ethical and regulatory hurdles, and overall public acceptance.

Given this complexity, a plausible range for the number of babies treated by 2029 is between 500 and 20,000. The lower end of this range reflects a scenario where technological challenges persist, regulatory approvals remain stringent, and ethical concerns significantly slow adoption. The upper end anticipates substantial progress in multiple areas â€“ including more efficient delivery systems, a broader range of treatable genetic disorders, streamlined regulatory pathways, and increased public confidence in the safety and efficacy of gene editing.

Several potential disruptive events could significantly impact this range. A major technological breakthrough, such as a dramatically improved CRISPR delivery system or a more precise editing tool, could accelerate treatment rates. Conversely, unforeseen safety issues, ethical debates, or regulatory delays could hinder progress. Market forces, including investment levels and competition among gene editing companies, will also play a key role.

Ultimately, while precise prediction remains impossible, current trends point towards a significant, albeit uneven, growth in the number of babies treated with gene editing therapies by 2029, potentially culminating in treatment for hundreds to thousands of individuals.
