The core drivers of potential global conflict and societal disruption by 2070 appear to be a complex interplay of escalating geopolitical tensions, economic instability, and potentially transformative, yet uncertain, technological advancements. The most probable scenario involves a gradual, persistent deterioration of the global security landscape, characterized by regional conflicts and economic volatility, rather than a sudden, catastrophic event. A “No” outcome – a return to relative stability – hinges on a period of significant de-escalation, requiring a coordinated international response to complex challenges and a collective willingness to prioritize diplomacy and cooperation. Conversely, a “Yes” outcome is predicated on a cascading series of highly improbable events: a rapid technological breakthrough (specifically in nuclear energy) coupled with a severe, destabilizing societal shift due to automation and inequality. The timeframe – roughly 10-15 months – provides a window for potential escalation and significant change, but the likelihood of a drastic shift remains relatively low. The consistent thread throughout these forecasts is a reliance on a combination of miscalculation, unforeseen events, and the amplification of existing tensions, rather than a fundamental alteration in the underlying dynamics of the global system. The most significant risk appears to be a gradual, protracted decline, punctuated by localized crises and economic shocks, rather than a singular, apocalyptic event.
