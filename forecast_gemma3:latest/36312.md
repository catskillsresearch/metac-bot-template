The prevailing rationale for the projected increase in the U.S. national debt held by the public from Fiscal Year 2025 to 2034, considering the trajectory of current trends and potential deviations, is driven by a combination of sustained fiscal policies and economic conditions. The baseline scenario, consistently echoed across forecasts, anticipates a persistent increase in deficits fueled by ongoing tax cuts, primarily the continuation of the TCJA, alongside expansion of government spending. This trend is projected to lead to a debt held by the public rising to approximately 122% of GDP by 2035, translating to an annual deficit exceeding $3 trillion. The projections consistently highlight the impact of economic growth, often compounding the effects of tax cuts, and the potential for rising interest rates to exacerbate the debt burden.

However, significant variability exists within the range of potential outcomes, influenced by various external factors. An unexpected, severe global recession would dramatically reduce economic growth, decreasing tax revenues and potentially prompting spending cuts, bringing the debt down to around $48 trillion by 2035. Conversely, a sustained period of exceptionally high economic growth, combined with continued tax cuts, could push the debt held by the public to $75 trillion by 2035. Political shifts influencing fiscal policy, ranging from a sudden commitment to austerity to an unforeseen geopolitical crisis leading to massive spending increases, also introduce considerable uncertainty.  Overall, a range of 45-75 trillion dollars for the debt held by the public by 2035 is considered a reasonable assessment, accounting for the dynamic interplay of economic, political, and global factors.
