India’s ascent to become the world’s fourth-largest economy by the end of 2025 is highly probable, underpinned by a confluence of factors. The most likely scenario – representing roughly 92% of the probability – hinges on India maintaining a robust growth trajectory, currently estimated around 6.3%, while Japan continues to experience slower, stagnant economic performance, likely around 0.6%. This dynamic is driven by India’s demographic dividend – a large, young population – combined with ongoing economic reforms, infrastructure development, and increasing integration into global markets.  India’s services sector, manufacturing growth, and technological advancements are expected to be key drivers of this expansion. The continued success of these reforms and investment in infrastructure would be crucial.

However, several potential “no” outcomes could derail this projection. A significant global recession, particularly one synchronized across major economies, represents a major risk. Similarly, a dramatic and prolonged decline in commodity prices, significantly impacting India’s export-oriented growth, could significantly hinder its growth. Moreover, unforeseen geopolitical instability within India itself, leading to disruptions in economic activity, or a sustained technological disruption impacting India’s key industries, pose substantial threats.

The continued, albeit potentially uneven, progress in Japan is also a critical component.  Japan’s demographic challenges, structural economic issues, and slow productivity growth make it unlikely for Japan to regain lost ground significantly, providing India with a substantial advantage.

Therefore, while external shocks represent a risk, the prevailing trends and projections strongly indicate that India’s continued economic expansion will ultimately lead to it surpassing Japan's GDP to become the world's fourth-largest economy by 2025.
