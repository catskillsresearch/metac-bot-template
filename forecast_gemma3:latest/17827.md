Based on the rationales provided, here's a consolidated rationale for the likelihood of Turkey joining the European Union by 2040:

The probability of Turkey joining the European Union by 2040 remains exceptionally low, currently estimated at approximately 15%. This projection is predicated on a protracted period of stagnation, primarily due to deeply entrenched obstacles. The status quo – characterized by significant political differences, persistent concerns regarding human rights and the rule of law, unresolved geopolitical tensions (particularly in the Eastern Mediterranean and Cyprus), and internal divisions within the EU – is the most likely outcome if no fundamental changes occur. The time remaining until 2040 offers limited opportunity for substantial shifts, and the core issues are unlikely to be resolved quickly.

However, a “No” outcome is not guaranteed. A more optimistic, though still improbable, scenario necessitates a dramatic transformation within Turkey, encompassing genuine democratic reforms, demonstrable respect for human rights, a resolution to regional conflicts, and significant economic integration. Simultaneously, the EU would need to overcome internal political divisions, address its own economic challenges, and re-evaluate its strategic priorities, potentially recognizing the benefits of Turkey’s membership. A period of relative geopolitical stability and a shift in EU leadership could also create a more conducive environment.

Despite these potential developments, the sheer weight of historical and current obstacles – including Turkey’s assertive foreign policy, its ongoing disputes with neighboring countries, and the deeply rooted skepticism within many EU member states – makes a successful accession by 2040 extraordinarily difficult. The inherent complexities and the lack of clear momentum suggest that the most plausible trajectory remains one of continued stalemate.
