Here's a synthesized rationale, incorporating the best elements from all five forecasts, aiming for a cohesive and comprehensive assessment:

The future of the Inflation Reduction Act’s clean energy tax credits, particularly the 45X, 45Q, 45Z, and 48C credits, remains highly uncertain, but a gradual reduction in support is the most likely near-term outcome. As of June 2025, approximately 18 months remain until the initial sunset provisions begin to take effect, a timeframe sufficient for significant legislative and economic shifts to occur. Given the polarized political landscape in the U.S., a complete reversal of the IRA’s climate provisions is unlikely, but neither is a straightforward continuation of the current incentives without adjustments.

The most probable scenario is a phased reduction in the value or duration of the credits, beginning around 2027 and continuing over the subsequent years. The Treasury Department is expected to issue interim guidance and potentially draft legislation to manage the credits, likely prioritizing adjustments based on cost-effectiveness evaluations. The 45Q carbon capture credit faces particular headwinds due to high costs and questionable effectiveness, and is likely to be the first to experience reductions. The 45X advanced manufacturing credit, tied to substantial private investment, may receive more sustained support initially, while the 45Z clean fuel production credit also faces uncertainty.

However, a significant, unforeseen event could dramatically alter this trajectory. A major technological breakthrough—specifically, a truly cost-effective long-duration energy storage solution—combined with a disruptive event in global oil markets (e.g., a large-scale geopolitical crisis) would fundamentally reshape the economic calculus. Such a scenario would create an unprecedented demand for renewable energy, immediately increasing the attractiveness of the existing credits and potentially triggering Congressional support for expanding or extending them. Alternatively, a severe economic downturn, coupled with heightened concerns about energy security, could accelerate support for immediate clean energy deployment, potentially leading to a complete rejection of any further sunset provisions.

Despite these possibilities, a substantial reduction in the value or duration of the credits before 2026 is still the most probable outcome, reflecting the political realities and the inherent challenges associated with the current incentives. Ongoing debates regarding the cost and effectiveness of these credits, combined with fiscal constraints, are likely to drive adjustments. Therefore, a gradual, phased decline in support represents the most realistic near-term projection.

Now, assigning probabilities based on this combined rationale:

Option_2025-2026 sunset: 20%
Option_2027 sunset: 35%
Option_2028 sunset: 25%
Option_2029 sunset: 15%
Option_No sunset reduction before 2026: 5%
