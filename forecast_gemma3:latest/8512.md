Given the current trajectory of technological advancement, including quantum computing, artificial intelligence, and robotics, the most likely outcome within the next 18 months (until June 2026) is a continued, albeit gradual, expansion of these technologies. While a truly disruptive “singularity” scenario remains unlikely, a confluence of events could lead to a significant acceleration in progress. The status quo, if nothing changes, envisions incremental advancements in quantum computing – primarily focused on improving qubit stability, coherence times, and the number of qubits – alongside continued progress in AI capabilities and widespread industrial automation driven by cognitive robots. The market size for quantum computing is expected to grow modestly, driven by increasing investment and a small number of successful applications in specialized areas like drug discovery and materials science. However, significant obstacles remain, including the challenges of error correction and scalability. 

A “No” outcome, representing a complete halt to progress, could be triggered by a catastrophic global event – a major pandemic, a significant geopolitical conflict disrupting R&D, or a devastating natural disaster. Alternatively, a fundamental technological roadblock, such as a major failure in quantum computing hardware or a disruptive breakthrough rendering existing technologies obsolete, could significantly delay advancements.  A substantial economic downturn would also likely curtail investment and slow the pace of development. 

Conversely, a “Yes” outcome—representing a genuinely transformative shift—would require a combination of breakthroughs: notably, a stable, scalable, and relatively inexpensive qubit technology coupled with the creation of genuinely “general” AI capable of independent learning and adaptation at an exponential rate. Such a development would likely be accelerated by related advancements in materials science, facilitating the construction of quantum computers. This could trigger a wave of investment and reshape the economic and social landscape within a relatively short timeframe, driving innovation across multiple sectors and making a more rapid technological transformation increasingly plausible. The overall likelihood of this outcome is estimated at 65%.
