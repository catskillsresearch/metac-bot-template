Okay, here’s a consolidated rationale incorporating the best elements from all five forecasts, aiming for a consistent and robust assessment:

**Consolidated Rationale: Likelihood of Russia Utilizing Nuclear Weapons in Ukraine or Ukrainian-Held Territory Before 2026**

The question of whether Russia will employ nuclear weapons in Ukraine or Ukrainian-held territory by June 23, 2025, presents a significant challenge for forecasting due to the high degree of uncertainty and volatility inherent in the situation. While a definitive prediction is impossible, a reasoned assessment can be constructed based on the available information and the probabilities associated with various scenarios.

The most immediate and statistically probable outcome remains the continuation of the current protracted, grinding conflict – a conventional war of attrition with intermittent offensives and counter-offsensives. This represents a baseline probability of approximately 45%.  This reflects the consensus across all forecasts regarding the continued military operations and the lack of a rapid, decisive shift in the conflict dynamics. The "status quo" scenario, characterized by neither side achieving a major breakthrough and ongoing political posturing, carries the highest weight (around 35%).

However, the risk of escalation – specifically the use of nuclear weapons – is not negligible. Several factors contribute to this elevated risk. Firstly, Russia’s leadership, particularly Putin and Shoigu, continues to maintain a nuclear deterrent posture, regularly employing nuclear rhetoric and hinting at the potential use of these weapons in response to perceived threats. This rhetoric, while perhaps intended as a deterrent, also indicates a willingness to consider nuclear options. Secondly, the instability of the situation, coupled with the possibility of miscalculation or unintended escalation, remains a significant concern.

Several potential scenarios could trigger a shift towards a “Yes” outcome – that Russia actually utilizes nuclear weapons. A catastrophic Ukrainian offensive achieving a substantial territorial gain and directly threatening Russian strategic assets (such as Moscow) would create a critical pressure point. Alternatively, a devastating Russian tactical nuclear strike, intended to disrupt Western command and control or inflict significant casualties, could provoke a dramatic NATO response. While less likely, a complete diplomatic breakdown – facilitated by a powerful third-party mediator – resulting in a deeply unfavorable outcome for Russia – could also trigger a desperate act.

It’s crucial to acknowledge that a significant diplomatic breakthrough leading to a negotiated settlement, guaranteeing Ukraine’s security and addressing Russia’s core concerns, presents a “No” outcome. However, given the entrenched positions of the parties and the lack of a clear path to a sustainable agreement, this scenario is statistically less probable (approximately 20%).

Considering all these factors, a measured probability of approximately 20% is assigned to the “Yes” outcome – Russia utilizing nuclear weapons. This reflects the persistent risk of escalation, the ongoing instability of the conflict, and the inherent unpredictability of Russian decision-making.  Therefore, the overall baseline probability remains centered around 45%, acknowledging the potential for significant shifts based on unforeseen developments.  The level of risk, and the potential for a dramatic escalation, demands continued vigilance and careful monitoring of the situation.
