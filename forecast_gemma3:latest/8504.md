Here’s a consolidated rationale, synthesizing the best elements from all five forecasts:

The likelihood of a legally binding international agreement banning or severely restricting Lethal Autonomous Weapons Systems (LAWS) by June 2025 is assessed to be relatively low, but with a potential for a moderate increase in probability given the dynamic geopolitical landscape. The core challenge lies in the persistent resistance from major powers, particularly the United States, Russia, and China, who prioritize national security interests and strategic advantage over multilateral regulatory frameworks. Despite ongoing discussions within mechanisms like the Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) under the UN Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW), significant progress towards a legally binding instrument remains improbable due to entrenched positions and competing national priorities.

However, the potential for a shift in probability exists. A key factor driving this is the rapid technological advancement in Artificial Intelligence and autonomous systems, outpacing regulatory efforts and generating significant concerns about the potential misuse and unintended consequences of LAWS. While a “black swan” event – a major, immediately disruptive conflict involving LAWS – could force a rushed, weak agreement, the most plausible pathway to a more positive outcome relies on a coordinated, sustained diplomatic initiative. This would likely involve a coalition of nations including the European Union, Japan, South Korea, and perhaps a renewed and committed Canada. This coalition would need to effectively leverage growing public concern – driven by ethical considerations and the potential for catastrophic humanitarian consequences – to create sufficient political momentum. A critical breakthrough would likely require a shared understanding and agreement on the definition of "meaningful human control" and the establishment of verifiable safeguards and enforcement mechanisms. The success of this endeavor hinges on a combination of technological advancement, geopolitical stability, and a demonstrable shift in the priorities of major powers.  Therefore, while the base probability remains relatively low, a determined and multifaceted diplomatic effort could modestly increase the chances of a successful agreement.
