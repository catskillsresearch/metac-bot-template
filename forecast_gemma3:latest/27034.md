The global AI regulatory landscape, as indicated by the provided forecasts, is characterized by a persistent lack of coordinated international action. A “No” outcome—a significant shift towards globally unified AI regulation—remains the most probable scenario. The world is operating within a fragmented environment, shaped by competing national interests, differing regulatory approaches (particularly between the US, the EU, and China), and a general caution in investment. The prevailing trend is one of incremental, divergent development, with ongoing geopolitical tensions acting as a major impediment to consensus. A significant, unforeseen global crisis—such as a major climate event or pandemic—is the most likely catalyst for a temporary, reactive shift towards greater collaboration, but this is unlikely to translate into a permanent, globally unified regulatory framework. The future appears to be one of continued competition and localized governance, with the “Wild West” perception of the US AI landscape persisting, and a “No” outcome being the most probable.
