## Final Rationale for Red Sea Shipping Resumption Forecast

Given the current landscape of geopolitical instability and ongoing maritime security concerns, the resumption of shipping operations in the Red Sea by the end of 2025 remains a highly uncertain prospect. The prevailing forecast is a cautious and gradual return, but a full, rapid resumption is unlikely.

The most probable outcome reflects a scenario of *managed risk*. Continuing instability in Yemen, coupled with the ongoing threat of Houthi attacks, will likely lead to a persistent reluctance among major shipping lines to fully utilize the Red Sea route. Rerouting vessels around the Cape of Good Hope will remain the norm, resulting in increased transit times and higher operational costs. Egypt will continue to suffer significant revenue losses related to the Suez Canal.

However, a sustained period of relative calm is a critical factor. This would require a multifaceted approach: firstly, a de-escalation of the conflict in Yemen, ideally achieved through a negotiated settlement, though this is considered the least likely. Secondly, an effective and demonstrably robust international security presence in the Red Sea, possibly involving a more permanent naval force or enhanced surveillance capabilities, would be necessary to deter attacks. Finally, a willingness by the Houthis to cease attacks – perhaps as part of a broader political agreement – would be crucial.

A prolonged escalation of the conflict, either through wider regional involvement or a significant deterioration in the security situation, poses a serious risk of a complete blockade of the Red Sea. Conversely, even with improvements in security, a full and immediate return to pre-2023 levels of activity is improbable, suggesting a gradual restoration of confidence and activity over time. The overall probability of a significant resumption of shipping in the Red Sea by December 2025 is estimated at approximately 35%.
