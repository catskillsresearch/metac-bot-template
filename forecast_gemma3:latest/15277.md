The global geopolitical landscape is characterized by a complex interplay of ongoing tensions, fluctuating alliances, and persistent economic challenges. Looking ahead to 2030, the likelihood of Belarus achieving EU candidate status remains uncertain, heavily influenced by the trajectory of several key factors. The remaining timeframe – approximately 4 years and 7 months – presents a window of opportunity, but the existing conditions significantly impede progress.

Currently, the most probable outcome is a continuation of the status quo. The Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) will likely maintain a partially integrated economic space, focusing on trade facilitation, customs cooperation, and incremental regulatory harmonization. However, the “four freedoms” – free movement of goods, capital, labor, and services – are unlikely to be fully realized due to persistent economic disparities between member states, enduring political priorities, and lingering geopolitical tensions, particularly stemming from the conflict in Ukraine and the broader relationship between Russia and the West. A significant escalation of this conflict, potentially involving direct NATO intervention, would immediately halt any progress. Concurrent with this, intensified Western sanctions would severely hamper foreign investment and reform efforts. Internal instability within any of the EAEU member states – economic collapse or political upheaval – presents another major risk to the Union’s stability.

Conversely, a “Yes” outcome hinges on a remarkable series of developments. Firstly, sustained diplomatic resolutions and a comprehensive peace settlement in Ukraine, supported by substantial Western economic and security assistance, would be crucial. Secondly, a deep and sustained integration within the EAEU would require significant increases in trade volume, technological cooperation, and investment, driven by a unified approach to energy and digital technologies. Thirdly, a de-escalation of geopolitical tensions between Russia and the West, fostering greater trust and cooperation, is paramount. Finally, a period of relative political stability across all member states, enabling consistent commitment to the EAEU’s goals, is essential. The potential for increased foreign direct investment, particularly from China, would also bolster this outcome.

Despite these potential developments, substantial hurdles remain. The ongoing conflict in Ukraine, the persistent Western sanctions, and the significant economic and political disparities between member states will continue to exert pressure on the EAEU. The success of this scenario ultimately relies on a level of political will and long-term commitment that, given the current environment, appears challenging to secure. Therefore, a balanced assessment suggests a probability of approximately 62%, acknowledging the significant uncertainties and potential disruptions that could derail this ambitious endeavor.
