**Combined Rationale:**

The assessment of the likelihood of a Russia-NATO conflict by 2035 is deeply rooted in a complex and persistently tense geopolitical landscape. The timeframe remaining – roughly 5-8 years – introduces a significant element of uncertainty, increasing the potential for rapid escalation if conditions align. The current status quo, characterized by ongoing military buildup by both sides, persistent strategic maneuvering, and the protracted conflict in Ukraine, suggests a continuation of heightened tensions. Russia’s strategic focus remains on projecting power regionally, aiming for influence in Ukraine, while simultaneously engaging in a long-term strategic competition with the West.

However, the risk of escalation is not negligible. A "No" outcome scenario hinges on a dramatic shift in the global balance of power, a major de-escalation of the conflict in Ukraine, or a fundamental change in Russia’s strategic calculations.  This could involve a diplomatic breakthrough, a collapse of the Russian economy, or a change in leadership that alters Moscow's priorities. Conversely, a “Yes” outcome scenario is predicated on a confluence of factors, including a miscalculation by NATO, a deterioration of the Ukrainian front, and a perceived Western reluctance to fully support Ukraine. This would likely trigger a limited, probing offensive, potentially aimed at a vulnerable NATO member.

Currently, the probability of a full-scale Russia-NATO conflict by 2035 appears relatively low, estimated at approximately 35%. This reflects the inherent complexities and uncertainties of the situation, including the potential for miscalculation, the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, and the persistent strategic competition between Russia and the West. While the risk remains significant, particularly given the limited timeframe, the prevailing factors suggest a continued state of tension rather than an imminent and large-scale confrontation.  It is crucial to acknowledge that this is a dynamic situation, vulnerable to unforeseen events that could dramatically alter the trajectory of the conflict.
