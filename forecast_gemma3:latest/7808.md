Based on the rationales provided, the most likely outcome is a continuation of the status quo, with a low probability of a breakthrough. The key drivers of this assessment are the deep-seated distrust, entrenched positions, and ongoing regional instability. 

The most significant factors contributing to this outlook are: the inherent difficulty in overcoming decades of animosity between the US and Iran; the lack of a clear framework for negotiations that addresses the core concerns of both sides; the persistent obstacles posed by Israel’s opposition to Iran’s nuclear program; and the volatile geopolitical situation in the Middle East, particularly the ongoing conflict in Gaza, which significantly increases the risk of escalation. 

Several scenarios could lead to a “No” outcome – a major escalation in the Gaza conflict, a significant deterioration in Iran’s nuclear program, or a complete breakdown in trust between the parties. These scenarios are consistently highlighted across all forecasts as the most likely path forward. 

While a “Yes” outcome – a comprehensive nuclear agreement – remains a possibility, it requires a confluence of highly improbable events: a dramatic shift in US policy, a corresponding willingness to compromise from Iran, a resolution of Israel’s security concerns, and a period of relative stability in the region. The forecasts consistently suggest that the necessary conditions for a breakthrough are unlikely to materialize within the 61-10 months timeframe outlined. 

Therefore, the most robust and justified assessment is a continued status quo, characterized by tension, instability, and a low probability of a comprehensive nuclear agreement being reached by October 2025. The inherent risks associated with the situation remain elevated, and a significant shift towards a positive outcome appears improbable given the current landscape.
