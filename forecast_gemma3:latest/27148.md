The mpox global situation by the end of 2025 is most likely to remain persistent but contained. Despite ongoing efforts by the WHO and various national health agencies, a dramatic, sustained global improvement is considered improbable. The most probable outcome involves a continued, albeit fluctuating, level of mpox activity, primarily concentrated in Africa, with localized outbreaks and approximately 3,000-4,000 confirmed cases globally. Vaccination campaigns will have a limited but noticeable impact, preventing a rapid increase in cases, but logistical challenges, funding constraints, and the inherent difficulty of controlling a disease transmitted through close contact will continue to hinder a more decisive outcome. A “No outcome” scenario – a catastrophic resurgence due to a novel mutation or a breakdown in international cooperation – remains a significant risk. Conversely, a “Yes outcome” – a dramatic and sustained reduction in cases – depends on a highly improbable confluence of factors, including a rapid, globally deployed, and highly effective vaccine, coupled with a significant shift in public behavior and sustained, coordinated international efforts. The current trajectory, characterized by localized outbreaks and persistent, albeit uneven, response measures, points towards a scenario of ongoing, contained activity, rather than a complete resolution of the mpox outbreak.
