Given the ongoing geopolitical tensions surrounding Taiwan, the global support for China’s claims regarding the island is expected to shift significantly over the next 18-24 months. The current trend of China steadily gaining diplomatic support, fueled by the Belt and Road Initiative, economic leverage, and increasingly vocal concerns regarding Taiwan’s security, is projected to continue. Over this timeframe, we can anticipate a substantial increase in the number of nations recognizing China’s position, potentially rising by 15-25% compared to the current baseline. 

This shift is largely driven by a combination of factors: China’s persistent diplomatic efforts, its growing economic influence, and the potential for a fractured international response to any crisis involving Taiwan. The expectation is that approximately 75-80 countries will ultimately support China’s stance, reflecting a strategic realignment driven by concerns about regional stability and a desire to avoid friction with Beijing. 

However, the degree of this shift is subject to considerable uncertainty. Several potential disruptive events could significantly alter this trajectory. A major global economic crisis, causing widespread instability and diverting attention away from the Taiwan issue, could temporarily weaken Western resolve and lead to a decline in support for Taiwan. Conversely, a coordinated Western initiative—such as a substantial aid package to Taiwan or a demonstration of military force—could galvanize international support and deter China.  Furthermore, a serious escalation involving Taiwan, even without direct US intervention, could trigger a global condemnation of China and a surge in support for Taiwan. 

The overall trend points towards a growing alignment with China’s position, driven by a complex interplay of economic, strategic, and geopolitical considerations. Given the inherent volatility of the situation, a reasonable projection for the number of UN member states supporting China’s claims at the end of 2025 is between 75 and 80, acknowledging the significant degree of uncertainty surrounding this dynamic global landscape.
