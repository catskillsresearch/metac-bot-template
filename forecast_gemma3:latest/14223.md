Based on the rationales provided, the most likely scenario for a non-Republican/non-Democrat US president being inaugurated before 2080 involves a confluence of disruptive events and shifts in political sentiment. A significant, sustained economic downturn – triggered perhaps by a global crisis – is consistently identified as a key catalyst. This would erode public confidence in the established political order and create space for alternative candidates and movements. 

Furthermore, ongoing political polarization and division within the Democratic and Republican parties are repeatedly cited as facilitating factors. A major scandal involving the incumbent administration, particularly one damaging to Biden’s legacy, would likely bolster the chances of a third-party candidate or a Republican challenger. The continued influence of figures like Donald Trump, and the potential for a broader conservative alliance – as hinted at in some forecasts – represents another crucial element.

The narratives surrounding economic issues, social justice debates, and national security would continue to drive public opinion and shape the political landscape. A decisive shift in the Republican party’s direction, possibly led by a new generation of leaders, would also be a significant factor. Finally, the emergence of a compelling third-party candidate with a clear vision and the ability to mobilize support would be critical. 

Essentially, the probability of a non-traditional president being inaugurated before 2080 hinges on a period of significant instability and upheaval within the US political system, coupled with the rise of a credible alternative force.
