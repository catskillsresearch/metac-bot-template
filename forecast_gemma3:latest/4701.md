The global market share of fully electric vehicles in 2030 is subject to considerable uncertainty, influenced by a complex interplay of technological advancements, policy decisions, and consumer behavior.  Based on available forecasts, a plausible, albeit fluctuating, trajectory emerges. Initially, the rate of adoption will continue to be moderated by existing constraints, including charging infrastructure limitations, consumer hesitancy due to range anxiety and upfront costs, and ongoing reliance on fossil fuels.  Assuming a continued, though moderate, trend of technological progress—specifically, advancements in battery technology (range, charging speed, and cost reduction) alongside the expansion of charging infrastructure—the market share is likely to increase steadily through 2025 and 2027, reaching approximately 25% of global car sales. However, this growth will be tempered by economic uncertainties and logistical hurdles. 

Between 2028 and 2030, the pace of increase will slow substantially.  Charging infrastructure may struggle to keep pace with growing demand, and economic fluctuations could dampen consumer confidence.  Consequently, the market share is projected to plateau around 35-40% globally. 

Several disruptive factors could significantly alter this trajectory. A major, unforeseen global recession would likely curtail consumer spending, impacting auto sales across the board.  Conversely, a truly revolutionary breakthrough in battery technology—such as solid-state batteries offering dramatically improved range, charging speed, and safety—coupled with simultaneously strong, consistent government policies (subsidies, regulations) and a massive shift in consumer preferences, could accelerate adoption dramatically, potentially pushing the market share to 75-85%.  Alternatively, a significant geopolitical crisis disrupting critical battery material supply chains would undoubtedly present a considerable obstacle to growth.  Ultimately, while technological progress and supportive policies are expected to play a crucial role, realizing a high market share by 2030 hinges on a fortunate combination of circumstances.
