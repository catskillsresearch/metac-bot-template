Given the rationales from the five forecasts, here's a consolidated rationale reflecting the most compelling elements:

The most likely outcome regarding the prevalence of HIV/AIDS in 2037 compared to 2017 is a *partial* failure to meet the 2030 targets. The dominant trend, highlighted across all forecasts, is one of persistent underinvestment, slow progress, and a continued high level of new infections globally.  If nothing changes, the current trajectory – characterized by stalled funding, limited global coordination, and a lack of urgency – will likely result in approximately 600,000-800,000 new infections by 2030, significantly exceeding the 370,000 target. The status quo implies a continued, albeit manageable, level of the epidemic, driven by inequalities, limited access to testing and treatment, and persistent stigma.

However, a catastrophic “No” outcome – triggered by a major global crisis such as a pandemic, economic collapse, or large-scale conflict – introduces a significant risk. Such an event would severely disrupt existing efforts, diverting resources and attention away from HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment, potentially leading to a resurgence of the epidemic and the complete failure to achieve the 2030 targets.

Conversely, a “Yes” outcome—the successful attainment of the 2030 targets—requires a monumental, almost improbable, convergence of factors. This includes a sustained surge in global funding, driven by renewed political will and significant public awareness, coupled with substantial breakthroughs in prevention technologies (like a highly effective vaccine or microbicide) and a drastic reduction in societal stigma. Despite the challenges, the possibility remains, dependent on a remarkably coordinated and dedicated global effort.  Given the current landscape of slow progress and constrained resources, the probability of achieving this ambitious goal by 2037 is relatively low, but not entirely impossible.
