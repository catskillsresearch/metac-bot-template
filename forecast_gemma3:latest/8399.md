Okay, here's a consolidated rationale synthesizing the best aspects of all five forecasts, aiming for a cohesive and robust assessment:

**Consolidated Rationale: Probability of Nuclear War by 2035**

The question of whether a global nuclear war will occur by 2035 is profoundly complex, and current indicators lean towards a concerning, though not deterministic, likelihood.  The timeframe remaining (approximately 1 year and 10 months) presents a crucial window for developments, but the underlying trends strongly suggest a significant risk.

The most probable scenario—and the one reflected across the forecasts—centers around a *gradual escalation* driven by miscalculation, strategic friction, and a diminished capacity for effective international cooperation. While a sudden, catastrophic event remains a possibility, the greater threat lies in a slow, incremental build-up of tensions, punctuated by localized conflicts and a persistent erosion of trust.

Several key factors contribute to this overall risk. The status quo – characterized by rising geopolitical tensions between major powers (particularly the US and China), the ongoing instability in regions like Ukraine and the Middle East, and the proliferation of nuclear weapons – creates a volatile environment. The current trends of nationalist sentiment, weakened international institutions, and a diminished willingness to compromise exacerbate this risk.  The legacy of the 2008 financial crisis and rising economic inequality further destabilize global relations.  Furthermore, the increasing sophistication of cyber warfare and space-based technologies introduces new dimensions to potential conflict, increasing the probability of miscalculation.

A “No” outcome—a successful avoidance of global nuclear war—requires a fundamental shift in global dynamics. This would necessitate a dramatic improvement in international relations, including breakthroughs in diplomacy between major powers, de-escalation of regional conflicts, strengthened multilateral institutions, and a renewed commitment to arms control and non-proliferation. This scenario, however, seems incredibly unlikely given the inertia of existing geopolitical forces and the lack of a compelling international consensus.  The most plausible, albeit frightening, path remains one of increasing strategic competition and the potential for miscalculation to spiral out of control.

While precise probabilities are difficult to assign, considering the cumulative weight of the forecasts, coupled with the persistent trends, a significant probability (approximately 65-70%) exists that a global nuclear conflict will occur by 2035. This doesn’t mean war is inevitable, but the conditions for escalation are increasingly present, demanding constant vigilance and a renewed commitment to preventing a catastrophic outcome.
