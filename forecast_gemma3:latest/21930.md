Based on the rationales provided, here’s a consolidated rationale for the likelihood of Bryan Caplan’s bet being correct by 2046:

The most probable scenario, given the timeframe and current geopolitical dynamics, points to a prolonged, unresolved conflict in Ukraine persisting well into the future. The predominant risk factor is the continued stalemate characterized by intermittent Russian control of Ukrainian territory, ongoing low-intensity warfare, and fluctuating Western support. A ‘No’ outcome – defined as a lack of a sustainable resolution – is significantly more likely than a ‘Yes’ outcome, primarily because of the entrenched positions of both sides, the lack of a clear path to a negotiated settlement, and the potential for escalation. A major escalation, whether through a significant Russian offensive or a Ukrainian counteroffensive, or a deterioration in Western support, would solidify this outcome. While a shift in the Russian political landscape and a renewed commitment from the West could conceivably lead to a resolution, the inherent complexity and the multiple obstacles make this scenario less probable. The time horizon – over two decades – further increases the likelihood of continued instability and the absence of a definitive resolution. Consequently, a probability of approximately 45% seems a reasonable assessment, recognizing the inherent unpredictability of geopolitical events.
