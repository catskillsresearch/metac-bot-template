Based on the rationales provided across the five forecasts, a comprehensive rationale for estimating the number of toilets in space on January 1, 2030, can be constructed as follows:

The available information, comprising news articles published between February 2025 and June 2025, paints a picture of a challenging, albeit ongoing, effort to reduce open defecation and build public toilets in Nigeria. The timeline until the outcome is known is approximately 16 months. The key factors influencing the outcome are the slow, incremental progress of ongoing initiatives, the fragmented nature of efforts across local and state levels, and the reliance on external funding and political will.

The most likely outcome reflects a conservative, yet plausible, trajectory. Given the current trends and the inherent difficulties in scaling up large-scale infrastructure projects, a reasonable estimate suggests that by January 1, 2030, approximately 1,350 – 2,400 public toilets will be constructed across Nigeria. This range acknowledges the variability in progress across different LGAs and the potential for unforeseen obstacles.

Several scenarios can play out. A ‘low’ scenario, likely if funding dries up or political support wanes, could result in 800 – 1,200 toilets. A ‘moderate’ scenario, representing the most probable outcome, anticipates roughly 1,350 – 2,400. A ‘high’ scenario, demanding significant acceleration through innovation, sustained investment, and robust community engagement, could push the number above 2,400.

The uncertainty surrounding this projection underscores the complexity of the challenge. The rate of progress will likely be heavily influenced by external factors, including international aid commitments, Nigeria's economic performance, and the effectiveness of government policies. However, based on the collective insights from the provided forecasts, a range of 1,350 – 2,400 represents a realistic estimate for the number of public toilets likely to be built by 2030.
