The declining birth rate in the United States, a consistent trend highlighted across the forecasts, stems from a confluence of interconnected factors. The immediate timeframe for a definitive prediction is relatively short, estimated at 1-2 years, reflecting the dynamic nature of demographic shifts. Assuming no major disruptive events, the established trend will continue, resulting in a gradual, albeit persistent, decline.  The current rate of decline, approximately 3-4% per year, is projected to continue, bringing the total fertility rate to 1.4 births per woman by 2035 and 1.2 by 2060. Assisted reproductive technologies (ART) will likely remain a significant contributor to births, potentially reaching 6-8% of all births by 2035 due to ongoing challenges with fertility. 

However, significant uncertainty remains regarding the long-term trajectory. A pessimistic scenario anticipates a population contraction of 20-25% by 2050, reaching a peak of 316 million before stabilizing at 280 million by 2060.  A more optimistic, albeit less probable, outcome envisions a counter-trend, driven by a major technological breakthrough in fertility enhancement or a dramatic shift in societal attitudes toward family size. The potential for a global recession, coupled with widespread anxieties about the future, could further depress birth rates, potentially pushing the total fertility rate below 1.3. Conversely, a technological advancement dramatically improving fertility or a cultural movement encouraging larger families could trigger a population boom. Financial markets are increasingly factoring in these demographic trends, anticipating decreased consumer spending and investment returns as the population ages, with potential impacts on sectors reliant on younger consumers.  Ultimately, the future birth rate remains fundamentally uncertain, dependent on an unpredictable combination of social, economic, and technological forces.
