Given the ongoing tensions, the high degree of strategic competition between the US and China, and the generally cautious nature of US trade policy, a full and comprehensive trade deal between India and the US by autumn 2025 is unlikely. The status quo remains the most probable outcome. The fundamental challenges – the US-China rivalry, intellectual property concerns, and differing economic priorities – are unlikely to be resolved quickly. A period of continued impasse, with intermittent trade adjustments and a lack of significant progress toward a comprehensive agreement, is the most plausible scenario. While opportunities for closer trade ties may emerge, the existing geopolitical landscape presents substantial obstacles.
