Based on the rationales provided, here’s a synthesized rationale for the likelihood of a large American city fully abolishing its police department before 2035:

The probability of a full abolition by 2035 is subject to considerable uncertainty, currently estimated at around 65%. The timeframe – approximately 10 years – presents a mixed bag of potential catalysts for change and persistent obstacles to implementation. The most immediate impacts will likely be gradual, incremental shifts, driven by localized activism and political maneuvering.  

A significant factor is the length of time remaining. While the initial snippets suggest a focus on current events (February - June 2025), the most substantial changes are likely to be triggered by sustained pressure and, crucially, coordinated action rather than isolated incidents. The status quo – characterized by slow, piecemeal progress and frequent delays – represents a very real possibility, particularly if political will wanes or unforeseen challenges (economic downturns, legal battles, or community resistance) emerge. 

Several scenarios could lead to a “yes” outcome. A particularly compelling example is the potential for a sustained, high-profile campaign regarding animal welfare in Malaga, coupled with a shift in political leadership that prioritizes impactful change. Similarly, significant public outcry surrounding corruption within the Hanceville police department, leading to immediate reforms and a dismantling of the department, is plausible.  Finally, a genuinely transformative redevelopment project in Phoenix, driven by strong public support and significant investment, could overcome political resistance and fundamentally reshape the city’s urban landscape. 

However, numerous factors could prevent a complete abolition. The Phoenix redevelopment project, while potentially progressing, is particularly vulnerable to bureaucratic delays, community opposition, and funding challenges. The Malaga horse-drawn carriage ban faces ongoing resistance, and the Hanceville police department abolition remains susceptible to local political headwinds. A major economic downturn or a significant shift in public opinion could easily derail any of these initiatives. 

Ultimately, the outcome hinges on a combination of sustained pressure, effective leadership, and a willingness to prioritize long-term societal goals over short-term political considerations. The current landscape suggests a high degree of volatility, and while progress is possible, a full abolition before 2035 remains a challenging, albeit not entirely impossible, prospect.
