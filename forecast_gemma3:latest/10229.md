Based on the provided forecasts, the overall rationale for predicting Russia’s fertility rate in 2027 is as follows:

The most likely scenario anticipates a continued, albeit gradual, decline in Russia’s fertility rate. The existing trend, as evidenced by the data through June 2025, points to a consistent downward trajectory, with a current rate of decline around 0.08 births per woman annually. Extrapolations suggest a rate of approximately 1.35 births per woman by the end of 2025, potentially decreasing further to around 1.25-1.35 by 2027. Experts and markets largely share this pessimistic outlook, anticipating ongoing demographic challenges stemming from factors like economic uncertainty, delayed childbearing, and a shrinking workforce.

However, significant uncertainties remain. A major unforeseen event – such as a severe economic recession, a public health crisis, or a significant geopolitical disruption – could dramatically worsen the situation, pushing the rate down further, potentially to levels of 1.0 - 1.3 births per woman. Conversely, a proactive, large-scale government intervention – including robust social support programs, financial incentives, and a concerted effort to shift societal attitudes – could, though less likely, potentially reverse the trend and lead to a rate of 1.4 – 1.8 births per woman. The overall consensus among the forecasts indicates that a rate of around 1.3 - 1.4 births per woman is the most probable outcome for 2027, but the possibility of deviation due to unexpected events remains considerable.
