Based on the rationales provided, a consolidated rationale for the likelihood of the US enacting export controls for some generative AI software before 2026 is as follows:

The most probable outcome is a continuation of the existing, tense dynamic between the US and China in the AI technology landscape.  The immediate period (June 2025) suggests a status quo characterized by incremental shifts, ongoing attempts to tighten US export controls on AI chips and model weights, and increasingly sophisticated circumvention efforts by Chinese companies.  The global AI ecosystem will remain fragmented, with the US maintaining a dominant position in high-end AI development while China continues to innovate, leveraging alternative hardware, software, and strategic partnerships.  There’s a significant risk of escalation – a ‘yes’ outcome – driven by breakthroughs in Chinese AI technology or a reactive response from the US government, but this remains less likely than a prolonged continuation of the current dynamic.  A “no” outcome, involving a complete resolution or de-escalation, is highly improbable given the underlying strategic competition and the inherent tensions.  While the timeframe (approximately 365 days as of June 23, 2025) offers potential for change, the most likely scenario is a persistent, fluctuating equilibrium, with continued adjustments and countermeasures over the next few years. The overall probability of a significant shift remains moderate, hovering around 55-65%, reflecting the complexities of the geopolitical and technological landscape.
