The current geopolitical landscape is characterized by persistent great power competition, fragmented alliances, and ongoing global instability. Assuming no significant, unforeseen shifts occur, the most likely outcome is a continuation of the existing dynamic: a simmering, low-level trade war with intermittent high-profile disputes (Taiwan, South China Sea, technology competition) alongside a continued, though diminished, role for the US within international institutions. The status quo involves ongoing strategic competition between the US and China, coupled with a generally unstable global environment marked by localized crises and managed instability. A major, disruptive event – such as a significant escalation in the South China Sea, a cyberattack, or a pandemic – could introduce instability, but the most probable trajectory remains one of persistent tension and cautious maneuvering. The likelihood of a comprehensive global effort to address shared challenges, driven by a genuine shift in political priorities, appears low given the current trends. A return to a more fragmented and dangerous world order, characterized by protectionism and a breakdown of international norms, remains a significant possibility. The core risk is a gradual erosion of global cooperation, with the US increasingly prioritizing its own national interests and contributing to a less stable and predictable international system.
