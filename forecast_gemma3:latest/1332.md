Based on the rationales provided, a comprehensive rationale for assessing the likelihood of 90% reduction in global malaria mortality rates by 2030 is as follows:

The prospects for achieving a 90% reduction in global malaria mortality rates by 2030 are characterized by significant uncertainty and depend on a confluence of factors, primarily centered around sustained investment, innovative interventions, and a degree of good fortune. The current trajectory, as reflected in the reports, points towards incremental progress, but falls far short of the ambitious target. 

The most probable outcome remains a continuation of the existing, albeit slow, efforts. Current trends indicate a gradual decline in malaria incidence, largely driven by existing control measures, particularly insecticide-treated nets and artemisinin-based combination therapies. However, this decline is unevenly distributed, with Sub-Saharan Africa continuing to bear the brunt of the disease. Funding remains a persistent challenge, with donor commitments often failing to fully materialize, and competing global health priorities diverting resources. The status quo – characterized by continued, slow progress, incremental funding, and ongoing research – appears likely, with an estimated 30-40% reduction in malaria mortality since 2015 by 2030.

However, a ‘no’ outcome – effectively halting or reversing progress – is a significant risk. This could arise from a major global crisis, such as a novel, highly virulent pandemic, or a severe global economic downturn leading to drastic cuts in international aid. Alternatively, sustained conflict or instability in malaria-endemic regions would severely disrupt control efforts. 

A ‘yes’ outcome – achieving the 90% reduction – requires a dramatic shift in momentum. This hinges on several critical events aligning. Firstly, a breakthrough in malaria control – perhaps a dramatically improved vaccine with high efficacy and ease of administration, or a new, rapid diagnostic test – would be essential. Secondly, a significant increase in dedicated funding, driven by both public and philanthropic sources, is crucial. Finally, a coordinated, multi-sectoral approach, integrating malaria control with broader health and development initiatives, is necessary. The key element is that rapid response to information and the ability to quickly mobilize resources and interventions would be necessary. 

Considering all these factors, a realistic probability of achieving a 90% reduction in global malaria mortality rates by 2030 is estimated at 25-35%. While ambitious, it acknowledges the considerable challenges and the potential for unexpected disruptions, as well as recognizing that achieving significant impact requires a concerted, globally coordinated effort.
