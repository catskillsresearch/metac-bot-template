The European Union’s approach to artificial intelligence faces significant challenges in achieving a truly transformative and globally leading outcome. The most probable outcome, reflecting the combined insights of these forecasts, is a continuation of measured progress punctuated by setbacks and ongoing debate. The EU will likely remain a key player in shaping global AI governance, primarily through a cautious, risk-based approach, consistently adjusting its regulatory framework – particularly the AI Act – in response to evolving technological developments and economic realities. However, a complete “No” outcome – characterized by abandoning the AI Act or a global shift away from its principles – is considered less likely, given the EU’s stated commitment and growing international consensus on the need for responsible AI governance. 

Despite these efforts, significant obstacles remain. The EU’s ability to attract substantial investment, particularly compared to the US and China, will be a critical factor. Furthermore, the risk of a global economic downturn, geopolitical instability, or a disruptive technological breakthrough could easily derail the current trajectory. The EU's future success hinges on its ability to consistently adapt its strategy, foster international collaboration, and maintain a balance between promoting innovation and mitigating potential risks. The forecasts consistently suggest a predominantly cautious and iterative approach – a slow, managed evolution rather than a rapid, transformative shift. The likelihood of a truly “Yes” outcome – marked by the EU firmly establishing itself as a global leader in responsible AI – remains the most challenging and least probable, demanding a confluence of factors that, at present, appear uncertain.
