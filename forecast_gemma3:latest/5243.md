The current trend is characterized by cautious, incremental progress, frequently disrupted by the ongoing conflict in Gaza and Hamas's opposition. While the underlying dynamics—shifting geopolitical alignments, economic incentives, and US diplomacy—remain, the pace of normalization is exceedingly slow and unpredictable. The status quo, characterized by a limited number of Arab nations (primarily the Abraham Accords signatories) engaging with Israel, is likely to persist.  The conflict in Gaza continues to be a significant impediment, creating instability and fueling opposition to normalization.  Despite ongoing diplomatic efforts and the potential for economic benefits, the process remains fragile and uncertain.  The most likely scenario is a gradual, uneven progression, with only a handful of Arab states cautiously proceeding with normalization, primarily driven by the US and motivated by economic interests. The risk of a major escalation, further destabilizing the region and significantly delaying any progress toward normalization, remains high. The key factors influencing the outcome are the resolution of the conflict in Gaza and a change in the political calculations of Saudi Arabia, which appear unlikely in the short to medium term. Therefore, the probability of a significant increase in the number of Arab countries normalizing relations with Israel within the next 18-24 months remains low, around 6-8 countries. The overall assessment is cautious, reflecting the inherent instability and unpredictability of the region.
