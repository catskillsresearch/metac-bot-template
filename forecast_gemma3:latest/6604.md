Based on the provided rationale sections, a comprehensive and consistent forecast rationale emerges as follows:

The prediction of whether annual US inflation will reach 100% before 2050 hinges on a complex interplay of economic, geopolitical, and monetary factors.  The immediate timeframe, considering the data snippets are from February 2025, offers approximately six months of uncertain data.  The most likely near-term outcome, mirroring the dominant sentiment across forecasts, is a continuation of the current “status quo” – characterized by moderate inflation (around 2.5-3%), cautious monetary policy from the Federal Reserve, and volatile global market conditions, particularly regarding US trade policy and the Turkish economy (as reflected in the BIST 100). This status quo involves ongoing, albeit slow, US economic growth (1.5-2%) with the unemployment rate remaining steady. The dollar would remain relatively strong, and bond yields would gradually decline. 

However, the possibility of a “Yes” outcome – where inflation reaches 100% – is not negligible. This hinges on several key developments. First, a significant and sustained drop in US inflation, possibly driven by a decline in consumer demand or a sharper-than-anticipated easing of supply chain pressures, would be critical. Secondly, a more aggressive response from the Federal Reserve, leading to accelerated interest rate cuts, would be necessary.  Finally, improved investor confidence – perhaps fueled by a breakthrough in geopolitical tensions (like the Russia-Ukraine conflict) or a demonstrably successful economic reform program in Turkey – would be a crucial catalyst. 

Conversely, a “No” outcome – the complete derailment of the projected status quo – is predicated on a major, disruptive event. This could manifest as a global recession triggered by geopolitical instability, a catastrophic financial crisis, or a sharp deterioration in the Turkish economy (e.g., a collapse in oil prices or a currency crisis). Such an event would force a radical shift in monetary policy and significantly alter the economic landscape.

The probabilities, as indicated across the forecasts, converge on a roughly 65% likelihood of a "Yes" outcome, acknowledging the substantial uncertainty and acknowledging the significant, albeit not dominant, risk represented by the "No" scenario (35%).  The timeframe remaining – approximately six months of data – amplifies the inherent uncertainty surrounding the long-term prediction.
