Based on the rationales provided, a comprehensive and consistent rationale for the forecast is as follows:

The future of Polymarket in the United States by 2025 is characterized by ongoing regulatory pressure and a high probability of significant disruption, though a complete, definitive ban remains uncertain. The timeframe, approximately 6-12 months from June 2025, presents a period of intense scrutiny and potential legal challenges. While Polymarket has successfully navigated a grey area, operating under continuous regulatory pressure from bodies like the CFTC, a full and permanent shutdown appears increasingly likely.

The most probable scenario involves a decisive legal action by the CFTC, likely culminating in a permanent injunction against Polymarket based on demonstrable evidence of election interference or manipulation of financial markets. This scenario is supported by the escalating regulatory efforts observed in jurisdictions like Singapore and Thailand, combined with the inherent difficulties of operating a decentralized, cryptocurrency-based platform under existing US laws. A “No” outcome – a complete and permanent shutdown – carries a significant probability (around 65% based on the provided forecasts), driven by the CFTC’s aggressive stance and the potential for substantial legal ramifications.

However, the status quo – Polymarket continuing to operate, albeit under intense scrutiny and with reduced user base – also holds a substantial probability (around 65%). This reflects the platform's demonstrated ability to evade direct regulatory confrontation and the inherent complexities of pursuing legal action against a decentralized operation.  Furthermore, the ongoing investigations by the CFTC and potentially the broader trend of regulatory responses to prediction markets suggests the likelihood of a significant disruptive legal outcome.

Therefore, while a complete shutdown is the most probable outcome, the scenario of Polymarket operating under continued restrictions and intense regulatory scrutiny remains a significant possibility. The overall probability of a substantial negative impact on Polymarket’s operations within the next 6-12 months is high, primarily driven by the anticipated legal actions taken by the CFTC and broader regulatory responses.
