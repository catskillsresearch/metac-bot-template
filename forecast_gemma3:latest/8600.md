Given the rationales provided, here’s a consolidated rationale for the likelihood of FDA/EMA approval of oral semaglutide by 2027:

The probability of a widely available, FDA/EMA-approved oral semaglutide treatment by 2027 remains cautiously optimistic, but faces significant hurdles. Current estimates suggest a roughly 45-65% chance of a successful outcome. The primary obstacle lies in the inherent challenges of translating subcutaneous GLP-1 receptor agonists to an oral delivery method. The complexity of achieving sufficient bioavailability after first-pass metabolism represents a major hurdle for most formulations, including Rani Therapeutics’ RaniPill HC and Eli Lilly’s Orforglipron. Several companies, including Novo Nordisk with CagriSema, are pursuing this route, creating a competitive landscape that adds to the regulatory scrutiny.

Despite this, several factors suggest a non-negligible probability of success. The continued research and development efforts by multiple companies – Rani Therapeutics, Lilly, and Novo Nordisk – demonstrate a strong commitment to overcoming these challenges.  Furthermore, the growing global prevalence of obesity and the demonstrated efficacy of GLP-1 receptor agonists provide a strong market incentive for the development of convenient oral therapies. The potential for a breakthrough in oral delivery technology, particularly one that effectively bypasses the first-pass effect, could dramatically increase the odds.  However, the possibility of unforeseen safety issues, particularly concerning liver toxicity or novel adverse effects, remains a significant concern, as highlighted across multiple forecasts. The risk of regulatory agencies demanding extensive post-market surveillance and long-term safety data adds another layer of complexity and delay. The overall market dynamics—a competitive landscape dominated by established injectable therapies—also create a difficult environment for new entrants. While a rapid, widespread market launch by 2027 is unlikely, the probability of eventual approval, potentially within the next 3-5 years, remains reasonable given the ongoing research and the market's need for innovative obesity treatments.
