Based on the rationales provided, the most likely scenario for Ukraine’s trade regime in 2025 is one of a *limited and conditional extension*, punctuated by periods of fragility and significant uncertainty. The core of the extended regime would continue to prioritize agricultural exports, driven by immediate humanitarian needs and the ongoing conflict. However, the duration of the extension, the stringency of conditions imposed by the EU and US, and the overall stability of Ukraine’s political and economic environment remain highly susceptible to shifts in the conflict and global dynamics. The potential for a ‘No’ outcome—a complete termination of the regime—remains significant, linked to heightened conflict or a further deterioration in Ukraine's economic or political standing.  Ultimately, a successful, sustained extension hinges on a confluence of factors – relative stability, continued IMF support, and demonstrable progress on key reform priorities. A long-term outlook requires a considerable degree of good fortune as the situation remains fluid and heavily reliant on ongoing developments within Ukraine and the surrounding geopolitical landscape.
