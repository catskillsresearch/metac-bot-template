Based on the provided forecasts, here’s a consolidated rationale for the likelihood of Jair Bolsonaro being able to run for president by 2032:

The situation surrounding Jair Bolsonaro’s legal challenges and potential candidacy by 2032 remains highly uncertain, with a baseline probability hovering around 35%. The timeframe – approximately 7 years, 4 months, and 1 day – offers a significant window for further legal developments, shifts in political landscapes, and potential interventions. The most likely outcome, representing roughly 35% of the probability, is that Bolsonaro will continue to face legal difficulties and remain ineligible to run for president in 2032. This scenario hinges on the continuation of existing legal proceedings, Brazil’s established judicial system’s resistance to political interference, and the ongoing political headwinds against him. A key element of this scenario involves the persistence of the January 8th riots accusations and the legal challenges stemming from them.

However, several potential developments could shift the probability in either direction. A significant shift in public opinion, combined with a decisive ruling from the Supreme Court siding against Bolsonaro, is considered plausible and could accelerate the process. Conversely, a catastrophic legal misstep—such as the emergence of irrefutable evidence linking him directly to the planning of the riots—would significantly bolster the chances of him remaining eligible. 

Despite the considerable legal obstacles, there exists a non-negligible probability—approximately 35%—of a favorable shift. This hinges on a sympathetic ruling from the Supreme Court, potentially influenced by a shift in judicial sentiment or an acknowledgment of a perceived overreach in previous investigations.  Crucially, this outcome would be further strengthened by external interventions, most notably, a leveraging of influence by figures like Donald Trump, leading to congressional pressure and, possibly, amnesty legislation. Another, although still improbable, scenario involves a sympathetic new political figure emerging in Brazil capitalizing on the existing political divisions and successfully framing the establishment as corrupt. 

Ultimately, the situation is characterized by significant uncertainty, with the probability of Bolsonaro’s eligibility heavily dependent on a complex interplay of legal, political, and potentially external factors.
