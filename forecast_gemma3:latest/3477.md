Based on the rationales provided, a comprehensive rationale for the forecasting scenario can be constructed as follows:

The core prediction regarding the impact of human-level AI on global GDP growth within the next 15 years – a minimum of 30% – is highly uncertain. The available forecasts, despite their varying probabilities, consistently highlight a significant degree of variability and dependence on several key factors. The timeframe remaining (approximately 7-18 months, depending on the source) introduces considerable risk, acknowledging that substantial technological and economic shifts can occur within this period.

The most likely scenario, representing the status quo, involves a gradual, incremental adoption of AI, with incremental improvements to global GDP growth, ranging from 1.5% to 3.9% over the next five years, driven by technological advancements and continued investment. This scenario assumes a continuation of current trends, underpinned by the relatively cautious projections already present in the data.  However, this status quo is fragile and subject to disruption.

The most significant threats to this stable outlook lie in potential “No” outcomes – circumstances that dramatically alter the trajectory of AI development and its impact.  A major regulatory crackdown, triggered by widespread public apprehension regarding AI's potential risks (job displacement, bias, security concerns) would represent a significant barrier to growth, effectively neutralizing the optimistic projections. Similarly, a catastrophic technical failure – perhaps a fundamental flaw discovered in AGI development – could abruptly halt progress.  A global economic downturn, coupled with reduced investment, could also trigger a "No" outcome.

Conversely, a “Yes” outcome – a rapid, exponential acceleration of AI adoption driven by breakthroughs in AGI and supported by a favorable policy environment – is far less probable. This scenario necessitates a confluence of factors, including sustained technological advancements, proactive government policies that promote innovation and retraining, and a shift in public perception. The data suggests this outcome is contingent on achieving significant and unforeseen progress in areas like AGI development, quantum computing, or neuromorphic computing.  It requires a more radical transformation of the global economy than currently anticipated.

Given the inherent uncertainties, a moderately conservative assessment suggests a probability of around 60-65% that global GDP will grow by at least 30% within the subsequent 15 years, contingent upon the avoidance of significant disruptive events and the realization of favorable technological and policy conditions. The forecasting landscape is characterized by a significant degree of volatility, highlighting the complexities and potential risks associated with predicting the long-term impact of such a transformative technology.
