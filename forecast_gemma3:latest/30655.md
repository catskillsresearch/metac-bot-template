The most probable outcome in 2025 will be continued incremental progress in artificial intelligence, with no demonstrable achievement of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). The core technological hurdles – true reasoning, common-sense understanding, and adaptable learning – remain largely unresolved. While significant advancements will continue in specialized AI applications, like large language models and computer vision, a fundamental shift towards genuine general intelligence is unlikely. The field will be characterized by a steady stream of "AI hype" versus concrete, fundamentally new capabilities, and a continued focus on scaling up existing techniques rather than achieving a truly transformative breakthrough. Funding will likely remain skewed toward current AI trends, and warnings from experts like Stuart Russell regarding the need for conceptual breakthroughs will largely be dismissed. A potential “No” outcome is realized if a major global event drastically slows or halts AI development, or if a fundamental limitation in current AI approaches is discovered. The most plausible “Yes” scenario would involve a confluence of factors: a new algorithmic innovation, significantly increased computing power, and a change in the approach to AI research. However, this remains a low probability given the current trajectory of the field.  The status quo outcome, characterized by incremental progress and a lack of AGI, is the most likely.
