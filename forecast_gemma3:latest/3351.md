Given the rationale sections from the five forecasts, a comprehensive assessment of the likelihood of Guinea Worm Disease eradication by the end of 2025 suggests a complex and precarious situation. The most probable outcome hinges on a confluence of factors, with significant challenges threatening to stall progress.  The current trends—exceptionally low provisional cases, the Carter Center’s continued leadership, and the massive progress already achieved—indicate a high likelihood of continued, gradual reduction in cases. However, the potential for setbacks is substantial.  A key challenge lies in maintaining momentum amidst persistent logistical difficulties, socio-economic factors, and the inherent complexity of eradicating a disease from a small number of geographically isolated, resource-constrained endemic areas. 

The greatest threats to eradication stem from potential disruptions to the ongoing surveillance and intervention programs. Political instability and conflict in remaining endemic countries pose a significant risk, as do unforeseen humanitarian crises that could derail efforts to reach and treat affected communities. The emergence of drug-resistant strains of the parasite, or a reduction in funding for the eradication campaign, represent additional critical risks. 

Despite these formidable challenges, a “yes” outcome – complete eradication – remains possible, but would require an exceptionally sustained and coordinated global effort. This would necessitate strengthened surveillance, rapid response teams, continued funding, unwavering community engagement, and the immediate and complete deployment of resources to all remaining endemic areas. The final breakthrough would likely be triggered by a decisive intervention in a key remaining hotspot, effectively eliminating the last breeding sites of the parasite.  However, given the inherent uncertainties and the potential for unforeseen setbacks, the probability of complete eradication by the end of 2025 remains uncertain, leaning towards a continued, albeit slow, decline with a small number of ongoing cases.
