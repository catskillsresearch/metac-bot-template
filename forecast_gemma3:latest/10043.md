The most likely outcome hinges on a complex interplay of factors, primarily centered around the duration and intensity of the conflict with Russia, coupled with the EU’s continued commitment to enlargement. The current trajectory suggests a gradual, albeit protracted, process. Ukraine will likely continue to make demonstrable progress on reforms aligned with EU standards, particularly in areas such as rule of law, anti-corruption, and defense. However, the pace of this progress will be significantly hampered by the ongoing conflict, persistent economic challenges, and political hurdles within Ukraine itself. The EU will maintain a cautious, condition-based approach, offering gradual access to funds and deeper integration elements, but bureaucratic delays and disagreements among member states will prevent a rushed accession. By 2030, Ukraine may achieve a “technical readiness” for accession, but full membership remains improbable, likely settling around 40-50%. A prolonged and intensified conflict in eastern Ukraine, potentially escalating into a wider regional war, will dramatically alter the calculus, leading to a frozen conflict scenario. Alternatively, a significant shift in the EU’s geopolitical priorities – perhaps a major economic downturn in Europe, or a change in leadership – could lead to a reduction in support for Ukraine’s integration. A sustained period of relative stability in Ukraine, coupled with continued strong political will from both sides to accelerate the integration process, is the most favorable scenario, contingent on a successful resolution of the conflict in the east, a major reduction in corruption, and significant investment in Ukraine’s economy. However, this remains a challenging and largely uncertain prospect.
