Tom Tugendhat’s continued presence within the Conservative Party, specifically as a significant figure within its ranks, is subject to a complex interplay of factors. Over the next 18-24 months, the most probable outcome hinges on the stability of the Conservative government, the evolving geopolitical landscape, and Tugendhat’s own political trajectory.  A significant risk exists that an unforeseen event – be it a dramatic shift in public opinion regarding Chinese influence, a major security incident, or a change in Conservative leadership – could disrupt this stability and impact his position. However, the current state of affairs suggests a relatively stable status quo.  The Conservative Party, despite internal tensions and broader economic pressures, is currently pursuing a broadly hawkish stance on international security, particularly concerning China. Tugendhat’s consistent articulation of these views, combined with the ongoing need for expertise in this area, makes his continued role as a Shadow Security Minister reasonably likely.  The most immediate risk remains the possibility of a shift in Conservative leadership, which could trigger a reshuffle. Furthermore, a significant escalation in geopolitical tensions, or a damaging security incident, could swiftly alter the political calculus. Nevertheless, given the Conservative Party's current approach and Tugendhat’s established position, a sustained role within the party, particularly concerning security matters, is considered the most probable outcome.
