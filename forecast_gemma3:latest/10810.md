Okay, here's a consolidated rationale based on the provided forecasts, aiming for a consistent and comprehensive assessment:

**Consolidated Rationale:**

The assessment of whether Russia’s total territory will decrease by at least 20% before 2028 hinges on a complex interplay of economic and demographic factors, with the key interest rate being a central driver.  Based on the available news snippets and forecasts, a significant territorial reduction – meaning a continued, accelerated population decline – appears increasingly likely, though a precise probability remains difficult to pinpoint.

The prevailing scenario, represented by the majority of forecasts (4 forecasts at 35-45%), is one of continued stability, characterized by the Central Bank maintaining the 21% key interest rate. This reflects a cautious approach driven by high inflation, the ongoing natural population decline (approximately 20% year-over-year), and geopolitical uncertainties.  The combination of these factors presents a challenging environment for significant economic growth and, consequently, a counteracting influence on demographic trends. The “status quo” is considered the most probable outcome, with a persistent, albeit concerning, decline in population.

However, a “Yes” outcome – a territory decrease of at least 20% – requires a confluence of events that are currently considered unlikely. This would necessitate a substantial drop in inflation, ideally below 4%, coupled with a surprising rebound in economic growth. Simultaneously, a shift in the Central Bank's monetary policy, involving a reduction in the key interest rate (perhaps to 15-18%), would be critical to stimulate investment and consumer spending.  Furthermore, a positive shift in demographics – a stabilization or even modest increase in the birth rate – would be essential to offset the population decline.

The possibility of a “No” outcome – preventing the 20% reduction – is considered the least probable. This requires a dramatic and sustained improvement in the Russian economy, spurred by a geopolitical shift or a robust recovery, but the current trajectory strongly suggests a continuation of the challenges outlined in the forecasts.  The inherent constraints on the Russian economy, coupled with the demographic pressures, create a significant uphill battle for any major reversal.

Considering all the forecasts, a probability of 40-45% seems a reasonable estimate for the likelihood of Russia’s total territory decreasing by at least 20% before 2028, reflecting the continued pressures of population decline and the persistent challenges in the broader economic landscape.  It’s important to acknowledge the inherent uncertainty surrounding this assessment, particularly given the dynamic nature of geopolitical and economic conditions.

**Final Answer:**

Probability: 40%

### Probability: 35%
