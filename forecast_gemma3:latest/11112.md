Given the rationales provided, here’s a consolidated rationale for the likelihood of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan by 2035, incorporating the most compelling elements from each forecast:

The situation surrounding the potential for a Chinese invasion of Taiwan by 2035 remains fundamentally characterized by heightened tension and persistent risk. While a full-scale invasion is not the most probable outcome, the underlying conditions and dynamics strongly suggest a significant risk that warrants serious consideration. The most likely scenario involves a continued state of near-constant risk, with ongoing military posturing, carefully calibrated incursions, and diplomatic pressure from all sides. China will undoubtedly continue to build up its capabilities and conduct provocative exercises, while the US and its allies will maintain a strong deterrent presence, and Taiwan will bolster its own defenses.

Several factors contribute to this elevated risk. A “no” outcome – a successful avoidance of invasion – hinges on a fundamental shift in the global geopolitical landscape, a scenario characterized by instability and uncertainty. This could involve a major economic downturn impacting China, a peaceful resolution to the Russia-Ukraine war, a dramatic shift in US-China relations towards cooperation, or a significant internal political upheaval in China. However, these events are subject to considerable uncertainty.

Conversely, a “yes” outcome – a Chinese invasion – would likely unfold if China perceived a window of opportunity, bolstered by its continued economic growth and a demonstration of its military strength. A coordinated cyberattack, designed to disrupt Taiwan’s infrastructure, could serve as a catalyst, prompting an amphibious assault. Crucially, a perceived weakening of the US response and potential covert support from Russia would significantly increase the likelihood of such an action. 

The timeframe – approximately 1 year and 4 months remaining until June 23, 2027 – represents a period of heightened volatility. During this time, miscalculations, escalatory spirals, and the exploitation of vulnerabilities could dramatically increase the chance of a dangerous confrontation.  The risk of a “no” outcome is dependent on unpredictable external factors, while the probability of an invasion remains elevated due to China’s strategic ambitions, Taiwan's robust defenses, and the potential for misjudgment and escalation.

Therefore, considering all of this, the most probable path remains a continued state of heightened tension and risk.
