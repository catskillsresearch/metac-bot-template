The global outlook for Donald Trump’s net approval rating on November 2, 2026, is subject to considerable uncertainty, heavily influenced by the interplay of the Bitwise ETF approval, the Australian housing market’s trajectory, and broader macroeconomic conditions. The timeframe available—approximately 6-12 months—offers a reasonable observation period, though significant unforeseen events could dramatically alter the outcome. 

The most likely scenario assumes a moderate increase in global investment in alternative assets, with a particular focus on crypto and real estate. The Australian housing market will continue its upward trend, bolstered by falling construction costs and anticipated policy changes under a Trump administration. Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF inflows will remain positive, albeit subject to volatility.  The US regulatory environment would become more favorable for crypto, attracting substantial capital inflows. 

However, several factors could significantly impact this projection. A major global recession, triggered by a sharp decline in Chinese economic activity or a major geopolitical conflict, could rapidly reverse the current trend, leading to a collapse in asset prices and a substantial drop in investment.  Conversely, a technological breakthrough—such as a major advancement in renewable energy or a significant discovery in blockchain technology—could spark a massive investment boom, particularly in sectors aligned with the anticipated policy changes. 

Furthermore, the continued success of the Bitwise ETF approvals, combined with sustained Australian housing market growth, would likely contribute to a moderately positive outcome.  Experts and markets currently anticipate a ‘soft landing’ for the global economy, with a gradual easing of inflationary pressures and continued, albeit cautious, optimism.  The overall expectation is for a 55-78% chance of an outcome ranging from 38-72%, contingent on the continued stability of the Australian housing market, successful ETF inflows, and a relatively benign macroeconomic environment.  A key risk remains the potential for unexpected geopolitical events or regulatory shifts, which could quickly disrupt the expected trend and drive the outcome towards the lower end of this range, particularly if investment confidence declines.
