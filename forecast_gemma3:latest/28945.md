The current trend of H5N1 bird flu in humans suggests a gradual increase in confirmed cases, though the risk to the general public remains low. Based on available data up to February 2025, forecasts range widely. A conservative estimate projects approximately 250-300 cases by the end of 2025, assuming a steady, albeit slow, progression driven by continued exposure in farm environments. However, the inherent uncertainty of infectious disease dynamics introduces significant risk. A more aggressive scenario, fueled by potential viral mutations leading to increased human-to-human transmission, could result in 800-1200 cases by year-end. This risk is amplified by market expectations of volatility, driven by supply chain disruptions and concerns about food security. Experts and markets anticipate continued monitoring, heightened biosecurity measures, and potential interventions. 

Unforeseen events, such as a rapid development and deployment of a broadly effective vaccine, or the emergence of a highly virulent strain with enhanced transmissibility, could dramatically alter the trajectory. A low-outcome scenario could be realized through such breakthroughs, limiting transmission and minimizing cases. Conversely, a high-outcome scenario, characterized by a mutation enhancing transmissibility and a delayed response, could lead to a widespread pandemic. Given the complexities and uncertainties surrounding this situation, a range of 300-1200 confirmed cases by the end of 2025 represents a reasonable, albeit cautious, projection. Continuous monitoring of the situation and adaptive strategies will be critical to mitigating potential risks.
