Given the current trajectory of AI development, marked by continuous research into persuasive AI capabilities by major players like OpenAI, Google DeepMind, and Anthropic, alongside ongoing ethical debates and cautious regulatory responses, the most likely outcome is a gradual, incremental increase in the prevalence of AI-powered persuasion technologies. The risk remains relatively low, with most companies prioritizing performance and user engagement over explicitly manipulative techniques. However, a critical “No” outcome could materialize through unforeseen technical hurdles – such as the discovery that inherent biases in large datasets are impossible to fully eliminate – or a severe cybersecurity breach crippling AI systems. Alternatively, a global regulatory crackdown, triggered by a major incident of AI-driven manipulation, would halt significant advancements. Conversely, a “Yes” outcome – representing a genuinely transformative and safe integration of persuasive AI – would require a confluence of factors: a breakthrough in AI safety research, substantial investment in robust guardrails and verification mechanisms, establishment of clear ethical guidelines and regulatory frameworks, and a significant shift in public perception. This scenario hinges on the development of a new, widely adopted international standard for AI persuasion, supported by strong enforcement mechanisms and widespread public awareness.
