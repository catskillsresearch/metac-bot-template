The likelihood of a functional Alcubierre drive-like FTL device being demonstrated before 2100 is contingent upon a complex interplay of scientific breakthroughs, technological advancements, and sustained investment. The core challenges – generating and controlling negative energy densities, maintaining the stability of a warp bubble, and mitigating potential causality violations – remain formidable. However, a combination of factors could shift the probability towards a “Yes” outcome.

Firstly, a fundamental shift in our understanding of physics, perhaps stemming from a deeper exploration of quantum gravity or a novel interpretation of dark energy, could provide the necessary tools to manipulate spacetime. Secondly, significant progress in materials science, particularly the development of highly advanced metamaterials capable of generating and controlling extreme negative refractive indices, could be crucial.  Thirdly, sustained investment and international collaboration within the research community are essential to accelerate progress and pool resources.  A major technological leap, perhaps involving harnessing quantum entanglement in a controllable manner, would dramatically increase the probability.

Conversely, a “No” outcome is more likely if fundamental limitations are discovered – perhaps confirming insurmountable energy requirements, or revealing a previously unknown force law that prevents spacetime manipulation. A major, disruptive event, such as a catastrophic cyberattack crippling a key technological platform, or a significant setback in research due to a lack of funding, could similarly inhibit progress.  Ultimately, the likelihood is heavily dependent on the emergence of unexpected breakthroughs and the continued pursuit of this ambitious endeavor. A realistic assessment suggests that, considering the immense challenges and the relatively short timeframe, the probability of a demonstrably functional device by 2100 remains low, but not negligible.
