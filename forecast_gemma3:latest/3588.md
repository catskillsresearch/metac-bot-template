Based on the provided forecasts, the most likely scenario regarding Stacey Abrams's potential presidency by 2040 is one characterized by persistent political instability and competition. The timeframe until the 2028 election offers ample opportunity for significant shifts in the political landscape, both domestically and internationally. The most probable outcome hinges on a series of interconnected events. 

Firstly, the established political dynamics within the United States, particularly the ongoing competition for the Democratic nomination, are likely to continue, with figures such as Abrams, Buttigieg, and others vying for support. The existing divisions within the Democratic Party and the complexities of the US electoral system (the Electoral College) present ongoing challenges to any single candidate’s success. 

Secondly, a major, unforeseen global event – a significant geopolitical crisis or a large-scale humanitarian disaster – remains a critical factor. Such an event could disrupt the political cycle, forcing a shift in priorities and creating an opportunity for a candidate capable of offering a stable and reassuring response. The scenario of a delayed or cancelled election due to such a crisis is plausible, offering a reset to the political timeline. 

Thirdly, the possibility of a substantial scandal involving a leading Democratic candidate is a consistently highlighted risk. Such a scandal could fundamentally alter the race, creating an opening for an alternative candidate to emerge and capitalize on the resulting instability. 

Finally, while a direct, sustained trajectory towards the presidency for Abrams appears unlikely, the sheer length of the timeframe allows for a gradual, shifting landscape.  A consistent and demonstrable emergence of a strong candidate within the Democratic Party, coupled with the potential disruption of unforeseen events, provides the most realistic pathway for a positive outcome. This hinges on a complex interplay of factors including candidate performance, external shocks, and the ongoing evolution of the political environment. The inherent uncertainty, coupled with the extended timeframe, suggests a probability of around 60% of some form of positive outcome for Abrams by 2040.
