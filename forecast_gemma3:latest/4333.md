The global democracy index by the end of 2026 is likely to reflect a sustained period of decline, driven by factors such as economic inequality, technological disruption, and increasing political polarization. A core trend is the continued weakening of trust in democratic institutions, exacerbated by the rise of authoritarian tendencies and the increasing influence of disruptive technologies like AI. The expected overall score is around 40-45%. This decline is compounded by the potential for significant geopolitical instability and a shift towards protectionist policies. Experts and markets anticipate continued volatility, with increased risk aversion and speculation surrounding the impact of AI on political outcomes. A major, unforeseen event – a large-scale cyberattack or a devastating global crisis – could trigger a catastrophic collapse in public confidence, potentially driving the index to 33-38%. Conversely, a coordinated global effort to strengthen democratic norms and institutions, leveraging technological innovation and inclusive governance models, could lead to an unexpected reversal, pushing the index towards 60-65%, demonstrating resilience under pressure. However, the most probable outcome remains a continued downward trajectory, with the index hovering around 40-45%, reflecting a significant erosion of democratic governance globally.
