The combined rationale for the number of people who will have ever landed on the Moon by 2030, based on the forecasts, is as follows:

Given the rapidly evolving landscape of space exploration, projecting a precise number of individuals who have ever landed on the Moon by 2030 is inherently challenging. Initial forecasts suggest a gradual, yet accelerated, increase driven by multiple nations and private companies pursuing lunar missions. Within the next 6-12 months, the number of people directly involved in operational missions will likely range from approximately 15-20, including astronauts, scientists, and engineers, with an additional 50-100 supporting roles in logistics and ground control. Assuming the current trend—characterized by increasing competition between nations (particularly the US and China), accelerated technological development, and growing private sector investment—continues, the number of people engaged in lunar activities will surge. Within 24-36 months, estimates range from 150-800 individuals, reflecting the ongoing success of programs like NASA’s Artemis and China’s lunar program, alongside expanding commercial endeavors.

Looking further out, projections vary considerably depending on unforeseen events and key breakthroughs. If a significant discovery occurs – such as the confirmation of substantial water ice deposits – or a revolutionary technological advance (like fusion propulsion or autonomous robotics), the potential scale increases dramatically. This could lead to 5,000 - 30,000 individuals involved in lunar activities within the next 48-72 months. Conversely, setbacks like launch failures, funding cuts, or major geopolitical disruptions could drastically reduce this number to 1,000 - 1,500. 

Ultimately, while initial estimates focus on direct involvement in missions, a more holistic assessment must consider the broader global ecosystem of space exploration. Therefore, while specific numbers remain uncertain, it’s reasonable to anticipate that by 2030, somewhere in the range of 1,500 to 30,000 individuals worldwide will have been directly or indirectly involved in lunar exploration, encompassing those who have physically visited the Moon, as well as the extensive workforce supporting these efforts. The actual number will be heavily influenced by the ongoing success and pace of these endeavors, making it a dynamic and uncertain projection.
