The US is highly likely to maintain and potentially tighten restrictions on the total compute capacity of individuals and companies allowed to possess, before 2026. The prevailing rationale is driven by a confluence of factors: persistent geopolitical tensions, particularly between the US and China, coupled with sustained national security concerns regarding the potential misuse of advanced AI technologies. While a complete and immediate tightening is not guaranteed, the most probable scenario involves a continued, albeit potentially nuanced, enforcement of existing export controls. These controls primarily target China, Russia, and potentially other nations deemed a security risk. The US will likely monitor and adjust the list of restricted countries based on evolving threats and technological developments. A key element will be sustained monitoring and enforcement, aiming to shape the global AI landscape. The possibility of escalation, fueled by geopolitical instability or a significant technological breakthrough (either a Chinese advance or an alternative chip design), remains a significant wildcard, but the underlying trend points toward continued restrictions. Furthermore, the US will likely seek to collaborate with allies to reinforce these controls and ensure a coordinated global approach. The risks associated with unchecked AI development and potential misuse are deemed too significant to ignore, underpinning the ongoing strategy of controlling access to high-performance computing capabilities.
