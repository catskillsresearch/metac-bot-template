Given the inherent complexity of achieving sustained nuclear fusion, a plausible overall assessment is that China will not have commercially viable fusion power by 2050. The technological hurdles remain substantial, demanding breakthroughs in plasma confinement, material science, and energy extraction. While China’s aggressive investment and development efforts, including the “artificial sun” initiative, present a significant opportunity, a 40% probability reflects a cautious estimation acknowledging the historically long timelines and significant technical challenges associated with fusion research.  A major, unforeseen global economic recession combined with a sustained decrease in international investment could severely curtail China’s ambitious fusion program, dropping the probability to 20%. Conversely, a confluence of factors – including a revolutionary breakthrough in plasma confinement, sustained political and financial support, and a shift in global energy demand – could push the probability up to 35%. Therefore, a central estimate of 30% represents a realistic assessment of the likelihood of commercial fusion by 2050, recognizing the interplay of technical, economic, and geopolitical factors.
