## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The Chinese government has prioritized building a domestic AI chip supply chain, investing billions of dollars and aiming for global AI leadership by 2030[3].
- Despite these efforts, as of early 2024, Chinese firms such as Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent, and Xiaomi continue to rely heavily on Nvidia for high-performance AI chips. Nvidia sold one million H20 chips to China in 2024, underscoring its market dominance at the high end[2].
- Domestic chipmakers like Huawei have made notable progress. Huawei’s Ascend 910C is set for mass production in May 2025, with the even more advanced Ascend 920 (6nm) targeted for mass production in the latter half of 2025[5].
- The largest reported domestic order to date was Baidu’s 1,600-chip order from Huawei in late 2023—far below the 20,000-chip threshold set by this forecast[5].
- The Chinese semiconductor industry is expanding rapidly, with $179.5 billion in revenue in 2023 and a projected annual growth rate of 7.31% through 2027[1].

## 2. Recent Announcements and Policies

- U.S. export controls on advanced AI chips have tightened, increasing urgency for domestic alternatives[3].
- China has accelerated domestic investment, with a surge in semiconductor patent applications and continued government subsidies[5][4].
- Mass production timelines for advanced domestic chips (Ascend 910C and 920) suggest that large-scale availability will begin in the second half of 2025[5].
- Leading Chinese tech firms remain the most likely candidates for placing large domestic chip orders, especially as new chips become available and U.S. supply remains restricted.

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Any qualifying order would likely be reported by international outlets such as Reuters, the New York Times, or major industry analysts, as with prior Huawei chip order coverage[5].
- Chinese government and company filings, as well as patent and trade publications, provide supporting data on progress and orders.

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- Technical: Domestic chips have yet to match Nvidia’s performance, especially for the largest training runs, though the gap is narrowing[2][5].
- Market: It remains uncertain how quickly major Chinese firms will validate and adopt new domestic chips at scale, given legacy dependencies and risk aversion.
- Transparency: Some orders may be unpublicized or delayed in public reporting, introducing uncertainty in real-time measurement.
- Policy: Further U.S. restrictions or Chinese policy shifts could accelerate or hinder adoption, but exact impacts are hard to measure.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

- **Probability estimate:** Moderately high (60–75%) that a Chinese firm will place a qualifying (>20,000) domestic AI chip order before January 2027.
    - This is based on the convergence of government support, technical progress, impending mass production of advanced chips, and persistent external pressure from export controls.
    - The critical window is late 2025 through 2026, when new Huawei chips are expected to be available at scale and incumbent supply constraints may drive major Chinese firms to switch to domestic suppliers.

If major hurdles in quality or scale persist, or if incumbents can still supply enough performance at acceptable cost, adoption could be slower. However, all trends point toward a high likelihood of at least one large publicized order within the forecast window.
