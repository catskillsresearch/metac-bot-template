### Key Historical Trends & Current Status

- Argentina's YoY inflation peaked at 292% in April 2024, then fell to 117.8% in December 2024[5] and 66.9% by February 2025[4].
- Monthly inflation has slowed dramatically: from 25.5% MoM in December 2023 to 2.4–2.7% MoM by early 2025[4][5].
- The disinflation is driven by a combination of strict monetary policy and a managed exchange rate regime[2].

### Reference Cases & Forecasts

| Source              | Dec 2025 YoY Inflation Forecast |
|---------------------|---------------------------------|
| BBVA Research       | 30%[2]                          |
| Trading Economics   | 25% (2026)[1]                   |
| IMF (late 2024)     | 62.7% (annual 2025)[3]          |

- The most up-to-date private and market forecasts (BBVA, REM-BCRA) project YoY inflation around 30% by the end of 2025[2][5].
- Trading Economics' econometric model, which accounts for recent trends, projects continued moderation into 2026[1].
- The IMF's estimate, while authoritative, is likely outdated due to the pace of recent disinflation[3].

### Key Differences & Risks

- The pace of disinflation since late 2023 has been much faster than most forecasts anticipated, due in part to President Milei’s aggressive reforms.
- Structural risks remain, especially political backlash from subsidy cuts and rising poverty, which could disrupt the current policy stance[5].
- Argentina's historic inflation volatility means risks of reversal or external shocks (such as commodity price spikes or financial instability) remain material.

### Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

- Current trends and authoritative forecasts suggest YoY inflation near or just at the 30% mark by December 2025.
- Given the strong downward momentum and the fact that recent actuals have consistently beaten pessimistic projections, the probability that YoY inflation ends below 30% is plausible but not overwhelming—likely in the 40–60% range, reflecting both the positive trend and Argentina’s macroeconomic unpredictability.

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- INDEC Consumer Prices, "Anual Growth Rate (%)" for December 2025, will be the definitive source for resolution.
- Alternative credible sources include BBVA Research and Trading Economics projections, which align closely with INDEC methodology[1][2][5].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- Policy sustainability: Political and social pressures could force a pivot, risking renewed inflation.
- External shocks: Argentina is vulnerable to commodity price swings and capital flight.
- Forecast error: Past projections have both underestimated and overestimated Argentine inflation, underscoring the inherent uncertainty in this metric.
