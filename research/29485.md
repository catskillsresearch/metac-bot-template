# Forecasting California's Proposition 33 on Rent Control

Proposition 33 on California's November 5, 2024 ballot would repeal the Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act of 1995, which currently limits local governments' ability to implement rent control policies[1][4]. This analysis examines available data as of November 1, 2024, to help forecast the proposition's chances of passing.

## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

### Historical Context
The Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act of 1995 currently prohibits local ordinances from limiting initial residential rental rates for new tenants or rent increases for existing tenants in certain residential properties[4]. Specifically, it prevents local governments from controlling rent on single-family homes and properties built after 1995, among other restrictions[1].

### Previous Similar Measures
In 2020, California voters rejected Proposition 21, a similar rent control measure that would have authorized cities to enact rent control ordinances. That proposition received only 40.1% approval, indicating historical resistance to expanding rent control in the state.

### Current Polling
As of September 30, 2024, polling indicated that California voters had "mixed" feelings on expanding rent control[3]. This suggests that public opinion remains divided on the issue, without a clear majority supporting the proposition.

## Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Measure

### Campaign Financing
As of October 29, 2024, Proposition 33 and the related Proposition 34 were attracting the most campaign cash by far among the 10 ballot measures on the November ballot[2]. This high level of financial interest from both supporters and opponents indicates the contentious nature of the proposition and the significant economic interests at stake.

### Official Ballot Information
The official voter guide provides the following information about Proposition 33:

**Fiscal Impact**: Reduction in local property tax revenues of at least tens of millions of dollars annually due to likely expansion of rent control in some communities[4].

**Supporters** include:
- California Nurses Association
- California Alliance for Retired Americans
- Mental Health Advocacy
- Coalition for Economic Survival
- Tenants Together[4]

**Opponents** include:
- California Council for Affordable Housing
- Women Veterans Alliance
- California Chamber of Commerce[4]

The "Pro" argument states: "The rent is too damn high. One million people have left California. Rent control in America has worked to keep people in their homes since 1919. California's 17 million renters need relief. Homeowners and taxpayers benefit from stable communities. The California dream is dying. You can help save it."[4]

The "Con" argument states: "Don't be fooled by the latest corporate landlord anti-housing scheme. California voters have rejected this radical proposal twice before, because it would freeze the construction of new housing and could effectively reverse dozens of new state housing laws. Vote No on 33 to protect new affordable housing and California homeowners."[4]

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

The California Secretary of State's official voter guide provides authoritative information about Proposition 33, including its text, fiscal impact analysis, and arguments for and against[4].

CalMatters, a nonprofit, nonpartisan newsroom, has published fact checks and analysis of Proposition 33 and its potential impacts[1][2].

## Limitations and Uncertainties in Measurement

### Polling Limitations
The available polling data as of September 30, 2024, only indicated "mixed" feelings among voters without providing specific percentages[3]. This vague characterization makes it difficult to precisely gauge voter sentiment.

### Historical Comparison Challenges
While the rejection of Proposition 21 in 2020 provides some historical context, changing economic conditions and housing market dynamics since then may have shifted voter priorities and preferences.

### Campaign Influence
The significant campaign spending on both sides of Proposition 33[2] creates uncertainty about how effective messaging might sway undecided voters in the final days before the election.

### Voter Turnout Variables
The proposition's fate will depend not only on overall voter sentiment but also on which demographic groups turn out to vote, as different populations may have varying views on rent control based on whether they are renters or property owners.
