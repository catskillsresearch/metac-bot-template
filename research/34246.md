# Forecasting Russian Control of Chasiv Yar by February 28, 2025

Based on information available as of January 2025, I'll analyze the current situation in Chasiv Yar and factors relevant to forecasting Russian control by February 28, 2025.

## Current Status of Chasiv Yar (January 2025)

As of late January 2025, Chasiv Yar remains contested with active fighting ongoing. Russian forces have made several advances in the area while Ukrainian forces have attempted to hold their positions and occasionally recapture lost ground.

Key developments in January 2025:

- Russian forces conducted continuous offensive operations within and near Chasiv Yar throughout early January[1][2]
- By January 21, 2025, geolocated footage confirmed Russian advances within central Chasiv Yar[3]
- Elements of the "Shustry" Detachment of Chechen Akhmat Spetsnaz were operating south of Chasiv Yar, indicating recent Russian advances in that area[3]
- Ukrainian forces recaptured some previously lost positions near Chasiv Yar around January 19, 2025[5]

## Strategic Importance and Battle Dynamics

Chasiv Yar holds significant strategic value:

- It serves as a military hub in eastern Donetsk region and would be "a major prize for Russia's military"[4]
- Its capture would give Russia proximity to larger Ukrainian military bases in Kostyantynivka and Kramatorsk[4]
- The town has been under attack since 2022, with most buildings now largely destroyed[4]

## Russian Tactics and Progress

Russian forces are employing specific tactics in their Chasiv Yar offensive:

- Using "small assault groups of three to eight people," described by Ukrainian military spokesman Dmytro Zaporozhets as an "effective" approach[4]
- Leveraging poor weather conditions with limited visibility to accumulate forces in northern Chasiv Yar[3]
- Focusing assault efforts on the Refractory Plant in central Chasiv Yar[3]
- Russian milbloggers claimed (though unconfirmed by ISW as of January 21) that Russian forces had cleared the Refractory Plant and advanced in northwestern and southwestern parts of Chasiv Yar[3]

## Ukrainian Defense Situation

The Ukrainian position in Chasiv Yar faces several challenges:

- As of January 22, 2025, only 229 civilians remained in the town (down from a pre-war population of 12,000)[4]
- Ukrainian military administration can no longer organize shelters or distribute food to remaining residents due to "active hostilities" and Russian drone usage[4]
- Ukrainian forces still controlled the former brick factory as of January 22, though Russian troops were "moving in the direction of the factory"[4]
- Russian forces' small group tactics are described as "harder to control" for Ukrainian defenders[4]

## Military Units Involved

Several specific Russian military units have been identified operating in the Chasiv Yar area:

- Elements of the Russian 299th Airborne Regiment (98th VDV Division)[3]
- "Hispaniola" Volunteer Brigade (Russian Volunteer Corps)[3]
- Drone operators from the Russian 7th Military Base (49th Combined Arms Army, Southern Military District)[2]
- Elements of the Russian 200th Motorized Rifle Brigade operating near Orikhovo-Vasylivka (northeast of Chasiv Yar)[3]

## Assessment and Uncertainties

Based on the January 2025 information, several factors are relevant to forecasting Russian control by February 28:

1. **Momentum**: Russian forces demonstrated consistent offensive pressure and achieved confirmed advances in central Chasiv Yar by January 21, 2025[3]

2. **Tactical Advantages**: Russian small-group tactics were described as "effective" by Ukrainian sources[4]

3. **Ukrainian Counteractions**: Ukrainian forces demonstrated capability to recapture some positions, as evidenced by January 19 reports[5]

4. **Key Terrain**: The battle appears to focus on central locations like the Refractory Plant, which could be decisive for control of the town[3]

5. **Uncertainties**: Weather conditions, potential reinforcements, and changes in tactics could all influence the outcome in the approximately 5-week period between the latest information and February 28

The situation remains fluid, with both sides demonstrating capability to make tactical gains. However, the confirmed Russian advances in central Chasiv Yar by January 21 and the effectiveness of their small-group tactics suggest momentum in Russia's favor as of the latest available information.
