### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The 2024 World Chess Championship match between Ding Liren and Gukesh D is scheduled as a best-of-14 classical games, with the first to 7.5 points declared champion. If tied after 14 games, tiebreaks will be played[4].
- At the elite level, classical chess matches are characterized by a high draw rate. Recent world championship matches, including Ding Liren's 2023 victory, have typically been decided in the final games or even in tiebreaks, reflecting the difficulty of achieving a decisive score early[1][5].
- Both Ding Liren and Gukesh D are known for their solid, resilient styles. Ding is famous for his 100-game unbeaten streak and defensive prowess, while Gukesh, despite his youth and aggressive play, has shown the ability to hold draws under pressure[1][3].
- As of November 1, 2024, Gukesh D is ranked #3 in the world with a peak rating of 2794, while Ding Liren, though ranked 23rd, has a long history in the top 5 and a peak rating of 2816[2][5].

### Recent Announcements and Policies

- There have been no recent changes to the match format or scoring system. The standard rules apply: 1 point for a win, 0.5 for a draw, and the first to 7.5 points wins the title[4].
- No indications of health, disciplinary, or organizational issues that might lead to a forfeit or disqualification for either player have been reported as of November 1, 2024.

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- FIDE's official championship site and major chess databases (Chess.com, 2700chess.com, 365chess.com) provide up-to-date results and player statistics[1][2][4][5].
- ESPN and other sports media offer previews and analysis of the match and player form[3].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- Chess at this level is unpredictable, and while history suggests a low probability of an early decision, a string of decisive games or an unforeseen event (e.g., illness, forfeit) could alter the outcome.
- The only scenario outside of normal play that could resolve the match before game 11 is a forfeit or disqualification, which is extremely rare and not currently anticipated.

### Summary Table: Recent World Championship Match Lengths

| Year | Champion         | Decided in Game | Number of Classical Games |
|------|------------------|-----------------|--------------------------|
| 2023 | Ding Liren       | 14 (tiebreaks)  | 14                       |
| 2021 | Magnus Carlsen   | 11              | 11                       |
| 2018 | Magnus Carlsen   | 12 (tiebreaks)  | 12                       |

Given the high draw rates and the competitive parity between Ding Liren and Gukesh D, it is historically unlikely that the 2024 World Chess Champion will be decided in the first 10 games.
