# Forecasting Hartford, CT Home Price Increases for November 2024

Based on available data as of November 2024, here's an analysis of factors relevant to predicting whether Hartford, CT will see a year-over-year home price increase of ≥7.0% in November 2024 according to Zillow's Home Value Index.

## Current Housing Market Trends in Connecticut

The Connecticut housing market has shown significant growth in 2024, with the average home value reaching $410,357 statewide, representing an 8.6% year-over-year increase according to Zillow data from October 2024[2]. The market has remained competitive in many Connecticut towns, with homes often selling quickly and above listing price in areas like Danbury and Norwalk[2].

For Hartford specifically, projections indicate home price increases of up to 3.9% by August 2025[2]. This forecast suggests that Hartford's growth rate may be more moderate than the statewide average, potentially falling below the 7.0% threshold specified in the question.

## Recent Market Indicators

Zillow's October 2024 market report provides several indicators that may influence Hartford's housing prices:

- New listings decreased by 1.6% month over month in October 2024[1]
- Total inventory remained relatively stable, decreasing only 0.05% from September to October 2024[1]
- Inventory levels were 18.5% higher in October 2024 compared to October 2023[1]
- 24.8% of listings in October had price cuts, similar to the 25% in September[1]
- Median days to pending increased to 23 days in October, up two days from September and seven days from the previous year[1]

These trends suggest a gradual cooling of the market nationwide, with increased inventory and longer selling times potentially putting downward pressure on price growth.

## National Housing Market Forecast

As of August 2024, Zillow forecasted that home values would rise just 1% nationally through June 2025[4]. This modest growth projection at the national level aligns with the more specific forecast for Hartford, suggesting that dramatic price increases are not widely expected in the near term.

The market has been described as being in "neutral, balanced territory" but "creeping closer to becoming a buyers market" as of November 2024[1]. This shift in market dynamics could further moderate price growth in cities like Hartford.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors create uncertainty in forecasting Hartford's specific year-over-year price growth:

1. The available data provides projections through August 2025 for Hartford (at 3.9%), but doesn't specifically address November 2024[2].

2. While Connecticut as a whole saw 8.6% year-over-year growth, individual cities can vary significantly from the state average[2].

3. According to Redfin data from August 2024, the median home price throughout Connecticut increased by 8.0% from the previous year to $460,200, indicating strong statewide growth[2]. However, this doesn't guarantee similar growth rates for Hartford specifically.

4. Seasonal factors affect the housing market, with October and early November typically experiencing a seasonal slowdown with fewer new listings[4].

## Conclusion

Based on the available data, it appears unlikely that Hartford, CT will see a year-over-year home price increase of ≥7.0% in November 2024 according to Zillow. The most specific projection indicates Hartford could see increases of up to 3.9% by August 2025[2], which is significantly below the 7.0% threshold. Additionally, the national forecast of just 1% growth through June 2025[4] and the market's shift toward buyer-friendly conditions[1] further suggest moderate rather than dramatic price growth for Hartford.

However, it's important to note that specific data for Hartford's November 2024 year-over-year growth was not directly available in the search results, creating some uncertainty in this forecast.
