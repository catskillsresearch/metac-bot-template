# Syrian Refugee Population Forecast for Jordan: July 1, 2025

As of May 2025, I'm analyzing the projected number of registered Syrian refugees in Jordan for July 1, 2025, based on current UNHCR data and recent developments.

## Current Situation

According to UNHCR, approximately 654,000 Syrian refugees are currently registered in Jordan[4]. This population is distributed across different governorates, with the most recent data from April 30, 2025, showing significant concentrations in:

- Amman Governorate: 163,385 (29.9% of the total)[2]
- Mafraq Governorate: 140,600 (25.7% of the total)[2]

Jordan remains one of the countries with the highest refugee population per capita, hosting a total of approximately 730,000 refugees of all nationalities[4].

## Key Factors Affecting the Forecast

### Political Changes in Syria

The fall of the Assad government in December 2024 has created a new dynamic for Syrian refugees in Jordan[1][5]. This significant political change has prompted some refugees to consider returning to Syria, though reactions have been mixed:

- Many refugees have expressed hope about the prospect of returning to their homes, but with caution[1]
- UNHCR has observed increased interest in voluntary returns and has scaled up transportation assistance in response[5]

### Refugee Intentions

Despite political changes in Syria, feedback from refugees indicates that the majority do not intend to return to Syria in 2025[1][5]. This reluctance is driven by:

- Ongoing uncertainty in Syria despite the regime change[1]
- High vulnerability rates among refugees in Jordan, with 67% falling below the poverty line[1]
- 90% of refugees resorting to debt to cover basic needs such as rent, food, and medicine[1]

### UNHCR Policies

UNHCR's approach to the situation is balanced:

- The agency is not promoting large-scale returns to Syria[1][5]
- However, UNHCR is supporting refugees who make informed decisions to return voluntarily[1]
- Simultaneously, UNHCR continues to maintain protection and lifesaving assistance for refugees remaining in Jordan[1]

## Forecast Analysis

Based on the available data, I project that the number of registered Syrian refugees in Jordan on July 1, 2025, will likely be between 620,000 and 645,000.

This forecast considers:

1. The current baseline of approximately 654,000 registered Syrian refugees[4]
2. The increased rate of voluntary returns following the fall of the Assad government[1][5]
3. The stated intention of the majority of refugees to remain in Jordan throughout 2025[1]
4. The relatively short timeframe between the latest data and the forecast date (approximately 2 months)

### Uncertainty Factors

Several factors create uncertainty in this forecast:

- Lack of precise data on the current rate of refugee returns since the Assad government's fall
- Potential changes in the security situation in Syria between now and July 1
- Possible policy changes by the Jordanian government or UNHCR
- The reliability of self-reported intentions by refugees regarding their plans to return

## Verification Sources

The most authoritative source for verification will be the UNHCR Operational Data Portal for Jordan, specifically the Syria Regional Refugee Response section that tracks registered refugee populations by location[2]. This is the same source specified in the resolution criteria and provides regular updates on refugee numbers.

UNHCR also publishes regular statistical reports on registered refugees and asylum-seekers in Jordan, with the most recent available report dated March 23, 2025[3].
