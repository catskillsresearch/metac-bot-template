## Forecast: Will a Senolytic Therapy Be Approved by the US FDA Before January 1, 2025?

### 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- **Senolytic agents** (notably dasatinib and quercetin) have demonstrated the ability to selectively eliminate senescent cells in preclinical and early clinical studies, with the hope of improving healthspan and treating age-related diseases[1][3].
- **Dasatinib** is FDA-approved for certain leukemias, but not as a senolytic. **Quercetin** is available as a supplement, not as an FDA-approved drug for any indication[1][3].
- The **combination of dasatinib and quercetin (D+Q)** has been tested in small, early-phase clinical trials for conditions such as Alzheimer's disease. These studies have shown safety and some positive biomarker trends, but are not sufficient for regulatory approval as a new therapy[1][2][3].
- As of October 21, 2024, **no senolytic therapy is listed as FDA-approved for commercial sale** for the purpose of selectively removing senescent cells[4].

### 2. Recent Announcements and Policies

- There have been **no FDA announcements or press releases** indicating the approval of any senolytic therapy for commercial sale as of the knowledge cutoff date.
- The **Alzheimer's disease drug development pipeline for 2024** does not include any senolytic therapy at the FDA approval stage; most are still in early clinical phases[4].
- **Ongoing clinical trials** for senolytic therapies are in phase 1 or early phase 2, and no phase 3 results or new drug applications (NDAs) have been submitted for FDA review as a senolytic therapy[1][2][4].

### 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Peer-reviewed articles and clinical trial registries confirm the current status of senolytic drug development and lack of FDA approval[1][2][3][4].

### 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- The FDA approval process can be unpredictable, but typically requires successful completion of phase 3 trials, which take several years.
- No evidence suggests any senolytic therapy has accelerated regulatory status or is on track for approval before January 1, 2025.

### Conclusion

**Based on all available information as of October 21, 2024, it is highly unlikely that a senolytic therapy will be approved for commercial sale by the US FDA before January 1, 2025. No such approval has been granted, and no candidate is sufficiently advanced in the regulatory process to expect approval within this timeframe.**
