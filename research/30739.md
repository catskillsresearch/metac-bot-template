# November 2024 Global Temperature Anomaly Forecast Analysis

Based on available data as of December 4, 2024, I can provide the following analysis regarding whether November 2024's global temperature anomaly will fall between 1.25°C and 1.31°C.

## Current Status and Recent Measurements

According to NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI), the November 2024 global surface temperature was 1.34°C (2.41°F) above the 20th-century average of 12.9°C (55.2°F), making it the second-warmest November on record[1]. This measurement is outside the specified range of 1.25°C to 1.31°C, being 0.03°C higher than the upper bound.

## Regional Temperature Patterns

Temperature patterns across the United States in November 2024 showed significant warming trends:

- 166 out of 191 analyzed U.S. cities experienced warmer-than-normal temperatures[5]
- 15 cities, including all 5 cities in Louisiana, recorded their hottest November on record[5]
- An additional 38 cities experienced one of their top 5 hottest Novembers[5]
- The average temperature anomaly across all analyzed cities was 3.7°F above normal[5]
- The highest temperature anomalies stretched from the Rocky Mountains eastward[5]

The U.S. Climate Prediction Center's outlook for November 2024, released on October 31, had correctly anticipated well-above-average temperatures across the central and eastern parts of the nation[2].

## Climate Factors Influencing November 2024

Several climate factors influenced global temperatures in November 2024:

1. **ENSO Conditions**: As of mid-November 2024, forecasters were still anticipating La Niña development to last through winter, though it was developing later than typical historical patterns[4]. Only two La Niñas in the 75-year historical record had formed in October-December[4]. Computer models had predicted a weak La Niña, with Niño-3.4 anomalies between -0.9°C and -0.5°C[4].

2. **Climate Change Impact**: Climate Central's Climate Shift Index tool indicated that 182 out of 191 weather stations analyzed had positive temperature trends for November, suggesting a significant climate change influence on the month's temperatures[5].

## Measurement Considerations

NOAA's temperature anomaly measurements represent departures from the 20th-century average (1901-2000). A positive anomaly indicates that observed temperatures were warmer than this reference value[1]. The Global Land and Ocean Average Temperature Anomaly is calculated using comprehensive global data collection systems maintained by NOAA's NCEI.

## Conclusion

Based on the available data, November 2024's global temperature anomaly of 1.34°C exceeds the specified range of 1.25°C to 1.31°C. This continues the trend of elevated global temperatures observed throughout 2024, with November being recorded as the second-warmest November in the historical record.
