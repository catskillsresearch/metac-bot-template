## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- September is historically the most active month for Atlantic hurricanes, with the highest likelihood for major hurricanes (Category 3 or higher) to form during this period[1][2].
- The 2024 Atlantic hurricane season has been forecast as above-normal or extremely active by multiple agencies, driven by the expected development of La Niña conditions and record-warm Atlantic sea surface temperatures, both of which favor hurricane formation and intensification[1][3].

## 2024 Season Forecasts

- **NOAA** (May 2024): Predicts 17–25 named storms, 8–13 hurricanes, and 4–7 major hurricanes for the entire 2024 season, citing La Niña and warmer-than-average ocean temperatures as key factors[1].
- **Tropical Storm Risk (TSR)**: Forecasts 20 tropical storms, 9 hurricanes, and 4 major hurricanes for 2024, with activity potentially 30% above the recent average[3].
- **AccuWeather** (September 3, 2024): Revised its forecast to 16–20 named storms, 6–10 hurricanes, and 3–6 major hurricanes for the season[5].
- These forecasts indicate a strong likelihood of multiple major hurricanes during the season, with September being the most probable month for such events.

## Recent Announcements and Observations

- As of early September 2024, the Atlantic basin experienced an unusually quiet start to the month, with no named storms during the Labor Day weekend[5].
- No major hurricanes had been reported in September 2024 up to the knowledge cutoff date.
- Seasonal forecasts cannot predict the exact timing of major hurricanes, but the combination of favorable atmospheric and oceanic conditions suggests a heightened risk for major hurricanes in September[1][3].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The National Hurricane Center (NHC) provides real-time storm tracking, advisories, and post-season reports, which are the definitive sources for confirming the occurrence and classification of major hurricanes[4].
- The NHC’s Tropical Cyclone Advisory Archive and Monthly Atlantic Tropical Weather Summary will provide the official record for September 2024.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- Seasonal and monthly forecasts indicate risk but cannot guarantee the occurrence or timing of major hurricanes in a specific month.
- Real-time confirmation depends on NHC advisories and post-storm analysis, which may be updated after the fact.
- As of September 12, 2024, no major hurricanes had occurred in September, but the peak of the season continues through the month, and conditions remain favorable for rapid storm development.

## Summary

- All major forecasting agencies agree that the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season is likely to be above average, with a high probability of multiple major hurricanes.
- September remains the most likely month for major hurricanes, but as of September 12, 2024, none had occurred in the month.
- The risk remains elevated for the remainder of September, and authoritative confirmation will depend on NHC reports published by October 1, 2024.
