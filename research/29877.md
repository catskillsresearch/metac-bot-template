# Will the Progressive Party Lead Iceland After the 2024 Elections?

The upcoming parliamentary elections in Iceland, scheduled for November 30, 2024, follow the collapse of the three-party coalition government that had been in power since 2021[3][4]. To assess whether the Progressive Party might secure the Prime Minister position after these elections, we need to examine several key factors.

## Current Political Landscape

Iceland's recent government coalition consisted of three parties:

1. The Independence Party (led by Bjarni Benediktsson, the current Prime Minister)
2. The Progressive Party 
3. The Left-Green Movement

This coalition dissolved on October 13, 2024, when Prime Minister Benediktsson announced its collapse due to growing disagreements between the three political parties[3]. The specific points of contention included "policy regarding asylum seekers," "vision for the future of energy efficiency," and other policy matters where the coalition partners could not find common ground[3][4].

Benediktsson, who became Prime Minister in April 2024 after Katrin Jakobsdottir resigned to run for the presidency, specifically highlighted how different the Left-Green Movement's vision was compared to his own[4]. This suggests significant ideological differences had developed within the coalition.

## Previous Electoral Performance

In the last parliamentary election (2021), the Independence Party secured the largest share with 16 of the 63 seats in the Althingi (Icelandic Parliament), while the Progressive Party won 13 seats[1][5]. The voter turnout in that election was approximately 80%[1].

Looking at more recent electoral indicators, the Progressive Party showed significant momentum in the 2022 municipal elections, gaining 23 seats compared to previous municipal elections[5]. This positive trend could potentially translate to increased parliamentary representation in the upcoming election.

## Historical Precedents

Iceland has a history of coalition governments where the Prime Minister position doesn't necessarily go to the largest party. A notable example occurred after the 2017 elections when, despite the Independence Party winning the most seats, Katrín Jakobsdóttir of the Left-Green Movement became Prime Minister. This precedent demonstrates that coalition negotiations can lead to unexpected leadership arrangements.

The Prime Minister in Iceland is traditionally "the leader of the largest party or coalition in the Parliament"[1]. However, as history has shown, this can involve complex negotiations where smaller parties may secure the premiership as part of coalition agreements.

## Factors Favoring the Progressive Party

Several factors could potentially support a Progressive Party Prime Minister:

1. **Recent Electoral Momentum**: Their strong performance in the 2022 municipal elections (+23 seats) suggests growing popular support[5].

2. **Centrist Position**: As a center party, the Progressive Party might be better positioned to form coalitions with either left or right-leaning parties, potentially making them a compromise candidate for Prime Minister.

3. **Coalition Flexibility**: If neither the Independence Party nor left-wing parties secure enough seats to form a government independently, the Progressive Party could leverage its position as a necessary coalition partner.

## Challenges for the Progressive Party

Despite these potential advantages, several obstacles exist:

1. **Current Seat Deficit**: The Progressive Party held fewer seats (13) than the Independence Party (16) after the 2021 elections[1], meaning they would need to significantly improve their performance to become the largest party.

2. **Established Leadership Patterns**: The Independence Party has traditionally been Iceland's dominant political force and may be reluctant to cede the premiership.

3. **Electoral Uncertainty**: The collapse of the coalition introduces unpredictability into the electoral landscape, making outcomes difficult to forecast.

## Conclusion

Based on the available information, the Progressive Party has a plausible but uncertain path to securing the Prime Minister position after the November 2024 elections. Their recent electoral momentum in municipal elections is promising, but they would likely need to either:

1. Significantly outperform their 2021 results to become the largest party, or
2. Serve as a crucial coalition partner with enough leverage to negotiate the premiership

The outcome will ultimately depend on both electoral results and subsequent coalition negotiations. Given Iceland's history of coalition governments where smaller parties have sometimes secured the premiership, the possibility cannot be ruled out, but it remains contingent on multiple political factors that will only become clear after the November 30 elections.
