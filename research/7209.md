# Forecast Analysis: US Bitcoin Possession Criminalization Before 2060

As of May 17, 2021, I'll analyze the likelihood of anyone being convicted in the US for the mere possession of Bitcoin before 2060.

## Current Legal Status of Bitcoin in the United States

As of 2021, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies exist in a complex regulatory landscape in the United States, with no federal law explicitly criminalizing the mere possession of Bitcoin. At the federal level, cryptocurrency is treated variously as:

- Property (by the IRS)
- A commodity (by the CFTC)
- Potentially a security in some contexts (by the SEC)[4]

The legality of cryptocurrency varies significantly at the state level:

- New York implemented the BitLicense regulatory framework requiring businesses dealing with virtual currencies to obtain licenses
- Vermont passed legislation (HB 868) recognizing blockchain records as admissible in court
- Washington includes virtual currency in its money transmission regulations (SB 5031)
- Ohio has no clear stance on cryptocurrencies generally, but prohibits purchasing alcohol with Bitcoin[4]

Importantly, as of May 2021, **no US state or federal law criminalizes the mere possession of Bitcoin**. Current regulations focus on:

1. Businesses providing cryptocurrency services
2. Anti-money laundering compliance
3. Tax reporting requirements
4. Consumer protection

## Emerging Regulatory Trends

Recent regulatory signals suggest increasing oversight but not criminalization of possession:

The US Treasury has proposed regulations that would:
- Require verification of crypto wallet owners' identities
- Mandate suspicious activity reports (SARs)
- Require non-registered financial institutions or wallet owners to identify themselves for transactions exceeding $3,000
- Submit identity information to the Treasury Department for transactions exceeding $10,000[4]

These measures focus on transaction reporting and KYC (Know Your Customer) requirements rather than prohibiting possession.

As of December 2021, 33 states and Puerto Rico had pending cryptocurrency legislation, and 17 states had enacted legislation or adopted resolutions related to cryptocurrency[3]. This indicates active regulatory development, though primarily focused on defining legal frameworks rather than prohibition.

## Comparative Analysis with Similar Assets

Historical precedent for asset prohibition in the US provides context:

1. **Gold Prohibition (1933-1974)**: Executive Order 6102 criminalized gold hoarding, providing a precedent for government action against private ownership of alternative stores of value.

2. **Cash Reporting Requirements**: Large cash transactions require reporting but possession itself is not criminalized.

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on information available as of May 17, 2021, I assess the probability of Bitcoin possession being criminalized before 2060 as **low to moderate** (approximately 15-25%) for the following reasons:

1. **Current Regulatory Trajectory**: Current regulations focus on compliance, reporting, and consumer protection rather than prohibition.

2. **Established Adoption**: Bitcoin has achieved significant institutional adoption by 2021, making outright criminalization more disruptive and politically challenging.

3. **Constitutional Considerations**: Criminalizing mere possession would face significant legal challenges under property rights protections.

4. **Long Timeframe**: The 39-year timeframe until 2060 allows for significant policy shifts, particularly if:
   - National security concerns around cryptocurrency increase
   - Monetary sovereignty concerns intensify
   - Financial stability issues emerge
   - Environmental impacts of mining become more severe

## Key Uncertainties

Major factors that could shift this assessment include:

1. Development of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) and their competitive relationship with private cryptocurrencies

2. Future national security incidents involving cryptocurrency

3. Significant changes in Bitcoin's governance or technical structure

4. Major shifts in US political landscape regarding financial regulation

5. International regulatory developments and their influence on US policy
