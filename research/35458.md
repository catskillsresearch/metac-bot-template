### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The United States has consistently dominated the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, especially in the top and median ranks. As of late 2024 and early 2025, U.S. billionaires—particularly those in technology—have seen substantial increases in wealth, reinforcing their positions on the list[2][4].
- The 250th-ranked billionaire on December 28, 2025, was Scott Duncan of the United States. While this is after the forecast date, it suggests that U.S. representation at the median rank remains strong[1].
- The Bloomberg Billionaires Index remains a daily-updated, authoritative source, with the U.S. maintaining a significant presence throughout the rankings[1].

### Recent Announcements and Market Factors

- The surge in technology stocks in 2024 and early 2025 has disproportionately benefited U.S. billionaires, further solidifying their positions on the index[2][4].
- There have been no significant policy changes or economic events reported that would suggest a sudden shift in the nationality distribution of billionaires at the median rank.

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The Bloomberg Billionaires Index is the definitive source for billionaire rankings and nationalities, updated daily and publicly accessible[1].
- Major financial news outlets (e.g., Euronews, Fortune) corroborate the dominance of U.S. billionaires in the global rankings[2][4].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- The exact identity and nationality of the 250th-ranked billionaire on March 20, 2025, cannot be confirmed until that date due to daily fluctuations in net worth and rankings.
- Market volatility, especially in technology and luxury sectors, could cause unexpected changes, but no current evidence points to a likely displacement of a U.S. billionaire from the median spot in the near term[2][4].

### Conclusion

Based on historical trends, current status, and recent market dynamics, it is highly likely that the median person (250th-ranked) on Bloomberg's Billionaires Index will be from the United States on March 20, 2025. However, this cannot be guaranteed until the actual data for that date is available.
