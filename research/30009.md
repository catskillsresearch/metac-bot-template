# Nebraska Drought Forecast Analysis: December 31, 2024

## Current Drought Status and Recent Trends

As of early November 2024, Nebraska was experiencing significant drought conditions across much of the state. According to the U.S. Drought Monitor data from November 5, 2024, most of the Omaha area was categorized in severe drought (category 3/5), with some areas seeing improvement following pre-Halloween and early November rainfall events[2]. However, eastern and northeastern Nebraska saw no improvement in drought conditions despite these precipitation events[2].

In late October 2024, much of Nebraska was in severe drought conditions, represented as orange in the U.S. Drought Monitor map[5]. The state experienced little rainfall and higher-than-normal temperatures throughout October, contributing to the intensification of drought conditions[5]. This pattern is consistent with what meteorologists call a "flash drought," which rapidly intensifies over the course of a few weeks to a couple of months[5].

## Regional Context and Forecast Indicators

The broader Midwest region, which includes Nebraska, has seen expanding drought conditions. As of October 22, 2024, 53% of the Midwest region was in drought (categories D1–D4), representing an 11% increase from the previous week and a 20% increase from four weeks prior[4]. This regional trend suggests drought conditions have been worsening across the area.

Temperature and precipitation patterns are critical factors in drought development and persistence. Almost the entire country, including Nebraska, experienced above-normal temperatures during the week of October 23-29, 2024, with the High Plains region (which includes Nebraska) being among the warmest with temperatures 10 to 12 degrees Fahrenheit above normal[5].

## Short-term and Seasonal Outlooks

The Climate Prediction Center's outlook for November 2024 indicated an increased likelihood of above-normal temperatures across the entire Midwest region, including Nebraska[4]. For precipitation, the outlook showed equal chances for above-, near-, or below-normal precipitation[4]. This forecast suggested that without above-normal precipitation, drought conditions were likely to persist or potentially worsen in areas already experiencing drought[4].

Looking further ahead to winter 2024-2025, NOAA released its Winter Outlook on October 17, 2024, which predicted a slowly-developing, weaker La Niña pattern to influence conditions for the upcoming winter months (December 2024–February 2025)[4]. A weaker La Niña typically means it would be less likely to result in conventional winter impacts, creating some uncertainty in long-term precipitation forecasts for Nebraska[4].

## Measurement and Verification Sources

The U.S. Drought Monitor, produced by the National Drought Mitigation Center at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, provides the authoritative measurement of drought conditions used for the resolution criteria[1][5]. This resource focuses on broad-scale conditions, with local variations possible[1]. The Drought Monitor is updated weekly, providing current maps and data on drought intensity across the United States.

For verification purposes, the resolution criteria specifically points to the drought.gov state page for Nebraska (https://www.drought.gov/states/nebraska), which will be used to determine the number of Nebraska residents living in drought areas on December 31, 2024[1].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors create uncertainty in forecasting drought conditions through the end of December 2024:

1. The Drought Monitor focuses on broad-scale conditions, while local conditions may vary significantly[1].

2. Weather patterns can change rapidly, and precipitation events can quickly alter drought conditions, as demonstrated by the improvements seen in some areas following rainfall events in early November 2024[2].

3. The equal chances forecast for precipitation in November 2024 and the weak La Niña pattern predicted for winter 2024-2025 create significant uncertainty in precipitation patterns for Nebraska through December[4].

4. Historical patterns suggest that winter months typically see less precipitation in the region, which could limit opportunities for drought recovery before December 31, 2024[3].

Given the severe drought conditions present in Nebraska as of early November 2024, the forecast for continued above-normal temperatures, and the uncertain precipitation outlook, the drought situation in Nebraska will require close monitoring through December 2024 to determine whether 1.5 million or more residents will be living in drought areas by year's end.
