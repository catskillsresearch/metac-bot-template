## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Since 1961, annual world real GDP growth has remained in the 2–4% range, with no recorded instance of a year where GDP was 25% higher than any prior year.
- The Industrial Revolution saw annual global growth rates increase from ~0.1% to ~1% post-1850; modern growth rates are typically 2–3%.
- The concept of Transformative AI (TAI) predicts a tenfold acceleration in growth after AGI, potentially raising annual growth rates to 20–30% if widely adopted.

## 2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- As of 2021, there were no policy changes or events indicating a potential for near-term, unprecedented global GDP growth in the absence of AGI.
- AI progress has been rapid, but economic productivity gains from current AI remain incremental, not transformative.

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- World Bank and Open Philanthropy data confirm no historical precedent for a 25% year-over-year real GDP jump.
- Expert surveys (Metaculus, academic studies) cluster AGI arrival median between 2040–2050, with some recent forecasts suggesting earlier (late 2020s–2030s) due to rapid AI progress[1][4][5].

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- AGI timeline predictions remain deeply uncertain; even expert estimates vary by decades[1][4][5].
- The actual economic impact and speed of TAI/AGI-driven growth will depend on adoption rates, regulatory responses, and global coordination.
- Measurement of “real GDP” can vary by methodology and may not perfectly capture all economic value generated by AGI.

## 5. Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

- The first year when world real GDP is 25% higher than all previous years will almost certainly occur after AGI is developed, due to the unprecedented acceleration in economic growth rates projected for the post-AGI era.
- Based on TAI economic growth models, this could happen within 1–2 years after AGI, assuming rapid, global integration and minimal friction.
- Probabilistically, the most likely answer is: **-1 to -2 years** (i.e., 1–2 years after AGI is developed).
