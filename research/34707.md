### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- China has been expanding its global military footprint, notably through “Project 141,” which seeks to establish at least five overseas PLA bases and ten logistic support sites by 2030 to protect its economic and security interests[3].
- The PLA’s only confirmed overseas base as of early 2025 is in Djibouti, Africa. U.S. officials and analysts have tracked Chinese engagement with dozens of countries to assess where future bases might be established, but information about specific locations is sparse and often speculative[3].
- Political considerations, such as maintaining the narrative of a “peaceful rise” and prioritizing issues closer to home (notably Taiwan), may limit China’s willingness or ability to pursue formal base agreements in the Americas at this time[3].

### Recent Announcements and Policies

- As of February 9, 2025, there have been no official announcements from China regarding an agreement to build a PLA military base in any North American or South American country.
- Recent major PLA construction projects have focused on domestic facilities, such as the massive new command center in Beijing, rather than new overseas bases[2][5].
- U.S. officials remain vigilant and concerned about the possibility of future Chinese bases in the Western Hemisphere, but no concrete agreements or public announcements have been reported[3].

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Breaking Defense (July 2024) provides a comprehensive overview of China’s overseas basing ambitions and the challenges involved, noting the lack of public information about specific new base agreements[3].
- Asia Times (February 2025) and Economic Times (February 2025) focus on China’s domestic military infrastructure expansion, with no mention of new bases in the Americas[2][5].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- Chinese government sources rarely disclose specific plans or negotiations regarding overseas bases, making it difficult to track developments until formal announcements are made[3].
- Political sensitivities in potential host countries and within China itself may delay or prevent public disclosure of any such agreements.
- Intelligence assessments and media reports may speculate on future possibilities, but these do not constitute formal announcements as required by the resolution criteria.

### Conclusion

Based on all available information as of February 9, 2025, there is no evidence that China has announced an agreement to build a PLA military base in any North American or South American country. The question therefore resolves as **No** under the specified criteria.
