## Forecasting Chinese Aircraft Violations of Taiwan's ADIZ

### Historical Trends
- **Increasing Incursions**: The number of Chinese aircraft violating Taiwan's ADIZ has been rising. In 2022, there were 1,737 PLA aircraft tracked, more than the combined total of 2019, 2020, and 2021[5]. The monthly average of intrusions increased from 81 in 2021 to 178 in 2022[2].
- **Record Highs**: The record for most ADIZ violations in one month was 446 in August 2022, following Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan[3][4].

### Recent Developments
- **Increased Pressure Post-Inauguration**: Following Lai Ching-te's inauguration on May 20, 2024, China intensified its military pressure. In June 2024, there were at least 325 ADIZ violations, the second-highest monthly total on record[3][4].
- **July 2024 Incursions**: The PLA significantly increased daily incursions in July, with 232 violations in the first ten days, including a record-tying 56 violations on July 10[4].

### Authoritative Sources
- **Taiwan's Ministry of National Defense (MND)**: Provides official data on ADIZ violations[3].
- **PLATracker Spreadsheet**: Offers detailed daily and monthly violation data[4].

### Limitations and Uncertainties
- **Exclusions**: The number of ADIZ violations does not include PRC vessels and aircraft around Taiwan's outlying islands[3].
- **Data Consistency**: Accuracy depends on reporting consistency and completeness.

Given these trends and recent developments, it is plausible that more than 10 Chinese aircraft will violate Taiwan's ADIZ in a single day between August 15 and September 15, 2024.
