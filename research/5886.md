# Will the First Female US President Be Republican?

As of December 29, 2020, forecasting whether the first female US president will be Republican requires examining historical trends, current political pipelines, and structural factors affecting women's political advancement.

## Historical Context and Current Status

The United States has never had a female president in its 232-year history. As of 2020, the Democratic Party has made more progress in nominating women for top executive positions:

- Democrats nominated Hillary Clinton for president in 2016, the first and only female major party presidential nominee to date[4]
- Democrats nominated two women for vice president: Geraldine Ferraro (1984) and Kamala Harris (2020)[4]
- Republicans nominated one woman for vice president: Sarah Palin (2008)[4]

The Republican Party has never nominated a woman for president, though several women have sought the nomination. As of 2020, no Republican woman had won a presidential primary or caucus in U.S. history[5].

## Pipeline Analysis

### Republican Pipeline

As of 2020, the Republican Party has several women who might be considered potential future presidential candidates:

- Nikki Haley: Former Governor of South Carolina and UN Ambassador under Trump[2]
- Kristi Noem: Governor of South Dakota
- Joni Ernst: Senator from Iowa
- Elise Stefanik: House Representative from New York

However, the pipeline of Republican women in elected office is significantly smaller than for Democrats. As of 2020, Republican women constitute only about 13% of Republican members of Congress.

### Democratic Pipeline

The Democratic pipeline for potential female presidential candidates as of 2020 is more robust:

- Kamala Harris: Vice President-elect (as of December 2020)
- Elizabeth Warren: Senator from Massachusetts and 2020 presidential candidate
- Amy Klobuchar: Senator from Minnesota and 2020 presidential candidate
- Gretchen Whitmer: Governor of Michigan

With Harris becoming Vice President in 2021, she would be positioned as a potential presidential candidate in future elections, potentially following the historical pattern of vice presidents often becoming presidential nominees.

## Structural Factors

Several structural factors influence the likelihood of a female Republican president:

1. **Party Demographics**: The Republican Party's voter base is less diverse than the Democratic Party's, with a higher proportion of white male voters who have historically shown less support for female candidates.

2. **Ideological Factors**: Conservative ideology sometimes emphasizes traditional gender roles, which may create additional hurdles for women seeking leadership positions within the party.

3. **Incumbency Advantage**: As of 2020, the incoming Democratic administration includes a female vice president, potentially giving Democrats a head start in eventually elevating a woman to the presidency.

4. **Historical Precedent**: The Democratic Party has demonstrated greater willingness to nominate women for top executive positions, suggesting they may be more likely to break the presidential gender barrier first.

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on information available as of December 29, 2020, the likelihood of the first female US president being Republican appears lower than the alternative, but not impossible. Key considerations:

- Democrats have a larger pipeline of potential female presidential candidates
- Republicans have fewer women in high-profile elected positions
- The incoming Democratic vice president (Harris) has a potential path to the presidency
- Republican women face additional structural barriers within their party

A reasonable probabilistic assessment would place the likelihood of the first female US president being Republican at approximately 30-35%, with several caveats and uncertainties.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

This forecast faces several limitations:

1. Political landscapes can change rapidly
2. Individual candidates' fortunes are highly unpredictable
3. Structural barriers to women in politics may decrease over time
4. The timing of when the first female president might be elected is highly uncertain
5. Succession scenarios (rather than election) could lead to unexpected outcomes

The forecast horizon extending to 2100 introduces extreme uncertainty, as party ideologies, demographics, and political structures could transform dramatically over such a timespan.
