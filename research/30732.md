## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of May 2025, the CDC has reported approximately 70 confirmed human H5 avian influenza cases in the United States since 2024, with all cases linked to direct animal exposure (primarily farm workers exposed to infected poultry or cattle)[2][4].
- There is no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission in the US. All close contacts of confirmed cases tested negative, and CDC continues to report the public health risk as low[1][2][4].
- Surveillance systems, including clinical laboratory data and wastewater monitoring, show no unusual influenza activity in the general population, and no uptick in unexplained respiratory illness[1][5].
- Globally, H5N1 has caused fewer than 1,000 human cases since 1997, with most cases associated with direct animal contact and not sustained transmission[4].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- CDC and USDA continue to monitor and respond to avian influenza outbreaks in animals, particularly among poultry and dairy cattle, but human cases remain rare and contained to those with direct animal contact[2][3].
- Routine and enhanced surveillance, including serology and wastewater monitoring, are in place to detect any changes in transmission patterns or increases in case numbers[5].
- The CDC has not changed its public health guidance or risk assessment, continuing to classify the risk to the general public as low[1][2].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- CDC H5 Bird Flu: Current Situation page[1]
- CDC H5N1 Bird Flu Response Updates[2]
- CDC H5N1 Surveillance and Monitoring Reports[5]
- World Health Organization (WHO) global H5N1 case summaries (referenced in [4])

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- Surveillance primarily detects symptomatic and laboratory-confirmed cases; mild or asymptomatic infections could be underreported, but no evidence suggests a large hidden caseload[5].
- Theoretical risk exists that a single mutation could enable more efficient human transmission, but there is no evidence this has occurred in the US as of May 2025[4].
- If the virus adapts for human-to-human transmission, the forecast would need rapid revision, but current evidence does not support this scenario[1][2][4].
- All projections assume the CDC maintains current case definitions and reporting practices.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the current pace of reported human H5 cases (about 70 in 14 months), the lack of person-to-person transmission, and robust ongoing surveillance, the probability that CDC will report 10,000 or more confirmed/probable human H5 avian influenza cases in the US before January 1, 2026 is extremely lowâ€”well below 1% under current conditions. Only a major virological or epidemiological shift (e.g., emergence of efficient human-to-human transmission) could materially alter this outlook.
