# Forecasting Clade I Mpox Cases in the US by August 23, 2024

As of August 14, 2024, no cases of clade I mpox have been reported outside central and eastern Africa[1][2]. However, several factors could influence whether the CDC might confirm a case in a US resident before August 23, 2024.

## Current Outbreak Status

The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is experiencing an unprecedented outbreak of clade I mpox. Since January 2023, the DRC has reported the largest number of yearly suspected clade I mpox cases on record[3]. This outbreak is more widespread than any previous DRC outbreak and has resulted in transmission to neighboring countries[1].

The spread pattern shows concerning developments:

- In April 2024, confirmed clade I mpox cases were reported in the Central African Republic (CAR) and Republic of the Congo (ROC)[1]
- In late July 2024, clade I cases were confirmed in Rwanda and Uganda[1]
- Burundi has presumed cases of clade I mpox, with testing underway[2]
- In the month prior to August 14, over 100 laboratory-confirmed cases of clade 1b were reported in four countries neighboring the DRC that had not previously reported mpox[4]

## CDC Response and Preparedness

The CDC has taken several actions that indicate heightened concern:

1. On August 7, 2024, the CDC issued a Health Alert Network (HAN) Health Update about the outbreak[1]
2. The CDC recommends that US clinicians and jurisdictions "maintain a heightened index of suspicion for mpox in patients who have recently been in DRC or to any country sharing a border with DRC" and who present with symptoms consistent with mpox[2]
3. The US has initiated public health preparedness activities in response to the increasing number of clade I mpox cases in the DRC[3]

## Risk Assessment Factors

Several factors are relevant to assessing the likelihood of a US case by August 23:

**Factors increasing risk:**
- The unprecedented scale of the current outbreak in DRC[1]
- Geographic expansion to multiple neighboring countries[1][2][4]
- International travel connections between affected regions and the US
- The CDC's heightened alert status suggests they consider importation possible[1][2]

**Factors decreasing risk:**
- No cases reported outside central and eastern Africa as of August 14, 2024[1][2]
- The short timeframe (9 days from August 14 to August 23)
- Awareness and surveillance may help identify and isolate potential cases quickly

## Severity and Characteristics

Clade I mpox is generally associated with higher case fatality rates (1.4% to >10%) compared with clade II MPXV (0.1% to 3.6%)[3]. This increased severity has prompted stronger public health responses.

## Global Response

On August 14, 2024, the WHO Director-General declared the mpox outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC)[4]. This declaration, the second PHEIC for mpox in two years, indicates the global health community's serious concern about the potential for international spread.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- There may be delays in case identification and reporting
- The actual extent of spread may be underestimated due to limited testing capacity in some affected regions
- The effectiveness of current travel screening measures is uncertain
- The short timeframe (August 14-23) limits the probability of case importation and confirmation

## Conclusion

While no cases of clade I mpox had been reported outside central and eastern Africa as of August 14, 2024, the CDC has issued alerts and recommendations indicating concern about potential spread to the United States. The unprecedented scale of the outbreak in DRC, its spread to neighboring countries, and the WHO's PHEIC declaration all suggest increased risk for international spread. However, the short timeframe until August 23 may limit the likelihood of a confirmed case in a US resident by that date.
