## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- US-Iran nuclear negotiations have a decades-long history, with a landmark deal in 2015 (JCPOA) and US withdrawal in 2018[3][4].
- Since 2020, Iran has significantly increased uranium enrichment activities, well above levels permitted by the JCPOA[4].
- In early 2025, the US (under President Trump) and Iran resumed indirect nuclear talks, with four rounds held in Oman in April and May 2025[3][4].
- Senior Iranian officials have rejected US demands for zero uranium enrichment—a key US requirement for any deal[1].
- The US continues to insist that Iran halt support for regional proxy groups as part of any prospective agreement[2].
- Iran has proposed a phased deal: temporary reduction in enrichment and enhanced inspections for sanctions relief, with further steps including US congressional approval and uranium stockpile transfers[3].
- Public intelligence assessments state Iran has the technical capability for weapons-grade uranium but is not currently building a weapon[4].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- President Trump has repeatedly stated a desire to finalize a deal but insists the window for agreement is closing[2].
- Official briefings (reported by Israeli media) suggest a “high chance” of a deal, but no formal confirmation exists[Israeli media].
- Both US and Iranian officials are publicly signaling willingness to engage, but with firm red lines on key issues—especially enrichment levels and sanctions[1][2][3][4].

- Times of Israel, reporting on US and Iranian official statements[2]
- Wikipedia, 2025 US–Iran negotiations, with detailed timeline and summary[3]

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- The talks are indirect and mediated, with limited public disclosure of substance and progress[4].
- Both sides face substantial domestic and regional pressures, raising the risk of last-minute breakdowns.
- Major sticking points (zero enrichment, sanctions relief, proxy activity) remain unresolved as of May 15, 2025[1][2].
- Intelligence and diplomatic briefings indicate potential for progress, but no agreement or announcement has been made.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given:
- Four rounds of recent talks, constructive diplomatic atmosphere, and public urgency from the US[2][3][4],
- Persistent, unresolved core disagreements (especially on enrichment and sanctions)[1][4],
- Credible but unconfirmed reports of a “high chance” of a deal,

**The probability that the United States and Iran will announce a new nuclear deal before July 1, 2025, is moderately elevated but below 50%.** The most likely scenarios are either a last-minute limited agreement or continued deadlock, given the unresolved fundamental issues.
