# Climate Disaster Impact Assessment: Population Decline Risk Analysis

Based on available information as of December 4, 2018, I'll analyze the likelihood of a climate disaster causing a 95%+ human population decline by 2100.

## Current Climate Trajectory and Reference Cases

The IPCC projections indicate that global mean temperatures for 2081-2100 (relative to 1986-2005) will likely fall within the following ranges:
- 0.3°C to 1.7°C under RCP2.6 (strong mitigation)
- 1.1°C to 2.6°C under RCP4.5 (intermediate mitigation)
- 1.4°C to 3.1°C under RCP6.0 (intermediate mitigation)
- 2.6°C to 4.8°C under RCP8.5 (high emissions)[2]

Under current policies and commitments, we appear to be tracking closer to higher-end scenarios. Global temperatures averaged over 2081-2100 are projected to likely exceed 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels for RCP4.5, RCP6.0, and RCP8.5, and are likely to exceed 2°C for RCP6.0 and RCP8.5[2].

## Key Factors Affecting Population Impact Assessment

### Temperature Thresholds and Habitability

While significant warming would create severe challenges, even the upper bound of current mainstream projections (4.8°C) would not render Earth uninhabitable for humans across all regions. The query notes that a 12°C increase—well beyond what's considered plausible this century—would create conditions exceeding human metabolic limits in territories where half the current population resides.

### Feedback Mechanisms and Tail Risks

The probability distribution for climate sensitivity has a "fat right tail," meaning low but non-negligible chances of extreme warming beyond median projections. Several self-reinforcing feedback mechanisms could potentially accelerate warming:

1. Permafrost thawing releasing methane
2. Decomposition of ocean methane hydrates
3. Increased marine bacterial respiration
4. Loss of polar ice sheets with accompanying sea level rise
5. Changes in ocean circulation amplifying temperature increases

These feedback loops could push Earth toward a "Hothouse" state, though the temperature thresholds and timelines for triggering such scenarios remain uncertain.

### Geoengineering Considerations

Solar Radiation Management (SRM) represents a potential emergency intervention to rapidly reduce temperatures by reflecting sunlight back to space. While SRM could theoretically mitigate warming, it introduces its own risks:

1. Abrupt termination risk: If deployed at large scale then suddenly stopped, rapid warming would follow
2. Precipitation pattern disruptions
3. Potential regional climate impacts
4. Governance challenges for deployment and maintenance

## Probabilistic Assessment of 95%+ Population Decline

Based on available evidence, the probability of a climate disaster causing a 95%+ population decline by 2100 appears low but not zero. Several factors inform this assessment:

1. Even under high-end warming scenarios (4-5°C), large portions of Earth would remain physically habitable, though with significant agricultural and economic disruption.

2. A 95% population decline would require either:
   - Direct climate effects of unprecedented severity
   - Cascading societal failures including conflict, economic collapse, and food system breakdown
   - Failed adaptation combined with multiple reinforcing feedback loops

3. Human adaptability and technological capacity provide substantial resilience against gradual climate change, though abrupt changes would be more challenging.

4. Historical civilizational collapses have typically been regional rather than global, even without modern technology and knowledge.

The primary mechanisms that could potentially lead to such extreme population decline would be:

1. Runaway warming far beyond current projections triggering multiple tipping points
2. Catastrophic failure of agriculture across most major growing regions
3. SRM deployment followed by abrupt termination without resumption
4. Complex interactions between climate impacts and other global risks (pandemics, conflict)

## Conclusion

Based on information available as of December 2018, while climate change presents serious global risks, the probability of it causing a 95%+ human population decline by 2100 appears to be in the low single-digit percentage range. The most plausible pathway to such an outcome would involve multiple compounding factors: warming significantly beyond current projections, triggering of multiple feedback loops, catastrophic agricultural failures, and breakdown of international cooperation for adaptation.

This assessment comes with significant uncertainty given the complex interactions between climate, ecological, and human systems. The fat-tailed distribution of climate sensitivity and potential for currently underappreciated tipping points warrant continued vigilance and research into extreme scenarios, even as they remain low probability.
