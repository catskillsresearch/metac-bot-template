# Forecasting Analysis: Will Ukraine Join the Union State Before 2040?

As of April 28, 2022, the following analysis examines the likelihood of Ukraine joining the Union State before 2040, based on available factual information.

## Current Situation and Historical Context

The Union State is a supranational union consisting of Belarus and Russia, established with the aim of deepening integration between these countries through economic and defense policy coordination. While originally aimed at creating a confederation, both countries currently maintain their independence within this framework. The Union State is open to other countries joining, with Alexander Lukashenko serving as the president of its Supreme State Council since 2000[2].

Ukraine's relationship with the Union State has been characterized by resistance and wariness. In 2021, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky explicitly stated that a "true Union State" represented a "real danger" to Ukraine, indicating strong opposition to membership from Ukraine's current leadership. This position reflects Ukraine's broader geopolitical orientation away from Russia and toward Western institutions.

## Key Factors Affecting the Forecast

### 1. Ukraine's European Aspirations

As of February 28, 2022, Ukraine formally applied for EU membership, demonstrating its clear Western orientation and desire for European integration rather than closer ties with Russia. This application came during the early days of Russia's invasion, underscoring Ukraine's rejection of being pulled back into Russia's sphere of influence[3].

### 2. Russian-Ukrainian Conflict

The ongoing Russian invasion that began in February 2022 has dramatically worsened relations between Ukraine and Russia, making voluntary Ukrainian membership in a Russia-dominated organization highly improbable in the near to medium term. The conflict has solidified anti-Russian sentiment in Ukraine and strengthened its Western orientation.

### 3. Statements by Key Leaders

Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko predicted that Ukraine would join the Union State within approximately 15 years, stating "If you say 15 years, I'm sure that Ukraine will be there if we don't make any mistakes." However, this statement contradicts Ukraine's own expressed intentions and appears to reflect Belarusian and Russian aspirations rather than Ukrainian policy.

### 4. Historical Precedents

Ukraine has consistently sought to maintain independence from Russian-led integration projects since gaining independence in 1991. Previous attempts to draw Ukraine into closer integration with Russia have faced significant domestic opposition in Ukraine.

## Scenarios and Probability Assessment

Based on information available as of April 28, 2022, several scenarios could unfold:

**Scenario 1: Ukraine maintains independence and Western orientation**
- Most likely scenario given Ukraine's current trajectory
- Supported by Ukraine's formal EU membership application
- Reinforced by strong anti-Russian sentiment following the invasion

**Scenario 2: Military defeat leads to imposed membership**
- Would require complete Russian military victory and installation of a pro-Russian government
- Would need to overcome likely continued resistance from Ukrainian population
- Would need to maintain control of over 50% of Ukraine's 2014 territory per resolution criteria

**Scenario 3: Geopolitical realignment**
- Would require fundamental shifts in Ukrainian politics and public opinion
- Possible only with resolution of current conflict and reconciliation with Russia
- Would need significant changes in Western support for Ukraine

## Assessment

The probability of Ukraine joining the Union State before 2040 appears low based on information available as of April 28, 2022. Several factors make this outcome unlikely:

1. Ukraine's explicit Western orientation and EU aspirations
2. Deep hostility toward Russia following the 2022 invasion
3. Ukraine's historical resistance to Russian-led integration projects
4. The requirement that any Union State membership must control over 50% of Ukraine's 2014 territory

For Ukraine to join the Union State would require either:
- A complete reversal of Ukraine's current foreign policy orientation
- A military defeat so comprehensive that Russia could install and maintain a compliant government in control of most Ukrainian territory
- A dramatic geopolitical shift that would make Union State membership attractive to Ukrainians

## Limitations and Uncertainties

This assessment faces several limitations:

1. The fluid military situation in Ukraine makes long-term political outcomes difficult to predict
2. The assessment cannot account for potential future leadership changes in Ukraine, Russia, or Belarus
3. Geopolitical alignments may shift significantly over the 18-year timeframe
4. The nature and purpose of the Union State itself may evolve
