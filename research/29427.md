## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- North Carolina's 1st Congressional District has been a Democratic stronghold for over a century; a Republican has not held the seat since 1883[1][2].
- Don Davis, a Democrat, won the seat in 2022 with 52% of the vote, succeeding G.K. Butterfield, who held the seat for nearly two decades[2].
- The district was redrawn in 2023 by Republican lawmakers, making it more competitive by slightly increasing the white population and decreasing the Black population (now 49.3% white, 39.6% Black)[2].
- The 2024 race is widely regarded as the only true toss-up congressional contest in North Carolina and has attracted millions in outside spending from both parties[1][3].

## Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- The redistricting by Republican lawmakers is the most significant recent change, making the district more favorable to Republicans and increasing competitiveness[1][2].
- Don Davis has emphasized his record on health care, education, and economic development in his campaign[3].
- Laurie Buckhout, the Republican challenger, is a retired Army Colonel and political newcomer, running as a moderate alternative to the previous Republican candidate[2][3].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- WUNC, The Assembly NC, and Spectrum News 1 all identify the race as highly competitive, with both parties investing heavily and national attention focused on the outcome[1][2][3].
- Campaign finance reports show Davis with a significant cash-on-hand advantage ($2.5 million vs. Buckhout's $1 million as of October 2024), and no outstanding debts, while Buckhout has $1.6 million in personal loans to her campaign[2].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- The district's new boundaries and demographic shifts introduce uncertainty, as does the national political climate and potential turnout effects from the presidential race.
- No final polling data is available as of October 31, 2024, and late campaign developments could influence the outcome.
- Despite the district's Democratic history, the race is considered a toss-up by multiple credible sources, and both parties see it as critical for control of the House[1][2][3].
