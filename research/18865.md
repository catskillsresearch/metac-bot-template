## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of July 2022, Russian and Russian-backed separatist forces controlled nearly all of Luhansk Oblast and about 54% of Donetsk Oblast[1].
- After intense fighting, Ukraine lost key cities like Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk, resulting in full Russian control of Luhansk by July 2022[1].
- Ukraine’s counteroffensives in late 2022 and throughout 2023 saw slow gains, with the liberation of some territories but no rapid breakthroughs in Donetsk and Luhansk. The frontlines remained largely static through September 2023[1][3].
- Russia declared the annexation of both oblasts (and two others) in late 2022 and staged non-recognized referendums and “fake elections” to legitimize its occupation[2].

## 2. Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Metric

- Russian President Putin set a strategic goal to fully capture Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts by March 2023, redeploying additional forces to the area, suggesting a continued focus on military entrenchment[5].
- Russian authorities have increased operational security and repression in occupied areas (e.g., blocking internet/cell service in Luhansk), indicating intentions to consolidate control[5].
- Western countries, notably the US and EU, continued to provide significant military and economic aid to Ukraine, but the effectiveness of this support depended on domestic politics and global events[3].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Major international news agencies and conflict monitors (e.g., ISW, ACLED, The Guardian, Wikipedia’s Eastern front coverage) regularly update territorial control maps and provide on-the-ground reporting[1][3][5].
- Ukrainian and Russian government announcements and military communiqués are primary (albeit sometimes biased) sources[5].
- UN, OSCE, and respected NGOs report on human rights and governance conditions in these areas[4].

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- The pace of Ukraine’s territorial recovery in 2023 was slower than earlier offensives, indicating entrenched Russian positions and possible war “freezing”[1][3].
- The effectiveness and continuity of Western aid remain uncertain, especially considering political changes in donor countries.
- Russian willingness to escalate (e.g., with further mobilization or unconventional tactics) adds volatility.
- Potential for diplomatic breakthroughs, internal instability in Russia, or negotiations could alter the strategic picture unexpectedly.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given:
- Russia’s firm military and administrative presence in most of Luhansk and much of Donetsk as of late 2023[1].
- The slow, attritional nature of Ukrainian advances, and the possibility of a protracted, frozen conflict.
- The absence of indications that either side is capable of achieving a decisive breakthrough as of September 2023[1][3].

**It is less likely than not (estimated probability 25-40%) that Ukraine will have de-facto control over the entirety of Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts—including the cities of Donetsk and Luhansk—by January 1, 2030, barring major unforeseen changes in the conflict’s dynamics.**
