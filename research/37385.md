# Forecast Analysis: Trump's Net Approval on Inflation (June 25, 2025)

As a forecasting analyst examining Donald Trump's potential net approval rating on inflation by June 25, 2025, I'll analyze current trends, identify key factors, and provide a probabilistic assessment based on available data as of May 28, 2025.

## Current Situation & Historical Trends

Donald Trump's overall job approval rating has shown a consistent downward trend in 2025:
- January 2025: 47% approval
- February 2025: 45% approval
- Recent measurements: 43% approval[1]
- As of April 23, 2025 (approaching the 100-day mark of his second term): 40% approval[3]

Specifically regarding economic issues, Trump is currently "underwater" on economy, inflation, and tariffs as of February-March 2025, meaning his net approval (approve minus disapprove percentage) is negative in these areas[2]. This is particularly significant as inflation is often a key economic indicator that voters use to judge presidential performance.

## Key Factors Affecting the Forecast

1. **Tariff Policies**: Trump announced sweeping new tariffs on nearly all U.S. trading partners on April 2, 2025, which triggered several days of volatility in U.S. and global stock markets. While he paused tariffs on most countries on April 9, 2025, he simultaneously levied higher rates on China[3]. These tariff policies are unpopular, with 59% of Americans disapproving and only 39% approving as of April 2025[3].

2. **Government Spending Cuts**: The administration is implementing cuts to federal departments and agencies, which 55% of Americans disapprove of, while 44% approve[3]. These fiscal policies could affect inflation perceptions.

3. **Executive Order Usage**: 51% of Americans believe Trump is setting too much policy via executive order[3]. This governance approach may impact public perception of his economic management.

4. **Historical Presidential Comparison**: Trump's approval ratings can be compared to previous presidents at similar points in their terms to establish contextual baselines[2].

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on the available data and trends, I forecast that Donald Trump's net approval rating on inflation as measured by the Silver Bulletin on June 25, 2025, will most likely fall in the range of **>-20.0% and <-10.0%** with the following probability distribution:

| Option | Probability Assessment |
|---|---|
| <-30.0% | 15% |
| â‰¥-30.0% and â‰¤-20.0% | 25% |
| >-20.0% and <-10.0% | 45% |
| â‰¥-10.0% | 15% |

### Rationale:

1. The overall job approval trend is declining, suggesting economic metrics like inflation approval are unlikely to improve significantly.

2. Tariff policies, which typically lead to higher consumer prices, have been implemented and are broadly unpopular (59% disapproval)[3]. These will likely continue to negatively impact inflation perceptions through June.

3. Trump is already "underwater" specifically on inflation as of March 2025[2], and there are no indications in the data of a reversal in this trend.

4. The time between the most recent data (April 23, 2025) and the forecast date (June 25, 2025) is approximately two months, which provides some time for policy adjustments but is unlikely to completely reverse established trends.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

1. The available data does not provide specific numerical values for Trump's current net approval on inflation, only that it is negative ("underwater")[2].

2. The Silver Bulletin tracker mentioned in the resolution criteria is not directly referenced in the available search results, making it difficult to assess its specific methodology.

3. Economic conditions could change rapidly between now (May 28, 2025) and the forecast date (June 25, 2025).

4. The impact of the April tariff adjustments may not be fully reflected in the most recent approval ratings.
