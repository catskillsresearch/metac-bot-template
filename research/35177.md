## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- **All-Time High:** Trump Media & Technology Group (DJT) reached an all-time high of $79.38 per share. This is the benchmark for the resolution criteria.
- **Recent Price Action:** After a surge in 2024, DJT experienced a pullback but remained volatile. As of early 2025, the stock had gained 3.5% year-to-date, outperforming broader indices, but was still trading well below its all-time high[4].
- **Valuation vs. Fundamentals:** Despite a market capitalization of $6–7.7 billion, the company reported only $3.4 million in revenue over the past 12 months, highlighting a disconnect between valuation and financial performance[3][4].

## Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Metric

- **Political Developments:** DJT’s price is heavily influenced by Donald Trump’s political prospects. The stock saw gains in anticipation of Trump’s inauguration, reflecting investor optimism about potential business opportunities[4].
- **Regulatory Scrutiny:** The SEC’s evolving stance on SPAC mergers and social media stocks introduces uncertainty, which could impact DJT’s valuation and trading activity[3].
- **Ownership Changes:** News that Trump moved a $4 billion-plus stake into a trust led to a temporary decline in the stock, reflecting market sensitivity to insider actions.

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- **Yahoo Finance Historical Data:** The official resolution will use Yahoo Finance’s historical price data for DJT to verify whether the stock ever exceeded $79.38 (including intraday highs) between now and March 31, 2025.
- **Investing.com and Nasdaq:** Both provide historical and forecast data for DJT, supporting analysis of trends and price movements[1][4].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- **Speculative Nature:** DJT is highly speculative, with price movements driven more by sentiment and political news than by financial fundamentals[3][4].
- **Forecast Variability:** Price forecasts for 2025 vary widely. Some predict DJT could reach $75–$100, while others suggest much higher potential highs, but these are not guarantees[2][3].
- **Data Gaps:** As of February 18, 2025, there is no evidence that DJT has exceeded $79.38 in 2025, but intraday highs for every trading day up to March 31, 2025, are not fully available at the cutoff.

## Summary

As of February 18, 2025, DJT has not exceeded its all-time high of $79.38 in 2025, but forecasts and the stock’s volatility suggest it could approach or surpass this level before March 31, 2025. The outcome remains uncertain and will depend on market sentiment, political developments, and potential regulatory actions. The official resolution will rely on Yahoo Finance’s historical data for confirmation.
