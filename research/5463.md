## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

**NASA Mars Sample Return (MSR):**
- NASA's goal of returning Mars samples dates back decades but only crystallized into a concrete plan in the late 2010s, with *Perseverance* (launched in 2020) collecting samples for eventual retrieval[4][5].
- As of 2020, the MSR was envisioned as a partnership with ESA, requiring three major missions: sample collection (active), sample retrieval (planned for ~2026), and Earth return (planned for ~2030)[3][5].
- The program was in early development, with only the sample-collecting rover on Mars, and no flight hardware for retrieval or return built or launched as of October 2020[3][5].
- Historically, NASA and ESA have encountered delays and budget overruns for complex interplanetary missions. These trends suggest that a 2030 return date was optimistic.

**SpaceX Starship:**
- SpaceX publicly targeted a Mars landing as early as 2026, based on aggressive development schedules and Elon Musk's aspirational statements[1].
- As of late 2020, Starship had not yet achieved orbital flight, and there were no demonstrated deep-space, autonomous, or interplanetary missions using Starship-class rockets.
- SpaceX had a history of rapid prototyping and iterative development but also of missing ambitious public timelines by several years.

## 2. Key Differences Affecting the Forecast

- **Technical Readiness:** NASA's MSR was at a more advanced stage in its preliminary implementation (with Perseverance already collecting samples), but the hardest mission elements (retrieval and Mars ascent) remained unbuilt as of 2020[3][5]. Starship, by comparison, was still in suborbital test phases[1].
- **Institutional Momentum and Funding:** NASA's MSR faced institutional inertia, reliance on multinational cooperation, and possible Congressional budget risks. SpaceX benefited from its entrepreneurial approach but depended on private funding and high technical risk.
- **Program Complexity:** MSR required tight international coordination, multiple launches, and robotic Mars ascent—never before attempted. Starship's technical requirements (landing a massive new vehicle on Mars) were also unprecedented but could, in principle, be achieved with fewer external dependencies.
- **Schedule Slippage:** Both parties had track records of delays. NASA's missions typically slipped by years; SpaceX tended to miss public target dates but sometimes accelerated once flight hardware matured.

## 3. Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment (as of 2020-10-29)

Given the above:

- Both NASA MSR and SpaceX Starship Mars landing were highly ambitious and faced major technical and budgetary challenges.
- NASA's sample return timeline (~2030) was likely optimistic, with historical trends suggesting possible slippage into the early to mid-2030s[3].
- SpaceX's 2026 Mars landing was highly aspirational, with the first Starship Mars landing likely to slip into the late 2020s at the earliest, given the stage of development as of 2020.
- There was significant uncertainty for both, but the edge likely went to SpaceX for possibly achieving a Mars landing before NASA could execute a complex, multi-stage sample return and Earth re-entry.

**Assessment:**  
As of October 2020, the probability that NASA returns a Mars sample to Earth before SpaceX Starship lands on Mars was less than 50%. The most likely scenario was that Starship would land on Mars before NASA's sample return, given the typical delays in large NASA-ESA joint missions and the speed of SpaceX's development once Starship reached maturity. However, both outcomes carried substantial uncertainties, with neither event likely before the late 2020s.

**Estimated probabilities (as of 2020-10-29):**
- NASA returns sample before Starship Mars landing: ~30%
- Starship lands on Mars before NASA sample return: ~60%
- Neither event occurs by 2035: ~10%

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- Both programs faced major technical and funding risks.
- Timelines were subject to change based on test results, unforeseen failures, or shifts in political priorities.
- SpaceX's history of aggressive deadlines often resulted in significant delays.
- NASA-ESA MSR's dependence on international cooperation and Congressional funding added risk for further slippage.
