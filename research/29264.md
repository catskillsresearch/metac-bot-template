### Key Factual Information Relevant to Forecasting a New WHO COVID-19 VOC Designation Before January 1, 2025

**1. Current WHO Variant Status**
- As of October 28, 2024, the WHO lists no circulating Variants of Concern (VOCs).
- The current variants tracked are:
  - **Variants Under Monitoring (VUM):** BA.2.86, JN.1
  - **Variants of Interest (VOI):** JN.1.7, KP.2, KP.3, KP.3.1.1, JN.1.18, LB.1, XEC[1][2].

**2. Criteria for VOC Designation**
- A variant must first be a VOI and then, through risk assessment, be shown with moderate or high confidence to cause:
  - Increased clinical severity,
  - Substantial impact on health systems,
  - Significant decrease in vaccine effectiveness[1][2][4].
- No current VUM or VOI has been publicly reported to meet these criteria.

**3. Historical Trends**
- The last new VOC was Omicron, designated in November 2021.
- No new VOCs have been added since then, despite the emergence of multiple sublineages and VOIs.
- Previous VOCs (Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, Omicron) were designated following clear evidence of increased transmissibility, severity, or immune escape[1][2][5].

**4. Recent Announcements and Policy Updates**
- In March 2023, the WHO updated its variant tracking system and definitions but did not lower the threshold for VOC designation[2].
- The CDC/SIG also updated its classification system to allow independent evaluation of Omicron sublineages, but this has not resulted in new VOC designations[4].

**5. Authoritative Sources for Verification**
- WHO COVID-19 Variants Dashboard[1]
- WHO Tracking SARS-CoV-2 Variants page[2]
- CDC SARS-CoV-2 Interagency Group[4]

**6. Limitations and Uncertainties**
- Viral evolution is inherently unpredictable; a new variant could theoretically emerge and meet VOC criteria rapidly.
- As of the cutoff date, there are no public signals or risk assessments indicating that any current VUM or VOI is close to being designated a VOC.
- Surveillance and reporting delays could affect the timeliness of public announcements.

### Summary Table: Current WHO Variant Classifications (as of 2024-10-28)

| Classification | Variants Listed      | Last New VOC Designation |
|----------------|---------------------|-------------------------|
| VUM            | BA.2.86, JN.1       | Omicron (Nov 2021)      |
| VOI            | JN.1.7, KP.2, KP.3, KP.3.1.1, JN.1.18, LB.1, XEC |                         |
| VOC            | None                |                         |

### Conclusion
Based on all available information as of October 28, 2024, there is no evidence that the WHO is likely to designate a new COVID-19 Variant of Concern before January 1, 2025. The current variants under monitoring and interest have not been publicly reported to meet the criteria for escalation, and there have been no recent policy changes or announcements suggesting an imminent new VOC designation.
