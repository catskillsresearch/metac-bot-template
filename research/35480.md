## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of February 19, 2025, the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine reported a total of 862,390 Russian personnel losses since the start of the full-scale invasion in 2022[5].
- Throughout February 2025, Ukrainian sources reported that Russian forces suffered 36,570 personnel losses, which averages to approximately 1,306 per day (36,570 losses over 28 days)[5].
- The daily reported loss rate has remained consistently above 1,000 since July 25, 2024, and recent daily figures (e.g., 1,730 on February 15, 2025) support this trend[3][5].

## Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Metric

- There have been no public announcements indicating a change in the Ukrainian General Staff’s reporting practices or a significant change in the intensity of combat that would drastically alter the daily loss rate[5].
- Ukrainian officials and independent analysts continue to note that Russian advances are coming at the cost of high personnel losses, with January and February 2025 seeing some of the highest monthly casualty rates since the invasion began[4][5].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The primary source for these figures is the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which publishes daily updates on its official website and social media channels[5].
- Independent trackers such as russian-casualties.in.ua and Combat.FYI, as well as open-source datasets, provide secondary verification and historical data.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- The Ukrainian General Staff’s figures are estimates and include both killed and wounded personnel. The methodology is not fully transparent, and the figures are not independently verified by neutral third parties.
- There have been rare instances of corrections to previously reported figures, but these are typically addressed promptly and transparently.
- The actual number of Russian personnel losses may differ from the reported figures, but for the purposes of this forecast, the reported numbers are the resolution standard.

## Forecast Calculation

- With 862,390 losses reported on February 19, 2025, and a daily average of about 1,300 losses, it would take approximately 29 days to reach 900,000:
  - \( 900,000 - 862,390 = 37,610 \)
  - \( 37,610 / 1,300 \approx 28.9 \) days
- Adding 29 days to February 19, 2025, projects the 900,000 threshold being reached on or around March 20, 2025.
- This is just before the March 21, 2025, cutoff for resolution.

## Conclusion

Based on the current rate of reported Russian personnel losses and the Ukrainian General Staff’s consistent reporting practices, it is highly likely that the 900,000 threshold will be reported before March 21, 2025. The projected date for reaching this figure is March 20, 2025, assuming the current daily rate continues and reporting remains uninterrupted[5].
