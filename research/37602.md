# Forecasting Bluesky's Unique Posters for June 28, 2025

As of June 5, 2025, I'll analyze the available data to forecast Bluesky's unique poster count for June 28, 2025.

## Current User Growth Trajectory

Bluesky has demonstrated remarkable growth since late 2024. The platform reached 33 million total users by March 11, 2025[1], following a rapid expansion from 25.4 million in December 2024[1][4]. This represents an increase of approximately 7.6 million users over a 3-month period, or about 2.5 million users per month.

The growth pattern shows acceleration throughout 2024-2025:
- 13 million users (October 24, 2024)
- 20 million users (November 20, 2024)
- 25.4 million users (December 18, 2024)
- 33 million users (March 11, 2025)[1]

## Estimating Current User Base (June 2025)

Applying the observed growth rate of approximately 2.5 million new users per month from the March-June 2025 period, we can estimate that Bluesky has likely reached approximately 40-41 million total users by early June 2025. This aligns with the projection that Bluesky would reach 53 million users by December 2025 at current growth rates[1].

Multiple sources confirm a consistent growth rate of 0.5-1 users per second[1][5], which translates to approximately 43,200-86,400 new users daily.

## Unique Posters vs. Total Users

The key distinction for this forecast is between registered users and active posters. According to the available data:

- As of March 2025, approximately 1.18 million posts had been made on Bluesky, averaging 35 posts per user[1]
- Bluesky recorded 3.5 million daily active users in the US and UK combined in early 2025[5]

Additionally, data comparing news influencers on Bluesky versus X indicates that posting activity patterns differ between platforms, with X users generally being more active posters than Bluesky users[2].

## Forecast for June 28, 2025

Based on the available data and trends, I estimate:

1. **Total registered users by June 28, 2025**: Approximately 42 million
   (40-41 million in early June plus ~1.5-2 million new users over 23 days)

2. **Percentage of daily active posters**: Based on the ratio of daily active users to total users and posting patterns, approximately 3-5% of total users are likely to post on any given day

3. **Projected unique posters on June 28, 2025**: Between 1.26 million and 2.1 million

The most likely estimate falls around **1.7 million unique posters** for June 28, 2025.

## Factors That Could Affect This Forecast

Several variables could influence this projection:

1. **Platform events or promotions**: Any special events or promotions planned for late June could temporarily boost posting activity

2. **Competitor actions**: Changes at X/Twitter or other platforms could trigger user migration waves

3. **Seasonal effects**: Summer usage patterns may differ from those observed in earlier months

4. **Growth stabilization**: As platforms mature, growth rates typically moderate; Bluesky may be entering this phase

5. **Technical limitations**: The platform's ability to maintain performance during rapid scaling could affect user engagement

The forecast assumes that current growth patterns will largely continue through June 2025, with some moderation as the platform matures.
