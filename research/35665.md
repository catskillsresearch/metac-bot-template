### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The Rubik's Cube world record for a single 3x3x3 solve has steadily decreased since the 1980s, with a significant acceleration in the last decade due to advances in technique, hardware, and training.
- As of January 2025, only three individualsâ€”Max Park (3.13s in 2023), Ruihang Xu (3.24s in 2024), and Yiheng Wang (3.27s in 2024)â€”have officially solved the cube in under 3.44 seconds at World Cube Association (WCA) events[2][4].
- On February 16, 2025, Yiheng Wang set a new world record with a 3.08s solve, further lowering the best time but not adding a new name to the sub-3.44s list[2][3][5].
- While around 20 people have achieved sub-4s solves, the sub-3.44s mark remains exceptionally rare and exclusive[2].

### Recent Announcements and Policies

- There are no reports of significant rule changes or new technologies that would drastically alter the competitive landscape as of early March 2025.
- The WCA continues to serve as the authoritative body for official results and maintains up-to-date rankings[2][4].

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The World Cube Association (WCA) official rankings and competition results remain the definitive source for verifying whether a new individual has achieved a sub-3.44s solve.
- Recent world record solves and analysis are widely covered by reputable outlets, including Guinness World Records and major cubing channels[1][2][3][5].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- The pace of improvement at the elite level has slowed, with only three people breaking the 3.44s barrier over the last two years.
- While the pool of sub-4s solvers is growing, the leap to sub-3.44s remains significant and may require both exceptional skill and favorable conditions.
- There is always a possibility of an unexpected breakthrough, but no evidence as of March 3, 2025, suggests an imminent fourth sub-3.44s solve.

### Summary Table: Sub-3.44s Solvers as of March 3, 2025

| Name         | Time (s) | Date      |
|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Max Park     | 3.13     | 2023      |
| Ruihang Xu   | 3.24     | 2024      |
| Yiheng Wang  | 3.27, 3.08 | 2024, 2025 |

No fourth individual has achieved a sub-3.44s solve as of the latest available data.
