### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of 2020 and 2025, chess remains unsolved. No proof exists that perfect play leads to a win for either White or Black, or to a forced draw.
- Zermelo's theorem states that for chess, exactly one of three outcomes must hold under perfect play: White wins, Black wins, or a forced draw. All are possible in principle, but only one is true for the initial position[Zermelo's theorem].
- Endgame tablebases (up to seven pieces) have been fully solved, showing that some positions are forced wins or draws, but these do not determine the outcome from the initial position.

### Recent Announcements/Policies

- No announcements or breakthroughs as of 2025 have changed the fundamental uncertainty regarding chess’s game-theoretic value.

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Peer-reviewed mathematical or computer science publications would be required to verify a solution and its result.
- The resolution criteria for the question explicitly require a peer-reviewed article, unchallenged for at least three years, as proof.

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- There is no mathematical or empirical basis as of 2020 (or 2025) to assert that a forced draw is required by the rules or structure of chess.
- The prevailing opinion among chess theorists is that a draw is likely with perfect play, but this is not a certainty or a proof.
- The question asks about logical necessity, not probability. Given Zermelo's theorem, any of the three outcomes is possible until a proof is published.
- The measurement is limited by the absence of a solution and the open nature of the problem.

### Direct Answer

If chess is solved before 2080, perfect play does **not** have to result in a forced draw. According to Zermelo’s theorem, perfect play from the initial position could lead to a forced win for White, a forced win for Black, or a forced draw. There is no requirement—either mathematical or historical—that the solution must be a draw; any of the three outcomes is possible until proven otherwise.

> Chess could be solved as a forced win for White, a forced win for Black, or a forced draw. Current knowledge does not mandate a draw as the only possible result of perfect play.
