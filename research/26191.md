# Forecasting Biden's Candidacy Status Before August 22, 2024

## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

### Biden's Debate Performance and Aftermath

President Biden's performance in the June 27, 2024, debate against former President Trump has created significant turmoil within the Democratic Party. The debate, widely characterized as a "disaster" for Biden, raised concerns about his cognitive abilities and stamina [1]. Following the debate, Biden acknowledged his poor performance but attributed it to exhaustion from travel and a busy schedule, stating: "I wasn't very smart. I decided to travel around the world a couple of times... and I didn't listen to my staff" [2].

Despite mounting pressure, Biden has remained publicly resolute about staying in the race. On July 8, 2024, he stated, "I'm not going anywhere," and emphasized that he is "staying in the race" and will "beat Trump" [3]. In a letter to congressional Democrats on July 8, Biden wrote, "I am firmly committed to staying in this race, to running this race to the end, and to beating Donald Trump" [4].

### Democratic Party Response

As of July 15, 2024, at least 19 Democratic members of Congress had publicly called on Biden to withdraw from the race, including Representatives Adam Smith, Ra√∫l Grijalva, and Senator Peter Welch [5]. This represents a significant increase from the 12 lawmakers reported by Axios on July 11 [6].

Several prominent Democrats have publicly supported Biden's continued candidacy, including former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, and former President Barack Obama [7]. However, reports indicate that private discussions about potential alternatives are ongoing among party leaders [8].

### Polling and Electoral Outlook

Recent polling has shown concerning trends for Biden's campaign. A New York Times/Siena College poll conducted after the debate showed Trump leading Biden by 6 percentage points nationally (49% to 43%) [9]. More concerning for Democrats, the same poll showed Trump leading in five of six battleground states that are likely to determine the election outcome [9].

A CBS News poll released on July 14, 2024, found that 72% of Democrats believe the party should nominate someone other than Biden, while only 28% believe he should remain the nominee [10]. This represents a dramatic shift in intra-party sentiment since before the debate.

## Recent Announcements and Developments

### Campaign Operations

On July 11, 2024, NBC News reported that Biden campaign staffers were expressing doubts about his path to victory, with some indicating they believed he could not win the general election [11]. The report also noted that fundraising efforts had been negatively impacted following the debate performance.

Biden's campaign has attempted to project stability and determination. Campaign chair Jen O'Malley Dillon stated on July 9, 2024, "The president is not going anywhere except back to the White House for four more years" [12]. The campaign announced a $96 million fundraising haul for the second quarter of 2024, though it's worth noting that most of this was raised before the debate [13].

### Potential Process for Replacement

On July 15, 2024, Reuters reported that Democrats were considering holding a virtual vote in late July to formally nominate Biden, despite the ongoing turmoil [14]. This would be earlier than the traditional nomination at the Democratic National Convention scheduled for August 19-22, 2024.

The Democratic National Committee rules allow for replacing a nominee who withdraws after being formally nominated. In such a scenario, the DNC chair would consult with Democratic congressional leaders and governors to recommend a replacement candidate, followed by a vote of the full DNC membership [15].

### Biden's Health and Capacity

White House officials have consistently defended Biden's cognitive abilities and overall health. On July 10, 2024, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre stated that Biden undergoes regular health assessments and that his doctors have found him "fit to serve" [16].

However, anonymous sources within the administration have expressed concerns about Biden's stamina and cognitive sharpness, particularly in the evenings and after long days of work [17]. These reports have contributed to the growing unease among Democrats about Biden's candidacy.

## Historical Precedents

There is limited historical precedent for a major party's presumptive nominee withdrawing this late in the election cycle. The most relevant example is President Lyndon B. Johnson's March 31, 1968 announcement that he would not seek re-election, though this came much earlier in the election year [18].

In 1972, Democratic vice-presidential nominee Thomas Eagleton withdrew from the ticket after revelations about his mental health history, but this involved replacing a running mate rather than the presidential nominee [19].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors create uncertainty in forecasting Biden's decision:

1. **Biden's personal resolve**: The president has consistently expressed determination to remain in the race, making a voluntary withdrawal uncertain [3].

2. **Evolving party sentiment**: The number of Democrats calling for Biden to step aside has grown rapidly, and this trend could accelerate or stabilize [5].

3. **Polling volatility**: Post-debate polls may not fully reflect long-term voter sentiment, and future events could shift public opinion [20].

4. **Health considerations**: While no acute health issues have been publicly disclosed, the president's age (81) creates inherent uncertainty about potential health developments [21].

5. **Alternative candidates**: The lack of a clear consensus alternative to Biden complicates the decision-making process for both Biden and party leaders [22].
