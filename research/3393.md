# Forecasting Analysis: Will DNA Testing Vindicate Jeanne Calment?

As of December 3, 2019, the controversy surrounding Jeanne Calment's record as the oldest verified person in history (122 years and 164 days) presents an interesting forecasting challenge. This analysis examines available evidence and assesses the likelihood of DNA testing confirming her identity.

## Current Situation and Evidence

The debate centers on whether the woman who died in 1997 was truly Jeanne Calment (born 1875) or her daughter Yvonne Calment (born 1898) who allegedly assumed her mother's identity. Key facts as of late 2019:

### Evidence Supporting Jeanne's Identity

Several French scientists published a paper in *The Journals of Gerontology* in September 2019 presenting substantial evidence supporting Calment's validated age, including:
- Multiple official documents
- Census data
- Photographic evidence
- Statistical possibility of reaching her reported age[1]

The authors criticized the identity switch hypothesis and called for a retraction of Zak's article that had challenged Calment's age[1].

Fran√ßois Robin-Champigneul has stated that "the hypothesis of an identity swap with her daughter appears not even realistic given the context and the facts, and not supported by evidence"[1].

### Evidence Supporting the Identity Switch Hypothesis

In February 2020 (not yet published as of our December 2019 cutoff date), Zak and Philip Gibbs would publish an assessment using Bayes' theorem that claimed a "99.99% chance of an identity switch"[1]. However, this approach has been criticized as "subjective and nonrigorous"[1].

As of September 2019, proponents of the identity switch hypothesis acknowledge they lack definitive proof and are operating on probabilities[5].

## Key Differentiating Factor: DNA Evidence Potential

The most significant development is the discovery that DNA testing could conclusively resolve this debate:

1. **Genetic Distinction**: Jeanne Calment had 16 distinct great-great-grandparents, while her daughter Yvonne had only 12 due to inbreeding[1][5].

2. **Sample Availability**: As of late 2019, it appears blood samples from Mme Calment have been preserved and could be tested without exhumation[5].

3. **Testing Feasibility**: Geneticists have noted that testing for autozygous DNA could easily settle the identity question if a blood or tissue sample were made available[1].

4. **Scientific Consensus**: There is agreement that DNA testing would be "near conclusive if DNA can be made available and legal hurdles can be overcome"[4].

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on available evidence as of December 2019, I assess the following probabilities:

1. **Probability DNA testing will occur**: ~70%
   - Blood samples exist and there is significant scientific interest
   - Legal hurdles remain a potential obstacle

2. **Probability testing would vindicate Jeanne Calment**: ~75%
   - The official validation process was thorough
   - Multiple lines of evidence support her identity
   - The identity switch hypothesis relies more on circumstantial evidence
   - Most experts in the field support the validation

3. **Key uncertainties**:
   - Legal permission to test existing samples
   - Quality/viability of preserved samples
   - Potential political/national pride factors in France

## Forecast

Based on the available evidence as of December 3, 2019, I assess a **~75% probability** that DNA testing would vindicate Jeanne Calment as the oldest recorded person in history. The key determining factor will be the autozygosity testing that can distinguish between 12 and 16 great-great-grandparents.

The most decisive evidence would come from DNA testing that is technically feasible with existing samples. The scientific consensus recognizes this test would be definitive, and the genetic difference between mother and daughter (due to different levels of inbreeding) provides a clear marker for identification[1][5].
