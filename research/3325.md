## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- In 2017, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) reported that 70.95 billion poultry were slaughtered worldwide[1].
- Poultry production has shown robust growth globally, driven by increasing demand for affordable animal-source protein, especially in Asia and Latin America[2][5].
- Poultry is expected to account for 41% of all meat-based proteins by 2030, up from previous years[4].

## 2. Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Metric

- The OECD-FAO Agricultural Outlook 2021â€“2030 projects poultry meat production will reach 153 million tonnes by 2030, with the highest growth in Asia and Central/South America[3][5].
- Both the volume of slaughtered poultry and overall poultry meat production are expected to rise, with chicken accounting for most of the increase[5].
- No major international policy changes or disease outbreaks as of 2019-11-10 appear likely to substantially alter this trend.

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- FAO datasets on livestock production (FAOSTAT)[1].
- OECD-FAO Agricultural Outlook reports[3][5].

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- Estimates depend on consistent definitions of "poultry" and "slaughtered" in FAO data collection.
- Disease outbreaks (e.g., avian influenza), shifts in consumer demand, and developments in alternative proteins could affect future slaughter numbers, although no such major disruptions were evident as of 2019-11-10.
- FAO projections are periodically revised as new data emerges.

## 5. Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Based on the above, the best estimate as of 2019-11-10 for the number of billions of poultry slaughtered worldwide in 2030, per FAO methodology, is:

> **Between 95 and 116 billion, with a median estimate of approximately 102 billion poultry slaughtered in 2030**[1].

This reflects sustained growth from the 2017 baseline, moderate annual increases, and consensus among expert and community forecasts.
