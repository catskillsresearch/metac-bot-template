## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- **Call Her Daddy** remains one of the most consistently high-ranking podcasts in the US. Edison Research ranks it in the top six for Q1 2025, with no change since Q4 2024, indicating strong, sustained audience reach[4]. Spotify’s own annual wrap-up for 2024 ranked it as the number two podcast in the US, behind only The Joe Rogan Experience[5]. It is regularly featured in top podcast charts, including on Spotify’s own platform[1][3].
- **Candace** managed to outrank Call Her Daddy on March 31, 2025, according to the reference Metaculus question. However, there is no evidence in current public industry rankings (Edison, Podnews, Spotify’s own charts) placing Candace above Call Her Daddy as of late May 2025[1][4][5]. There is also no indication from recent news of a major surge, collaboration, or controversy that would give Candace a durable edge.

## Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- There are no known recent Spotify chart methodology changes or major platform announcements that would impact the comparative rankings of these two shows as of the end of May 2025.
- No news of major format changes, host departures, or exclusive deals affecting either podcast has been reported in the past quarter.

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Spotify’s official Podcast Charts, which are referenced in the resolution criteria and updated daily for the US[1].
- Edison Research’s Podcast Metrics, which provide quarterly reach-based rankings for the US[4].
- Podnews and Podchaser, which aggregate Spotify chart rankings and industry news[3][5].

## Limitations or Uncertainties in Measurement

- **Daily Volatility**: Spotify’s chart can fluctuate daily, so a single-day snapshot (July 1) may not reflect the longer-term trend.
- **Platform-Specific Measurement**: Spotify’s rankings are based on internal listening data and may differ from third-party metrics (like Edison’s reach ranking).
- **Insufficient Recent Data for Candace**: There is a lack of public third-party data tracking Candace’s daily Spotify chart position into late May 2025, making it difficult to gauge whether its March 31 surge was sustained.
- **Potential for Sudden Events**: Any viral moment, controversy, or strategic collaboration could rapidly alter rankings on short notice.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the consistent top-tier performance of Call Her Daddy, its entrenched position in major podcast rankings, and the absence of evidence for a sustained lead by Candace, there is a high probability that Call Her Daddy will again outrank Candace on the Spotify US Top Podcasts chart on July 1, 2025. However, given the precedent of Candace’s March 31, 2025, win and the inherent volatility in rankings, I estimate:

- **Call Her Daddy**: 80% chance of being ranked higher
- **Candace**: 20% chance of being ranked higher

This forecast should be verified against the official Spotify Podcast Charts on July 1, 2025, as per the resolution criteria.
