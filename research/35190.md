# Will Any US Federal Judges Be Impeached Before April 1, 2025?

Based on information available as of February 19, 2025, there are significant developments regarding federal judicial impeachment that are relevant to this forecast.

## Current Status and Recent Developments

As of February 18, 2025, the U.S. House of Representatives has introduced House Resolution 143, which states that Paul Engelmayer, judge of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, "is impeached for high crimes and misdemeanors."[3] This resolution represents a formal impeachment proceeding against Judge Engelmayer, though the specific stage in the process requires careful consideration.

## Understanding Judicial Impeachment

Federal judges, appointed under Article III of the Constitution, can only be removed from office through the impeachment process.[2] This process involves:

1. **Initiation**: A member or committee of the House of Representatives must start proceedings.[5]
2. **Investigation**: A committee investigates allegations through fact-finding hearings.[5]
3. **Articles of Impeachment**: If wrongdoing is determined, formal articles are drafted.[5]
4. **House Vote**: The full House must vote, with a simple majority needed to impeach.[5]
5. **Senate Trial**: If impeached by the House, the Senate conducts a trial, with a two-thirds majority required for conviction and removal.[5]

It's important to note that for the purpose of this forecast question, only the House impeachment vote (step 4) is relevant, not the Senate conviction.

## Historical Context

Historically, impeachment of federal judges has been rare. Notable examples include:

- Samuel B. Kent (U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas): Impeached by the House on June 19, 2009, on charges of sexual assault and obstruction. He resigned before Senate trial completion.[4]

- G. Thomas Porteous, Jr. (U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana): Impeached by the House on March 11, 2010, on charges of accepting bribes and making false statements. He was convicted by the Senate and removed from office on December 8, 2010.[4]

These historical cases demonstrate that the impeachment process can move relatively quickly once formal proceedings begin.

## Analysis for Forecast

The introduction of H.Res.143 on February 18, 2025, impeaching Judge Paul Engelmayer, suggests that at least one federal judge may be impeached before April 1, 2025.[3] However, the exact status of this resolution in the House process (whether it has been voted on by the full House or is still in committee) is not entirely clear from the available information.

The impeachment process typically involves multiple steps, including committee investigation and a full House vote.[5] The timeline from introduction of articles to a House vote can vary significantly based on political priorities and the complexity of the case.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors could affect the outcome of this forecast:

1. **Procedural Timeline**: The House may need to complete committee investigations before a full vote, which could extend beyond April 1, 2025.

2. **Resignation**: As seen in previous cases like Judge Kent, judges facing impeachment sometimes resign before the process is complete.[4]

3. **Political Dynamics**: The current political composition of the House and its leadership's priorities will influence how quickly impeachment proceedings advance.

4. **Evidentiary Developments**: New evidence could either accelerate or delay the impeachment process.

## Conclusion

Based on the introduction of H.Res.143 on February 18, 2025, there appears to be an active impeachment proceeding against at least one federal judge (Paul Engelmayer).[3] While this suggests a possibility of impeachment before April 1, 2025, the exact timeline depends on House procedures and political factors that cannot be definitively predicted with the available information.
