### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Pantone’s Color of the Year selections from 2015–2024 have included a range of hues: red, blue, violet, green, yellow, and orange. The last yellow selection was “Illuminating” in 2021[2].
- The 2024 Color of the Year was “Peach Fuzz,” an orange shade, indicating a recent preference for warm, comforting colors[2].
- For 2025, Pantone’s trend forecasts and fashion week palettes emphasize earthy, natural tones: deep green, earthy orange, gold, purple, and light blue[2][4].
- Industry observers and color experts predict that the 2025 Color of the Year will likely be a warm brown (“Mocha Mousse”), a muted neutral, or possibly a green or blue. Yellow is mentioned as a trending color but is not the leading candidate[3][4].

### Recent Announcements and Policies

- As of November 15, 2024, Pantone had not officially announced the 2025 Color of the Year. The announcement is expected on December 5, 2024[3].
- The most widely cited prediction for Pantone’s 2025 Color of the Year is “Mocha Mousse,” a warm brown, which falls outside the yellow hue range[3].
- Pantone’s Spring/Summer 2025 trend forecasts and fashion week palettes do include a yellow shade (“Yellow Jasper”), but it is not the dominant color in these reports[4].

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Pantone’s official website and trend reports[1][5].
- Industry analyses and predictions from design and color trend experts[2][3][4].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- Pantone’s final Color of the Year selection is confidential until the official announcement, and the company sometimes makes unexpected choices.
- Forecasts are based on trend analysis and expert opinion, not on inside information.
- The resolution depends on the precise hue of the selected color, which will be determined by its HSV value.

### Conclusion

Based on all available information as of November 15, 2024, yellow is present in some 2025 trend palettes but is not the leading prediction for Pantone’s Color of the Year. The consensus among industry observers points toward a warm brown or neutral, with some speculation about green or blue. Therefore, it is unlikely that yellow will be the closest color to the 2025 Pantone Color of the Year, though uncertainty remains until the official announcement[2][3][4].
