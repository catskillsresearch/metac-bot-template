## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Great Britain has maintained a constitutional monarchy since the Stuart Restoration in 1660, with the monarch serving as a ceremonial head of state[1].
- The monarchy's powers have diminished over centuries, making the role largely symbolic by 2021[1].
- Worldwide, monarchies have declined from over 150 in 1900 to 44 by 2019, but most remaining European monarchies (including the UK) are stable and ceremonial[1].
- As of 2020, a YouGov poll showed 62% of British adults supported retaining the monarchy, with only 22% opposed[1].

## 2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- No legislation or major political movement to abolish the monarchy was present in the UK as of March 2021[1].
- The monarchy remains integrated into the UK's constitution, with no formal proposals for transition to a republic as of that date[1].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- YouGov polling data (2020) indicating strong public support for the monarchy[1].
- Historical data on the persistence and structure of the British monarchy[1].
- Global trends in the number of monarchies, showing stabilization among remaining monarchies[1].

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- Forecasts over a 54-year horizon are subject to significant uncertainty from unpredictable political, social, or economic events.
- Demographic shifts and changes in public opinion could erode support, especially if the monarchy is involved in scandals or if republican sentiment grows.
- External shocks (e.g., constitutional crises, wars, or global movements) could accelerate institutional change.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the monarchy's historical resilience, structural entrenchment in the UK constitution, and strong public support as of 2021, the probability that at least 1% of Great Britain’s population will live under a monarchy in 2075 is high—estimated at greater than 75%, barring unforeseen, transformative events.
