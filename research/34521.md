## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of late April 2025, two federal agencies (not yet specified, but typically DOJ and/or DOE in such cases) have launched Title VI investigations into Harvard and the Harvard Law Review, citing allegations of discrimination based on race and gender[1].
- The federal government, under the Trump Administration, has issued direct demands to Harvard to overhaul admissions and DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) policies, including eliminating some DEI-related student organizations and instituting comprehensive audits for viewpoint diversity. Harvard has refused these demands, leading to a freeze on more than $2 billion in federal funding[2][3].
- The administration has publicly suggested further punitive actions, such as considering the revocation of Harvard’s tax-exempt status, intensifying the pressure on the university regarding its diversity-related practices[3].

## Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Metric

- In April 2025, the administration sent a formal letter requiring Harvard to cease “all preferences based on race, color, national origin,” and to certify compliance after each admissions cycle. The letter also mandated audits for viewpoint diversity, specifically referencing DEI-related initiatives and student clubs[2].
- Harvard has publicly disputed the legal basis of these demands and has initiated litigation over the funding freeze, but the administration has not lifted the freeze or retracted its demands[3].
- Congressional action (e.g., House Oversight Committee investigations) is ongoing, but the question focuses on DOJ/DOE investigations, not legislative inquiries[5].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Formal investigative announcements (e.g., Title VI investigations) are covered by reputable outlets and official university communications[1][2][3]. These sources will be critical for confirming whether an investigation meets the resolution criteria.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- The primary uncertainty is whether the federal agencies’ investigations, already in progress, explicitly and officially cite concerns about discrimination or preferences in connection to Harvard’s diversity-related programs (DEI, affirmative action replacements, etc.), as required by the resolution criteria.
- There is also some ambiguity as to which agencies (DOJ, DOE, or others) are leading the current Title VI investigations; precise agency attribution is needed for resolution.
- While current investigations are broad and aggressive, a technicality could arise if they are framed solely as responses to other forms of discrimination (e.g., antisemitism or gender) and not directly to diversity-related preferences.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given:
- The explicit targeting of DEI policies by the federal government,
- The existence of ongoing Title VI investigations against Harvard as of April 2025,
- The administration’s public commitment to rooting out what it sees as illegal discrimination or preferences in higher education diversity programs,

**It is highly probable (well above 75%) that by January 1, 2026, the DOJ or DOE will have formally opened a civil rights or Title VI investigation into whether diversity-related programs at Harvard constitute illegal discrimination or preferences, or that the existing investigations will expand to officially and publicly include this scope.** The only scenario in which this does not occur is if political or legal obstacles halt or redirect the current investigations away from diversity-related programs specifically.
