# Federal Reserve Interest Rate Forecast: Cuts Before December 1, 2024

## Current Status and Historical Trends

As of May 2025, the Federal Reserve has already begun its interest rate easing cycle. In September 2024, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) lowered interest rates by 50 basis points, bringing the target range to 4.75% to 5.00%[1]. This marked the first rate cut in four years, signaling a significant shift in monetary policy.

The September 2024 rate cut came after a period of relatively higher interest rates that had been maintained to combat inflation. The Fed's decision to ease monetary policy was based on progress toward its dual mandate, with the statement noting that the Committee had "gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably towards two percent"[1]. August 2024 inflation data showed inflation at 2.5%, considerably closer to the Fed's 2% target[1].

## Recent Announcements and Forecasts

Following the September 2024 rate cut, multiple financial institutions have forecasted additional rate cuts before the end of 2024:

- TD Securities projected that the FOMC would implement additional 25 basis point rate cuts in both November and December 2024, with the upper end of the Fed funds target range expected to end 2024 at 4.75%[5].

- Fitch Ratings expected the federal funds target (upper) rate to fall to 4.5% by the end of 2024, implying at least one more rate cut after September[3].

These forecasts align with the Fed's own projections. The Summary of Economic Projections released on September 18, 2024, provided insights into FOMC members' expectations for future rate movements[2].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

The primary sources for verifying Federal Reserve interest rate decisions include:

1. The Federal Reserve's official announcements following FOMC meetings
2. The Summary of Economic Projections released quarterly by the Fed
3. Federal Reserve meeting minutes

The September 2024 FOMC statement explicitly mentioned that the Fed remains committed to "achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of two percent over the longer run"[1]. This commitment, combined with the Fed's assessment that risks to its dual mandate are "roughly in balance," suggests a continued easing bias[1].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

While forecasts strongly suggest additional rate cuts before December 1, 2024, several factors could influence the Fed's decision-making:

1. **Economic Data**: Unexpected changes in inflation, employment, or growth data could alter the Fed's planned path.

2. **Pace of Easing**: While a November rate cut appears likely based on current forecasts, the size of the cut (25bp vs 50bp) remains uncertain.

3. **External Factors**: Global economic conditions, financial market stability, or unexpected events could impact the Fed's decisions.

TD Securities noted that the main risk to their forecast is that "Fed leadership finds itself needing to go back to a neutral stance much sooner than we currently anticipate," which could potentially accelerate the pace of rate cuts[5].

## Conclusion

Based on the available information as of May 2025, there is strong evidence suggesting that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates before December 1, 2024. The Fed has already begun its easing cycle with a 50 basis point cut in September 2024, and multiple credible forecasts indicate an additional cut is likely in November 2024. The Fed's own communications suggest a continued easing bias as inflation moves closer to its 2% target and as it seeks to support economic growth and stabilize the labor market.
