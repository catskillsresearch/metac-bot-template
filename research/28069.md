## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The Rivian Stories site (https://stories.rivian.com/) features periodic posts about company updates, product features, and community events. The most recent post confirmed in the search results is dated January 15, 2024, covering the R1 Gen 2 Carbon Footprint Reports[5].
- The site lists several other stories, but none are timestamped after January 2024 in the available search results. However, the question asserts that as of September 8, 2024, the most recent post was August 15, 2024. This suggests that posts do occur, but the frequency is unclear from the search results alone.

## Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- There are no search results indicating any recent announcements or changes in Rivian's communication strategy that would affect the likelihood of new posts on the Stories site.
- No evidence suggests a pause or acceleration in posting frequency.

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The only authoritative source for resolving this question is the Rivian Stories site itself (https://stories.rivian.com/)[5].
- No other web address or social media channel is relevant for resolution.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- The search results do not provide a comprehensive posting history or confirm the August 15, 2024, post mentioned in the question.
- There is no information on the site's technical reliability, but no evidence suggests it is likely to be down.
- The lack of recent posts in the search results may be due to incomplete indexing rather than a lack of updates.

## Summary

- Rivian Stories has a history of periodic updates, but the exact frequency is unclear based on available data.
- There are no known factors that would prevent a new post before October 1, 2024, nor is there evidence of an imminent update.
- The main uncertainties are the incomplete visibility into the site's posting cadence and the technical reliability of the site.
