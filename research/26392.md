## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- OpenAI has historically released major GPT models at intervals of roughly one year or more, with GPT-4 announced in March 2023 and GPT-4o in May 2024.
- As of July 22, 2024, OpenAI has not publicly announced GPT-5 or published any document describing its performance or existence[1][2][3][5].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- On May 13, 2024, OpenAI announced GPT-4o, not GPT-5.
- In late May 2024, OpenAI confirmed it had begun training its "next frontier model," widely believed to be GPT-5, but did not announce the model or publish results[2].
- Multiple reports from March 2024 suggested a possible mid-year (summer) release for GPT-5, with some enterprise demos reportedly shown, but no public announcement or publication as of the cutoff[3][5].
- Some sources indicate a roadmap targeting a summer 2025 release for GPT-5, which would be after the September 30, 2024, deadline[1].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- OpenAI's official blog and press releases are the primary sources for announcements.
- Business Insider and Business Today have reported on internal demos and expected timelines, but these do not constitute public announcements[3][5].
- Community discussions and OpenAI forums confirm training is underway but do not provide evidence of a public announcement[2][4].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- Internal demos to select customers do not meet the resolution criteria.
- Hints or statements about ongoing training or future plans do not qualify unless accompanied by a public document describing GPT-5's performance or existence.
- OpenAI could make an unexpected announcement, but as of July 22, 2024, there is no public evidence to suggest this will occur before September 30, 2024.

## Conclusion

As of July 22, 2024, there is no public announcement or publication by OpenAI regarding GPT-5. While training is underway and internal demos may have occurred, these do not meet the resolution criteria. Most credible sources suggest that a public announcement before September 30, 2024, is unlikely, with some roadmaps pointing to a 2025 release[1][3][5].
