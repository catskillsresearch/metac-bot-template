## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Four U.S. Presidents have been assassinated while in office: Lincoln (1865), Garfield (1881), McKinley (1901), Kennedy (1963)[1][2].
- Since JFK's assassination in 1963, there have been no successful assassinations of sitting U.S. Presidents, though there have been several credible attempts, such as the shooting of President Reagan in 1981; Reagan survived and completed his term[1][2][3].
- The frequency of assassination attempts remains, but the success rate has dropped dramatically since the Secret Service and other agencies overhauled presidential security post-1963[2][5].

## Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- As of 2018, the U.S. Secret Service had not reported major changes that would increase presidential risk. Security protocols, technology, and intelligence sharing have been continually updated, particularly after notable incidents and in response to evolving threats[2][5].
- No successful attempts on a sitting president have occurred in over 55 years, despite ongoing threats and attempts[1][2].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Wikipedia entry on U.S. presidential assassination attempts and plots provides a comprehensive list of successful and failed attacks[1].
- Congressional Research Service reports and reputable historical summaries document attempts, motivations, and outcomes[2][3][5].
- Statista and other data sources provide timelines and visuals of historical trends[4].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- The unpredictability of lone-wolf attackers, technological advances (e.g., drones), and systemic or intelligence failures introduce irreducible uncertainty.
- While security measures are robust and have proven effective, no system is flawless, and new threat vectors may emerge.
- The assessment is based on data up to July 2018; future developments in technology, politics, or security could alter the risk profile.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the historical rate of successful assassinations (four in nearly 230 years, none since 1963), the greatly improved security environment post-1963, and the lack of recent successful attacks, it is more probable than not that the next assassination of a sitting U.S. President will occur after January 1, 2100. Nevertheless, the risk per presidency is not zero, and compounding risks across many terms before 2100 mean that while the probability is lower than in the past, it is not negligible.
