### 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Alcor has utilized vitrification (without fixative) as its standard cryopreservation method since 2001, emphasizing the preservation of biological viability[5].
- Aldehyde-Stabilized Cryopreservation (ASC), which uses glutaraldehyde as a fixative, won the Large Mammal Brain Preservation Foundation Prize in 2018, demonstrating superior ultrastructural preservation but at the cost of biological viability[4][5].
- As of 2018, Alcor published a position statement noting interest in ASC as a research direction but stating no current plans to adopt the protocol for member procedures. They highlighted ongoing debates and even cited ASC’s lead developer recommending against adopting ASC for cryonics at that time[5].
- Alcor’s research initiatives in 2020 continued to focus on improving vitrification techniques and reducing toxicity, with no announcements regarding adoption of fixative-based protocols[1][2][3].

### 2. Recent Announcements and Policies

- In 2018, Alcor publicly stated there were no plans to adopt ASC or any fixative-based protocol, favoring continued improvement of vitrification[5].
- Through 2020, Alcor’s official communications and research focus remained on vitrification and related innovations, not on the use of fixatives[1][2][3].

### 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Alcor’s official blog and policy statements[5]
- Updates and research summaries from Alcor’s website[1][2][3]
- External analysis and forecasting discussions (e.g., Metaculus)[4]

### 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- This assessment is based on public statements and policies as of May 2020. Internal research or future developments could alter Alcor’s trajectory.
- The forecast does not account for potential disruptive scientific advancements or dramatic shifts in member demand or regulatory environment before 2030.

### Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given Alcor’s conservative approach, explicit preference for viability-preserving methods, and lack of public plans to adopt fixative protocols as of 2020, the probability that Alcor will offer the use of a fixative during cryopreservation procedures before 2030 is **low**.

> It remains much more likely Alcor will continue refining vitrification rather than implement fixative-based methods like ASC before 2030, unless compelling new evidence or member demand emerges.
