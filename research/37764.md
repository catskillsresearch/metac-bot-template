## California’s Annualized GDP Growth Forecast for Q1 2025

**1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status**
- California’s seasonally-adjusted annual GDP growth rate (unadjusted for inflation) for Q4 2024 was 6.0%[1].
- Real (inflation-adjusted) GDP growth for Q1 2025 slowed to 1.2%, down from 3.1% in Q4 2023 and below the U.S. average[5].
- The national U.S. real GDP growth for Q1 2025 was -0.3%, indicating broader economic headwinds[3].
- The state’s tech sector and AI services continue to drive productivity and spending, but overall growth is moderating[4].

**2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric**
- The 2025-26 California budget projects inflation falling to 2.3% in 2025, with interest rates expected to ease, supporting housing and credit-sensitive sectors[2].
- Housing and construction are expected to rebound in 2025, though risks remain from insurance market instability and potential changes in immigration policy[4].
- California continues to outperform other major world economies in nominal terms, but the gap is narrowing[1].

**3. Authoritative Sources for Verification**
- FRED Gross Domestic Product: All Industry Total in California (CANQGSP) will provide the official Q1 2025 value when released (units: Percent Change from Year Ago, Seasonally Adjusted Annual Rate).
- Additional verification can be obtained from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis for national context[3].

**4. Limitations and Uncertainties**
- Most available data is real GDP (inflation-adjusted), while the resolution metric is nominal GDP.
- Early estimates are subject to revision.
- California-specific shocks or policy changes (e.g., in housing, insurance, or tech) may cause deviations.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

- Given the sharp slowdown in real growth but persistent nominal tailwinds (mild inflation, strong sectors), the most probable outcome is that California’s Q1 2025 nominal GDP growth rate will moderate from Q4 2024 but remain in the upper half of the open bounds.
- **Most Likely Range:** 4.5% – 5.5% (seasonally-adjusted annual rate, unadjusted for inflation).
- **Median Forecast:** 5.0%
- **Probability Distribution:** 
  - <4.5%: 15%
  - 4.5–5.5%: 60%
  - 5.5–6.5%: 20%
  - >6.5%: 5%

This reflects a slowdown from 2024 highs, with nominal growth buoyed by inflation and sectoral resilience, but with moderation in line with recent real GDP trends and broader U.S. economic softness[3][4][5].
