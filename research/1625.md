### Historical Trends and Current Status (as of 2018-12-16)

- IQ scores in healthy adults are highly stable over time, with test–retest reliability such that significant changes are rare without brain injury, pathology, or major environmental shifts.
- No pharmacological, behavioral, or technological intervention has demonstrated the ability to increase IQ by two standard deviations (30 points on a standard scale) in healthy adults in under 30 days.
- Known cognitive enhancers (e.g., stimulants, nootropics) may produce modest, short-term improvements in attention or working memory, but not in general intelligence as measured by standardized IQ tests.
- Intelligence amplification (IA) and AI are being developed to *augment* human decision-making and problem-solving, but not to increase measured IQ in the absence of external aids[2][3].

### Recent Announcements/Policies

- As of late 2018, most research and policy focus has been on using AI to support or augment human cognitive capabilities—not to radically increase baseline intelligence scores[1][2][3].
- No major breakthroughs or policy directives suggest imminent development of interventions capable of rapidly increasing adult IQ by two SDs.

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Psychometric literature emphasizing the stability and predictive validity of IQ tests, including peer-reviewed meta-analyses and textbooks[2][3].
- Reports and analyses from AI and intelligence amplification communities, which focus on augmenting human capabilities rather than increasing measured IQ[2][3].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- While practice effects and coaching can yield small, short-lived IQ gains, the forecast’s strict controls (test supervision, independent test-takers, and multiple tests) are designed to prevent these from affecting results.
- Future breakthroughs in neurotechnology, genetics, or AI-augmented cognition are possible but speculative as of 2018; there is no established pathway to achieving the specified IQ increase in the specified timeframe.
- The reliability of IQ measurement at the extremes (after a +2 SD change) is limited, but the resolution criteria attempt to mitigate this by excluding ultra-high initial scorers.

### Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the absence of any intervention as of 2018 capable of producing such large, rapid IQ gains in healthy adults, and the lack of a clear technological roadmap to such interventions, the probability of this outcome by 2050 is low—likely under 10%, barring radical, currently unforeseeable advances in neurotechnology, genetics, or AI-human integration[2][3].
