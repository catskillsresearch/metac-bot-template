## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- No nuclear weapon has been used in warfare since 1945. In every prior crisis involving nuclear powers—including the Cold War, the Cuban Missile Crisis, and the 2022–2025 Ukraine conflict—nuclear threats have been made but not acted upon[4].
- Since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Russian officials (including Putin) have repeatedly invoked nuclear threats, especially during periods of military pressure or setbacks[3][4][5].
- As of late 2024 and early 2025, Russia has: placed nuclear forces on higher alert, conducted tactical nuclear drills, deployed tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus (a first since the USSR’s collapse), and updated its nuclear doctrine in ways seen as lowering the threshold for use[5].
- Despite this, the West has increased military and diplomatic support to Ukraine without provoking nuclear use, demonstrating a pattern: Russia’s “red lines” have been crossed repeatedly without escalation to nuclear detonation[4][5].

## 2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- November 2024: Putin approved an updated nuclear doctrine, reportedly lowering the threshold for tactical nuclear weapon use, though details remain ambiguous[5].
- May 2024: Russia conducted highly publicized tactical nuclear weapon drills, directly linking them to Western “provocations” and NATO support for Ukraine[3][5].
- Russian leadership and state TV continue to float the idea of tactical nuclear use, including scenarios involving Russian territory occupied by Ukrainian forces or major battlefield reversals[4].
- U.S. and NATO intelligence consistently judge that nuclear use is unlikely unless Russia perceives an existential threat to its regime or territorial integrity[2].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) assessments (2025) consider tactical nuclear use unlikely barring existential threat[2].
- UK Parliament and Commons Library briefings summarize increased Russian nuclear signaling and doctrinal changes, but also note lack of actual use[3][5].
- Open-source intelligence and academic analysis corroborate the pattern of nuclear saber-rattling without operational follow-through[4][5].

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- Actual Russian nuclear decision-making is opaque; public doctrine and drills may be intended as deterrence or psychological warfare[1][4].
- Unpredictable events—such as regime instability, catastrophic battlefield defeat, or unauthorized launch—remain low-probability but high-impact risks[4].
- The risk of inadvertent escalation, miscalculation, or communication breakdown cannot be fully discounted.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

- **Relative to historical precedent, the probability of Russian nuclear use in Ukraine or Ukrainian-held territory before 2026 remains low, but higher than at any time since 1945.**
- Key differences from past crises: explicit lowering of nuclear threshold, battlefield setbacks, and routine nuclear signaling by Russian leadership.
- **Adjusted estimate:** The likelihood remains well below 10% barring unforeseen existential threats to the Russian regime or state, but is meaningfully above zero given doctrinal shifts and continued escalation risks[2][4][5].
