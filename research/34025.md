## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Since its inception in 1967, the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) has been amended to reinforce transparency, most notably with the 2016 update that increased the presumption of disclosure and narrowed agency discretion to withhold information[4].
- FOIA currently applies to all executive branch departments and agencies, including the CIA and EPA, with nine well-defined exemptions (e.g., for classified information, internal rules, law enforcement, national security) and three narrow exclusions, but not agency-wide carve-outs[3][4][5].
- Recent updates (as of January 2025) concern the application and clarification of existing statutory exemptions, rather than new legislative exemptions for specific agencies[1].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- The January 21, 2025, Federal Register entry addresses application procedures for current FOIA exemptions but does not announce or discuss any new legislation exempting executive branch agencies from FOIA[1].
- March 2025 and June 2024 guides and overviews from FOIA.gov and the Congressional Research Service confirm that existing law is unchanged, with no new department- or agency-specific FOIA exemptions reported[2][4][5].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The official FOIA.gov portal and Congressional Research Service reports are authoritative references for statutory status and recent changes[2][3][4][5].
- The Federal Register is the official record for agency rulemaking and notices regarding FOIA implementation[1].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- Legislative activity can sometimes move quickly, and not all proposals are widely reported in real time. However, high-profile changes to FOIA applicability would almost certainly be tracked in congressional records and mainstream reporting.
- This assessment is based on information available up to January 31, 2025. It is possible, though unlikely, that relevant developments could have occurred very recently or with limited public visibility.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Based on all available evidence as of January 31, 2025, the probability that legislation has been approved by at least one chamber of Congress in 2025 that partially or fully exempts at least one executive branch department, the CIA, or EPA from FOIA is extremely lowâ€”well below 5%. There is no credible evidence or reporting to support such a development as of the cut-off date.
