## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) has long provided for nine statutory exemptions and three special law enforcement/national security exclusions, allowing agencies to withhold certain types of information[3][5].
- Historically, Congress has rarely passed blanket, agency-specific FOIA exemptions for major executive departments. Instead, most limitations are categorical (e.g., classified information, national security, law enforcement) or arise from separate statutes referenced by FOIA's exemption 3[2][5].
- Previous major legislative changes (such as the 2016 FOIA Improvement Act) have generally increased transparency or clarified the use of exemptions rather than creating new broad agency carve-outs[4].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- As of January–March 2025, recent regulatory updates referenced in the Federal Register address application of existing FOIA exemptions but do not create new statutory exemptions for specific agencies[1].
- The official FOIA portal and recent congressional guides reiterate the scope of current exemptions and do not signal imminent statutory changes for the Department of Defense, CIA, EPA, or other listed agencies[4][5].
- No credible sources or congressional records as of January 31, 2025, report that either chamber has passed legislation granting new, agency-specific exemptions from FOIA for any of the listed departments.

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Federal Register notices regarding FOIA regulations and updates[1].
- Congressional Research Service legal overview of FOIA and its exemptions[2].
- FOIA.gov official guidance and FAQs on exemptions and exclusions[3][5].
- House Oversight Committee's March 2025 FOIA Citizen’s Guide[4].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- The lack of public reporting on relevant legislation as of January 31, 2025, means the probability assessment could shift rapidly if a new national security event or political controversy emerges.
- Narrow, targeted amendments may be less visible if embedded in larger legislative packages; close monitoring of congressional activity is warranted.
- Administrative rule changes do not qualify under the question's resolution criteria—only statutory exemptions passed by at least one chamber count.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the absence of major proposed or enacted legislation as of January 31, 2025, and the historical rarity of new, department-specific FOIA exemptions, the probability that at least one chamber of Congress will approve such legislation in 2025 is low—likely well below 15%, barring unforeseen events that prompt rapid legislative action.
