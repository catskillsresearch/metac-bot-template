## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- In World War I and World War II, China and the United States fought on the same side, united by a common enemy and overlapping interests.
- As of 2022, the US government officially regards China as its principal strategic competitor, with China seeking to reshape the international order in ways that challenge US global leadership[1][2].
- China is rapidly modernizing its military, aiming to achieve "world-class" status by 2049, and is formulating strategies to counter perceived US dominance in international affairs[1][2][4].
- The US is focused on strengthening alliances in Asia to deter China and is actively planning for potential confrontation scenarios involving China, particularly in areas such as Taiwan and the South China Sea[3].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- The 2022 US National Security Strategy and National Defense Strategy both explicitly define China as the primary "pacing challenge" to US security and the international system[1][2].
- US policy has increasingly prioritized multilateral cooperation with allies in Asia to improve strategic planning, intelligence sharing, and arms sales, specifically to counterbalance China[3].
- China and Russia have reached unprecedented levels of military cooperation, marked by joint exercises, industrial cooperation, and high-level exchanges, suggesting bloc formation that could oppose US-led coalitions in a major conflict[5].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- US Department of Defense annual reports on Chinese military and security developments[1][2].
- Analyses from the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) on US alliance dynamics in Asia[3].
- Reports on the trajectory of China-Russia military relations from the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission[5].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- Alliances can shift rapidly in response to major shocks, new threats, or leadership changes.
- The "side" a country is on could be ambiguous in multipolar or complex coalition scenarios.
- The definition of "world war" and "same side" are somewhat open to interpretation, especially in the context of non-traditional warfare or multi-bloc alignments.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the trajectory as of 2022—marked by intensifying US-China rivalry, Chinese alignment with Russia, and US efforts to deter Chinese ambitions—the probability that the US and China would be on the same side in a hypothetical World War 3 before 2060 is exceedingly low. While not strictly impossible, it would likely require the emergence of an even greater common adversary or a dramatic and unforeseen realignment of global politics.

**Estimated probability: Less than 5%**
