## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Venezuela has experienced a prolonged national crisis involving economic collapse, hyperinflation, severe shortages of necessities, frequent protests, widespread human rights abuses, and mass migration[1][3][2]. 
- The Maduro regime has used repression, torture, and detention to control dissent, while opposition forces have remained active but fragmented[1][2][4]. 
- Nonstate armed groups and criminal gangs contribute to high levels of violence, but there is no evidence of a unified, armed insurgency controlling territory—an important criterion for civil war classification[4]. 
- Millions of Venezuelans have fled, but the bulk of violence remains political repression and criminal, not organized civil conflict[3].

## Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Forecast

- In 2023, Venezuela held a controversial referendum on the Essequibo region, raising concerns about external conflict but also demonstrating the regime’s ability to mobilize state power[5].
- Maduro continues to rely on loyalist militias (*colectivos*) and the Bolivarian National Guard, insulating the regular military from direct repression and dismissing disloyal generals[5].
- International actors (Russia, China, Cuba, Iran) provide ongoing economic and strategic support, increasing regime resilience against internal collapse[3][5].
- While large protests continue and opposition leaders evade arrest, there is no sign of sustained armed rebellion or large-scale defections from security forces[5].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, the U.S. State Department, and other monitors document severe repression and humanitarian crisis, but none classify Venezuela as being in civil war as of April 2023[1][2][4].
- The World Population Review’s “Countries Currently at War” list does not list Venezuela as being in civil war as of 2023.
- There is no global consensus (BBC, New York Times, UN) describing Venezuela as being in civil war.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- The main uncertainty is whether the loyalty of security forces can be maintained amid worsening conditions or regime exhaustion.
- The possibility of external shocks (e.g., war with Guyana) or sudden opposition unity could rapidly change the risk profile.
- Measurement is limited by the lack of transparent information from within Venezuela and potential underreporting of localized armed clashes.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given historical trends, current regime resilience, lack of organized armed opposition, and ongoing external support, the probability of Venezuela entering a civil war (as defined by the resolution criteria) before 2050 is **low but non-negligible**. The risk could rise if regime cohesion falters, external actors reduce support, or opposition forces become more organized and armed. At present, Venezuela appears more likely to remain in a state of chronic crisis and repression than to transition to full-scale civil war.
