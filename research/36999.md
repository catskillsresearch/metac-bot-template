## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Starlink’s expansion strategy in Africa has accelerated in 2025, with recent service launches in Niger, Liberia, and now Somalia[3][5].
- Starlink’s availability map is generally updated soon after official launches and local regulatory approvals in new markets[1].
- As of early May 2025, publicly available sources confirm Starlink service is operational in Somalia, and users can order and activate kits within the country[2][5].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- Somalia’s National Communications Authority officially approved Starlink’s operational license on April 13, 2025[5].
- Elon Musk publicly announced “Starlink in Somalia” via Twitter the same day, marking the official launch[4].
- Somali government officials have endorsed Starlink’s entry and indicated strong support for rapid rollout[5].
- Reports confirm that orders are being accepted and kits are shipping to Somali addresses as of early May 2025[2].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The Starlink Availability Map is the definitive reference for whether a country is listed as “Available”[1].
- National Communications Authority (NCA) of Somalia and multiple news outlets confirm the regulatory approval and launch status[3][4][5].
- Independent reporting and testimonials indicate that users in Somalia are already accessing Starlink services[2].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- While service is operational, there is occasionally a short delay (days to weeks) between a country’s launch and the website reflecting this on the availability map.
- No reports indicate any regulatory or technical obstacles that might reverse or delay public listing for Somalia.
- Ongoing policy development in Somalia could marginally affect the pace of rollout, but current signals are strongly supportive[2][5].

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given:
- Official license approval and public launch announcements
- Confirmed operational status and ability to order within Somalia
- Historical trend of Starlink updating the availability map promptly after launch

**It is highly probable (well above 90%) that Starlink’s website will show Somalia as “Available” before July 1, 2025.**
