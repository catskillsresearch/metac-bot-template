# Lake Kariba Water Level Forecast Analysis

Based on the available data as of January 31, 2025, I can provide the following analysis to help forecast the Lake Kariba water level for February 24, 2025.

## Current Status and Recent Trends

The most recent available data shows that as of January 6, 2025, Lake Kariba's water level was at 475.87 meters, representing only 2.61% of usable storage capacity[2]. This is significantly lower than the level recorded on the same date in the previous year (January 6, 2024), which was 477.28 meters with 12.32% usable storage[2]. This represents a year-over-year decline of 1.41 meters in water level and a substantial reduction in usable storage capacity.

The declining trend is concerning and suggests that the lake continues to face challenges related to insufficient water inflow, likely due to drought conditions that have been affecting the region.

## Historical Context

The Kariba reservoir's water levels are monitored through a hydrometric network comprising thirteen stations where water levels are tracked daily[3]. Flow measurements are conducted at eight of these stations, including Victoria Falls, which is a key monitoring station on the Zambezi River[3].

For historical context, the maximum flow ever recorded at Victoria Falls was 10,000 cubic meters per second in March 1958, coincidentally during the early construction phase of Kariba Dam[3]. The lowest flows on record occurred during the 1995/96 season, with an annual mean flow of 390 cubic meters per second, compared to the Long Term Mean Annual flow of 1,100 cubic meters per second[3].

## Forecasting Limitations

Forecasting the exact water level for February 24, 2025, presents several challenges:

1. Limited recent data points available before the January 31, 2025 knowledge cutoff
2. Uncertainty about rainfall patterns between January and February 2025
3. Lack of information about planned water releases for hydropower generation
4. Unknown inflow rates from tributaries during the period in question

## Verification Sources

The Zambezi River Authority maintains official records of Lake Kariba water levels and provides regular updates through their hydrology data resources[1]. Their Lake Levels tracker would be the authoritative source for verifying the actual water level on February 24, 2025.
