# Forecasting US Recognition of Taiwan Before January 20, 2029

## Historical Context and Current Status

The United States' relationship with Taiwan has been defined by strategic ambiguity for decades, operating through a complex framework established by the Shanghai Communiqué (1972), the Taiwan Relations Act (1979), and the Six Assurances (1982). This approach has allowed the US to maintain unofficial but substantive relations with Taiwan while simultaneously acknowledging Beijing's position without endorsing it.

As of March 2025, the US conducts relations with Taiwan through the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT), which functions similar to an embassy but maintains a façade of unofficiality. The relationship is essentially "government-to-government, but behind a façade of unofficiality"[5]. In many respects, the US treats Taiwan "as if" it were a state, without officially recognizing it as such.

A significant recent development occurred on February 16, 2025, when the Trump administration removed the long-standing phrase "we do not support Taiwan independence" from the State Department's fact sheet on Taiwan-US relations[1]. This follows a similar move by the Biden administration in 2022, which was subsequently reversed after China's diplomatic protests[1].

## Recent Policy Developments

Several key developments in early 2025 suggest potential shifts in US policy toward Taiwan:

1. **State Department Language Change**: The removal of "we do not support Taiwan independence" from official documents represents a notable departure from decades of careful diplomatic phrasing[1].

2. **Congressional Action**: The America Supports Taiwan Act was introduced in the 119th Congress (2025-2026), with the bill text explicitly stating "The United States Government has never officially recognized the People's Republic of China's claim of sovereignty over Taiwan"[2].

3. **Trump Administration's Approach**: The Trump administration has demonstrated "a willingness to take risks in Taiwan policy," potentially signaling a more assertive stance compared to previous administrations[1].

## Comparative Analysis with Reference Cases

To assess the likelihood of formal recognition, we can examine previous cases of US recognition of new states:

**South Sudan (2011)** and **Niue (2023)** were recognized through presidential statements and establishment of diplomatic relations. Both cases involved territories with clearer paths to independence and less geopolitical complexity than Taiwan's situation.

Taiwan's case differs significantly due to:

1. China's explicit red line regarding Taiwan's status and the potential for severe economic and military consequences
2. The decades-long status quo of strategic ambiguity that has served US interests
3. Taiwan's unique international position as a de facto independent entity with limited formal recognition

## Key Factors Affecting the Forecast

Several factors will influence whether the US moves toward formal recognition:

**Factors Increasing Probability:**
- The Trump administration's demonstrated willingness to challenge diplomatic norms
- Congressional support for stronger Taiwan relations, as evidenced by the America Supports Taiwan Act
- The gradual expansion of "the boundaries of officiality and 'as if-ness'" in US-Taiwan relations over time[5]

**Factors Decreasing Probability:**
- Potential severe economic and military consequences from China
- The long-established benefits of strategic ambiguity
- Historical precedent of walking back similar language changes (as occurred in 2022)
- The limited number of countries (only 12) that currently recognize Taiwan diplomatically

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on the available evidence as of March 28, 2025, I assess that there is approximately a **15-20% probability** that the United States will formally recognize Taiwan before January 20, 2029.

This assessment reflects:

1. The significant recent shift in State Department language suggests movement toward a more Taiwan-friendly position, but falls well short of the criteria for formal recognition[1].

2. The "robust unofficial relationship" framework has proven durable and flexible, allowing substantive cooperation without triggering major conflict with China[3][5].

3. While the Trump administration has shown willingness to take risks in Taiwan policy, formal recognition would represent an extraordinary departure from decades of US policy and would likely trigger severe consequences from China[1].

4. The historical pattern shows incremental changes in US-Taiwan relations rather than dramatic shifts in formal status.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several key uncertainties could significantly affect this forecast:

1. **Cross-strait tensions**: A significant escalation or de-escalation in China-Taiwan relations could dramatically alter US calculations.

2. **Chinese response**: How China responds to the February 2025 language change could influence whether the US continues moving toward recognition or reverts to previous positions.

3. **Trump administration priorities**: The degree to which Taiwan becomes a priority issue for the second Trump term remains uncertain.

4. **Taiwan's own position**: Taiwan's government may not necessarily push for formal recognition if it believes maintaining the status quo better serves its security interests.

The forecast should be updated as these uncertainties resolve over the coming months and years.
