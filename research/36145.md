Based on information available as of March 17, 2025, I can provide a definitive answer regarding the 2025 GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Film -- Limited Release.

## Winner and Nominees

The 36th Annual GLAAD Media Awards were announced on January 22, 2025, and **"Crossing" (MUBI)** won the award for Outstanding Film â€“ Limited Release[1][4]. This film competed against nine other nominees in this category:

- 20,000 Species of Bees (Film Movement)
- Backspot (XYZ Films)
- Before I Change My Mind (Epic Pictures)
- Big Boys (Dark Star Pictures)
- Close to You (Greenwich Entertainment)
- Fitting In (Blue Fox Entertainment)
- High Tide (Strand Releasing)
- Housekeeping for Beginners (Focus Features)
- A Place of Our Own (Dark Star Pictures)[1][2]

## Award Criteria and Context

The GLAAD Media Awards recognize media for "fair, accurate and inclusive representations of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ) community and the issues that affect their lives"[1]. For the Limited Release category specifically, films must:

- Be released by a recognized film distribution company
- Play for paid admission on a limited number of theater screens for seven consecutive days
- The "Limited Release" designation is determined by a combination of number of screens played, budget, and visibility[5]

The award is given to the film itself, though producers, directors, writers, and/or actors may accept it on behalf of the production[5].

## Selection Process

As noted in the question description, honorees are selected through a rigorous process involving over 700 GLAAD Media Award voters and volunteers. They evaluate nominees based on four key criteria:
- Fair, Accurate and Inclusive Representations of the LGBT community
- Boldness and Originality of the project
- Significant Cultural Impact on mainstream culture
- Overall Quality of the project

The final recipients are determined by a Review Panel based on voting results and expert opinions.

## Verification

The winner announcement was officially published on GLAAD's website and can be verified through their official channels[1][2][4]. The 36th Annual GLAAD Media Awards represent the most current cycle of these awards as of the March 17, 2025 knowledge cutoff date.
