## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Since China's entry into the nuclear club in the 1960s, US-China relations have cycled between cooperation and rivalry, with notable escalation in recent years over trade, technology, and regional security issues.
- Both nations have modernized their militaries, with China investing heavily in anti-access/area-denial (A2/AD) and naval capabilities, especially in the South China Sea and around Taiwan[1].
- The US has maintained a policy of "strategic ambiguity" regarding Taiwan but has increased military cooperation and arms sales to Taipei, while China continues asserting that reunification by force remains on the table[5].
- No direct military conflict between the US and China has resulted in 1,000+ battle deaths in a single year since the Korean War era; nuclear deterrence and economic interdependence have been stabilizing factors.
- The closest historical analog is the US-Soviet Cold War, which saw several proxy wars but no direct large-scale US-Soviet conflict.

## 2. Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Forecast

- US military leaders have publicly warned of potential war scenarios, with some, like General Minihan, predicting possible war as early as 2025[3]. However, these warnings are not predictions of inevitability but highlight the seriousness of rising tensions.
- The "Davidson window" (2024–2027) has been identified as a period of elevated risk for a Chinese move against Taiwan, with limited conflict (such as a blockade) being considered more likely than full-scale invasion[5].
- China’s coercive diplomacy and military build-up have led the US to reconsider its regional force posture, seeking more forward-deployed assets and alliances, which could increase the risk of miscalculation or escalation[1].
- Economic headwinds for China and the US, along with the ongoing trade and tech wars, may raise tensions but also create pressures for restraint, as both economies are highly interdependent[4].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Battle-related deaths will be tracked using definitions and data from the Uppsala Conflict Data Program (UCDP), with resolution triggered by credible reports from news agencies, governments, or multinational bodies such as the UN or NATO.

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- Predicting interstate war is inherently uncertain, especially over a long time horizon (to 2050).
- Measurement depends on transparent, credible reporting of battle deaths, which may be delayed or obscured in the early stages of conflict.
- Escalation dynamics are hard to model: technological advances, cyber warfare, or unanticipated political shifts could either increase or decrease risk.
- Scenarios such as blockades, cyberattacks, or proxy wars may fall below the 1,000 battle-death threshold, even if highly disruptive.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

- Historical trends suggest major war between nuclear-armed great powers is rare post-1945 due to deterrence and economic integration.
- Recent expert assessments put the probability of a full-scale Chinese invasion of Taiwan (which would almost certainly trigger US intervention and high battle deaths) at approximately 35% in the near term; limited conflict scenarios are considered more likely but might not meet the battle death threshold[5].
- Given these factors, the probability of a US-China war as defined (≥1,000 battle deaths in a single year) before 2050 is elevated relative to the post-Cold War baseline, but remains below 50%, likely in the 20-35% range barring major shifts in current trends.
