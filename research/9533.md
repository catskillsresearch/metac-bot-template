## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- China has developed a robust biotechnology industry and is a global leader in genomics infrastructure (e.g., BGI Group), with significant investment in embryo and genetic research[1].
- Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) for disease prevention is already widely practiced in China, showing technical capability and social acceptance of embryo selection for medical reasons[1][2].
- In 2018, the He Jiankui case demonstrated China’s capacity for cutting-edge genetic modification, but also triggered a severe regulatory backlash, including criminal penalties for unauthorized embryo gene editing[3].
- China allows embryo research up to 14 days, consistent with many international scientific standards, but prohibits reproductive cloning and germline gene editing for clinical or reproductive use[1][4].
- Embryo selection for nonmedical traits, including intelligence, is explicitly prohibited by Chinese guidelines as of 2023[2].

## 2. Recent Announcements and Policies

- In May 2020, the new Chinese Civil Code introduced explicit regulations for research on human genes and embryos, signaling increased legal oversight[3].
- After the CRISPR baby controversy, China further tightened clinical applications for embryo modification, requiring stricter compliance and review[3][4].
- The 2023 Chinese experts’ consensus guideline on preimplantation genetic testing reiterates a prohibition on embryo selection for nonmedical purposes, including sex and intelligence[2].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Academic and regulatory analyses (Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology, Human Reproduction)[1][2].
- Official regulatory updates and guidelines (Chinese Civil Code, Ministry of Science and Technology)[3][4].

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- Enforcement: While regulations are strict, there is limited transparency about enforcement and possible regional variation in compliance[1][3].
- Public Opinion: Reliable polling on attitudes toward embryo selection for intelligence in mainland China is sparse[2].
- Technical Feasibility: The effectiveness of polygenic embryo selection for intelligence remains scientifically debated; even with technological advances, achieving a 3 IQ point expected gain is nontrivial.
- International Comparison: Other countries (e.g., the US or UK) have stricter clinical embryo selection regulation, but strong black-market or medical tourism demand could shift where first mass adoption occurs.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the above, as of 2022-01-31, it is plausible that China will be among the first ten countries to reach large-scale embryo selection for intelligence, given its technical capacity and history of rapid biotech adoption. However, the current explicit regulatory prohibitions on nonmedical embryo selection, especially after the CRISPR baby scandal, create a significant barrier. Unless there is a major policy shift or widespread noncompliance, China is unlikely to legalize or officially report >10% of newborns selected for intelligence in the near future.

- Adjusted probability (as of 2022-01-31): **Moderately likely** (between 30-60%) that China will eventually be in the first ten countries to cross this threshold, but **not in the immediate future** unless regulations are relaxed or enforcement weakens.
