### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The ARC Prize competition leaderboard for the 2025 cycle uses the ARC-AGI-2 benchmark, a significantly harder challenge than prior ARC versions[2][3].
- As of June 24, 2025, the highest public leaderboard score is 15.3%, achieved by MindsAI @ Tufa Labs[5].
- The top five teams all have scores below 16%, indicating limited recent progress and that no major breakthroughs have occurred[5].
- Previous competition cycles and the ARC-AGI-1 benchmark saw gradual, incremental improvements rather than sudden large jumps in scores[2].

### Recent Announcements and Policies

- The 2025 competition offers a $1 million+ prize pool, with an 85% accuracy target for the grand prize, but the public leaderboard reflects performance on a semi-private set, not the final private test set[3].
- New efficiency and internet access restrictions are in place for prize-eligible solutions, but the public leaderboard is not bound by all of these constraints[3].
- No recent announcements indicate an imminent game-changing advancement or change in evaluation protocol[3].

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The [Kaggle public leaderboard](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/arc-prize-2025/leaderboard) is the official source for real-time scores and will serve as the resolution authority on August 31, 2025[1].
- The [arcprize.org leaderboard](https://arcprize.org/leaderboard) provides additional context and historical data[2].
- The [ARC Prize 2025 State of the Art](https://arcprize.org/2025-sota) page lists current high scores and top-performing teams[5].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- The measurement is based solely on the public leaderboard as of the first Metaculus access on August 31, 2025; unpublished or post hoc results do not count.
- AI research progress is unpredictable, and a last-minute breakthrough or release could change the forecast, but there is no evidence of such developments as of late June.
- The semi-private evaluation set may not perfectly reflect the private test set, though historical differences are minor[3].

### Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given current progress, historical trends, and the absence of disruptive announcements, a reasonable forecast for the highest public leaderboard score on August 31, 2025 is:

- **Most likely range:** 15.5% â€“ 17.5%
- **Best estimate:** 16.5%
- **Probability of exceeding 20%:** Less than 10%
- **Probability of exceeding 25%:** Less than 2%

The forecast assumes continued incremental gains, with a slim possibility of a modest breakthrough but no evidence for a dramatic leap.
