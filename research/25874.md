### Key Factual Information for Forecasting the 2024 Tour de France Time Gap

**1. Historical Trends**
- The time gap between first and second in recent Tours has varied, but gaps over 3 minutes are not unprecedented. In 2023, the gap was 7:29, but in 2022 it was 2:43, and in 2021 it was 5:20. This shows that both large and small gaps are possible, depending on race dynamics and the relative strength of the top contenders.

**2. Current Form and Favorites**
- Tadej Pogačar is the clear favorite for 2024, with rivals and experts describing him as "unreachable" based on his recent performances, including a dominant Giro d’Italia[1][2][3][4][5].
- Jonas Vingegaard, the two-time defending champion, is returning from injury and may not be at full strength, which could make it harder for him to limit time losses to Pogačar[4][5].
- Primož Roglič and Remco Evenepoel are also considered strong contenders, but both have shown vulnerabilities in high mountains and may struggle to match Pogačar’s consistency[1][3].

**3. Team Support**
- Pogačar’s UAE Team Emirates is considered strong and well-organized, while Vingegaard’s Visma-Lease a Bike team has faced difficulties this season, potentially reducing their ability to control the race and protect their leader[4].

**4. Route and Race Dynamics**
- The 2024 route features nearly 60km of individual time trials, which could lead to larger time gaps if one of the favorites excels in these stages[1].
- The presence of multiple strong contenders could keep the race close, but if Pogačar is significantly stronger, the time trials and mountain stages could allow him to build a gap of more than 3 minutes.

**5. Expert Predictions**
- Most expert previews expect a close contest, but several suggest that if Pogačar is at his best and his rivals are not fully fit, he could win by a comfortable margin[1][3][4][5].
- Evenepoel himself has stated that he expects Pogačar to be "unreachable, almost," indicating a belief that a significant gap is possible[1].

**6. Limitations and Uncertainties**
- Unpredictable events such as crashes, illness, or tactical surprises could dramatically alter the final time gap.
- The form of Vingegaard, returning from injury, is a major variable that could influence whether the gap is above or below 3 minutes.

### Authoritative Sources for Verification
- The official Tour de France website will publish the final general classification and time gaps at the conclusion of the race.

### Limitations and Uncertainties in Measurement
- The final time gap will be determined by the official timing system and published on the official site. Unexpected events during the race could affect the outcome, and pre-race predictions are inherently uncertain.
