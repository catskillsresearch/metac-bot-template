## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of May 11, 2025, the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) reports total estimated savings of $170 billion, equating to $1,055.90 in savings per taxpayer, based on an estimated 161 million individual federal taxpayers[1].
- The DOGE Live Tracker confirms this figure and shows that only 8.25% of the original $2 trillion savings goal has been achieved, suggesting a slow pace of additional savings accumulation[2].
- The DOGE website is updated weekly, but there is no indication of a recent acceleration in savings growth[1].

## Recent Announcements and Policy Changes

- In April 2025, Elon Musk reportedly lowered DOGE’s savings goal during a cabinet meeting, signaling reduced expectations for further rapid increases in reported savings[NY Times].
- There have been reports of inaccuracies in DOGE’s savings calculations, including double-counting and misrepresentation of contract values, leading to increased scrutiny and possibly more conservative reporting going forward[5].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The DOGE Live Tracker and the official DOGE savings page are the primary sources for the per-taxpayer savings figure[1][2].
- The tracker is updated regularly, and the most recent update was on May 11, 2025[1].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- The savings figure may be subject to future adjustments or corrections due to past reporting discrepancies[5].
- The pace of new savings initiatives appears to have slowed, especially after the downward revision of the savings goal.
- There is a possibility of late-breaking policy actions or reporting changes, but these are less likely given the current political and administrative climate.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the current reported savings per taxpayer of $1,055.90 as of May 11, 2025, the slow rate of increase, and the recent lowering of the DOGE savings goal, the most probable forecast for the "Savings Per Taxpayer" metric on July 1, 2025, is:

- **$1,060 to $1,080 per taxpayer**, with the most likely figure being **$1,065**.

This forecast assumes a continuation of the current trend, with only modest increases in reported savings and no major new policy interventions or reporting changes before July 1, 2025.
