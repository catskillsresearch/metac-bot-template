# Bo Nix as Potential Broncos Starting QB for Week 4 vs Jets

The Denver Broncos selected Oregon quarterback Bo Nix with the 12th overall pick in the 2024 NFL Draft on April 25, 2024[2][4]. This selection came after the Broncos moved on from Russell Wilson, leaving them with Jarrett Stidham and Zach Wilson as the other quarterbacks on their roster. To forecast whether Nix will start against the Jets in Week 4, we need to examine the available evidence.

## Draft Investment and Background

The Broncos' selection of Nix with a high first-round pick indicates significant investment and likely plans to develop him as their franchise quarterback. Nix brings an impressive college resume:

- At Auburn: 7,251 passing yards, 39 touchdowns, and 16 interceptions over 34 games (three seasons)[2]
- At Oregon: 8,101 yards, 74 touchdowns, and 10 interceptions (two seasons)[2]
- Set single-season records at Oregon for passing yards, completions, and touchdown passes[2]

This substantial draft capital investment suggests the Broncos view Nix as their quarterback of the future, though it doesn't guarantee an immediate starting role.

## Training Camp and Preseason Development

As of early August 2024, reports indicated that Nix was "one step closer to the starting job in Denver"[3]. He participated in the Broncos' training camp at Broncos Park in Englewood, Colorado, on July 26, 2024[3]. The Broncos were conducting a quarterback competition, with Nix detailing his transition to the team and expressing hopes to "play fast" when training camp began[1].

While the search results don't provide definitive information about Nix being named the starter for Week 4 specifically, there are indications that he was progressing toward securing the starting role during training camp.

## Coach's Confidence

There appears to be some level of confidence from the coaching staff in Nix's abilities. A reference to "Payton: Broncos have found their QB with Nix" suggests head coach Sean Payton may have made positive statements about Nix being their quarterback solution[5]. However, the timing and context of this statement aren't clear from the available information.

## Health Considerations

There is a mention that "Broncos QB Nix played through back fractures"[5], which could potentially impact his availability depending on when this injury occurred and its severity. This health factor could influence whether he starts in Week 4, though the search results don't provide enough context to determine if this is a current or past issue.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several key pieces of information are missing from the available search results:

1. No definitive announcement about who will be the Week 1 starter for the Broncos
2. No specific information about the coaching staff's plans for quarterback progression throughout the season
3. Limited details about how Nix has performed in preseason games or practices compared to Stidham and Wilson
4. No information about the current health status of all quarterbacks on the roster

## Conclusion

Based on the available information as of August 14, 2024, there are positive indicators that Bo Nix could be on track to become the Broncos' starting quarterback, given his draft position, college credentials, and apparent progress in training camp. However, without more recent and specific information about the quarterback competition resolution or coach Payton's definitive starter announcement, it's difficult to make a high-confidence forecast about whether Nix will start specifically in Week 4 against the Jets.

The Broncos' performance in the first three weeks of the regular season and how Nix develops (assuming he gets playing time) would be critical factors in determining whether he starts in Week 4, but this information is not available within the knowledge cutoff date.
