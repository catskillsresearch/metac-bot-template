## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- In a 2019 national poll by the Vegetarian Resource Group (VRG), 4% of U.S. adults self-identified as vegetarian according to the strict criterion of never eating meat, fish, seafood, or poultry[4].
- Historical data suggest slow, incremental growth: a 1977-78 USDA survey reported 1.2% vegetarians (with less precise definitions), and the percentage has gradually increased to the 4%-6% range in major polls by 2019-2025[4][2].
- Other sources corroborate this range: Gallup found 4% of U.S. adults identified as vegetarian in 2023[1], and Statista reported about 6% in 2025, though definitions may vary slightly[2][5].
- Women are significantly more likely to self-report as vegetarian, with estimates as high as 87% of vegetarians being female in the U.S.[5].

## 2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- No significant federal policy changes or national campaigns specifically aimed at increasing vegetarianism were noted as of 2019-2025.
- Rising awareness of health, environmental, and ethical concerns may be contributing to gradual growth, but these trends have not yet produced a sharp increase in self-reported vegetarianism[5].
- Plant-based food availability and adoption continue to rise, but this has more impact on people reducing meat rather than complete abstention (as required by the strict vegetarian definition)[4][5].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Vegetarian Resource Group (VRG) Harris Polls are the primary reference for this metric, using large, representative samples and clear definitions[4].
- Gallup and Statista surveys serve as secondary verification but may use slightly different self-identification criteria[1][2].
- Other sources (e.g., World Animal Foundation, Vegconomist) generally align with these figures but may include broader definitions or less stringent survey designs[5].

## 4. Limitations or Uncertainties in Measurement

- Survey wording and self-reporting bias can affect results: some respondents may consider themselves vegetarian despite eating meat occasionally, leading to overestimation in less strict surveys[4].
- Definitions of vegetarianism vary; only those reporting they "never" eat meat, fish, seafood, or poultry are counted for this forecast.
- Temporary diet trends (e.g., "flexitarian" or plant-based eating) may inflate perceptions of vegetarianism without reflecting permanent lifestyle change.
- Demographic changes (e.g., increasing diversity, generational turnover) could influence future rates, but current trends show only modest annual growth.

## Probabilistic Assessment (as of 2019-11-22)

- Growth from 1.2% (late 1970s) to 4% (2019) suggests an approximate increase of 0.1-0.15 percentage points per year over four decades.
- If the pace continues or slightly accelerates due to cultural and generational change, reaching 8% by 2036 would require a doubling over 17 years.
- Barring major unforeseen cultural or policy shifts, the probability of ≥8% of U.S. adults self-reporting as strict vegetarians by 2036 is moderate but not certain—best characterized as a roughly 40-60% likelihood, depending on future accelerators or barriers.
