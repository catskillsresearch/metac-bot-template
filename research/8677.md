## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of 2025, more than 80 SMR designs are at varying stages of development worldwide, with a few operational demonstration projects, such as Russia’s Akademik Lomonosov (a floating SMR) and China’s HTR-PM (expected to be operational by 2027)[2][5].
- The global SMR market is projected to grow, with conservative estimates valuing it at $10–15 billion by 2030. However, most large-scale deployments are anticipated after 2030 as the technology matures and regulatory processes evolve[5].
- Russia and China are the clear leaders in operational and near-operational SMRs, with Russia’s floating SMR connected to the grid and China’s HTR-PM set to begin operations soon. Other countries, including the US and UK, have significant projects but are unlikely to have operational SMRs contributing meaningful electricity shares before 2030[2][5].

## 2. Recent Announcements and Policies

- The United States has provided substantial support for SMR development through the Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program[5].
- China has invested heavily in SMR technology, positioning its HTR-PM as a flagship project for near-term deployment[5].
- The UK plans to bring SMRs online in the early 2030s, according to industry sources, but this timeline likely falls just after the 2030 resolution threshold[2].
- The International Energy Agency (IEA) scenarios suggest initial SMR capacity will be operational by 2030, but with limited share in total electricity generation in most regions[1][4].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- International Energy Agency (IEA) data on SMR installed capacity and projections for 2025–2050[1][4].
- NucNet and World Nuclear News for SMR deployment reports and operational status[3].
- Market research from ResearchAndMarkets, detailing global SMR market growth and deployment outlooks[5].

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- The measurement depends on both the operational capacity of SMRs and the total electricity consumption of each nation. In large countries like Russia and China, even multiple SMRs may not reach the 1% threshold, whereas in small, isolated grids (e.g., Arctic regions), a single SMR could have a larger proportional impact.
- Policy, regulatory, and supply chain risks remain. Delays in construction or grid connection could push meaningful contributions beyond 2030.
- Announced pledges and national targets are subject to change based on political, economic, or technical challenges.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the current trajectory:
- There is a moderate probability (estimated at 30–50%) that at least one nation—most plausibly Russia (for a specific regional grid) or China—will have SMRs supply at least 1% of its annual electricity consumption by 2030. This is most likely if a small or isolated grid is counted separately, or if a larger deployment is rapidly completed in the latter half of the 2020s[1][5].
