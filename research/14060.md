## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- From 1969 to 1972, 12 humans landed on the Moon during the Apollo program; no human has landed on the Moon since December 1972[5].
- As of December 2022, no country or agency has established a sustained human presence on the Moon[5].
- NASA and its international partners have announced ambitious plans to return humans to the Moon, with a strong focus on developing a permanent or semi-permanent lunar outpost[2][5].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- **Artemis Program:** NASA’s Artemis program, in collaboration with international partners, aims to land humans on the lunar south pole by 2026, with Artemis III being the first planned crewed landing[5]. The broader Artemis plan is to establish a sustainable lunar presence, eventually leading to a lunar base camp[2][4].
    - The Artemis Base Camp is scheduled to see its foundational surface habitat (FSH) established in the 2030s, not before 2030. Prior to this, several temporary base camps will be set up with each crewed landing, but these are not expected to provide a continuous year-long human presence before 2030[5].
    - NASA’s official materials in 2020 outlined post-Artemis III operations aimed at developing the capabilities for longer lunar stays, but did not specify a timeline for a full year of continuous human presence before 2030[1].
- **International Efforts:**
    - The European Space Agency (ESA) has proposed a Moon Village concept, but no concrete timeline for a 1-year sustained presence before 2030 has been formalized[5].
    - The International Lunar Research Station (ILRS), a joint Chinese-Russian project, plans for a long-term human presence at the lunar south pole, but its target window is 2036–2045—after the 2030 deadline[3].
    - SpaceX and other commercial partners are working on lunar landing technology, but there are no public commitments or schedules for a year-long lunar settlement before 2030[5].

## Key Differences Affecting the Forecast

- **Technical and Logistical Challenges:** Achieving a continuous human presence for 1 year requires robust life support, resupply, power, and surface habitat systems, all of which are still in conceptual or early development stages as of late 2022[1][5].
- **Timelines and Delays:** Historically, major space projects experience delays. While Artemis III is targeted for 2026, subsequent missions needed for base construction are likely to stretch into the late 2020s or 2030s, based on official schedules and past performance[5].
- **No Firm Commitments:** While permanent lunar settlements are a stated goal, no agency has formally committed to maintaining a continuous human presence on the Moon for 1 year before 2030, and foundational habitats supporting such a stay are not scheduled before that date[5].
- **International Coordination:** While multiple agencies are involved, coordination challenges and geopolitical uncertainties can affect timelines[3][5].

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on factual information available as of December 2022:

- No agency or consortium had a concrete, funded, and technically mature plan to sustain a human on the lunar surface for 1 continuous year before 2030[1][5].
- The Artemis Base Camp foundational habitat, the most prominent U.S. proposal, was scheduled for the 2030s, with only temporary or short-duration base camps possible in the late 2020s[5].
- Chinese-Russian efforts (ILRS) target post-2030 timelines[3].
- Given the historical tendency for delays in complex space projects, the technological and logistical maturity required, and the absence of any firm schedule for a year-long lunar occupation before 2030, the probability of achieving the forecast criterion is low—likely well below 10% as of December 2022.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- Announced schedules are often aspirational and subject to funding, political will, and technical progress.
- Commercial and private actors could accelerate timelines, but as of December 2022, no such plans had reached an operational or funded stage[5].
- Unforeseen breakthroughs or geopolitical events could affect the forecast, but these are not predictable with information as of December 2022.
