## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- In March 2019, cage-free shell egg production accounted for only 18.4% of the U.S. table egg layer flock.
- As of early 2025, several recent sources confirm that the share has risen to around 40%–42%:
  - January 2025: "about 40 percent of egg-laying hens now in cage-free systems" (124.8 million hens)[1].
  - February 2025: "organic and cage-free shell egg production accounted for 42.1% (122.6 million hens)"[2].
  - March 2025: "more than 40% of hens used for eggs in the U.S. are now cage-free," per the USDA[3].
  - April 2025: "number of hens classified as cage-free (excluding Certified Organic)... increased ... to 105.4 million," with Certified Organic at 20.4 million[5].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- The U.S. has experienced steady growth in cage-free flock share, driven by consumer demand, retailer commitments, and animal welfare advocacy[1][3].
- There have been no major federal mandates but sustained industry and retailer pledges (e.g., major grocers and foodservice companies pledging 100% cage-free eggs by the mid-2020s).
- Avian influenza (HPAI) caused flock depopulation in late 2024 and early 2025, but by March 2025, the impact had lessened, and cage-free flock sizes continued to grow[5].
- No new disruptive regulations or market shocks have been reported in 2025.

## U.S. vs. Reference Cases

- The U.S. has made faster recent progress than Canada (where over 81% of hens remain caged)[1].
- The European Union, as of 2017, had 49.6% of hens non-caged, indicating that the U.S. is approaching EU levels but still slightly behind.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- Measurement is based on USDA monthly reporting; short-term fluctuations from disease outbreaks or market shocks may cause minor deviations.
- Some reported data include both cage-free and organic; organic is a subset of cage-free but is separately tracked in USDA reports[2][5].
- The future pace of transition depends on ongoing retailer/producer commitments and consumer demand, both of which appear stable but could shift.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the trajectory from 18.4% (March 2019) to 40–42% (early 2025), and the lack of evidence for a sudden acceleration or deceleration in the subsequent months, the best estimate for the percentage of U.S. egg-laying hens that will be cage-free in June 2025 is:

> **41% ± 1%**

This range (40%–42%) reflects both the latest available data and the steady (but not sharply accelerating) trend into mid-2025[2][3][4][5].
