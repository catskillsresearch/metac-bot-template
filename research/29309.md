### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Time magazine has occasionally named women as Person of the Year, but it is rare for a woman to be the sole recipient. In recent years, women have often shared the title with men or groups, as was the case with Kamala Harris and Joe Biden in 2020, which would not meet the criteria for this question[2].
- The 2024 TIME100 list, released in April 2024, features several influential women, including Dua Lipa, Taraji P. Henson, and Yulia Navalnaya, who were highlighted on the magazine's covers[3]. However, inclusion in the TIME100 does not directly correlate with being named Person of the Year.
- The 2024 TIME Women of the Year list, published in February 2024, honors 12 extraordinary women such as Greta Gerwig and Taraji P. Henson, but this is a separate recognition from Person of the Year[5].

### Recent Announcements and Policies

- As of October 29, 2024, there have been no official announcements or credible leaks regarding the 2024 Time Person of the Year.
- The TIME100 and Women of the Year lists for 2024 showcase prominent women, but Time has not signaled that any of these individuals are frontrunners for the Person of the Year title[3][5].

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The official Time magazine website and its press releases are the primary sources for announcements regarding Person of the Year.
- The Wikipedia page for Time Person of the Year provides a historical record of past recipients and can be used to verify the outcome once announced.

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- The selection process for Time Person of the Year is confidential and typically announced in December, so as of October 29, 2024, there is no definitive information about the 2024 recipient.
- While several women have been recognized by Time in 2024, there is no public indication that a woman will be named the sole Person of the Year.
- Forecasting relies on historical patterns and current recognitions, but without an official announcement, uncertainty remains high.

### Summary

As of October 29, 2024, there is no factual information or official announcement indicating that a woman will be named the sole Time Person of the Year for 2024. While influential women have been recognized in other Time lists this year, the Person of the Year selection remains unknown and will be determined by Time's editorial decision later in the year[3][5].
