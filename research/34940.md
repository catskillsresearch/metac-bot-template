## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- In the 2021 German federal election, the SPD won the most seats, followed by the CDU/CSU and then the AfD[5].
- Since then, the SPD-led "traffic light" coalition (SPD, Greens, FDP) has lost significant public support, while the CDU/CSU has regained its lead in the polls[3].
- The AfD has experienced a notable surge, reaching record levels of support for a party to the right of the CDU/CSU in post-war Germany[4].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- The CDU/CSU remains the leading party in all major polls and seat projections, with the AfD consistently in second place[2][3][4].
- The SPD and Greens have not recovered in recent polling, and the AfD's gains have solidified in the final weeks before the election[4].
- The AfD has nominated Alice Weidel as its chancellor candidate, and the party is projected to win around 20% of the vote and 142 out of 630 seats, according to YouGov's February 2025 MRP model[4].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- YouGov's MRP models (January and February 2025) both project the AfD to win the second-highest number of seats, with the CDU/CSU first and the SPD trailing in third[2][4].
- POLITICO's Poll of Polls and seat projections corroborate this, showing the CDU/CSU leading, AfD second, and SPD third[1].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- Polling and seat projections are subject to last-minute shifts in voter sentiment, campaign events, and turnout variations.
- The AfD remains politically isolated, which may affect coalition dynamics but not the raw seat count[3][4].
- Some minor parties may hover near the electoral threshold, potentially impacting seat distribution.

## Conclusion

Based on all available data as of February 10, 2025, the Alternative for Germany (AfD) is forecast to win the 2nd highest number of seats in the 2025 German federal election.
