# Parker Solar Probe Mission Success Forecast (as of September 5, 2018)

As of early September 2018, the Parker Solar Probe mission has just begun its ambitious journey to study our star up close. Launched on August 12, 2018, the spacecraft is embarking on what will be a seven-year mission involving 24 progressively closer orbits around the sun[4]. Based on currently available information, I'll assess the likelihood of mission success through its planned 24 perihelion passages.

## Current Status & Mission Design

The Parker Solar Probe successfully launched aboard a Delta IV Heavy rocket from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station on August 12, 2018[3][4]. The spacecraft was built and is operated by the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland[3]. At this early stage, the spacecraft appears to be functioning as expected post-launch, though it has not yet made its first close approach to the sun.

The mission plan calls for the probe to make 24 orbits around the sun over seven years, gradually reducing its distance to achieve unprecedented proximity to our star - eventually reaching just 6.16 million kilometers (3.83 million miles) from the sun's surface[4]. This will make it approximately 7 times closer than any previous spacecraft has ventured.

## Technical Capabilities & Protective Measures

The Parker Solar Probe incorporates several critical design elements that increase its chances of surviving the extreme conditions:

- **Heat Shield Technology**: The spacecraft features a 4.5-inch-thick carbon-composite shield designed to withstand temperatures of nearly 1,377°C (2,500°F) while keeping the instruments at roughly room temperature.

- **Autonomous Systems**: The probe is designed to operate autonomously during close solar approaches, as the communication delay and intense environment make real-time control impossible.

- **Power Management**: Solar arrays are designed with a cooling system that can retract partially behind the heat shield during closest approaches.

- **Spacecraft Specifications**: The probe has a launch mass of 685 kg (1,510 lb) and is designed to generate 343 W of power even at its closest approach to the sun[4].

## Risk Assessment Factors

Several factors must be considered when forecasting mission success:

1. **No Precedent**: No spacecraft has ever operated this close to the sun, creating significant uncertainty despite extensive modeling and testing.

2. **Radiation Exposure**: Instruments and electronics will face extreme radiation, though they have been designed with substantial shielding.

3. **Micrometeoroid Impacts**: The potential for damage from high-velocity dust particles in the solar environment poses an ongoing risk.

4. **Mechanical Systems**: Solar array mechanisms and other moving parts must function reliably despite thermal cycling through extreme temperature ranges.

5. **Mission Duration**: The seven-year timeline introduces risks of component degradation and failure over time.

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on the information available as of September 5, 2018:

- **High Confidence (>90%)**: The probe will successfully complete its first several orbits and gather valuable scientific data.
- **Moderate Confidence (70-80%)**: The probe will survive to complete at least half of its planned 24 orbits.
- **Moderate-Low Confidence (50-60%)**: The probe will successfully complete all 24 orbits while maintaining full scientific capabilities.

The mission has been designed with significant margins and redundancies to increase the probability of success. The spacecraft's autonomous operations capability is particularly important, as demonstrated by the mission design which anticipates periods where the probe must operate without direct control from Earth.

## Limiting Factors and Uncertainties

The primary uncertainties in this forecast stem from:

1. The unprecedented nature of the mission environment
2. Limited real-world testing capabilities for such extreme conditions
3. Potential unknown solar phenomena that might affect spacecraft performance
4. Cumulative effects of repeated close approaches on spacecraft systems

## Conclusion

The Parker Solar Probe represents one of NASA's most ambitious missions, with significant technical challenges. While complete mission success through all 24 perihelion passages faces substantial risks, the spacecraft's robust design and the mission team's careful planning provide reasonably good prospects for achieving most mission objectives. The early phases of the mission will provide critical data to better assess the likelihood of complete mission success.
