# Forecasting US 30-Year Fixed Mortgage Rate for October 1, 2024

To assess whether the US weekly 30-year fixed mortgage rate will exceed 6.35% on October 1, 2024, according to Freddie Mac, I'll analyze historical trends, current rates, and relevant economic factors based on data available through September 9, 2024.

## Current Status and Recent Trends

As of September 6, 2024, the 30-year fixed mortgage rate had fallen to 6.17%, representing a significant drop and marking the lowest level since April 2023[2]. This rate reflected a notable three-day decline of 16 basis points and positioned the rate more than 90 basis points below July 2024's high of 7.08%[2].

The downward trend observed in early September 2024 represented a substantial shift from earlier in the year:

- In May 2024, mortgage rates were rising, with the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage crossing the 7% mark according to Freddie Mac's Primary Mortgage Market Survey[4]
- The 30-year fixed rate reached a 23-year high of 8.01% in October 2023, demonstrating the significant volatility in the market[2]

## Economic Factors and Forecasts

Several key factors influence mortgage rate movements that could affect the October 1, 2024 rate:

### Federal Reserve Policy

As of May 2024, analysts expected the Federal Reserve to maintain higher interest rates through most of 2024, with potentially one rate cut toward the end of the year[4]. The Fed's reluctance to reduce rates prior to September 2024 had caused housing market analysts to reassess their mortgage rate projections[5].

### Economic Outlook

Freddie Mac's economic outlook from May 2024 anticipated:
- The economy settling into a lower growth rate in 2024 and 2025
- No recession in their baseline scenario
- Slower growth and a weaker labor market helping to rein in inflation[4]

### Mortgage Rate Forecasts

In May 2024, both Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae projected that mortgage rates would remain in the 7% range throughout 2024[5]. However, the actual trend through early September showed rates falling below this projection, reaching 6.17% by September 6, 2024[2].

## Measurement Considerations

When evaluating the October 1, 2024 rate, it's important to note:

1. Freddie Mac's Primary Mortgage Market Survey (PMMS) is the official measurement source for this forecast
2. Rate volatility has been significant throughout 2024, with earlier forecasts repeatedly being adjusted as economic conditions evolved[5]
3. The resolution will be based on the 30-Yr FRM rate displayed on Freddie Mac's tracker page on October 1, 2024, regardless of what period it covers

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors create uncertainty in forecasting the October 1, 2024 rate:

1. Inflation data releases between September 9 and October 1 could significantly impact market expectations
2. Any Federal Reserve announcements or policy changes in September 2024 would likely influence mortgage rates
3. The historical data shows considerable volatility in mortgage rates throughout 2024, with earlier forecasts often requiring revision[5]

Based on the data available through September 9, 2024, the 30-year fixed mortgage rate had been trending downward, reaching 6.17% on September 6, 2024. However, earlier forecasts from major housing finance entities suggested rates would remain elevated above 7% through the end of 2024. The significant gap between these forecasts and the actual rate in early September illustrates the uncertainty in predicting the October 1 rate.
