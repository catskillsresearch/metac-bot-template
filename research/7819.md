## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The Taliban’s prior rule (pre-2001) directly facilitated Al Qaeda’s planning and execution of the 9/11 attacks against NATO member the United States, leading to international intervention[2].
- After the U.S. and NATO withdrawal in August 2021, the Taliban regained control of most of Afghanistan, including Kabul[2][1].
- International concern persists that Afghanistan could again serve as a terrorist haven; the Taliban’s ties to Al Qaeda reportedly remain strong. UN reports (2022) found Al Qaeda had a safe haven in Afghanistan and “increased freedom of action,” with leadership, including Ayman al-Zawahiri, present in Kabul under Taliban shelter as recently as mid-2022[2].
- The Taliban claim that Afghan soil will not be used for attacks abroad, but there is skepticism among Western intelligence agencies and experts[2][3].
- The Taliban’s capacity to dismantle or control terrorist networks within Afghanistan is unclear, particularly in urban areas[3].

## Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Metric

- The Doha Agreement (2020) included Taliban commitments to prevent terrorist use of Afghan territory, but enforcement and compliance remain disputed[1][2].
- U.S. and allied intelligence continue to monitor the situation; after Zawahiri’s killing, U.S. assessments indicated Al Qaeda had not reconstituted a significant external operations capability in Afghanistan as of late 2022, but disagreement remains among experts[2].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- U.S. government and intelligence community reports (e.g., State Department Country Reports on Terrorism, National Counterterrorism Center data)[3][4].
- NATO and European Union threat assessments[1].
- United Nations sanctions monitoring and analytical support reports[2].
- Credible international media reporting on major attacks and attribution.

## Key Differences Affecting the Forecast

- Enhanced international intelligence and counterterrorism capabilities post-2001 may detect and disrupt plots earlier than in the 1990s.
- Taliban public messaging now includes assurances against transnational attacks, likely due to international pressure and a desire for legitimacy and aid[2].
- However, the Taliban’s ability to control or distance themselves from Al Qaeda and similar groups is questionable, with evidence of continued cooperation and harboring of terrorists[2][3].
- Regional instability and the presence of other militant groups (e.g., Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan) complicate attribution and increase the risk of spillover violence[2].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- The lack of transparency about Taliban internal dynamics and the clandestine nature of terrorist activity make external assessment difficult.
- Attribution for any future attack may be contested or unclear, especially if the Taliban provide only indirect support or sanctuary.
- The evolving international engagement with the Taliban regime may affect both terrorist group incentives and intelligence access.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Based on the above, the probability that Taliban-controlled Afghanistan is used as a base for at least one major (10+ killed) anti-NATO terrorist attack outside Afghanistan, clearly attributed by U.S./NATO/EU authorities to the Taliban or Taliban-supported actors before 2027, is elevated compared to 2014–2021, but still faces significant obstacles:
- International scrutiny and intelligence efforts have been significantly enhanced since 2001.
- The Taliban’s incentives for international legitimacy may restrain overt cooperation with transnational terrorist plots, but their inability or unwillingness to fully sever ties with groups like Al Qaeda increases risk.
- As of late 2022, major attacks traceable to Taliban-supported actors had not occurred, but the presence and activities of such groups within Afghanistan remain a persistent threat.

**Estimated likelihood as of late 2021**: Moderate (roughly 30–50%), reflecting heightened risk but significant uncertainty and barriers to a large, externally attributed attack before 2027.
