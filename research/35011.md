## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- **Polling Leadership**: As of late April 2025, Rafał Trzaskowski leads all major polls for the first round of the presidential election, with support estimated between 33% and 38%[2][3][5]. His main rival, Karol Nawrocki (backed by PiS), trails but has narrowed the gap in recent weeks[1][3][5].
  
- **Runoff Likely**: No candidate is forecast to exceed the 50% threshold needed to win outright in the first round (May 18). A second round (June 1) between the top two candidates is highly probable[2][4].

- **Political Realignment**: The Civic Coalition, led by PM Donald Tusk, holds parliamentary power since ousting PiS in 2023, but the presidency remains PiS's stronghold. The outcome could determine the government’s ability to implement reforms, as the president wields veto power that the current parliamentary majority cannot override on its own[2].

- **Third-Party Impact**: Far-right candidate Slawomir Mentzen and centrist Szymon Hołownia are polling behind the leading pair, but their voters’ second-round preferences could be pivotal[3][5].

## Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- **Campaign Momentum**: Trzaskowski’s campaign has focused on progressive policies, European integration, and judicial independence, aiming to appeal to urban and centrist voters[2][3].
  
- **Nawrocki’s Surge**: Nawrocki has gained ground recently, attributed to PiS’s mobilization and an uptick in support from conservative and rural voters[1].

- **Electoral Context**: The Civic Coalition’s recent strong performance in the 2024 European elections (37% of the vote) signals robust support but also highlights a still-polarized electorate with PiS retaining a significant base[2].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Statista polling data (April 2025): Trzaskowski leads with 33%+, followed by Nawrocki[5].
- Euronews polling roundup (April 2025): Trzaskowski at 38.3% average; runoff expected with Nawrocki as the main challenger[3].
- Robert Schuman Foundation analysis: Civic Coalition’s recent electoral victories, ongoing cohabitation tensions, and the significance of the presidency for reform[2].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- **Runoff Unpredictability**: Polish presidential elections are often decided by narrow margins in the second round, with shifting alliances and high volatility among undecided or third-party voters[2][3].
  
- **Polling Margins and Shifts**: Nawrocki’s momentum and far-right minor candidates could alter the runoff calculus, especially if turnout varies regionally or younger voters mobilize for Mentzen[1][3].
  
- **Cohabitation Dynamics**: The presidency’s power to veto reforms creates high stakes and could intensify partisan turnout, benefiting either leading candidate[2].

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

- **Trzaskowski remains the clear favorite to reach and win the second round**, but the race is tightening, and the outcome is not assured. Given current trends, the probability of Trzaskowski being elected president in 2025 is moderately high—likely in the range of 55% to 65%—but with significant uncertainty due to runoff dynamics and late-campaign shifts[1][2][3][5].
