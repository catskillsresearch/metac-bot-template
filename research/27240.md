### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Keir Starmer's approval/favourability ratings saw a brief post-election boost but have since declined. As of early August 2024, YouGov reported his favourability at 40% (down from 44% immediately after the election), with 49% unfavourable[2].
- Ipsos polling from mid-July 2024 found 36% of Britons thought Starmer was doing a good job as Prime Minister, the highest such figure since early 2021, but still well below 50%[5].
- The "honeymoon" period for Starmer appears to have ended quickly, with ratings returning to or below pre-election levels within a month of taking office[1][2].

### Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- Starmer's government has focused on promises of "national renewal" and returning politics to public service, but there have been no major policy breakthroughs or events reported that would likely drive a significant surge in approval ratings[1][2].
- The Labour victory was achieved with a historically low turnout and a relatively low share of the popular vote, indicating limited public enthusiasm and a potentially fragile mandate[1].

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The Politico Poll of Polls aggregates data from major UK pollsters and is the specified source for resolving this question.
- YouGov and Ipsos are among the most reputable polling organizations in the UK and their recent data is consistent with the aggregate trends[2][5].

### Limitations or Uncertainties

- Approval ratings can fluctuate in response to unforeseen events, crises, or major policy announcements.
- The precise methodology and sample composition of each poll may vary, but the aggregate trend across multiple pollsters is clear.
- The "Smooth" version of the Politico Poll of Polls should be used for final resolution, as specified.

### Conclusion

Based on all available data as of August 16, 2024, there is no evidence that Keir Starmer's approval rating as Prime Minister is near or above 50%. Recent polling shows his approval/favourability in the mid-30s to low-40s, with a declining trend since the immediate post-election period. Unless there is a dramatic and unforeseen shift in public opinion, it is highly likely that his approval rating will be less than 50 on September 18, 2024[1][2][5].
