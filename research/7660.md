### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- China has consistently led in animal cloning and gene editing, having successfully cloned primates (Zhong Zhong and Hua Hua) and conducted the controversial first gene editing of human embryos[1][3].
- As of 2022, Chinese scientists continued to make advances in primate cloning, notably achieving the first successful cloning of a rhesus monkey—a species genetically closer to humans than previous clones[1].
- Technical barriers to human cloning remain high; even Chinese experts consider human reproductive cloning insurmountable with present knowledge[1].
- No verified reports of successful human cloning exist globally as of May 23, 2022[2].

### Recent Announcements and Policies

- The He Jiankui gene-editing affair (2018) led to increased regulatory scrutiny and calls for clearer oversight of human genome and embryo research in China[3][4][5].
- China's regulatory framework has become more explicit, especially after international controversy, though enforcement and transparency remain less stringent than in many Western countries[3][4].

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Peer-reviewed journals (e.g., Nature Communications for cloning research, PNAS for ethical analysis)[1][2][3].
- Official Chinese government and policy publications documenting changes to ethical oversight post-He Jiankui[4][5].
- International media coverage and scientific news outlets reporting on credible claims of human cloning.

### Key Differences Affecting the Forecast

| Factor                     | Reference Cases (Primate Cloning)  | Human Cloning Case            |
|----------------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Technical difficulty       | High, but overcome (primates)      | Extremely high, unsolved[1]   |
| Regulatory environment     | Permissive/ambiguous in China      | Increasingly strict[3][4][5]  |
| Global scrutiny            | Moderate                           | Extremely high[2][3][5]       |
| Societal/ethical pressure  | Moderate                           | Extreme[2][5]                 |
| Willingness to take risks  | Demonstrated (e.g., He Jiankui)    | Possibly diminished post-2018  |

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- Technical hurdles remain formidable; primate cloning does not guarantee immediate feasibility in humans[1][2].
- Regulatory tightening and global scrutiny may deter public or even clandestine attempts[3][4][5].
- Clandestine or unauthorized research is difficult to rule out entirely.
- The first successful human clone must be credibly reported to the public for the question to resolve as "Yes".

### Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given China’s leading technical expertise and a history of regulatory ambiguity, it is more likely than most countries to attempt or succeed in human cloning once feasible. However, as of May 23, 2022, the technical hurdles and increasing regulatory scrutiny post-He Jiankui affair reduce the likelihood of imminent public success. China remains the most probable location relative to other nations, but the probability of human cloning occurring anywhere in the near term is still low, given current technological and regulatory realities.

**Estimated probability (as of 2022-05-23):**  
- China is the leading candidate, but the overall probability of a successful, publicly reported human clone anywhere before 2030 remains well below 20%.
