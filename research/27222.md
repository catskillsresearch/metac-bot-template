# Ukrainian Offensive into Russian Territory: Status and Forecast Analysis

As of mid-August 2024, Ukraine has launched a significant offensive into Russia's Kursk Oblast, marking a major development in the ongoing conflict. This analysis examines the current status and relevant factors that may help forecast whether Ukraine will maintain offensives at least five miles into Russian territory by October 1, 2024.

## Current Status of Ukrainian Offensive (as of August 12, 2024)

Ukrainian forces launched an offensive operation into Russia's Kursk Oblast on August 6, 2024, and have made substantial territorial gains:

- Ukrainian forces have made confirmed advances up to 10 kilometers (approximately 6.2 miles) into Russia's Kursk Oblast as of August 7, 2024[1].
- Geolocated footage published on August 6-7 showed Ukrainian armored vehicles advancing to positions along the 38K-030 route about 10 kilometers from the international border[1].
- By August 12, 2024, Kursk Oblast Governor Alexei Smirnov acknowledged that Ukrainian forces had seized 28 settlements in Kursk Oblast and advanced roughly 12 kilometers (approximately 7.5 miles) deep along a 40-kilometer-long front[2].
- Independent analysis has observed geolocated footage indicating Ukrainian forces operating up to 24 kilometers (approximately 15 miles) from the international border[2].

## Scale and Scope of Operations

The Ukrainian offensive appears to be substantial in both scale and scope:

- Ukrainian forces have reportedly penetrated at least two Russian defensive lines and a stronghold[1].
- A Russian insider source claimed that Ukrainian forces seized 45 square kilometers of territory within Kursk Oblast since launching the operation on August 6[1].
- Ukrainian forces have reportedly captured 11 total settlements, including Nikolaevo-Daryino, Darino, and Sverdlikovo, and are operating within Lyubimovka (eight kilometers north of the Sumy Oblast border)[1].
- As of August 11-12, there were claims and geolocated footage indicating Ukrainian forces operating in or near 29 settlements on August 11, expanding to 40 settlements by August 12[2].

## Russian Response and Countermeasures

The Russian response to the Ukrainian offensive has been mixed:

- The Kremlin's response has been described as contradictory, attempting to balance presenting the effort as a notable Ukrainian escalation while avoiding overstating its potential implications[1].
- Some Russian military bloggers heavily criticized the Russian military command for not detecting preparations for or preventing Ukrainian offensive operations into Kursk Oblast[1].
- As of August 12, Russian milbloggers initially claimed that Ukrainian offensive activity had decreased and that Russian forces were stabilizing the frontline, but a prominent Kremlin-affiliated milblogger refuted these claims, noting that Russian forces were "far from stabilizing the situation" due in part to poor command and control[2].
- Russia is reportedly relocating troops to the area, with estimates suggesting 15,000 to 20,000 additional troops being moved from other regions, including from the Kharkiv region[4].

## Continued Ukrainian Advances

Despite Russian claims of stabilization, evidence suggests Ukrainian forces continued to advance through mid-August:

- Geolocated footage and reporting from August 10-11 indicated that Ukrainian forces advanced westward and northwestward in Kursk Oblast[3].
- Ukrainian forces reportedly launched new incursions into western Kursk Oblast near multiple settlements including Slobodka-Ivanovka, Tetkino, Gordeevka, Uspenka, and Viktorovka[2].
- Geolocated footage published on August 11 indicated Ukrainian forces were recently operating southeast of Korenevo and had advanced near Kremyanoye[3].

## Assessment and Limitations

Several factors may influence whether Ukraine will maintain offensives at least five miles into Russian territory by October 1, 2024:

1. **Current Depth of Penetration**: Ukrainian forces have already advanced well beyond the five-mile threshold, with confirmed advances of 10-24 kilometers (approximately 6.2-15 miles) into Russian territory.

2. **Russian Counteroffensive Capability**: Russia's ability to push Ukrainian forces back will depend on their success in redeploying forces from other fronts and organizing effective counteroffensives.

3. **Ukrainian Strategic Objectives**: It remains unclear whether Ukraine intends this as a temporary raid or a longer-term territorial hold. Some reports suggest Ukrainian forces are preparing for prolonged operations.

4. **Limitations in Available Information**: The information available is from early-mid August 2024, and the situation may evolve significantly by October 1, 2024.

The current evidence suggests Ukrainian forces have established a significant presence beyond the five-mile threshold into Russian territory. Whether this will be maintained until October 1 will depend on both Ukrainian strategic decisions and the effectiveness of Russian countermeasures.
