## Comparison to Reference Cases

- **Stellar-mass black hole mergers** were successfully detected by LIGO multiple times by 2017[1][5]. These events involved higher-frequency gravitational waves and a mature, highly sensitive detection instrument.
- **Supermassive black hole (SMBH) mergers** emit gravitational waves at much lower frequencies, requiring pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) for detection. As of December 2017, no SMBH merger had been detected, but three major PTA projects formed the International Pulsar Timing Array consortium to improve sensitivity[4].

## Key Differences Affecting the Forecast

- **Detection Method**: LIGO and PTAs operate in different frequency ranges, with PTAs being less mature in terms of direct detections as of 2017.
- **Astrophysical Rates and Amplitudes**: SMBH mergers are rarer and their gravitational wave amplitude and frequency content differ significantly from stellar-mass black hole mergers.
- **Technological Progress**: PTAs were expected to improve sensitivity, but actual rates of progress and pulsar discoveries were uncertain.
- **Expected Timeline**: A 2017 analysis predicted a "near 100 percent chance" of a PTA detection of SMBH merger gravitational waves within 10 years, based on available galaxy and pulsar data[4].
- **Detection Window and Publication Lag**: The gravitational wave signal from an SMBH merger persists for millions of years, but detection requires sufficiently sensitive pulsar timing, and publication can lag data collection.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

- The **2017 reference forecast** suggested a near-certainty of detection within 10 years, implying a high probability of meeting a November 30, 2027, publication deadline[4].
- **Adjusting for uncertainties**:
  - PTA sensitivity improvements may not proceed as quickly as hoped due to technical or funding constraints.
  - Astrophysical rates of SMBH mergers could be overestimated.
  - Peer-reviewed publication could lag detection, especially if the statistical significance is borderline or data analysis is complex.

Given these factors, a **probabilistic assessment as of December 2017** would reasonably estimate the chance of a 4-sigma (or equivalent) peer-reviewed announcement by November 30, 2027, at around **80â€“90%**, slightly reduced from the "near 100 percent" estimate to account for operational, astrophysical, and publication uncertainties.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- The forecast depends on astrophysical event rates, technological progress in PTAs, and efficient data analysis and publication.
- If PTA sensitivity does not increase as anticipated or if SMBH mergers are less common or detectable than models suggest, detection could be delayed beyond 2027.
- Unforeseen technical, funding, or collaboration issues could further reduce the probability.
