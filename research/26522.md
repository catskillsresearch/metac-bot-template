## Historical Reference: The East India Company

The East India Company (EIC) rose to become a de facto military and administrative power, controlling vast territories, maintaining armies totaling over 250,000 soldiers, and directly engaging in warfare and treaty-making with states[2][3][5]. This was possible due to weak central authority in target regions, the company's private revenue base, and limited early-modern state capacity to regulate or nationalize such an actor[2][3].

## Current Situation: AI Companies and Sovereignty

- No AI company today possesses private military forces comparable to the EIC or any ability to wage large-scale war independently of state frameworks.
- Modern international law and state practice reserve the legitimate use of force, treaty-making, and war powers to sovereign states.
- Contemporary companies are subject to extensive regulation, especially regarding dual-use and military technologies. Any attempt by an AI company to amass private military power or act militarily against a state would almost certainly provoke rapid intervention—nationalization, legal action, or military suppression—by the host or affected governments.
- The resolution of the question explicitly disqualifies companies effectively controlled by governments, a likely outcome should any AI company approach military autonomy.

## Key Differences Affecting the Forecast

- **Sovereignty and State Power:** The modern state system is vastly more robust than that of the EIC era. Corporate actors cannot legally or practically rival state militaries or sovereignty.
- **Legal and Normative Constraints:** International law and domestic regulation provide powerful barriers to private military action at scale.
- **Government Leverage:** States possess overwhelming legal, economic, and military tools to prevent private entities from becoming independent military powers, especially where AGI is involved.
- **Precedents:** No private military or technology company has achieved or maintained independent military power in the modern era. PMCs remain subordinate to state authority.

## Recent Announcements/Policies

- Governments and international organizations are increasing scrutiny and regulation of AI, particularly regarding national security risks.
- Discussions around AGI safety and military applications have led to proposals for tighter governmental oversight and potential international agreements to prevent AGI proliferation outside state control.

## Authoritative Sources

- Historical record of the East India Company’s armies and autonomy[2][3][5].
- Modern international law on the monopoly of force.
- Recent government statements on AI regulation and national security (see [Aschenbrenner, 2024] for arguments about AGI military advantage, but note that plausible scenarios still involve state absorption or control).

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- Rapid AGI development could outpace state response in some scenarios, particularly in failed states or ambiguous jurisdictions, but such cases are unlikely to meet the resolution criteria for an AI company acting as an independent military power against a recognized sovereign state.
- Legal ambiguity around "effective control" could arise, but the resolution text delegates final authority to Metaculus admins.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the above, and barring unforeseen breakdowns in state authority or international order, the probability that an AI company will, within five years of AGI, independently sign a treaty with or wage war against a sovereign state (without being effectively controlled by a government) is extremely low—likely well under 5%.
