## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- In April 2020, NASA selected SpaceX, Blue Origin, and Dynetics to develop lunar human landing systems (HLS) for Artemis, aiming to return astronauts—including the first woman—to the Moon by 2024[2][3].
- Historically, NASA’s human spaceflight programs have faced technical and schedule delays, often down-selecting to the most promising provider as missions approach critical milestones.

As of June 2020:
- SpaceX proposed a single-stage lunar variant of Starship, leveraging experience with rapid development cycles and recent crewed launches.
- Blue Origin led a team with Lockheed Martin, Northrup Grumman, and Draper, offering a multi-stage lander.
- Dynetics proposed a single-stage lander with a novel, low-slung design[2].
- None of the companies had flown a lunar lander or demonstrated full mission capabilities at this stage.

## 2. Recent Announcements and Policies

- NASA’s April 2020 announcement committed to funding all three companies for initial design and development, but indicated that a down-selection would occur before the first crewed landing attempt[3].
- No final decision on which system would fly Artemis III (the first crewed lunar landing) had been made as of June 2020.
- NASA’s stated goal was a crewed lunar landing by 2024, but funding and political support remained uncertain.

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- NASA press releases and procurement records[2][3].
- Artemis program documentation and technical requirements[5].
- Company announcements and technical white papers.

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- As of June 2020, significant technical and schedule risk remained for all providers.
- NASA’s down-selection process, funding availability, and evolving mission requirements could change the outcome.
- Political shifts or new technical challenges could delay or redirect the Artemis program.
- Measurement is unambiguous: the first team to land a living human on the Moon with their system resolves the question.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment (as of 2020-06-20)

Given:
- SpaceX’s track record and cost advantages, but also high technical risk (orbital refueling, lunar landing).
- Blue Origin and Dynetics’ more conventional designs but less orbital human spaceflight experience.
- NASA’s pattern of down-selecting to a single provider for crewed missions.

A reasonable probabilistic assessment as of June 2020:
- SpaceX: 55%
- Blue Origin: 25%
- Dynetics: 20%
- None before 2030: <5%

## Summary Table

| Provider      | Probability (2020) | Rationale                                               |
|---------------|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| SpaceX        | 55%                | Aggressive development, NASA favor, cost, but risky     |
| Blue Origin   | 25%                | Strong team, conventional approach, slower progress     |
| Dynetics      | 20%                | Innovative design, less experience, funding questions   |
| None/Other    | <5%                | Historical delays, but unlikely all will fail by 2030   |
