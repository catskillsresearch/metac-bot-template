### 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The average US 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was 6.81% for the week ending May 15, 2025, and increased slightly to 6.86% by May 22, 2025[3][5].
- Rates have hovered in the 6.8%–7.0% range in recent weeks, reflecting a period of stability after significant volatility in previous years[3][5].
- The first half of 2025 has seen persistent high rates, with only modest shifts up or down.

### 2. Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Metric

- Analysts point to continued economic uncertainty, including rising Treasury yields, high federal debt, and a recent US credit rating downgrade, as factors maintaining elevated mortgage rates[2].
- Inflation has begun to moderate, but not enough to produce a significant drop in rates[1].
- No major policy shifts or Federal Reserve announcements indicate an imminent, substantial change in mortgage rates for June.

### 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Freddie Mac’s Primary Mortgage Market Survey (PMMS) is the reference standard for weekly mortgage rate averages[3].
- Trading Economics and industry reporting provide corroborating figures and projections[5].
- Expert predictions from economists at Cotality, Bright MLS, and other firms reinforce the expectation for rates to remain near current levels[1][2].

### 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- Mortgage rates are sensitive to sudden shifts in economic data, inflation expectations, and Treasury yields, all of which can be volatile on a week-to-week basis[2].
- Forecasts assume no abrupt policy changes or macroeconomic shocks between now and June 12, 2025.

### Probabilistic Assessment

Given the available data and expert consensus, the most likely range for the US 30-year fixed-rate mortgage average for the week of June 12, 2025, is:

- **Expected value:** 6.85% (rounded to nearest basis point)
- **Probable range (68% confidence):** 6.80% – 6.95%
- **Low probability of exceeding 7.00% barring a major market shock**
