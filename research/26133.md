## Key Factual Information as of July 15, 2024

**Current Status and Historical Trends**
- Benjamin Netanyahu is the serving Prime Minister of Israel as of July 2024, having held the office since December 2022 and previously from 1996–1999 and 2009–2021, making him the longest-serving prime minister in Israeli history[1][3].
- Netanyahu has maintained his position through multiple political crises and elections, demonstrating significant political resilience.

**Recent Announcements and Political Developments**
- On July 7, 2024, Netanyahu was actively conducting international diplomacy, including a call with the UK Prime Minister, confirming his status as Prime Minister at that time[1].
- On July 2, 2024, Netanyahu held discussions with French President Macron, further confirming his active leadership role[3].
- Netanyahu is scheduled to address a joint session of the U.S. Congress on July 24, 2024, indicating both international recognition of his leadership and no anticipated change in his position before that date[2].
- Despite ongoing criticism of his government’s handling of the October 2023 Hamas attacks and the subsequent war in Gaza, there have been no authoritative reports of a successful no-confidence motion, coalition collapse, or Netanyahu’s resignation as of July 15, 2024.

**Authoritative Sources for Verification**
- Official government press releases and international diplomatic communications confirm Netanyahu’s status as Prime Minister in July 2024[1][3].
- Major news outlets report on Netanyahu’s scheduled address to the U.S. Congress and ongoing diplomatic activities[2].

**Limitations and Uncertainties**
- Israeli politics are highly dynamic, and coalition governments can be unstable. While there is no current indication of Netanyahu’s imminent departure, unforeseen political developments, legal challenges, or coalition shifts could alter the situation before September 30, 2024.
- The available information only confirms Netanyahu’s position up to mid-July 2024; future events between July 15 and September 30, 2024, cannot be predicted with certainty based solely on current data.

## Conclusion

As of July 15, 2024, all available evidence indicates that Benjamin Netanyahu remains Prime Minister of Israel, with no credible reports of an impending resignation or removal. He is expected to remain in office at least through late July 2024, and there are no public indications of a scheduled leadership change before September 30, 2024. However, the inherently volatile nature of Israeli politics means that this forecast is subject to change if new developments arise.
