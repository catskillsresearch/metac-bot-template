# Forecasting Kamala Harris's 538 Approval Rating for December 30, 2024

To assess whether Kamala Harris's FiveThirtyEight approval rating will reach or exceed 44.0% by December 30, 2024, I'll analyze historical trends, current status, and relevant factors that could influence her approval rating.

## Historical Trends and Current Status

Harris's approval ratings have shown significant volatility throughout her political career:

- In October 2021, Harris's approval rating was at 42.7% according to FiveThirtyEight's tracker, which was lower than President Biden's 43.7% at that time[1].

- As of mid-July 2024, Harris had a net approval rating of -17, which was among the worst vice presidential ratings in modern polling history[3].

- However, Harris experienced a remarkable turnaround after becoming the presumptive Democratic nominee. By September 2024, her favorability rating had risen to approximately 46%, nearly erasing her negative net approval rating[4].

- This represented a significant improvement compared to her position earlier in 2024 and placed her in a better position than former President Trump, who remained almost 10 points underwater in favorability ratings (53% unfavorable) as of September 2024[4].

- By September 17, 2024, Harris's net favorability rating had crossed into positive territory for the first time since July 2021, according to FiveThirtyEight's polling average[3].

## Factors Potentially Affecting Future Approval Ratings

Several factors could influence Harris's approval rating trajectory toward December 2024:

- **Debate Performance Impact**: Harris received a polling bump following what was described as a strong debate performance against former President Trump in September 2024[3]. The sustainability of such bumps typically depends on subsequent events and messaging.

- **Electoral Performance**: FiveThirtyEight's election model in September 2024 had Harris favored to win the election 61 times out of 100, while The Economist's polling average showed Harris opening her largest lead yet in the national popular vote at 4.4 points over Trump[3]. The outcome of the election would significantly impact her subsequent approval ratings.

- **Public Perception Shift**: Harris successfully underwent what was described as "an image makeover of epic proportions" between July and September 2024[3]. This suggests her team found effective messaging strategies that could potentially be maintained.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several limitations affect the forecast reliability:

- The most recent data available in the search results is from September 2024, leaving a three-month gap before the December 30 resolution date.

- Approval ratings are highly sensitive to current events, policy outcomes, and media coverage, making long-term predictions challenging.

- FiveThirtyEight's methodology aggregates multiple polls with different methodologies, sample sizes, and potential biases, which can introduce variability.

- Historical precedent shows that approval ratings often fluctuate significantly during transition periods and the early months of a new term or after major political events.

## Conclusion

Based on the available data through September 2024, Harris had already achieved an approval rating of approximately 46%[4], which exceeds the 44.0% threshold specified in the question. The positive trajectory from July to September 2024 suggests momentum in her public perception. However, without more recent data closer to December 2024, it's difficult to make a definitive forecast about whether this level would be maintained through December 30, 2024.

The significant improvement in Harris's approval ratings from mid-2024 to September 2024 demonstrates that public opinion can shift substantially in relatively short periods, making the December 2024 outcome dependent on intervening events and Harris's performance in the final months of 2024.
