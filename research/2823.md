## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Smallpox was declared eradicated by the World Health Organization (WHO) in May 1980. The last known cases occurred in 1978 following accidental laboratory exposure[4][5].
- Since eradication, authorized stocks of live variola virus have been retained in only two WHO-approved labs: the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, USA, and the State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology in Koltsovo, Russia. All research using the virus is under strict WHO oversight[1][4].
- No new cases of smallpox have been reported globally since 1978, and all natural transmission has ceased[4][5].

## 2. Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Metric

- In January 2025, the US began the formal process of withdrawing from WHO oversight. This unprecedented move introduces uncertainty regarding future inspections, biosafety, and reporting standards at the CDC's smallpox repository[1][3].
- The US exit from WHO could reduce the transparency and international oversight of smallpox research and storage, potentially increasing risks of accidental release or unauthorized access[3].
- Advances in synthetic biology, demonstrated by the 2017 synthesis of horsepox virus, have shown that orthopoxviruses can be reconstructed from DNA fragments in a laboratory for a relatively modest cost, raising concerns about the possibility of de novo smallpox creation[5].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- WHO maintains up-to-date status and policy guidance on smallpox and its remaining virus stocks[4].
- Recent expert commentary and policy analysis highlight the need for continued vigilance and preparedness, even though the probability of re-emergence remains low[5].
- Reports from infectious disease specialists emphasize that even a single case would constitute a global public health emergency, underscoring the criticality of maintaining oversight and preparedness[5].

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties in Measurement

- The forecast hinges on the integrity of biosecurity protocols at the two authorized labs and the effectiveness of international oversight, both of which are now under question due to the US-WHO split[1][3].
- The potential for synthetic reconstruction of smallpox introduces a new, hard-to-quantify risk, especially given the increasing accessibility of genetic engineering tools[5].
- Population immunity has waned, as routine smallpox vaccination ceased decades ago, increasing the impact of any potential outbreak[2].
- The probability remains extremely low but is no longer strictly zero due to synthetic biology risks and changing geopolitical factors.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

- Historically, the probability of another smallpox case has been functionally zero since 1980, given the eradication and strict containment.
- As of mid-2025, the risk is slightly elevated due to:
  - Reduced international oversight at the US lab[1][3]
  - Advances in synthetic biology enabling potential de novo synthesis[5]
- While still very unlikely, the probability is no longer negligible. The most likely scenario for a new case would be a laboratory accident or synthetic creationâ€”not a natural re-emergence.

**Forecast:**  
The chance of a confirmed case of smallpox infection in a human by the end of 2029 remains extremely low, but is higher than in the immediate post-eradication decades, primarily due to new biosafety and technological challenges[1][3][5].
