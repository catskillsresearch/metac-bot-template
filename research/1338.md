## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The Drake Equation's second parameter, \( f_p \), represents the fraction of stars that form planetary systems.
- Early estimates of \( f_p \) were highly uncertain, but since the 1990s, the discovery of exoplanets has revolutionized the field.
- By 2018, thousands of exoplanets had been detected, mainly by the Kepler mission and radial velocity surveys. These findings established that planets are common around stars.
- According to sources available as of 2018, the prevailing estimate for \( f_p \) was very high. For example, a widely referenced value in popular summaries is \( f_p = 0.99 \), indicating that nearly every star hosts at least one planet[5].
- The reference model for this forecasting series assumes a log-uniform prior for \( f_p \) between 0.1 and 1, but the current scientific consensus is much closer to the upper bound[2][5].

## 2. Key Differences Affecting the Forecast

- The main difference between the historical situation (pre-exoplanet era) and 2018 is a dramatic increase in the observed fraction of stars with planets, especially for Sun-like stars.
- Detection techniques are biased toward large planets and planets close to their stars, but statistical corrections are routinely applied. These corrections, and the consistency of planet occurrence rates across surveys, bolster confidence in high values for \( f_p \).
- The definition for this parameter in the question is clear: a star counts as having planets if it has at least one planet. For binaries, the percentage is based on the number of stars, not systems[2].
- Some uncertainties remain for lower-mass stars and for stars in dense clusters, but these are unlikely to bring the estimate below 0.5 for the galaxy as a whole.

## 3. Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

- Given that the literature and authoritative sources as of 2018 regularly cited values of \( f_p \) at or above 0.9, and no major contradictory evidence emerged in the preceding years, the most credible point estimate for \( f_p \) is between 0.9 and 1.0[5].
- A conservative probabilistic assessment would assign a median close to 0.95, with a 95% confidence interval of [0.8, 1.0], reflecting some residual uncertainty in detection limits and edge cases (e.g., very low-mass or high-mass stars).
- The lower end (e.g., \( f_p = 0.1 \)) is highly implausible given 2018 knowledge.

## 4. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Wikipedia and academic overviews cite \( f_p \) as "nearly 1" based on Kepler and other exoplanet mission data[1][5].
- Major outreach and educational sites, as well as the Metaculus forecasting series, agree on this summary[2][4][5].
- Original research from peer-reviewed journals (not directly cited in search results) would further support this, but the consensus is well-reflected in the above sources.

## 5. Limitations and Uncertainties

- Despite high confidence, some uncertainty remains due to:
  - Detection biases (e.g., planets in wide orbits are harder to detect).
  - The possibility of rare stellar types or environments where planet formation is suppressed.
  - Definitions: While the question specifies "all stars," some surveys focus on FGK (Sun-like) stars, possibly overstating the case for red dwarfs or massive stars.
- The fraction for binary or multiple star systems is somewhat ambiguous, but the resolution criteria clarify that planet occurrence is measured per star, not per system[2].
