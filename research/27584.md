# Mpox Clade I Outbreak Analysis: Potential Spread to Angola

The current mpox outbreak in Africa, particularly the spread of Clade I, presents a complex epidemiological situation that requires careful analysis to assess the likelihood of Angola confirming Clade I infections before October 1, 2024.

## Current Status of Mpox Clade I Outbreak

As of mid-August 2024, Africa is experiencing its largest recorded outbreak of mpox. Since January 2023, over 22,000 suspected cases and more than 1,200 suspected deaths have been reported across the continent[1]. The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) has been reporting the largest number of yearly suspected Clade I mpox cases on record, with the current outbreak being more widespread than any previous DRC outbreak[4].

According to Africa CDC data from August 16, 2024, a total of 18,837 mpox cases have been reported in Africa during 2024, including 3,101 confirmed cases and 541 deaths (case fatality rate: 3%) from 12 Africa Union Member States[3]. The outbreak has shown significant growth, with suspected cases across the continent surging past 17,000, a substantial increase from 7,146 cases in 2022 and 14,957 cases in 2023[2].

## Geographic Spread of Clade I

The Clade I outbreak has expanded beyond its traditional endemic regions:

1. **Initial Spread**: While Clade I MPXV is endemic in DRC, the current outbreak has resulted in transmission to neighboring countries[4].

2. **Confirmed Cases in Neighboring Countries**: 
   - Republic of Congo (ROC) declared a Clade I mpox outbreak in April 2024
   - Central African Republic (CAR) has confirmed cases
   - Rwanda and Uganda confirmed Clade I cases in late July 2024
   - Burundi and Kenya have also reported cases[4][2]

3. **Recent Developments**: As of August 19, 2024, a total of 53 confirmed Clade I cases, including four deaths, have been reported across multiple countries[3]. On August 22, 2024, Gabon reported a suspected case of mpox Clade Ib in a person with travel history to Uganda[3].

4. **International Spread**: The first cases outside Africa have been detected, with Sweden confirming an imported MPXV Clade Ib case on August 15, 2024, and Thailand reporting a confirmed imported case on August 22, 2024. Both cases had travel history to Africa[3].

## Factors Relevant to Potential Spread to Angola

Several factors are relevant when considering the potential for Clade I mpox to spread to Angola:

1. **Geographic Proximity**: Angola shares a long border with the DRC, which is the epicenter of the current Clade I outbreak.

2. **Pattern of Spread**: The outbreak has already spread to at least four countries neighboring the DRC that had not previously reported mpox (Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, and Uganda)[2][4].

3. **Rate of Expansion**: The outbreak is expanding rapidly, with over 100 laboratory-confirmed cases of Clade Ib reported in neighboring countries in just one month prior to mid-August 2024.

4. **Surveillance Limitations**: Africa CDC has acknowledged "weaknesses in surveillance, laboratory testing and contact tracing"[2], suggesting that the true extent of the outbreak may be underreported.

5. **Public Health Emergency Declarations**: The Africa CDC declared Mpox a Public Health Emergency of Continental Security on August 13, 2024[2], highlighting the seriousness of the situation across the continent.

## Uncertainties and Limitations

Several factors create uncertainty in forecasting the spread to Angola:

1. **Surveillance Capacity**: Limited testing and surveillance capabilities may delay detection of cases if they do occur.

2. **Border Controls**: Information about specific border control measures between Angola and DRC is not available in the search results.

3. **Transmission Dynamics**: The new Clade Ib strain appears to be spreading mainly through sexual networks, which could affect the pattern and speed of international spread.

4. **Public Health Response**: The effectiveness of containment measures in DRC and neighboring countries will influence further spread.

## Conclusion

While Angola is not specifically mentioned in the current reports of confirmed Clade I mpox cases, the rapid geographic expansion of the outbreak to multiple countries neighboring DRC, including previously unaffected nations, suggests a significant risk of further spread in the region. The pattern of transmission to countries bordering DRC, combined with Angola's extensive shared border with DRC, creates conditions where spread to Angola is plausible within the timeframe ending October 1, 2024.

However, actual confirmation would depend on Angola's surveillance and testing capabilities, as well as the effectiveness of any preventive measures implemented. The current evidence indicates an active and expanding outbreak with demonstrated capacity for cross-border spread, but specific prediction would require more detailed information about Angola's public health infrastructure and border situation.
