# Forecasting Analysis: Sudanese Refugees in Chad by July 1, 2025

As of May 22, 2025, I'm analyzing available data to forecast the number of Sudanese refugees expected to be in Chad by July 1, 2025. The most recent official figure from May 15, 2025, indicates 1,216,666 Sudanese refugees in Chad, which serves as our primary baseline for this forecast.

## Current Situation and Historical Trends

The Sudanese refugee crisis in Chad has been escalating significantly since April 2023 when conflict erupted in Sudan. Chad has experienced a massive influx of refugees, with the following key data points:

- As of December 2024, approximately 723,121 Sudanese refugees had crossed into eastern Chad through 32 entry points[5]
- By early 2025, Chad had received over 580,000 new refugees since April 2023, adding to the over 400,000 Sudanese refugees who were already there (totaling approximately 980,000)[2]
- As of May 15, 2025, this number had grown to 1,216,666 Sudanese refugees

The demographic composition is notable, with 88% of these refugees being women and children, many arriving traumatized, injured, and malnourished[5].

## Key Factors Affecting the Forecast

Several critical factors will influence refugee numbers between now and July 1, 2025:

1. **Ongoing Conflict Intensity**: Armed clashes between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) escalated significantly since September 2024, particularly in El Fasher, North Darfur[5]. The conflict shows no signs of resolution as of early 2025[5].

2. **Projected Escalation**: Humanitarian needs in eastern Chad are expected to increase significantly, with projections indicating up to 1.4 million refugees in total[5].

3. **Border Dynamics**: Recent border crossing extensions for aid deliveries suggest continued movement of people across the Sudan-Chad border.

4. **Refugee Arrival Rate**: Chad has been receiving thousands of new arrivals each week, with the Ouadda√Ø region being particularly impacted, sheltering 486,900 refugees[5].

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on the available data, I project the following range for Sudanese refugees in Chad by July 1, 2025:

- **Lower bound (90% confidence)**: 1,250,000 refugees
- **Median estimate**: 1,285,000 refugees
- **Upper bound (90% confidence)**: 1,320,000 refugees

This assessment is based on the following reasoning:

1. The increase from December 2024 (723,121) to May 15, 2025 (1,216,666) represents approximately 493,545 new refugees over about 4.5 months, or roughly 110,000 per month.

2. However, this rate appears to have slowed somewhat in recent months, as suggested by the difference between projected figures and current numbers.

3. For the period between May 15 and July 1, 2025 (approximately 1.5 months), we might expect an additional 35,000-100,000 refugees, depending on conflict intensity and border conditions.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors could significantly impact this forecast:

1. **Conflict Escalation**: Any major intensification of fighting in Sudan, particularly in border regions, could dramatically increase refugee flows.

2. **Seasonal Factors**: The approaching rainy season (typically June-September in the region) could affect both conflict dynamics and border crossings.

3. **Humanitarian Response**: The 2025 Regional Refugee Response Plan (RRP) for Sudan covers January to December 2025 and may influence refugee management[3].

4. **Data Reporting Delays**: UNHCR data may have reporting lags that affect the precision of real-time estimates.

Given that Chad is already Africa's largest refugee host per capita with over 1.4 million refugees and asylum seekers in total (not just Sudanese)[2], the country's absorption capacity and the international humanitarian response will be critical factors in managing this ongoing crisis.
