# Forecasting Eric Adams' Status as NYC Mayor on April 1, 2025

As of January 2025, Eric Adams remains the Mayor of New York City, though his administration faces significant challenges that could potentially impact his status in the coming months.

## Current Status and Recent Activities

Eric Adams delivered his fourth State of the City address on January 9, 2025, at The Apollo Theater in Harlem[3][4]. During this address, he outlined his vision for making New York City "the best place to raise a family" and highlighted his administration's achievements[3]. The speech appeared to serve as an unofficial kickoff to his reelection campaign for later in 2025[4].

In his address, Adams acknowledged the difficulties his administration faced in 2024, stating: "Challenging year. Difficult year. And many thought we couldn't get through it, as we continue with this amazing team to make it happen. There were some who said step down. I said no, I'm going to step up."[4] This statement indicates that despite calls for his resignation in 2024, Adams has maintained his position and intends to continue serving as mayor.

As recently as January 13, 2025, Adams held an in-person media availability at City Hall[2], demonstrating his continued active role as mayor.

## Legal Challenges

A significant factor that could affect Adams' status as mayor is the federal corruption trial he faces, which is scheduled to begin in April 2025[4]. The search results do not provide specific details about the charges, but they do mention that 2024 was "marred with scandal, resignations and federal indictments" for Adams' administration[5].

## Administration's Recent Initiatives

Despite these challenges, Adams has continued to advance his mayoral agenda. In his State of the City address, he touted achievements including:

- Taking "nearly 20,000 guns" off the streets during his tenure
- Declining murder and shooting rates
- Increased enforcement against illegal cannabis shops and ghost vehicles
- Passage of what he described as "the most pro-housing zoning proposal in city history"
- Record job creation and housing construction[3][4]

For 2025, Adams announced plans to continue work on housing development, including advancing sites like 100 Gold Street, where over 2,000 new homes are planned[3].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

The primary uncertainty regarding Adams' status as mayor on April 1, 2025, stems from the federal corruption trial scheduled to begin that month. As of January 22, 2025, there have been no official announcements regarding Adams stepping down or being removed from office. However, the outcome of the trial could potentially impact his ability to remain in office.

It's worth noting that according to the resolution criteria for this forecast, a suspension of the mayor by the governor would not be sufficient for Adams to no longer be considered mayor for the purposes of this question.

Based on the information available as of January 22, 2025, Eric Adams remains the Mayor of New York City and has given no public indication of plans to resign before April 1, 2025. However, the pending federal trial represents a significant uncertainty that could affect his status.
