### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The 2024 French legislative elections resulted in a fragmented National Assembly. The New Popular Front (NFP), a left-wing alliance, won the most seats (180–188), followed by President Macron's centrist Together (Ensemble) alliance (161–163 seats), and the far-right National Rally (RN) and its allies (142–143 seats)[1][2].
- No alliance achieved the 289 seats required for an outright majority, creating a hung parliament and significant uncertainty about government formation[1][2].
- The RN's surge was checked by a strategic pact between NFP and Together, with over 210 candidates withdrawing to prevent RN victories in three-way runoffs[1].
- The current Prime Minister, Gabriel Attal, is from Together (Ensemble) and has led a minority government, relying on ad hoc agreements to pass legislation[1].

### Recent Announcements and Policies

- As of July 10, 2024, no new Prime Minister has been officially appointed following the elections. Negotiations for government formation are ongoing, with no single alliance able to claim a stable majority[1][2].
- The French political system allows the President to appoint a Prime Minister, but the government must avoid a no-confidence vote in the National Assembly.

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The official government website (info.gouv.fr) and the Interior Ministry are the definitive sources for the identity and party affiliation of the Prime Minister.
- Election results and seat distributions are confirmed by IPU Parline and major news outlets[1][2].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- As of July 10, 2024, there is no public information indicating that a Prime Minister from outside the New Popular Front or Together has been appointed.
- The possibility remains for a caretaker government or a deadlock, but no evidence supports the appointment of a Prime Minister from another coalition or party.
- The situation is fluid, and coalition negotiations could produce unexpected outcomes, but all available facts point to the Prime Minister being from either NFP or Together, or the position remaining with the current Together caretaker.

**Conclusion:**  
Based on all factual information available as of July 10, 2024, there is no evidence to suggest that the Prime Minister of France will belong to a coalition other than the New Popular Front or Together on July 30, 2024. The most likely scenarios are a Prime Minister from one of these two alliances or a continuation of the current Together-led caretaker government.
