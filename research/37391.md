# Florida Drought Forecast Analysis for June 28, 2025

As of May 29, 2025, Florida is experiencing significant drought conditions that have been worsening through early May. However, recent forecasts suggest potential improvement as the state enters its summer rainy season. This analysis examines available data to forecast whether 14.0 million or more Florida residents will be living in drought conditions by June 28, 2025.

## Current Drought Status

Florida is currently experiencing widespread drought conditions:

- As of early May 2025, approximately 99% of Florida is experiencing some level of drought, with only northern portions of two counties (Escambia and Santa Rosa) unaffected[5].
- The drought has been intensifying, with areas under extreme drought increasing significantly from 4.86% to 16.87% in just one week in early May[5].
- Severe drought expanded from 28.48% to 29.88%, while moderate drought almost doubled from 18.46% to 36.45% during the same period[5].

These statistics indicate that as of early May, nearly all of Florida's population was living under drought conditions, likely exceeding the 14 million threshold mentioned in the question.

## Recent Forecasts and Seasonal Outlook

The most recent and relevant information comes from the May 28, 2025 drought outlook:

- "Drought is expected to be removed from Florida and the rest of the Southeast during the summer"[3].
- Florida has entered its rainy season as of late May 2025[3].
- Earlier forecasts from May 1, 2025 had indicated that "drought conditions are expected to continue through May"[4].

## Timing Considerations

The critical question is whether sufficient improvement will occur between now (May 29) and the target date (June 28):

- The one-month timeframe represents the early part of summer and the beginning of Florida's rainy season.
- The May 28 forecast specifically mentions drought removal "during the summer" but doesn't provide a precise timeline[3].
- The transition from 99% drought coverage to below the 14 million resident threshold would require significant improvement in a relatively short period.

## Assessment

Based on the available information, there are competing factors affecting this forecast:

**Factors suggesting continued drought affecting â‰¥14 million residents:**
- The extreme severity and widespread nature of the drought as of early May (99% coverage)[5]
- The significant worsening trend observed in early May[5]
- The relatively short timeframe (one month) for substantial improvement

**Factors suggesting drought affecting <14 million residents:**
- The most recent forecast (May 28) explicitly states drought is expected to be removed during summer[3]
- Florida has entered its rainy season, which typically brings substantial precipitation[3]
- The May 1 forecast only projected drought continuation "through May," implying possible improvement in June[4]

## Conclusion

The most recent authoritative forecast from May 28, 2025 indicates that drought conditions are expected to be removed from Florida during the summer[3]. While the exact timing isn't specified, this represents a significant change from earlier forecasts that only projected drought continuation through May[4].

Given that Florida has entered its rainy season and the forecast specifically mentions drought removal, there is a reasonable probability that by June 28, 2025, drought conditions will have improved enough to drop below the 14 million resident threshold. However, the widespread nature of the current drought (99% of the state) creates uncertainty about whether sufficient improvement can occur within just one month.

The most prudent forecast is that drought conditions will be improving by June 28 but may still affect a substantial portion of Florida's population. The probability that 14 million or more Florida residents will still be under drought conditions on June 28, 2025 is estimated at 40-50%, with significant uncertainty due to the timing of summer rainfall patterns.
