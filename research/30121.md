# Will Violet be the 2025 Pantone Color of the Year?

Based on available information as of November 2024, there are several indicators and predictions regarding Pantone's 2025 Color of the Year selection. While the official announcement is expected in December 2024, we can analyze current trends and forecasts to assess the likelihood of a violet shade being selected.

## Historical Patterns and Recent Trends

Looking at Pantone's Color of the Year history over the past decade, we can observe certain patterns:

- Violet has appeared once (Ultra Violet in 2018)
- Blue tones have been selected three times (2020, 2021 as part of a duo, and 2022)
- Red/pink tones have appeared four times (2015, 2016 as part of a duo, 2019, and 2023)
- Orange appeared most recently with Peach Fuzz in 2024

This historical pattern suggests Pantone tends to rotate through color families rather than selecting similar hues in consecutive years. Following 2024's Peach Fuzz (an orange tone), this might increase the likelihood of a shift to a different color family.

## Current Predictions and Indicators

Fashion color trend reports for Spring/Summer 2025 from both London and New York Fashion Weeks provide insights into potential color directions:

1. **Brown tones** are prominently featured in predictions, with various sources suggesting shades like Mocha Mousse, described as a "warming" color that combines "the delectable qualities of chocolate and coffee."[3] Other brown variations mentioned include Rum Raisin, Cocoa, Bitter Chocolate, and Chocolate Fondant.[4]

2. **Purple/Plum shades** are also appearing in forecasts. Deep plum is specifically mentioned as having potential for the 2025 Color of the Year.[2] Benjamin Moore's 2025 color pick "Cinnamon Slate" is described as a mix of "heathered plum" and "velvety brown," indicating the prominence of purple-brown hybrid tones.[3]

3. **Green tones** are represented by "White Grape 14-0442 TCX," which appears in both London and New York color palettes, described as a "zingy green shade reminiscent of the first leaves of Spring."[4]

4. **Blue shades** like "Deja Vu Blue 19-4041" are also considered contenders, with the observation that "there hasn't been a bright blue selected since 2008."[4]

## Analysis of Violet's Prospects

Several factors suggest a violet or purple-adjacent shade could be selected:

1. The 2025 color palettes feature purple among the prominent colors, with deep plum specifically mentioned as having "my vote for the Color of the Year 2025."[2]

2. Benjamin Moore's selection of "Cinnamon Slate," described as a "heathered plum" and "velvety brown" mix, indicates that purple-brown hybrid tones are trending in the design world.[3]

3. The trend toward "warm and earthy tones" could manifest in a deep, rich violet rather than a bright purple, aligning with the overall direction toward "richer and calmer" colors.[2]

However, competing factors include:

1. The strong presence of brown tones in predictions, with multiple sources highlighting various chocolate and coffee-inspired shades.

2. The unique appearance of "White Grape" in both London and New York Fashion Week color palettes, potentially signaling its importance.[4]

3. The observation that "after years of safe blue and green tones as Color of the Year choices by most paint brands, I think it's time to shift to other colors."[2]

## Conclusion

Based on available information, violet has a moderate chance of being the 2025 Pantone Color of the Year. While not the most frequently mentioned color family in predictions, purple tones—particularly deep plum and purple-brown hybrids—are appearing in trend forecasts. The final selection will depend on how Pantone interprets broader cultural and design trends, with brown tones and green shades also showing strong potential.

The official announcement expected in December 2024 will provide the definitive answer, with the color's HSV hue value determining whether it falls within the violet range (255 ≤ H < 330) specified in the resolution criteria.
