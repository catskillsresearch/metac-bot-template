### 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of 2020, there were 72 active AGI R&D projects in 37 countries, spanning for-profit corporations, universities, non-profits, and some government-backed organizations[1].
- Major AI advances over the past decade have been led by private companies (e.g., Google DeepMind, OpenAI, Facebook AI Research), with universities and nonprofits playing key roles in foundational theory and ethics[1][3].
- Historical analogues (e.g., nuclear weapons, early internet) saw government-led or government-collaborative efforts, especially for high-stakes or resource-intensive breakthroughs.
- By 2021, government involvement in AI was significant (especially in China and the US), but private sector R&D capabilities—especially in computational resources and talent—were often on par or superior to government labs[4].

### 2. Recent Announcements and Policies

- Both the US and Chinese governments had, by 2021, set national strategies for AI leadership, with China explicitly stating ambitions to lead in AGI[4].
- Substantial government investments and public-private partnerships were ramping up, but the most advanced AGI research groups remained in the private sector.
- Some AGI research (especially with potential national security implications) could be classified, commissioned, or absorbed by government projects if progress accelerates or strategic interests dictate.

### 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Wikipedia’s AGI overview and project list[1]
- Metaculus and expert survey data on AGI timelines and research distribution[3]
- SCSP memo on US-China AGI paths and national ambitions[4]
- Our World in Data on AI capabilities and progress[5]

### 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- The line between "government project" and "private research" is increasingly blurred by funding, collaboration, and data sharing.
- New policy actions or geopolitical shocks could trigger rapid nationalization or militarization of AGI research.
- The definition of "first AGI" and the transparency of its announcement may affect whether the responsible group is clearly identifiable as government-led.

**Probabilistic Assessment (as of 2021-11-05):**

Given the above, the most likely scenario is that the first AGI will be developed by a private or hybrid (public-private) research group, but with a non-negligible chance of government project involvement, either through direct sponsorship, collaboration, or post-hoc nationalization.

- Estimated probability that the first AGI group is part of a government project as of 2021: **20–35%**
- Probability that it is led by a for-profit corporation or hybrid with government ties: **65–80%**

These probabilities reflect the dominance of private sector AI research in 2021, rising government interest, and historical precedent for government involvement in transformative technologies, tempered by today’s more distributed and open AI research landscape[1][3][4].
