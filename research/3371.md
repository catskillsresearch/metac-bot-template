### 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of November 2019, EU Regulation 1099/2009 explicitly includes farmed fish only within the scope of Article 3(1), which requires animals to be spared avoidable pain, distress, or suffering at slaughter. All operational standards (including mandatory stunning) apply to terrestrial farm animals but *not* to fish[5].
- EU institutions acknowledge the need for separate, fish-specific slaughter standards, but no such standards had been developed or enacted by 2019[5].
- The general trend in EU animal welfare law has been toward increased regulation (e.g., mandatory stunning for mammals and birds), often following advances in scientific understanding and public concern.

### 2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- The European Green Deal, launched in December 2019, signaled new focus on animal welfare and sustainable food systems, including aquaculture, but as of this date, did not include any binding commitment or proposal to mandate fish stunning[5].
- The European Food Safety Authority and animal welfare groups have called for development and implementation of humane slaughter techniques for fish, but cite technical and species-specific challenges.

### 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Official EU legal texts: Regulation 1099/2009, Regulation 2019/1241[5][1].
- Animal Law Europe research notes and policy analyses[5].
- European Commission communications, e.g., the European Green Deal (2019).

### 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- Scientific and technical limitations: Humane stunning methods are not yet fully validated or feasible for all commercially farmed fish species.
- Policy uncertainty: While there is a foundation for future legislation, as of 2019, there was no draft directive, timetable, or formal proposal for mandatory stunning.
- Measurement: Regulatory change often proceeds incrementally, with non-binding recommendations preceding enforceable mandates; partial or voluntary adoption by some Member States could occur without an EU-wide requirement.

### Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the absence of draft legislation, the technical barriers cited, and the slow pace of previous regulatory expansions, the probability that the EU will require at least 50% of all commercially farmed fish to be stunned before slaughter by law (with effect before end 2029) is **low to moderate**. While political momentum and advocacy are growing, the lack of concrete legislative action as of 2019 makes near-term mandatory requirements unlikely before 2030.
