## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- On May 7, 2025, Benin closed land border crossings with Nigeria’s Kwara state, particularly between Taberu (Nigeria) and Tanu (Benin), citing security concerns—specifically, arms smuggling and the emergence of a new militant group, “Mahmuda”[1][4].
- The closures also aimed to curb the export of agricultural products such as soya beans, cashew nuts, and maize through unofficial routes[1][4].
- Previous border closures in the region, particularly those motivated by security or smuggling concerns, have tended to persist for months unless resolved by significant security or diplomatic breakthroughs[2][5].

## Recent Announcements and Policy Developments

- As of May 31, 2025, no official statements from the Beninese or Nigerian governments have indicated an imminent reopening of the closed Kwara border crossings[1][4].
- Local customs sources reiterate that the affected routes are considered “illegal,” but this status does not guarantee a swift reopening, especially as the primary motivation remains unresolved security threats[1].
- Calls for regional border reopening (such as the Benin–Niger border) have occurred in other contexts, often requiring multilateral negotiation and security guarantees, which are absent in this case[2][5].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Credible updates on border status can be monitored through official Beninese and Nigerian government communications, reputable Nigerian news outlets, and regional security briefings[1][4].
- International organizations such as ECOWAS have played mediating roles in the past, but there is no evidence of such involvement in this specific closure as of late May 2025.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- The main uncertainty is the evolving security situation related to the “Mahmuda” group and arms trafficking. Rapid improvement could accelerate reopening, but no such developments have been reported.
- The closure’s focus on unofficial crossings complicates monitoring and measurement, increasing the risk of partial or de facto reopening without formal announcement[1].
- Absence of clear government timelines or criteria for reopening increases forecast uncertainty.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the persistence of similar security-related closures in the region, the absence of any official reopening signals, and the short time remaining until July 1, 2025, the probability that Benin reopens its closed land border crossings with Nigeria’s Kwara state before that date is **low**. A reasonable probabilistic estimate would be **less than 20%** barring an unforeseen political or security breakthrough.
