## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- In early 2024, the Central Mediterranean route saw a sharp decline in irregular migration, with only about 4,300 detections in January and February combinedâ€”roughly 2,150 per month[5].
- The Western African route became the busiest, with about 12,100 arrivals in the first two months of 2024, or about 6,050 per month[5].
- The Eastern Mediterranean route also saw a surge, with over 9,150 detections in January and February 2024, averaging about 4,575 per month[5].
- Overall, irregular border crossings into the EU were down 39% in the first eight months of 2024 compared to 2023, with the largest drops on the Central Mediterranean and Western Balkans routes, but increases on the Eastern Mediterranean and Atlantic routes[2].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- The EU has enacted stricter migration controls, including the New European Migration Pact, which imposes tighter screening and limits on asylum seekers from the Middle East and Africa[4].
- Increased border enforcement and cooperation with transit countries (notably in North Africa) are expected to continue suppressing arrivals or shifting flows to less monitored routes[4].
- Far-right political trends in Europe have contributed to a more restrictive migration environment[4].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The Mediterranean Refugees/Migrants Data Portal (UNHCR) is the definitive source for monthly arrival figures and will provide the final number for February 2025.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- Projections are based on early 2024 data and current policy context; actual arrivals may vary due to weather, enforcement, or sudden geopolitical changes.
- February is typically a lower month for arrivals due to winter sea conditions, which may further reduce numbers.
- The data may not capture all irregular arrivals, especially if routes shift or new enforcement measures are introduced.

## Forecast

Based on recent trends and policy context, the most likely range for Mediterranean migrant and refugee arrivals in Europe in February 2025 is:

**10,001-15,000**
