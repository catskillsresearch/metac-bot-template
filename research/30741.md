### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of April 2024, the national average price of regular gasoline in the US was $3.62 per gallon, $0.02 higher than the same time in 2023[3].
- Over the past two years, average prices have decreased by about 15% from their 2022 peak of $4.27 per gallon, but remain well above $3.020[3].
- GasBuddy projected the 2024 yearly national average to be $3.38 per gallon, indicating that prices are expected to remain above $3.020 throughout the year[2].

### Recent Announcements and Policies

- The EIA's January 2024 outlook anticipated a decrease in average retail gasoline prices in 2024 due to increased refinery capacity and inventories, but did not forecast a drop below $3.020[1].
- No significant new policies or market disruptions have been reported that would drive prices sharply lower before December 2024.

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The US Energy Information Administration (EIA) provides weekly data on national average gasoline prices, which will be the resolution source for this question.
- GasBuddy and Bankrate offer additional analysis and projections based on EIA data and market trends[2][3].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- Gasoline prices are subject to volatility from crude oil price changes, supply chain disruptions, and geopolitical events.
- Forecasts are based on current trends and known factors; unexpected events could alter the outlook.
- The EIA's weekly survey methodology is consistent and reliable, but always subject to minor revisions.

### Conclusion

Based on all available data and authoritative forecasts as of December 4, 2024, there is no evidence to suggest that the US national average retail price of regular gasoline will fall below $3.020 for the week of December 9, 2024. The most recent prices and projections are significantly higher than this threshold.
