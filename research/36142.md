### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The S&P 500 experienced a sharp 9.3% decline from $6,144.15 on February 19, 2025, to $5,572.07 on March 11, 2025—the largest drop since 2023[1].
- As of late February 2025, the US stock market was trading at about a 1% discount to fair value, marking a shift from previous overvaluation[2].
- Value stocks have significantly outperformed growth stocks year-to-date, with the Morningstar US Value Index up 5.54% and the Growth Index down 3.81% through early March 2025[2].

### Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Metric

- Market volatility has been driven by President Trump’s shifting tariff policies, a crackdown on immigration, and public sector cuts, fueling fears of higher inflation and slower GDP growth[3].
- Tariffs are described as a "wild card" for 2025, with the potential to disrupt earnings and sentiment further[2].
- Despite these risks, major Wall Street banks (Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan) maintain bullish year-end S&P 500 targets of 6,500, suggesting expectations of a rebound from current levels[3][4].
- Goldman Sachs recently lowered its S&P 500 earnings forecast for 2025 to $262 per share (from $268), still projecting 7% annual growth[1].

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Yahoo Finance will provide the official closing price for resolution, with $5,832.84 as the recovery threshold[3].
- Major financial institutions (Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan, Morningstar) provide consensus forecasts and valuation analysis[1][2][3][4].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- The S&P 500’s recovery is subject to ongoing policy uncertainty, especially regarding tariffs and fiscal policy, which could trigger further volatility[2][3].
- High current valuations mean the market is more sensitive to negative shocks[3].
- Only the closing price (not intraday highs) on or before April 7, 2025, as reported by Yahoo Finance, will determine resolution.
- Forecasts are inherently uncertain, especially given the unpredictable nature of policy and macroeconomic developments.
