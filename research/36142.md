### Key Factual Information for Forecasting S&P 500 Recovery by April 7, 2025

**1. Historical Trends and Current Status**
- The S&P 500 fell 9.3% from $6,144.15 (Feb 19, 2025) to $5,572.07 (Mar 11, 2025), marking its steepest decline since 2023[1][2].
- As of late February 2025, the market was trading at a 1% discount to fair value, a rare occurrence in recent years[2].
- Value stocks have outperformed growth stocks year-to-date, with the Morningstar US Value Index up 5.54% and the Growth Index down 3.81% through early March[2].

**2. Recent Announcements and Policies**
- Market volatility has been exacerbated by former President Trump’s fluctuating tariff policies, immigration crackdowns, and public sector cuts, which have led to concerns about rising inflation and slowing GDP growth[2].
- These policy uncertainties have contributed to the recent market downturn and heightened investor caution.

**3. Authoritative Forecasts**
- Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan both project the S&P 500 to reach 6,500 by the end of 2025, implying an 8% gain from the 6,000 level and suggesting expectations of a rebound[3][4].
- Earnings per share (EPS) forecasts for 2025 have been slightly lowered but still indicate 7% growth, with consensus EPS around $262–$270[1][3][4].
- Despite the recent drop, the long-term outlook from major institutions remains positive, though these forecasts are for year-end, not specifically for early April.

**4. Limitations and Uncertainties**
- The S&P 500’s recovery is subject to ongoing risks, including high valuations, potential for further tariffs, rising bond yields, and macroeconomic shocks[2][3].
- The market’s ability to recover half its drop by April 7, 2025, depends on how quickly investor confidence returns and whether policy risks subside.
- Measurement is based strictly on the S&P 500’s closing price as reported by Yahoo Finance; intraday highs do not count.

**5. Verification Sources**
- S&P 500 historical closing prices can be verified on Yahoo Finance.
- Major financial outlooks and policy analysis are available from Morningstar, Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan, and the Financial Times[1][2][3][4].
