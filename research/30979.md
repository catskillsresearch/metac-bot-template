## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of April 2024, Michael Jordan's net worth was reported at $3.2 billion by multiple sources, including Forbes and HoopsHype[1][5].
- Jordan's wealth saw a significant increase in 2023 due to the sale of his majority stake in the Charlotte Hornets, which was valued at $3 billion[4].
- By December 11, 2024, Forbes listed Michael Jordan's net worth at $3.5 billion, while Howard Schultz's net worth was $3.4 billion, according to the question's description.

## Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Metric

- No major negative financial events or controversies affecting Michael Jordan's net worth were reported in 2024.
- Jordan's diversified portfolio—including ongoing royalties from Nike's Jordan Brand, investments in sports teams (such as 23XI Racing), and other business ventures—continues to provide stability and growth[4][5].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The Forbes Real-Time Billionaires List is the official resolution source for this question and is regularly updated to reflect changes in billionaire net worths based on public information and market movements.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- Net worth estimates for both individuals are subject to fluctuations in the value of their investments, especially if they hold significant stock in public or private companies.
- The Forbes Real-Time Billionaires List may update net worths in response to market changes, but private asset valuations (such as private company stakes or real estate) may not be updated as frequently or transparently.
- The margin between Jordan and Schultz's net worths is relatively small ($100 million), so minor market movements or new information could affect their rankings by December 31, 2024.
- If their net worths are tied on the resolution date, the question resolves as "No" per the fine print.

## Summary

As of December 11, 2024, Michael Jordan's net worth ($3.5 billion) exceeds that of Howard Schultz ($3.4 billion) according to Forbes. Barring significant, unreported changes in their financial situations or market volatility, Jordan is likely to maintain a higher net worth through December 31, 2024. However, the small margin and inherent uncertainties in net worth estimation mean that a reversal or tie remains possible until the resolution date.
