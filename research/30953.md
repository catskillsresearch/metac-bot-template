**Key Factors for December 20, 2024 Forecast**  

### 1. Operational Baseline  
Grouse Mountain opened for the 2024/25 season on November 23, 2024, with two chairlifts (Peak and Greenway) and four runs[4]. As of December 1, no additional terrain had opened, and staff indicated further expansions would require significant snowfall[2].  

### 2. Snowfall Trends  
The snowiest week historically occurs around December 15–21, averaging 16.5 inches[3]. However, early December 2024 saw minimal accumulation, delaying terrain expansions[2].  

### 3. Reporting Methodology  
On the Snow’s reports reflect resort-provided data, which typically classifies the resort as “Open” even with limited operations[5]. Unless explicitly closed, Grouse Mountain is likely to retain an “Open” status on the platform.  

### 4. Limitations  
- **Partial Operations**: Limited lifts/runs may not align with user expectations of “Open” status[5].  
- **Snow Reliance**: Unseasonably warm weather or rain could reduce operational capacity[3].  

**Conclusion**: Barring unforeseen closures, Grouse Mountain will likely be listed as “Open” on December 20, 2024, due to its baseline operational status, though terrain availability may remain limited[2][4][5].
