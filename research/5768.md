Based on the information available as of January 13, 2021, forecasting whether senior executives of major public companies will be imprisoned for corporate crimes before 2026 requires examining historical patterns and ongoing cases.

## Historical Context and Trends

The corporate criminal accountability landscape has shown mixed patterns. While the Jeffrey Skilling case from the Enron scandal resulted in a significant 12-year prison sentence, there has been a notable scarcity of high-profile convictions since then. The 2007-2008 financial crisis, despite its magnitude, did not result in significant imprisonments of senior banking executives.

When prosecutions do occur, they have often targeted lower-level employees rather than C-suite executives. The case of Tom Hayes in the LIBOR fixing scandal demonstrates this pattern, where he faced imprisonment while senior leadership largely avoided severe legal consequences.

## Ongoing Cases as of January 2021

As of January 2021, there were several notable ongoing cases that could potentially result in executive imprisonment:

- Volkswagen emissions scandal: The former VW CEO was facing fraud charges related to the emissions scandal. If convicted and sentenced to prison before 2026, this would satisfy the resolution criteria.

- Wirecard executives: There were outstanding warrants for Wirecard executives following the company's collapse and accounting fraud revelations in 2020.

These ongoing cases represent potential pathways to executive imprisonment within the timeframe specified.

## Factors Affecting Likelihood

Several factors affect the likelihood of senior executive imprisonment:

- **Prosecutorial approach**: Government agencies have historically shown varying levels of aggressiveness in pursuing corporate criminal cases.

- **Complexity of cases**: Corporate fraud cases are typically complex and resource-intensive to investigate and prosecute, often taking many years to reach conclusion.

- **Regulatory environment**: Changes in political administration can shift enforcement priorities.

- **Evidentiary challenges**: Proving criminal intent at the executive level presents significant challenges.

## Limitations in Forecasting

This forecast faces several limitations:

- Historical data shows relatively few precedents of senior executive imprisonment.
- The timeframe (5 years) is relatively short for complex corporate criminal cases to proceed from investigation to imprisonment.
- The resolution criteria specifically exclude certain types of crimes like insider trading, narrowing the qualifying scenarios.

Given the historical patterns, ongoing cases, and the specific resolution criteria, there appears to be a meaningful but not high probability that at least one senior executive from a major public company will be imprisoned for corporate crimes before 2026.
