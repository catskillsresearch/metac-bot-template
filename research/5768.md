### 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Since the high-profile convictions of the early 2000s (e.g., Jeffrey Skilling, Joseph Nacchio, Richard Scrushy), it has become increasingly rare for senior executives of major public companies to face imprisonment for corporate crimes[2][4]. The 2008 financial crisis, the LIBOR scandal, and various other corporate malfeasances led to few, if any, convictions of senior executives; punishment, when it occurred, often targeted lower-level employees (e.g., Tom Hayes in the LIBOR case)[2].
- As of January 2021, despite ongoing public and political pressure, most enforcement actions against senior executives in large, listed firms resulted in civil penalties, fines, or settlements rather than criminal convictions and prison sentences.

### 2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- By early 2021, several high-profile cases were progressing: 
    - Wirecard executives had outstanding warrants, and the former VW CEO was facing fraud charges in court related to the emissions scandal. The imprisonment of any such executive would meet the question’s resolution criteria.
    - However, no new regulatory or prosecutorial policy shift—such as legislative reforms or a commitment to more aggressive executive prosecutions—had been announced or implemented by January 2021 that would markedly change the historical pattern of rare executive imprisonment.

### 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Historical conviction data: CEO Today Magazine, DigitalDefynd (for lists of executives imprisoned for corporate crimes)[2][4].
- Ongoing criminal cases and indictments: Department of Justice press releases, major financial news outlets.
- Public records of company executives and index membership: Official stock exchange filings.

### 4. Limitations or Uncertainties in Measurement

- The outcome and timing of complex international legal cases (e.g., VW, Wirecard) are highly uncertain and often subject to lengthy appeals and extradition issues.
- Changes in political climate or prosecutorial priorities after January 2021 could not be fully anticipated in this forecast.
- Some convictions may occur outside the US or Europe, complicating verification and comparison due to legal system differences.

### Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

- **Reference Case:** Between 2006 and 2020, there were exceedingly few instances where senior executives of major public companies listed on major indices were imprisoned for crimes committed in their corporate capacity.
- **Key Differences:** As of early 2021, there were several "live" cases with senior executives facing credible criminal charges (notably VW and Wirecard), representing a higher-than-usual baseline risk compared to most years post-2008.
- **Assessment:** Given the historical rarity of such convictions but acknowledging the existence of ongoing cases with a real possibility of imprisonment, the probability that at least one senior executive of a qualifying company would be imprisoned for corporate crimes between January 1, 2021 and January 1, 2026 is **moderate but not high**—reasonable estimates would place it in the **20-40%** range.

> The most likely scenario, absent major policy shifts, is that most executives will continue to avoid criminal liability, but the outcome of pending cases introduces significant uncertainty.
