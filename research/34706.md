# Forecasting US State Department Arms Sales Approvals for March 2025

To forecast the number of arms sales the US State Department might approve in March 2025, I'll analyze historical patterns, recent trends, and current policy developments that could influence this metric.

## Historical Trends and Current Status

Looking at the historical data provided, several patterns emerge regarding US State Department arms sales approvals:

1. **March-specific patterns**: In recent years, March has shown varying approval numbers:
   - March 2020: 4 approvals
   - March 2021: 6 approvals
   - March 2022: 4 approvals
   - March 2023: 10 approvals
   - March 2024: 10 approvals

   This indicates a notable increase in March approvals in 2023-2024 compared to previous years, with the most recent two March periods both showing 10 approvals.

2. **Recent monthly trends**: The last few months of 2024 showed:
   - October 2024: 9 approvals
   - November 2024: 10 approvals
   - December 2024: 15 approvals

   This suggests a potential upward trend in approvals toward the end of 2024.

3. **Annual patterns**: The data shows some variability throughout each year, with certain months consistently showing higher approval rates. December tends to have higher numbers (17 in 2023, 15 in 2024), possibly due to fiscal year-end considerations.

4. **Overall volume**: Between March 2020 and June 2023, the Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) processed 26,422 license applications and approved 24,741 of them, representing a 93.6% approval rate with a total value of $34.7 billion[2]. This demonstrates the significant volume of arms sales being processed, though many of these may fall below Congressional notification thresholds.

## Recent Developments Affecting Arms Sales

Several recent developments could influence the March 2025 approval numbers:

1. **Recent major sales**: On February 8, 2025, the State Department formally notified Congress of plans to sell more than $7 billion in weapons to Israel, including thousands of bombs and missiles[4]. This indicates ongoing significant arms sales activity in early 2025.

2. **Regulatory changes**: On January 17, 2025, the Department of State published an interim final rule in the Federal Register with a 240-day delayed effective date[3]. While the specific content isn't detailed in the search results, regulatory changes could potentially impact the approval process or volume.

3. **FY 2025 budget considerations**: The FY 2025 budget request maintains programs for various missile systems and other weapons[5], suggesting continued support for defense sales as part of broader security cooperation efforts.

4. **Foreign Military Sales process**: The FMS sales process begins when a country submits a formal Letter of Request (LOR), ideally including both a desired military capability and rough specifications[1]. The timing of these requests and their processing could influence March 2025 numbers.

## Forecast Considerations

Based on the available data and recent trends, several factors suggest March 2025 approvals will likely fall in the 6-10 range:

1. The most recent two March periods (2023 and 2024) both had 10 approvals, establishing a recent pattern.

2. The overall trend in late 2024 showed robust approval numbers (9-15 per month).

3. The recent major arms sale to Israel announced in February 2025 indicates continued active arms sales diplomacy.

4. Historical data shows March typically has moderate to high approval numbers compared to other months.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors create uncertainty in this forecast:

1. **Political transitions**: Changes in administration priorities could affect arms sales approval rates.

2. **Global conflicts**: Emerging or resolving conflicts could significantly impact arms sales approvals.

3. **Congressional oversight**: While the question focuses on State Department approvals regardless of Congressional action, increased scrutiny could slow the initial approval process.

4. **Data limitations**: The search results provide limited information about early 2025 trends or specific policy changes that might affect March 2025 approvals.

5. **Under-threshold sales**: Many arms sales fall below Congressional notification thresholds and aren't captured in the major arms sales statistics[2], creating a partial picture of overall arms transfer activity.

Given the historical patterns and recent developments, March 2025 approvals will most likely fall in the 6-10 range, continuing the pattern established in 2023-2024, though specific geopolitical developments in early 2025 could shift this forecast.
