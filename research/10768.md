## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The Kuril Islands have been under Russian (formerly Soviet) control since the end of World War II. Russia considers its sovereignty over the islands legitimate, based on the postwar settlement, and the Russian constitution (amended in 2020) now explicitly prohibits ceding any territory[1][5].
- Japan has consistently claimed the four southernmost islands (Iturup, Kunashir, Shikotan, Habomai) as its own “Northern Territories,” but has never exercised de facto control since 1945[1][5].
- There has never been a peaceful transfer of these islands, nor any major territorial change between Russia and Japan since WWII[1].

## 2. Recent Announcements and Policies

- In March 2022, Russia formally withdrew from peace treaty negotiations with Japan and froze all joint economic projects in the disputed islands, citing Japan’s position on the Ukraine war and its alliance with the US[1][4].
- Russia conducted large-scale military drills on the Kuril Islands in March 2022, demonstrating its military presence and resolve[1].
- In April 2025, Russia imposed new restrictions on foreign navigation around the southern Kuril Islands, further asserting its control and limiting outside influence[3].
- Russian officials, including Dmitry Medvedev and President Putin, have publicly stated that the territorial issue is closed and not open for negotiation, pointing to constitutional changes that prohibit any cession of territory[1].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- International coverage and analysis from sources such as Wikipedia, The Moscow Times, TASS, and Harvard International Review provide consistent details on the current situation and the hardening of Russian control[1][2][3][4].
- Research reports on the dispute underline the intractability of the conflict and the lack of effective international mechanisms to force a resolution against Russia’s will[5].

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- While Russia’s global position has weakened since the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, there is no evidence that this has directly affected its hold on the Kuril Islands or created meaningful leverage for Japan[2][5].
- The only plausible pathway for a shift in control would be a major geopolitical upheaval within Russia or a broader regional conflict, both of which are highly unlikely and without precedent.
- Measurement of control is straightforward, as Russia maintains both military and administrative presence on all four island groups[5].

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the combination of entrenched Russian control, explicit legal prohibitions on territorial cession, ongoing military activities, and lack of plausible diplomatic or military avenues for change, the probability that Russia will lose control of at least three of the four main Kuril Island groups before January 1, 2028, is exceedingly low—estimated at less than 1% barring unforeseen major upheaval.
