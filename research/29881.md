# Will there be a large-scale armed conflict in Russia before January 1, 2025?

Based on information available as of November 11, 2024, there are several factors to consider when assessing the likelihood of a large-scale armed conflict within Russia before January 1, 2025.

## Current Status and Key Trends

The most significant development affecting Russian territory is the Ukrainian incursion into Russia's Kursk region that began in early August 2024. After two weeks of this operation, Ukrainian officials claimed to control more than 1,200 sq km of Russian territory and 93 villages[4]. As of mid-October 2024, this incursion was entering its third month with "scores of settlements still firmly under [Ukrainian] control"[4].

In response to this incursion, the Russian government:
- Declared a state of emergency in the Kursk and Belgorod regions[4]
- Evacuated almost 200,000 people from areas along the border[4]
- Deployed an estimated 40,000 troops to defend and counterattack in the region, though these forces appear to be largely conscripts and reservists[4]

It's important to note that while this represents fighting on Russian soil, it does not constitute an internal Russian conflict as defined in the question criteria, as it involves Ukrainian military forces rather than Russian citizens fighting each other.

## Recent Developments

As of November 2024, Russian forces have intensified their efforts to dislodge Ukrainian forces from Kursk Oblast and have had some success in removing Ukrainian forces from the nearby Glushkovsky region[4]. More recently, Ukrainian forces have advanced north of Sudzha[5].

On November 11, 2024, US President-elect Donald Trump spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin and urged him not to escalate the war in Ukraine[3]. This diplomatic engagement could potentially influence Russia's military strategy in the coming weeks.

## Internal Stability Indicators

Several factors might provide insights into Russia's internal stability:

1. **Public Response**: Reports indicate that after Russia's initial shock at the Ukrainian incursion, the Russian public is becoming "normalised" to the situation[4]. The Kremlin and Russian authorities have sought to downplay the significance of the offensive[4].

2. **Military Deployment Decisions**: Russian commanders appear reluctant to redeploy forces from the Ukrainian frontlines to address the Kursk incursion[4], suggesting they continue to prioritize the war in Ukraine over defending Russian territory.

3. **Digital Control Measures**: The Russian federal censor Roskomnadzor failed to enforce its plan to deanonymize Russian social media accounts by its November 1, 2024 deadline[5], which could be interpreted as a setback in the government's efforts to control information flow.

## Assessment Limitations

The available information has several limitations for forecasting an internal armed conflict:

1. There is no direct evidence in the available sources of organized armed opposition to the Russian government by Russian citizens.

2. The search results do not contain information about significant anti-government protests, coup attempts, or separatist movements within Russia that might escalate into armed conflict.

3. While the Ukrainian incursion represents a military challenge for Russia, it does not itself constitute the type of internal conflict specified in the question criteria.

4. The search results provide limited information about internal Russian politics, economic conditions, or military morale that might indicate growing instability.

Based on the available information as of November 11, 2024, there is insufficient evidence to suggest that a large-scale armed conflict involving Russian citizens fighting each other and resulting in at least 1,000 deaths will occur before January 1, 2025. However, the ongoing Ukrainian incursion into Russian territory represents an unusual situation that could potentially have unpredictable consequences for Russian internal stability.
