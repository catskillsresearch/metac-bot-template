**Key Historical Trends and Current Status**  
- The US and Russia, successors to the Cold War superpowers, have maintained adversarial relations for decades, punctuated by crises such as the Cuban Missile Crisis, proxy wars, and, more recently, disagreements over NATO expansion and regional conflicts in Ukraine and Georgia. Despite periods of acute tension, there has been no direct large-scale US-Russia war since World War II[4][5].
- Both countries possess the world’s largest nuclear arsenals, accounting for roughly 88% of global stockpiles as of 2025, reinforcing a state of mutual deterrence[2]. This has historically acted as a strong brake on direct military confrontation[1][4].

**Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric**  
- As of June 2021, the extension of the New START treaty demonstrated some willingness for arms control cooperation, but broader relations remained adversarial[1].
- Russia’s aggression toward Ukraine, interference in Western institutions, and US sanctions have maintained high tension, but neither side indicated intent for direct war[5].
- Expert assessments and public statements by policymakers in early 2020s generally rated the risk of direct military conflict as low but nonzero, emphasizing the unpredictability of crisis escalation[3][5].

**Probabilistic Assessment (as of 2021-06-25)**  
- Expert elicitation studies estimated the annual probability of a nuclear war (the most likely avenue for direct US-Russia conflict causing 1,000+ battle deaths) at about 0.24–0.38% per year, with a 4.7% chance over 20 years (from a 2015 survey), though these figures come with significant uncertainty[4].
- The cumulative risk by 2050, while still low, is nontrivial. Over a 29-year period (2021–2050), even a small annual probability can accumulate to a 6–10% chance, depending on assumptions about risk consistency and escalation[4][5].

**Key Differences Affecting the Forecast**  
- The post-Cold War era lacks the formalized ideological standoff but features more ambiguous, gray-zone conflict (cyber, information operations).
- Ongoing, but fragile, arms control agreements (e.g., New START) contrast with the more robust Cold War-era arms control architecture.
- Increased unpredictability in regional crises and leadership decision-making add uncertainty to long-range forecasts.

**Limitations and Uncertainties**  
- Forecasts rely on expert judgment, historical trends, and assumptions about rational actor behavior, which may not hold in all future scenarios.
- Measurement is complicated by the rarity of such events and the difficulty in modeling escalation pathways, especially those triggered by accidents or miscalculation[4][5].

**Authoritative Sources for Verification**  
- Uppsala Conflict Data Program for conflict definitions and battle death criteria.
- Major news outlets, government announcements, and multinational organizations (UN, NATO) for event verification.
