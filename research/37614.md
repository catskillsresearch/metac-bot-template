## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- John Morgan, a billionaire attorney and founder of one of the world’s largest injury law firms, has repeatedly flirted with entering Florida’s gubernatorial race, drawing significant media coverage and speculation[3][4][5].
- As of June 6, 2025, Morgan has not officially announced his candidacy for the 2026 Florida governor’s race, but he has been openly discussing the possibility and publicly laying out elements of what could become a campaign platform[1][4][5].
- Morgan is known for his influential role in Florida politics, notably as the architect and primary funder of successful ballot initiatives (e.g., raising the minimum wage, legalizing medical marijuana)[5].
- He is currently advancing efforts to form a new political party, positioning it as a centrist alternative to Florida’s current political landscape[2].

## 2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- On May 15, 2025, Morgan spoke at the Capitol Tiger Bay Club in Tallahassee, where he "laid out what could be a campaign blueprint" and delivered pointed criticisms of both parties and current state leadership[1][5].
- Morgan told reporters he is giving a run for governor "serious" consideration, but also indicated his decision process is ongoing: “Every day that you wake up, you lean differently. You see stuff”[4].
- Despite frequent teasing and media attention, Morgan has not made a definitive announcement or filed any official paperwork as of early June 2025[3][4][5].
- There is no record in authoritative news outlets of Morgan formally declaring his candidacy or launching an official campaign prior to June 6, 2025.

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Politico, Fox 35 Orlando, WUSF, and ABC Action News have all reported on Morgan’s recent statements and activities, consistently noting that while he is actively considering a run, he has not yet announced[1][2][3][4][5].

## 4. Key Differences and Factors Affecting the Forecast

- Unlike some prior candidates who moved quickly from speculation to formal announcement, Morgan is leveraging sustained media attention and has not committed to a timeline for a decision.
- He is exploring the formation of a new political party, a process that could require strategic groundwork before a formal candidacy announcement[2].
- Morgan’s public statements suggest a deliberative approach with no deadline cited, and he is known for being unpredictable and for keeping options open until the last moment[4].
- The 2026 election cycle is still relatively early, and high-profile self-funded candidates often delay announcements to maximize flexibility and publicity.

## 5. Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Based on current facts as of June 6, 2025, there is no evidence that John Morgan has announced his candidacy, and his recent statements indicate ongoing deliberation rather than imminent action. Given the historical behavior of similar candidates and Morgan’s own pattern of public deliberation, the probability that he will announce his candidacy before July 1, 2025 appears low. I assess the chance as below 20%, barring any unforeseen developments.

## 6. Limitations and Uncertainties

- Morgan could make a surprise announcement at any time, as wealthy, high-profile individuals sometimes do.
- There may be private deliberations or groundwork not yet reported.
- Media coverage relies on public statements and filings; sudden developments could occur between now and July 1, 2025.
