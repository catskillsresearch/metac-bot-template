# Forecasting the Closure of Dearborn Sausage Company Recall

Based on the information available as of November 18, 2024, I'll analyze the factors relevant to forecasting whether the USDA-posted recall affecting Dearborn Sausage Company will be closed before December 1, 2024.

## Current Status and Details of the Recall

On September 12, 2024, Dearborn Sausage Company Inc., a Michigan establishment, initiated a recall of approximately 1,944 pounds of ready-to-eat (RTE) wiener products due to misbranding and undeclared allergens[3][4]. The specific issue involved:

- Labels of two products were inadvertently swapped
- Soy (a known allergen) was not declared on product labels
- Pork was not declared on certain product labels[3]

The problem was discovered when the company received a complaint from a retailer that products they received may have been incorrectly labeled[3]. Dearborn determined that they had inadvertently mislabeled beef wiener products as beef and pork wiener products and vice versa, resulting in undeclared allergens and ingredients[3].

As of the reporting date, there were no confirmed reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of these products[3].

## Factors Relevant to Recall Closure Timeline

Several factors may influence whether this recall will be closed before December 1, 2024:

1. **Recall Classification and Severity**: This appears to be a Class II recall (moderate health hazard situation) based on the undeclared allergen. Class II recalls typically resolve faster than Class I (serious health hazard) recalls.

2. **Volume and Distribution**: The recall affects a relatively limited amount of product (1,944 pounds), which may facilitate faster resolution compared to larger-scale recalls[3].

3. **Consumer Impact**: No adverse reactions had been reported as of the initial recall announcement, which is a positive factor that could expedite closure[3].

4. **Corrective Actions**: The search results don't specify what corrective actions Dearborn Sausage Company has implemented, but the company's response speed and effectiveness would impact closure timing.

## Limitations in Forecasting

The available information has several limitations for forecasting purposes:

1. The search results don't provide data on typical USDA recall closure timelines for similar misbranding/allergen cases.

2. There's no information about any follow-up actions taken by Dearborn Sausage Company since the initial recall announcement.

3. The search results don't indicate whether the FSIS has conducted follow-up inspections or verification activities, which would be necessary before closing the recall.

4. No updates on the recall status between September 12, 2024, and the knowledge cutoff date (November 18, 2024) are available in the search results.

## Comparable Recall Patterns

While the search results don't provide direct comparisons, we can note that other food recalls mentioned in the results include:

- A ShopRite Puffin Muffins recall due to undeclared allergens[2]
- A Jif Peanut Butter recall due to potential Salmonella contamination[2]
- A ground beef patties recall due to potential E. coli contamination[2]

However, these examples don't include resolution timelines that would help forecast the Dearborn Sausage Company recall closure.

## Conclusion

Based on the limited information available, it's difficult to make a confident forecast about whether the Dearborn Sausage Company recall will be closed before December 1, 2024. The relatively small volume of affected product (1,944 pounds) and the absence of reported adverse reactions are positive factors that could support earlier closure. However, without specific information about FSIS verification activities, company corrective actions, or typical timelines for similar recalls, significant uncertainty remains.

To make a more informed forecast, additional information about USDA-FSIS typical recall closure procedures and timelines for Class II recalls involving misbranding and undeclared allergens would be necessary.
