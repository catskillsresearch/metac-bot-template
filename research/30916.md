## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- US home prices rose steadily in the 2010s, accelerated during the pandemic, and saw modest appreciation in 2023 and 2024. In 2024, nominal growth was about 4–4.5%[5].
- By early 2025, the market exhibits softening demand and rising inventory, with supply now at or above pre-pandemic levels in many metros[1].
- Affordability challenges and increased rental options are keeping more would-be buyers on the sidelines[2][4].

## Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Metric

- Zillow’s May 2025 forecast predicts a 1.4% decline in national home values for the year, due to higher inventory and cautious buyers[4].
- Redfin forecasts a 1% year-over-year drop in median home-sale price by Q4 2025[3].
- Bankrate reports that industry consensus now expects price growth to slow to 2% or less in 2025, compared to 4.5% in 2024[5].
- J.P. Morgan’s February 2025 outlook describes a “largely frozen” market, with growth projections capped at about 3% and supply constraints less supportive than in past years[1].
- Zillow’s March 2025 update further lowered its 12-month price growth forecast to just +0.8%[2].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Zillow Home Value Index (ZHVI) provides monthly, inflation-adjusted data for reference and resolution.
- US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) CPI Inflation Calculator will be used for real price adjustments.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- Forecasts may change with macroeconomic shifts (e.g., interest rate moves, economic shocks).
- All cited projections use data available as of May 2025, but real-world events can rapidly alter sentiment and fundamentals.
- Real price changes depend on both nominal appreciation and inflation rates, which may deviate from expectations.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the strong consensus across major forecasters that nominal home price growth will be slower or negative in 2025 than in 2024—and with inflation likely to remain moderate—the probability that real US housing prices (ZHVI, inflation-adjusted) will increase more in 2025 than in 2024 is **very low**. Most credible projections point to slower or negative real appreciation in 2025 compared to the prior year[2][3][4][5].
