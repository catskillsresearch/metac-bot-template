# Forecasting the US Steel/Nippon Steel Merger Outcome

The proposed acquisition of US Steel by Nippon Steel Corporation represents a significant transaction in the steel industry with major political and economic implications. Below is an analysis of the available information that could help forecast whether this merger will collapse before January 1, 2025.

## Current Status and Timeline

Nippon Steel Corporation announced its intention to acquire US Steel for $14.9 billion ($55 per share) in an all-cash transaction on December 18, 2023[2]. This represents a 40% premium for US Steel shareholders and would make US Steel a wholly owned subsidiary of Nippon Steel while maintaining its name and Pittsburgh headquarters[2].

The deal has progressed through several key milestones:

- On April 12, 2024, US Steel held a Special Meeting of Stockholders where 71% of outstanding shares voted, with an overwhelming 99% approval for the proposed transaction[1]
- As of May 30, 2024, the companies had received all necessary non-US regulatory approvals[1]
- The transaction was initially expected to close in the second or third quarter of 2024[2], but as of May 2024, the companies revised their expectation to the second half of 2024, pending US regulatory approvals[1]

## Political Opposition and Regulatory Challenges

The merger faces significant political headwinds that substantially increase the risk of collapse:

- President Biden is expected to block US Steel's proposed $14.9 billion merger with Nippon Steel, citing national security concerns[4]
- The Biden administration's stance reflects growing bipartisan opposition and a preference for US Steel to remain under American control[4]
- Donald Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, has reiterated his opposition to the merger, declaring he would block the deal if elected[4]
- Vice President Kamala Harris has expressed her preference for US Steel to remain under American ownership[4]

## Regulatory Review Process

The deal is currently undergoing critical regulatory review:

- The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) is reviewing the deal, focusing on its implications for national security[4]
- The companies were allowed to refile their CFIUS application in September 2024, setting a new deadline in December 2024 for CFIUS to make a decision
- White House sources have suggested that President Biden is inclined to block the merger as part of broader efforts to protect critical industries from foreign control[4]

## Analysis of Completion Prospects

Several factors suggest the deal faces significant obstacles to completion before January 1, 2025:

1. **Executive Action**: The Biden administration has signaled intent to block the merger, which would directly satisfy one of the resolution criteria (presidential executive order)
2. **Regulatory Timeline**: The CFIUS review deadline in December 2024 leaves little time for deal completion before the January 1, 2025 resolution date
3. **Bipartisan Opposition**: The rare bipartisan opposition to the deal increases political pressure for intervention
4. **National Security Concerns**: The framing of steel production as a national security issue provides regulatory grounds for blocking the transaction

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors create uncertainty in forecasting this outcome:

1. The exact timing of any presidential action remains unclear
2. The companies could potentially negotiate remedies or concessions to address national security concerns
3. Political calculations may influence the timing of any decision, particularly given the proximity to the US presidential election
4. The companies have not publicly indicated any intention to abandon the deal despite the political opposition
