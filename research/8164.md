**Key Historical Trends and Current Status**
- US third parties rarely win Congressional or presidential seats due to institutional barriers like the first-past-the-post system and entrenched party loyalties. Notable exceptions (e.g., Bernie Sanders as an Independent) rely on unique local dynamics and personal political capital, not new party brands.
- The Forward Party, founded by Andrew Yang in October 2021, is a centrist, reform-oriented movement advocating for ranked-choice voting and electoral innovation as pathways to break the two-party blockade[3][5].
- As of early 2025, the Forward Party has not won any seats in Congress or the presidency. Its activities focus on advocacy, local party-building, and supporting reforms, but no Forward Party candidates have achieved federal electoral success to date[2][4].

**Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Metric**
- Andrew Yang continues to promote the Forward Party and electoral reforms at public events and through media appearances[4][5].
- The party is involved in local and state-level initiatives and alliances but has not announced any credible, high-profile Congressional campaigns or electoral victories as of April 2025[4].
- Some localities have adopted ranked-choice voting, which, if expanded, could marginally improve third-party prospects, but federal adoption remains unlikely by 2029.

**Authoritative Sources for Verification**
- Forward Party official website and press releases[1].
- Media interviews and event coverage with Andrew Yang and other party officials[2][4][5].
- Wikipedia and established political reporting archives for historical context[3].

**Limitations and Uncertainties**
- The landscape can shift rapidly, especially if a major political realignment or scandal were to occur.
- Local-level wins or alliances could precede a federal breakthrough, but there is no evidence yet of this occurring for the Forward Party.
- The party’s focus on systemic reform may pay dividends in the long term, but structural barriers remain formidable through at least early 2029.

**Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment**
Given the entrenched two-party system, lack of federal-level wins, and the slow pace of electoral reform, the probability that a member of the Forward Party will hold a seat in Congress or the presidency by February 1, 2029, is low—likely in the 1–5% range, barring unforeseen major political disruption.
