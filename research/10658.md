## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of December 31, 2021, the US operated 93 commercial nuclear reactors. Recent years have seen retirements: 6 reactors closed between 2018 and 2021. The EIA projected a net decrease to 92 reactors by the end of 2025, factoring in 2 new units and 3 retirements[1][3].
- US reactor construction has been slow; the only recent new builds (Vogtle 3 & 4) took over a decade each and came online around 2023–2024[5].
- Most of the US fleet is aging. Unless extended, many reactors face retirement between 2030 and 2040 as they reach the end of their operating licenses.

## 2. Recent Announcements and Policies

- In late 2024, the US government announced a plan to add 35 GW of new nuclear capacity by 2035, aiming to keep the country on track for net-zero emissions by 2050[1]. This goal would require a major acceleration in permitting, financing, and construction.
- The World Nuclear Association estimates 55 GW of new capacity would be required by 2035 just to sustain present fleet size if reactors retire after 60 years[3].
- Industry analysis by NREL and others identifies about 8.5 GW of announced nuclear projects for the US and Canada, with a moderate scenario assuming 3 GW of new US capacity deployed by 2035, suggesting that only a few new reactors are likely to be online by then under current trends[5].
- US policy signals—such as tax credits, carbon pricing, and regulatory reform—could encourage plant life extensions or new builds, but actual deployment remains uncertain.

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- US Energy Information Administration (EIA) Preliminary Monthly Electric Generator Inventory
- World Nuclear Association: Nuclear Power in the USA[3]
- Department of Energy announcements[1]
- National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) Annual Technology Baseline[5]

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- Many older plants’ license extensions are not guaranteed, and economic or political pressures may hasten retirements.
- Announced targets (e.g., 35 GW by 2035) are ambitious and depend on overcoming regulatory, supply chain, and financing barriers[1][5].
- Small modular reactors (SMRs) could accelerate deployment, but no SMRs are in commercial operation in the US as of 2025.
- Data may be revised after initial publication; official counts will use the first EIA report published for the reference date.

## Probabilistic Assessment

Assuming:
- The base fleet drops from 92 in 2025 to ~70–80 by 2035 due to age-based retirements if license extensions are not widely pursued.
- Realistic new build deployment rates (2–6 reactors, accounting for 3–9 GW, with SMR deployment ramping up late in the period).
- A moderate probability that policy and market incentives will slow retirements and spur some new construction, but not fully realize the most ambitious government targets.

**Adjusted forecast:**
- 70th percentile: 75 reactors (modest retirements, a handful of new builds)
- 50th percentile (median): 72 reactors
- 30th percentile: 68 reactors (higher retirements, few new builds)

**Most likely range:** 68–75 reactors in commercial operation in the US on December 31, 2035.
