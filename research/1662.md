## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- **Early optimism:** In the early 2010s, companies such as Planetary Resources and Deep Space Industries (DSI) were founded with the explicit goal of asteroid mining, attracting significant attention and some investment. These companies had plans for precursor missions (e.g., Prospector-X by DSI) to develop and test technologies for prospecting and, eventually, resource extraction[5].
  
- **Technical milestones:** While some precursor robotic missions were planned (e.g., DSI's Prospector-1, targeting a near-Earth asteroid rendezvous before 2020), none had demonstrated in-space mining or resource return by the end of 2018. Missions remained in the prospecting or technology demonstration phase rather than actual mining[5].

- **Business challenges:** By 2018, the largest asteroid mining startups (Planetary Resources and DSI) were acquired by non-mining entities, reflecting waning private or governmental appetite for the high risk and long timelines involved in asteroid mining. This marked a transition to "second-generation" companies, often with a more diversified or stepwise approach (e.g., prospecting satellites, in-space services) rather than direct mining[1].

- **International consensus:** Despite business setbacks, asteroid resource utilization remained a credible topic in academic, legal, and business circles. There was growing consensus that in-space resource utilization, including asteroid mining, is a legitimate long-term goal[1].

## 2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- **Legal frameworks:** The US Commercial Space Launch Competitiveness Act (2015) explicitly recognized the rights of private entities to own and sell resources extracted from asteroids. Luxembourg, in 2016–2017, established its own legal and financial incentives, investing over $200 million to attract space mining startups and becoming the first European country to guarantee rights over space resources[1].
  
- **Sector pivots:** Notably, the financial and technical hurdles led to a shift in focus for many companies by 2018, with more emphasis on prospecting, data commercialization, and incremental technology development, rather than immediate resource extraction[1].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- **Industry status reports:** Academic and industry surveys, as well as news from the companies themselves, serve as primary sources for verifying claims of commercial mining activity.
- **Legal registries:** National space agencies and legal databases provide records of legislative developments relevant to asteroid mining.

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- **Technical risk:** No mission as of 2018 had demonstrated in-space resource extraction or return on a commercial scale (≥100 kg) from an asteroid or comet.
- **Financial and regulatory risk:** The acquisition or pivot of early mining companies indicates significant hurdles in business sustainability and technology readiness[1].
- **Measurement ambiguity:** The "commercial purpose" requirement and the 100 kg threshold set a high bar; precursor or demonstration missions with smaller sample returns, or purely scientific missions, would not meet the resolution criteria.
- **Timeline uncertainty:** While legal frameworks and academic interest support the field, the slow pace of technical progress and high capital requirements make a commercial success before 2030 uncertain.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

- **Compared to initial optimism in the early 2010s, the probability as of December 2018 that ≥100 kg of asteroid/comet material would be mined for commercial purposes and returned to commercial control before 2030 should be assessed as low.**
- **Key differences:** Early ventures overestimated the readiness of technology and underestimated financial, regulatory, and logistical hurdles. The sector shifted from bold near-term promises to incremental, stepwise progress, with leading companies acquired or repurposed[1].
- **Assessment:** Given the absence of operational mining missions as of 2018, the acquisition of leading companies, and the pivot in business models, the adjusted probability (as of December 2018) that this milestone would be achieved before 2030 is **well below 50%**, with a plausible range in the single digits to low double digits percentage, unless there is a breakthrough in launch costs, robotic autonomy, or a surge in public/private investment.
