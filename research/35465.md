# Will Ukraine Announce a Presidential Election Before April 1, 2025?

Based on the available information as of February 27, 2025, it appears highly unlikely that Ukraine will announce a presidential election before April 1, 2025. The evidence strongly suggests that no such announcement will occur within this timeframe.

## Current Status and Legal Framework

Ukraine is currently operating under martial law due to the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian War that began with Russia's invasion in 2022. Under the Ukrainian Constitution, elections cannot be held during martial law[4]. Specifically, Article 19 of the Ukrainian constitution explicitly bans presidential, parliamentary, and local elections during this period[4].

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's original term expired in May 2024, but he remains in office due to these constitutional provisions regarding martial law[2]. The Ukrainian parliament has officially affirmed the legitimacy of Zelenskyy's continued presidency despite the expiration of his term[2].

## Recent Developments

The most significant recent development occurred on February 26, 2025, when Ukraine's parliament (Verkhovna Rada) passed a resolution that:

1. Reaffirmed that elections should not be held during martial law
2. Pledged to hold a presidential election only upon the conclusion of the Russo-Ukrainian War[4]

This parliamentary resolution came after a previous failed vote on a similar measure, with the successful vote occurring when enough MPs were present[2]. The resolution explicitly states that "no elections can be held until the lifting of martial law after the coming of a just and lasting peace"[2].

## Official Position

President Zelenskyy has consistently maintained that elections will only be announced after the war situation changes. He has repeatedly stated: "The hot phase of the war will end, and when martial law is lifted, elections will be announced"[1]. This position has remained unchanged despite increasing questions about elections as his original term has expired.

The parliamentary resolution passed on February 26, 2025, represents a clear rebuff to suggestions from international figures, including U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, who had questioned Zelenskyy's legitimacy due to the lack of elections[2].

## International Context

There have been some international pressures to hold elections. In early February 2025, U.S. special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, Keith Kellogg, suggested that the USA wanted Ukraine to hold elections, potentially before the end of 2025, especially if Kyiv could agree to a truce with Moscow[1]. Kellogg stated that elections are "good for democracy"[1].

However, Ukraine has officially rejected these suggestions through its parliamentary resolution, citing practical impossibilities of holding credible elections during wartime[2].

## Practical Challenges

Most Ukrainians, including major opposition parties, agree that holding credible elections during the war is not feasible for several reasons:

1. Millions of Ukrainians are abroad as refugees
2. Hundreds of thousands are actively fighting in the war
3. An election could provide Russia with an opportunity to sow division while Ukraine is defending itself[2]

## Conclusion

Given the recent parliamentary resolution on February 26, 2025, the constitutional prohibition on elections during martial law, the ongoing war with Russia, and the consistent position of both President Zelenskyy and the Ukrainian parliament, it is highly unlikely that Ukraine will announce a presidential election before April 1, 2025. The official position remains that elections will only be announced after martial law is lifted, which is contingent on the end of the "hot phase" of the war with Russia.
