## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of late 2023 through mid-2025, the global AI regulatory landscape is fragmented. No international agency with binding enforcement powers and on-site monitoring for transformative AI has been established[1][4][5].
- The EU AI Act became law in August 2024, introducing comprehensive regulations within the EU. It mandates risk assessments and penalties but is strictly regional and not an international treaty-based organization[5].
- The UN convened a High-Level Advisory Body on AI (HLAB-AI) in October 2023. Its 2024 report recommended steps toward better governance (dialogues, standards exchanges, scientific panels, and a dedicated AI office), but these are advisory and lack enforcement or inspection authority[1].
- The HLAB-AI report explicitly notes that a robust institution with monitoring and enforcement powers may become necessary if risks escalate, but no such institution has been set up as of May 2025[1].

## 2. Recent Announcements/Policies

- The EU AI Act is the most advanced example of legislative progress, with phased implementation running through 2027[5].
- The US, China, and other major AI powers continue to develop their own national or regional frameworks, with no clear movement toward a binding, multinational AI agency[2][3][4].
- The UN's current approach is fragmented, relying on voluntary cooperation, and has not produced a treaty or institution with the scope and mandate required by the resolution criteria[1].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Oxford Academic's analysis of the HLAB-AI and UN initiatives[1]
- Mind Foundry's overview of the EU AI Act and global regulatory approaches[5]
- CentralEyes and White & Case LLP's global regulatory trackers and summaries[2][4]

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- Progress toward international AI regulation is dynamic and could accelerate in response to future events (e.g., a major AI-related incident).
- Political resistance to intrusive inspections and national sovereignty concerns remain significant barriers.
- The definition of "transformative AI" and the threshold for monitoring are still under debate, complicating treaty negotiations.

## Probabilistic Assessment (as of May 2025)

Given the above, the probability that at least 20 countries will, before 2030, accept the statutes of an actively operating international organization with on-site monitoring and regulatory powers over transformative AI projects is low. Recent trends show incremental progress toward international governance, but not at the scale or binding level required by the resolution criteria. A reasonable, evidence-based estimate would place the probability at **15-25%** barring a major catalyzing event to spur international action.
