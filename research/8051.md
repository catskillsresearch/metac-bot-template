## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Since 1949, the US and China have avoided direct armed conflict resulting in significant fatalities, despite repeated crises over Taiwan, the South China Sea, and economic disputes[3][4][5].
- Military competition and tension have increased since the late 2010s, with frequent military exercises, close encounters, and explicit planning for potential conflict[1][3][4].
- The risk of a major incident or escalation has grown, especially in maritime and airspace near Taiwan and the South China Sea[1][3].

## 2. Recent Announcements and Policies

- In 2024–2025, the US deployed the Typhon missile system to the Philippines, capable of striking deep into Chinese territory—marking a major strategic escalation[2].
- The US Air Force and Pentagon have engaged in open planning for potential war with China, especially in the 2025–2032 window[4].
- Economic and technological decoupling, particularly in semiconductors, has further strained relations and increased the risks of miscalculation[5].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Credible news outlets (e.g., Wall Street Journal, Crisis Group) and government sources regularly report on military deployments and strategic postures[1][2][3].
- Academic and military journals, such as Air University’s Journal of the Americas, provide detailed analysis of war planning and military capabilities[4].

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- Forecasts are highly sensitive to unpredictable leadership decisions, crisis management, and domestic politics.
- The "100 deaths" threshold could be reached by a single incident or accumulated over several smaller clashes—making the scenario plausible even if neither side seeks war.
- Escalation dynamics are complex; both sides have incentives to avoid large-scale war, but accidental or limited clashes are increasingly possible.
- The outcome depends on the availability of credible reporting to verify lethal exchanges.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given:
- Recent deployments and explicit war planning[2][4]
- Increased tensions and risk of accidental escalation[1][3]
- A relatively low threshold for the question to resolve "Yes"

A reasonable updated forecast is that there is approximately a **30–40% probability** that armed conflict between the US and China will result in at least 100 deaths before 2050.
