## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The Venezuela-Guyana border dispute centers on the Essequibo region, which comprises over two-thirds of Guyana’s territory. The 1899 Paris Arbitral Award granted this land to British Guiana (now Guyana), but Venezuela revived its claim in 1962, arguing the award was invalid[2][3].
- Tensions escalated in 2023 after significant oil discoveries in Guyana, with Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro threatening to annex the Essequibo region and holding a national referendum on the issue in December 2023[2][3].
- Despite these threats, both countries signed a joint declaration on December 14, 2023, pledging not to threaten or use force and to resolve the dispute through dialogue[1][3].
- The International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruled in December 2023 that Venezuela must abstain from actions that could alter the status quo in the disputed region, which remains under Guyanese administration[3].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- In April 2024, Venezuelan President Maduro signed the "Organic Law for the Defense of Guayana Esequiba," which formalizes Venezuela’s claim and establishes a new Venezuelan state in the disputed territory. This move was described by Guyana as cementing Venezuela’s intent to annex the region[1].
- Venezuela has deployed military forces to the border with Guyana, raising concerns about possible escalation[4].
- Despite these actions, both sides have continued to participate in diplomatic talks, including the establishment of a joint commission to address the dispute and a commitment to peaceful coexistence and dialogue[1].
- International actors, including the United States and Brazil, have shown concern and engaged diplomatically, but there is no public evidence of direct military intervention or support for an invasion[1][3].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- United Nations Security Council and International Court of Justice statements and rulings[1][3].
- Official declarations and laws from the governments of Venezuela and Guyana[1][3].
- Reports from credible international news agencies and regional organizations monitoring troop movements and diplomatic developments[4].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- While Venezuela has taken provocative legal and political steps and increased military presence near the border, there is no public evidence as of July 30, 2024, that more than 100 Venezuelan ground troops have entered Guyanese territory on government orders, as defined by the resolution criteria.
- Both countries have publicly committed to dialogue and non-aggression, and international pressure appears to have deterred immediate military action[1][3].
- Military deployments near the border increase the risk of accidental or deliberate escalation, but the available evidence does not confirm an imminent invasion before September 30, 2024[4].
- Intelligence on covert troop movements or secret orders may not be available in open sources, so there is always some uncertainty in forecasting state actions.

## Summary

As of July 30, 2024, Venezuela has taken significant legal and military steps to assert its claim over the Essequibo region, including passing a law to annex the territory and deploying troops near the border. However, both Venezuela and Guyana have publicly committed to peaceful resolution and continued diplomatic engagement, and there is no credible evidence that Venezuela has invaded Guyana or is poised to do so imminently. International actors are closely monitoring the situation, and the risk of escalation remains, but the threshold for an invasion as defined by the resolution criteria has not been met.
