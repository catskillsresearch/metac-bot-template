## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Ralph Norman has been a member of the US House representing South Carolina’s 5th District since 2017 and is a prominent figure in the state's Republican right wing[3][4].
- There has been speculation, dating back to 2023, about Norman potentially mounting a primary challenge against incumbent Senator Lindsey Graham in 2026, as reported by Axios and other outlets.
- As of late May 2025, the most credible and recent reporting suggests Norman is “expected to announce his intentions very soon”—but specifically regarding the South Carolina governor’s race, not the US Senate race[1].

## 2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- Norman has made no public declaration of candidacy for the US Senate race as of May 30, 2025[1][2].
- His public activity and political maneuvering are currently associated with the potential for a gubernatorial bid[1].
- No Federal Election Commission (FEC) filings or campaign infrastructure for a 2026 US Senate run have been reported as of this date[2].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- FEC candidate filings and campaign finance data[2].
- Congressional records and official House website[3][4].
- Reputable state political news outlets covering South Carolina elections and candidate announcements[1].

## 4. Limitations or Uncertainties in Measurement

- If Norman were to announce shortly after May 30, but before July 1, the probability would change; however, as of today, there is no evidence of such an announcement.
- Media coverage tends to quickly publicize any Senate campaign declarations by major figures, so the absence of news is meaningful.
- It is possible, but unlikely, that a private declaration or low-profile campaign announcement could occur without immediate widespread reporting, but this would be atypical for a US Senate race.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Based on all available information as of May 30, 2025:
- There is a high probability (estimated >90%) that Ralph Norman will **not** declare his candidacy for the US Senate race in South Carolina before July 1, 2025.
- The key factor is that Norman’s political focus is currently on the governor’s race, not the Senate, and there are no indications of an imminent Senate campaign launch[1].
- Unless there is a rapid, unexpected shift in the next month, the forecast is **No** for a Senate declaration before the deadline.
