# Forecasting Trump Media & Technology Group Stock Performance Through 2024

Based on available information as of November 2024, here's an analysis to help forecast whether Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG) stock will remain below its all-time high through the end of 2024.

## Historical Trends and Current Status

Trump Media & Technology Group, which owns Truth Social, reached its all-time high of $79.38 on March 26, 2024, which was the stock's first day of trading under the DJT ticker[1]. However, by early September 2024, the stock had experienced a significant decline, erasing all of its 2024 gains[1].

As of September 5, 2024, TMTG had lost approximately 80% of its value since hitting that March peak[1]. This dramatic decline occurred over just a few months, indicating high volatility and a strong downward trend through most of 2024.

## Key Factors Affecting Stock Performance

Several factors appear to be influencing TMTG's stock performance:

1. **Executive Selling Pressure**: There were concerns in the market that Donald Trump might follow the example of CEO Devin Nunes and sell shares of the company[1]. This selling pressure from insiders typically creates negative sentiment among investors.

2. **Lock-up Period Considerations**: The timing of when major shareholders like Donald Trump could cash out their holdings appears to have been a significant market concern[1]. Such events typically create uncertainty in stock performance.

3. **Valuation Concerns**: Despite the significant drop in share price, Donald Trump's stake was still valued at nearly $2 billion as of September 2024[1], suggesting potential overvaluation concerns among market analysts.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several limitations should be considered when forecasting TMTG's stock performance:

1. **Limited Trading History**: With DJT only beginning to trade under its ticker in March 2024, there is limited historical data to establish long-term patterns.

2. **Political Factors**: As a company closely associated with Donald Trump, political developments could significantly impact stock performance in unpredictable ways.

3. **Market Volatility**: The stock has demonstrated extreme volatility, losing 80% of its value in just a few months, making predictions challenging.

Based on the available information through early September 2024, TMTG stock had established a strong downward trend after its initial peak. For the stock to exceed its all-time high of $79.38 before January 1, 2025, it would need to reverse this trend and gain more than 400% from its early September levels. While such movements are not impossible in volatile stocks, the established trend and insider selling pressure suggested continued challenges for TMTG stock through the remainder of 2024.
