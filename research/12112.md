## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Beyond Meat’s net revenues have continued to decline, with a 9.1% year-over-year drop to $68.7 million in Q1 2025, down from $75.6 million in Q1 2024[1][2][3].
- The company’s gross profit turned negative ($1.1 million loss, or -1.5% gross margin), compared to a positive $3.7 million one year earlier. This decline was driven by increased inventory provisions and the suspension of operations in China[2][3].
- Loss from operations deepened to $56.2 million (an operating margin of -81.8%), compared to a $53.5 million loss (operating margin -70.7%) in the prior year[2].
- The company has faced persistent and significant cash burn, with continued operating losses and negative margins since at least late 2022.

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- In May 2025, Beyond Meat announced a $100 million new senior secured financing from an affiliate of the Ahimsa Foundation, improving its near-term liquidity[2].
- The company has implemented cost-cutting measures, including layoffs and operational restructuring, as part of a broader effort to control cash burn[2][4].
- Despite these actions, the company continues to report declining revenues and negative profitability, indicating ongoing financial distress[1][2][3].

## Limitations or Uncertainties

- While the new $100 million financing strengthens short-term liquidity and demonstrates some lender confidence, it may not be sufficient if revenue declines persist or worsen, or if restructuring efforts do not succeed.
- The food tech sector is volatile, and consumer demand for plant-based meat alternatives has shown signs of stagnation or decline, which could further challenge Beyond Meat’s turnaround.
- The company’s ability to secure future financing, cut costs further, or return to profitability is uncertain and subject to market and operational risks.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the sustained negative trends in revenue, profitability, and cash flow, Beyond Meat remains at significant risk of bankruptcy before 2026. However, the infusion of $100 million in new secured financing and ongoing restructuring reduce the probability of an imminent filing. Compared to reference cases of rapid bankruptcies, Beyond Meat’s recent actions suggest a moderate chance of surviving through 2025 if no further severe deterioration occurs.

**Probabilistic Risk Estimate (as of May 2025):**
- Elevated risk, but an immediate bankruptcy filing appears less likely given the recent financing.
- If negative trends continue or accelerate and no further financing is obtained, the probability of bankruptcy before 2026 could increase significantly.
