# Forecasting Civil Unrest in the US (November-December 2024)

The period following the 2024 US presidential election through the end of the year presents significant potential for civil unrest based on current intelligence assessments, expert analyses, and historical patterns. This analysis examines factors that may contribute to or mitigate the risk of major civil unrest meeting the specified threshold (10+ deaths or 1,000+ arrests) between November 6 and December 31, 2024.

## Historical Context and Current Risk Factors

Recent US history demonstrates that large-scale civil unrest can emerge rapidly under certain conditions. The 2020 George Floyd protests resulted in 19 deaths, over 14,000 arrests, and $1-2 billion in insured damages. The January 6, 2021 Capitol riot resulted in five deaths and numerous arrests, establishing a precedent for election-related violence[1].

The Department of Homeland Security's 2025 Homeland Threat Assessment, released in October 2024, explicitly warns that domestic violent extremists (DVEs) may engage in "civil unrest if there are perceptions of election fraud"[4]. This assessment aligns with statements from FBI Director Christopher Wray, who expressed growing concern about "the potential for a coordinated attack here in the homeland"[1].

Political rhetoric surrounding the 2024 election has included explicit references to potential violence. Former President Trump and his allies have repeatedly suggested that an election loss could trigger civil war or revolution, with one shared social media post suggesting 2024 might resemble 1776, "except this time the fight is not against the British, it's against communist Americans"[1]. Trump has previously warned that his defeat would spark a "bloodbath" in the country[1].

## Expert Assessments and Warning Signs

Security experts have identified several concerning trends that increase the risk of post-election violence:

1. **Ideological Extremism**: The threat landscape is characterized primarily by "lone offenders or small cells motivated to violence by a combination of racial, religious, gender, or anti-government grievances; conspiracy theories; and personalized factors"[4].

2. **Convergence of Threats**: The DHS notes that "threat actors" will likely "converge on 2024 election season," with foreign adversaries potentially using influence operations to further divide the US populace and create new sources of divisiveness and violence[1].

3. **Weapons Proliferation**: Experts warn about "the growing accumulation of privatized high-powered weapons like AR-15s, largely on the right," which could facilitate escalating attacks triggered by key events[5].

4. **Law Enforcement Capacity**: There are concerns that "a contagion of localized but widespread tit-for-tat violence could produce mass abdications on the part of local law enforcement and overwhelm the capacity of the federal authorities"[5].

Between September 2023 and July 2024, DVEs conducted at least four attacks in the US, with law enforcement disrupting at least seven additional plots[4]. This demonstrates both the persistent threat and the ongoing efforts to prevent violence.

## Mitigating Factors

Despite these concerning indicators, several factors may reduce the likelihood of widespread unrest reaching the specified threshold:

1. **Geographic Distribution**: Unlike the Civil War era, today's political divisions run urban-rural rather than north-south, "robbing any potential seditious movement of the geographical safe haven it would need to engage in nationwide conflict"[1].

2. **Law Enforcement Preparedness**: Following the January 6, 2021 events, federal and local law enforcement have likely developed enhanced protocols for responding to election-related unrest.

3. **Public Awareness**: Increased public awareness of the potential for violence may reduce participation in risky gatherings or protests.

## Assessment Limitations

Several factors complicate accurate forecasting of civil unrest:

1. **Trigger Events**: Unrest often requires specific triggering events that are difficult to predict, such as contested election results, controversial court decisions, or inflammatory incidents.

2. **Extremist Adaptability**: The DHS notes that many violent extremists "embrace multiple, sometimes competing motivations, challenging our ability to identify their potential targets in advance"[4].

3. **Measurement Challenges**: Determining whether incidents constitute "civil unrest" versus isolated criminal acts can be subjective, particularly when events occur across multiple locations.

## Conclusion

Based on available information as of November 2024, there is a significant risk of civil unrest in the US between November 6 and December 31, 2024. Government assessments, expert warnings, and historical precedents all suggest elevated potential for politically motivated violence following the presidential election. While full-scale civil war remains unlikely, localized incidents of violence could potentially escalate to meet the threshold of major civil unrest as defined in the query.

The most likely scenario involves geographically dispersed incidents rather than a single massive riot, with the period immediately following the election and around key dates (electoral college meetings, court decisions) presenting the highest risk windows.
