### 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- In 2017–2018, 43% of U.S. adults were classified as obese (BMI ≥ 30)[2].
- Obesity rates have been rising steadily since the late 1970s, with projections showing little sign of plateauing up to 2030 and beyond[2][3].
- By 2030, authoritative models published in the New England Journal of Medicine and reported by the CDC and major outlets projected nearly half (49.2%) of U.S. adults will be obese[1][2][3].

### 2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- In June 2021, the FDA approved Wegovy, a highly effective weight-loss drug, which demonstrated 15–18% mean body weight loss in trials. Although expensive ($1,349/month in 2021), demand has been high, suggesting potential for impact if adoption increases[2].
- Despite this, as of November 2021, the drug’s reach and the impact of similar interventions were minimal relative to the national obesity trend.
- No major federal policy changes with immediate large-scale impact on obesity rates were announced as of late 2021.

### 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- New England Journal of Medicine 2019 projection: ~49% obesity prevalence for U.S. adults by 2030[2][3].
- CDC NHANES data for 2017–2018: 43%[2].
- Metaculus community forecast for 2032 (as of late 2021): median 43.8%, interquartile range roughly 39–49%[4].
- The Lancet (projection for 2050): upward trajectory continues, with overweight/obesity projected to affect 64% of Americans by 2050 (note: this combines overweight and obesity)[5].

### 4. Limitations or Uncertainties in Measurement

- Measurement will ultimately depend on NHANES data for 2031–2032; interim projections may be revised with new data or trends.
- BMI as a measure has limitations in capturing health and body composition but remains the standard for population-level obesity statistics[3].
- The potential impact of new weight-loss drugs, public health interventions, or unforeseen societal changes introduces uncertainty.
- COVID-19 pandemic effects on behavior and healthcare access could have longer-term impacts not fully accounted for in 2021 projections.

### Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the historical trend, authoritative projections for 2030, and only limited penetration of new interventions as of late 2021, the most likely percentage of American adults who will be obese in 2032 is:

- **Best estimate:** 47% (rounded)
- **Probable range:** 44–49%

This forecast will need to be updated as new data on intervention effectiveness, drug adoption, and policy changes become available.
