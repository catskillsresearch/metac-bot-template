# Will the Fed Cut Rates by More Than 50 bps at Their September Meeting?

Based on available information as of August 22, 2024, here's an analysis of factors relevant to forecasting whether the Federal Reserve will cut rates by more than 50 basis points at their September 17-18, 2024 meeting.

## Current Economic Context and Fed Positioning

As of early August 2024, the Federal Reserve has maintained the federal funds target rate at 5.25%-5.50% since July 2023[3]. However, economic conditions have been shifting significantly, with a notable transition from inflation concerns to growth worries. The unemployment rate has increased to 4.3% from a historic low of 3.5% just 12 months prior, raising recession concerns[5].

Fed Chair Jerome Powell signaled in late July that the time for a rate cut "is approaching," specifically mentioning that a reduction "could be on the table at our September meeting" if economic data continues to show inflation easing[3]. This marked a significant shift in the Fed's communication strategy, with the Fed describing inflation as "somewhat elevated" rather than simply "elevated" as they had in June[3].

## Market Expectations for September

As of July 31, 2024, markets were projecting three cuts in 2024, which would take the federal-funds rate down to 4.50%-4.75% by December[1]. This implies cuts of 75-100 basis points total for the remainder of 2024, but doesn't necessarily suggest more than 50 bps at the September meeting alone.

By early August 2024, economists were beginning to project that the Fed could cut interest rates at all three remaining meetings of the year, with discussions centered around either quarter-point cuts (25 bps) or half-point moves (50 bps)[5]. This suggests that while a 50 bps cut in September was being considered as a possibility, cuts larger than 50 bps weren't prominently featured in mainstream forecasts.

## Historical Fed Behavior and Projections

The Fed has historically preferred gradual, measured approaches to policy changes. Earlier in 2024, the Fed had projected just one reduction for the entire year[4], showing their cautious stance. By June, Morningstar analysts were forecasting that "the Fed should cut two or three times in 2024, rather than just once," with the first cut expected in September[4].

It's worth noting that as recently as June 12, 2024, the Fed was officially projecting only one 25 bps cut for all of 2024, a significant downgrade from their March projection of three cuts[4]. This demonstrates the Fed's traditionally conservative approach to rate adjustments.

## Factors That Could Influence a Larger Cut

Several factors could potentially push the Fed toward a larger cut:

1. **Labor Market Deterioration**: The unemployment rate increase to 4.3% represents a significant weakening from previous levels[5].

2. **Inflation Progress**: The Fed acknowledged "modest further progress toward the Committee's 2 percent inflation objective" in recent months[4], which could give them more room to focus on supporting employment.

3. **Recession Fears**: Powell has indicated that both retreating inflation and a weakening job market would warrant rate cuts[5]. With both conditions potentially being met, the urgency for action could increase.

## Limitations in Forecasting

The available information has several limitations:

1. **Rapidly Evolving Situation**: Economic data and market expectations were changing quickly in early August 2024.

2. **Fed's Data Dependency**: Powell emphasized that decisions would depend on forthcoming inflation data[3], making predictions uncertain.

3. **Limited Precedent**: The Fed rarely makes initial cuts larger than 50 bps outside of crisis situations.

4. **Communication Strategy**: The Fed has been careful not to commit to specific cut sizes, with Powell sidestepping questions about the pace of rate reductions[3].

## Conclusion

Based on information available as of August 22, 2024, while a September rate cut appears increasingly likely, there is limited evidence suggesting the Fed would opt for a cut larger than 50 bps at that meeting. Most forecasts and Fed communications point toward either a 25 bps or potentially a 50 bps cut to begin the easing cycle, with additional cuts expected at subsequent meetings. The Fed's historically cautious approach and preference for gradual policy adjustments further suggest that a cut exceeding 50 bps would be unusual for the September meeting.
