## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Y Combinator (YC) has a long history of hosting high-profile technology and entrepreneurship events, but there is no documented precedent for both Sam Altman and Elon Musk appearing together on stage at a YC event[5].
- The relationship between Sam Altman (OpenAI CEO) and Elon Musk (CEO of Tesla, SpaceX, xAI) has become notably strained in recent years, especially after Musk's public criticisms of OpenAI and his 2024 lawsuit against the organization and Altman personally. This public tension may affect their willingness to appear together.

## 2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- YC has officially announced both Sam Altman and Elon Musk as headline speakers for its inaugural AI Startup School, scheduled for June 16–17, 2025, in San Francisco[1][3][5].
- The published speaker list confirms their individual participation but does not specify whether they will share a session or appear on stage simultaneously[1][3][5].
- As of May 27, 2025, there are no published schedules or official statements indicating a joint appearance; the event website and supporting materials do not clarify this detail[1][3][5].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The official YC AI Startup School event page and blog confirm both are speakers but do not mention a joint session[1][3].
- Secondary reporting and prediction markets (e.g., Metaculus, CFTC filings) are tracking the question but have no direct evidence of a planned joint appearance as of this date[2][4].

## 4. Limitations or Uncertainties in Measurement

- The event agenda has not been fully published, and organizers may alter the schedule closer to the event.
- Both Altman and Musk are known for last-minute changes to public appearances, and the ongoing public disputes between them add additional uncertainty.
- Absence of explicit confirmation does not rule out the possibility of a surprise joint appearance (planned or spontaneous) during the event.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given:
- Both are confirmed as headline speakers but with no explicit evidence of a scheduled joint appearance.
- Recent strained relations and public disputes.
- No historical precedent for such a joint appearance at YC events.
- High media/public attention potentially incentivizing or deterring a joint appearance.

**As of May 27, 2025, the probability that Sam Altman and Elon Musk will share the stage together at YC AI Startup School is assessed as low (estimated 10–20%), unless further details emerge confirming a planned joint session.**
