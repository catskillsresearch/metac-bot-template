# Forecast Analysis: US Military Climate Resilience Portal Status

As of May 20, 2025, there is insufficient specific information in the available data to make a robust forecast about whether the US military's climate resilience portal (climate.mil) will be back online by July 1, 2025. However, I can provide contextual information about the current climate policy landscape that may indirectly inform this forecast.

## Current Status and Context

The US military's climate resilience portal (climate.mil) is currently offline as of May 5, 2025, according to the resolution source IsItDownRightNow.com. This appears to be related to broader actions by the Trump administration regarding climate information on federal websites, as referenced in the question description.

The current climate policy environment shows mixed signals:

- The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) continues to publish climate outlooks and predictions, suggesting that some federal climate information services remain operational[1].
- Scientific organizations like RealClimate are continuing to publish climate status updates as of May 12, 2025[2].
- The Union of Concerned Scientists launched an updated online map tracking climate-related "Danger Season" impacts across the United States on May 7, 2025, indicating ongoing non-governmental climate information initiatives[5].

## Relevant Factors for Forecast

Without specific information about the military's plans for climate.mil, several broader factors may influence the likelihood of restoration:

1. **Current Administration Priorities**: The question description references Trump administration actions to remove climate mentions from federal websites. This suggests a policy direction that may not prioritize restoration of climate-focused military resources.

2. **Ongoing Climate Monitoring**: Federal scientific agencies like NOAA continue to release climate data and forecasts as recently as May 12, 2025[4], indicating that not all federal climate information has been removed.

3. **Alternative Information Sources**: The emergence of non-governmental climate information tracking, such as the UCS "Danger Season" map[5], may reduce pressure to restore government resources.

## Forecast Limitations

The available information is insufficient to make a confident prediction about whether climate.mil will be restored by July 1, 2025. Key missing information includes:

- Department of Defense statements regarding the climate.mil portal
- Technical versus policy reasons for the site being offline
- Any legal challenges to the removal of climate information from military websites
- Congressional actions related to military climate resilience programs

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based solely on the limited information available, the restoration of climate.mil by July 1, 2025 appears unlikely, given:

1. The site has been down since at least May 5, 2025 (over two weeks as of current date)
2. There is an apparent administration policy to remove climate mentions from federal websites
3. No information is available about efforts to restore the site

However, this assessment carries very low confidence due to the significant information gaps noted above.
