# Forecast: Will Commercial Passengers Routinely Fly in Pilotless Planes by 2030?

As of March 12, 2020, I'm assessing the likelihood of commercial passengers routinely flying in pilotless planes by 2030, as per the Longbets contest between Craig J. Mundie and Eric Schmidt.

## Current Status and Historical Trends

As of early 2020, autonomous aircraft technology is in active development but still in relatively early stages for commercial passenger applications. Major aerospace companies are investing in autonomous flight capabilities, with Airbus actively working toward self-piloting urban air mobility vehicles, cargo drones, and more autonomous commercial aircraft.

The industry is currently exploring varying levels of autonomy, from advanced autopilot systems to fully autonomous operations. However, no major commercial airline is currently operating pilotless passenger flights, and all commercial passenger aircraft still require human pilots in the cockpit.

## Key Factors Affecting the Forecast

### Technological Progress

Boeing has been testing heavy-duty drone prototypes capable of lifting 500-pound payloads, with indoor flight tests completed and potential outdoor testing planned for 2019. This indicates progress in autonomous cargo applications that could precede passenger applications.

In February 2020, Airbus entered into collaboration with the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) to enable urban air mobility (UAM) in Singapore, showing regulatory engagement with autonomous flight technologies.

### Market Projections and Industry Developments

The autonomous aircraft market is expected to grow significantly in the coming decade, driven by:
- Rising adoption of autonomous cargo aircraft
- Efforts to reduce human errors through autonomy
- Increasing adoption of artificial intelligence in aircraft systems

### Barriers to Implementation

Several significant barriers exist that could prevent widespread adoption of pilotless commercial passenger flights by 2030:

1. **Regulatory Hurdles**: Aviation regulations are typically conservative and slow-changing, requiring extensive safety validation.

2. **Security Concerns**: Increased security issues and cyber threats pose challenges to fully autonomous systems.

3. **Infrastructure Limitations**: Lack of standardized infrastructure for autonomous aircraft operations.

4. **Technical Complexity**: Complex design requirements and high initial investment costs.

5. **Public Acceptance**: Perhaps most critically, passenger acceptance of pilotless aircraft will be a significant hurdle.

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on information available as of March 2020, I assess the probability of commercial passengers routinely flying in pilotless planes by 2030 at **15-25%**.

This relatively low probability reflects:

1. The significant regulatory and safety certification processes required for passenger-carrying autonomous aircraft

2. The likely progression of autonomy in aviation, which appears to be following this sequence:
   - Cargo drones for short-range, low-altitude operations
   - Urban air mobility for limited passenger routes
   - Larger cargo aircraft
   - Commercial passenger aircraft (with reduced crew before fully pilotless)

3. The 10-year timeframe to 2030, which is likely insufficient for the technology to mature, gain regulatory approval, and achieve public acceptance for routine commercial passenger flights

While autonomous systems will likely see increasing implementation in commercial aviation by 2030, these will more probably be in the form of enhanced autopilot systems or reduced crew operations rather than fully pilotless commercial passenger flights becoming routine.
