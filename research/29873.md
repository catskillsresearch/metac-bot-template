# US Oil Drilling Rig Count Forecast Analysis

Based on available data as of October 2024, I'll analyze factors relevant to forecasting whether US active drilling rigs will fall within the 585-590 range by November 29, 2024.

## Historical Trends and Current Status

The Baker Hughes rig count serves as a leading indicator of demand for products used in drilling operations and has been issued to the oil and gas industry since 1944[1]. Historical data shows significant volatility in US oil rig counts, which once peaked at 1,609 rigs before dramatically declining to just 325 rigs within a two-year period[2].

According to the 2024 NOV census published in October 2024, the number of active rigs in the US stood at 683, representing a utilization rate of 64% (up from 58% in 2023). Of these active rigs, 645 were land rigs and 38 were offshore rigs[4]. This census indicated a stabilization in the US onshore rig market after previous declines, while offshore markets remained tight with positive developments for rig counts and dayrates[4].

## Recent Trends and Forecasts

Industry forecasts from late 2023 projected that after hitting 651 rigs in Q4 2023, the US onshore market would reach approximately 676 rigs by Q4 2024, representing a modest 4% increase year-over-year[5]. This aligns with the observation in the 2024 census that showed a "leveling out of the decline in the US onshore rig markets"[4].

The rig count had experienced a significant drop of 69 units from Q2 to Q3 2023, driven partly by lower-than-expected gas prices that discouraged production[5]. This demonstrates how sensitive rig counts can be to energy price fluctuations.

## Factors Affecting Future Rig Counts

Several factors will influence whether the rig count falls within the 585-590 range by late November 2024:

1. **Oil and Gas Prices**: WTI crude oil was trading at $85.85 as of October 17, 2023, and was forecast to remain around that level for much of 2024, potentially dipping to $81.50 in Q4 2023 before rising back to $85.50 by Q4 2024[5]. Henry Hub natural gas prices were expected to hover around $3.50 in 2024[5].

2. **Infrastructure Development**: New gas pipelines were expected to increase US gas takeaway capacity from 1 billion cubic feet per day in Q4 2023 to 2.5 billion cubic feet per day by Q4 2024[5]. However, industry experts noted that the impact of this increased capacity on drilling activity would take months to materialize, with significant effects likely not visible until late 2024 or 2025[5].

3. **Regional Dynamics**: The Permian Basin's drilling activity was expected to benefit from new gas pipelines, but the most substantial impacts were anticipated for 2025 rather than 2024[5].

4. **Industry Consolidation**: The period between the 2023 and 2024 census was characterized by record levels of merger and acquisition activity, particularly in US shale plays[4]. This consolidation could affect drilling strategies and rig deployment.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several uncertainties could affect the accuracy of any forecast:

1. **Energy Price Volatility**: Unexpected fluctuations in oil and gas prices could significantly impact drilling activity.

2. **Geopolitical Factors**: The search results mention "unrest in the Middle East" as contributing to a focus on energy security[4], and any escalation or resolution of global conflicts could affect energy markets and drilling activity.

3. **Seasonal Factors**: Weather patterns can affect both energy demand and drilling operations, potentially causing short-term fluctuations in rig counts.

4. **Reporting Methodology**: Baker Hughes provides the official rig count data, but changes to their reporting format were mentioned[1][3], which could potentially affect how rigs are counted or categorized.

Based on the available information, the US rig count appears to be on a modest growth trajectory for Q4 2024, but with a tendency toward stabilization rather than rapid expansion. Whether the count will fall specifically within the 585-590 range by November 29, 2024, depends on how these various factors play out in the coming months.
