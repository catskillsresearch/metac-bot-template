### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of February 16, 2025, the FAA had received 181 reports of unruly passengers year-to-date[1].
- In 2024, airlines reported 1,240 unruly passenger cases by August, indicating a persistent problem but with a lower rate than the 2021 peak[1].
- In 2023, there were 2,075 unruly passenger reports for the full year, with 649 reports by April 28, suggesting that Q1 typically sees between 200 and 250 incidents[2][3].
- The rate of unruly passenger incidents has declined since 2021 but remains a significant safety concern[1][3].

### Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Metric

- The FAA and TSA have maintained a zero-tolerance policy, with fines up to $37,000 per violation and potential criminal referrals for severe cases[1][2].
- In January 2024, the Department of Transportation and FAA increased fines for assaulting or threatening crew, raising the penalty to $42,658 per violation[2].
- Passengers may also lose TSA PreCheck privileges or be placed on airline no-fly lists for serious offenses[1][2].

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The FAA’s official page for unruly passenger statistics is the primary source for the current and historical incident count.

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- The FAA’s published number may lag behind actual events due to reporting and processing times.
- Seasonal variation, changes in reporting practices, or new enforcement actions could affect the incident rate.
- The exact number for Q1 2025 will depend on the FAA’s reporting as of the date Metaculus accesses the page, regardless of the "as of" date shown.

### Summary Table: Recent FAA Unruly Passenger Reports

| Year | Q1 Incidents (Est.) | Full Year Incidents | Notable Policies/Events           |
|------|---------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------|
| 2023 | ~200–250            | 2,075               | Zero-tolerance, increased fines   |
| 2024 | ~300 (by April 28)  | 1,240 (by August)   | Fines increased, continued crackdown |
| 2025 | 181 (as of Feb 16)  | TBD                 | Ongoing enforcement               |

### Forecast Implications

Given 181 incidents as of February 16, 2025, and historical Q1 totals of 200–250, it is likely that the Q1 2025 total will fall within the '301 to 350' range if the incident rate remains steady through March. However, if the rate slows, the total could be slightly lower. The most authoritative and up-to-date number will be found on the FAA’s official page at the time of resolution.
