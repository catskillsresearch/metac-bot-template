# Forecasting Registered Syrian Refugees in Jordan by April 1, 2025

Based on available data as of March 5, 2025, I'll analyze the current status and trends of registered Syrian refugees in Jordan to help forecast the number expected by April 1, 2025.

## Current Status and Historical Trends

As of November 2024, approximately 654,000 Syrian refugees were registered with UNHCR in Jordan[2]. This makes Jordan one of the countries with the highest refugee population per capita, placing significant pressure on the country and its host communities[2].

The most recent official documentation on Syrian refugees in Jordan was published on February 28, 2025, titled "Syrian Refugees in Jordan, Origin and Location"[1]. While the exact number isn't specified in the search results, this document would contain the most up-to-date figures prior to the April 1, 2025 target date.

Another relevant document is the "External Statistical Report on UNHCR Registered Refugees and Asylum-Seekers Jordan as of 31 Jan 2025," published on February 5, 2025[3]. This report likely contains precise figures for registered Syrian refugees in Jordan as of January 31, 2025.

In the broader regional context, as of February 25, 2025, there were 1.79 million Syrians registered by UNHCR across Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, and Lebanon combined[4].

## Factors Affecting Refugee Numbers

Several factors may influence the number of registered Syrian refugees in Jordan by April 1, 2025:

1. **Long-term Displacement**: Most Syrian refugees have been in Jordan for years, with the crisis beginning in 2011[5]. This suggests a relatively stable population with limited fluctuations in the short term.

2. **Living Conditions**: More than 80% of refugee households were in debt as of late 2022, with most borrowing money to cover basic needs such as food and rent[5]. Approximately 80% of refugees lived outside camps in poor housing as of January 2023[5].

3. **UNHCR Operations**: UNHCR maintains three main offices across Jordan (Amman, Irbid, and Mafraq) and has a presence in the two main refugee camps, Azraq and Zaatari[2]. This established infrastructure suggests continued support and registration capabilities.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

There are several limitations to consider when forecasting the number of registered Syrian refugees in Jordan:

1. **Data Recency**: While we have documentation from February 28, 2025[1], the most recent specific number in the search results is from November 2024 (654,000)[2].

2. **Registration vs. Actual Population**: The number of registered refugees may not capture all Syrian nationals in Jordan. The search results mention "nearly 1.3 million Syrian refugees in Jordan" in a March 2023 report[5], suggesting a potential gap between registered and unregistered populations.

3. **Dynamic Situation**: Refugee populations can change due to various factors, including new displacements, returns to Syria, resettlement to third countries, or changes in registration policies.

Based on the available data, the most reliable estimate for registered Syrian refugees in Jordan by April 1, 2025, would be approximately 654,000, with potential minor fluctuations since the November 2024 data point[2]. For the most accurate forecast, the February 28, 2025 UNHCR document[1] should be consulted for the exact figures.
