# Ukrainian Incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast: Forecasting Potential Capture of Glushkovo

The Ukrainian incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast that began in early August 2024 represents a significant development in the Russia-Ukraine conflict. This analysis examines available information that could help forecast whether Ukrainian forces will capture Glushkovo before October 1, 2024.

## Initial Offensive and Territorial Gains

Ukrainian forces launched a mechanized offensive operation into Russia's Kursk Oblast on August 6, 2024[1]. By August 7, Ukrainian forces had made confirmed advances up to 10 kilometers into Russian territory, with geolocated footage showing Ukrainian armored vehicles positioned along the 38K-030 route approximately 10 kilometers from the international border[1]. The initial advance indicated that Ukrainian forces had successfully penetrated at least two Russian defensive lines and a stronghold[1].

Russian sources reported that Ukrainian forces had captured 11 settlements by August 7, including:
- Nikolaevo-Daryino (1.5 kilometers north of the Sumy Oblast border)
- Darino (three kilometers north of the Sumy Oblast border)
- Sverdlikovo (east of the Nikolaevo-Darino-Darino area)[1]

Ukrainian forces were also reportedly operating within Lyubimovka, approximately 8 kilometers north of the Sumy Oblast border[1].

## Continued Advances and Territorial Control

By August 12, the situation had developed further, with Ukrainian forces continuing to advance despite Russian milblogger claims that Russian forces were stabilizing the frontline in Kursk Oblast[2]. A prominent Kremlin-affiliated milblogger noted on August 12 that Russian forces were "far from stabilizing the situation, in part due to poor C2 [Command and Control]"[2].

Ukrainian forces reportedly launched new incursions into western Kursk Oblast near several locations:
- Slobodka-Ivanovka (northwest of Sumy City and two kilometers from the international border)
- Tetkino (south of Slobodka-Ivanovka along the international border)
- Gordeevka, Uspenka, and Viktorovka (all north of Sumy City along the international border and south of Korenevo)[2]

## Official Russian Assessments

Notably, regional Russian officials provided relatively frank assessments of the Ukrainian incursion. Kursk Oblast Governor Alexei Smirnov claimed on August 12 that:
1. Ukrainian forces had seized 28 settlements in Kursk Oblast
2. Ukrainian forces had advanced approximately 12 kilometers deep along a 40-kilometer-long front into Kursk Oblast[2]

Independent analysis based on geolocated footage indicated that Ukrainian forces were operating in or near 29 settlements as of August 11 and 40 settlements as of August 12[2]. Furthermore, geolocated footage showed that Ukrainian forces had operated up to 24 kilometers from the international border[2].

## Implications for Glushkovo

While the search results do not specifically mention Ukrainian operations in or near Glushkovo, the pace and extent of Ukrainian advances provide context for assessing the likelihood of Ukrainian forces capturing this settlement before October 1, 2024.

Based on reports from August 14, 2024, there were indications that Ukraine had doubled its controlled territory in Kursk Oblast[3]. Some reports suggested that Ukrainian forces were "much much much much much deeper into [Kursk Oblast] than it is shown on this map"[3], indicating potential underreporting of the full extent of Ukrainian advances.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors create uncertainty in forecasting whether Ukrainian forces will capture Glushkovo:

1. The search results do not provide specific information about Ukrainian operations near Glushkovo or the distance between current Ukrainian positions and this settlement.
2. There is a time lag in reporting developments on the ground, with Ukrainian forces potentially being "much more advanced" than what is reported[3].
3. The search results do not provide information about Russian defensive preparations specifically around Glushkovo.
4. The search results do not indicate Ukrainian strategic objectives in the Kursk Oblast operation, making it unclear whether capturing Glushkovo is a priority.
