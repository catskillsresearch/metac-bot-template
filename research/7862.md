# Forecasting Analysis: Will Sam Bankman-Fried Donate $1bn by 2031?

As of September 4, 2021, several key factors can inform our forecast of whether Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) will donate $1 billion in charitable contributions before 2031.

## Current Status and Historical Trends

Sam Bankman-Fried is a cryptocurrency entrepreneur with a substantial net worth of approximately $16.2 billion as of August 2021. He is the founder and CEO of FTX, a cryptocurrency exchange that has seen rapid growth. SBF has publicly aligned himself with the Effective Altruism movement, which advocates for using evidence and reasoning to determine how to benefit others as much as possible.

SBF is affiliated with Giving What We Can, an organization whose members pledge to donate a significant portion of their income to effective charities[5]. Additionally, he has signed the Giving Pledge, joining other billionaires who have committed to donating the majority of their wealth to philanthropic causes[4].

## Comparable Reference Cases

To assess the likelihood of SBF reaching the $1 billion donation threshold by 2031, we can examine similar cases:

1. **Dustin Moskovitz and Cari Tuna**: Facebook co-founder who embraced Effective Altruism and created Good Ventures, donating hundreds of millions within a decade of accumulating wealth.

2. **Bill Gates**: After accumulating significant wealth, Gates established his foundation and began large-scale giving, though his giving accelerated more substantially after stepping back from Microsoft.

3. **Other tech billionaires**: Many have taken several years to ramp up their giving, often creating foundations or donor-advised funds before making major grants.

## Key Differences Affecting the Forecast

Several factors specific to SBF may influence his giving trajectory:

1. **Explicit earning-to-give philosophy**: Unlike many other billionaires who accumulated wealth first and developed philanthropic interests later, SBF has explicitly stated that making money is a means to philanthropic ends.

2. **Cryptocurrency volatility**: SBF's wealth is largely tied to cryptocurrency ventures, which experience significant volatility. This could either accelerate or hinder his ability to donate depending on market performance.

3. **Age and time horizon**: At a relatively young age, SBF has a longer potential giving timeline than many other major philanthropists who began significant giving later in life.

4. **Effective Altruism influence**: The EA movement emphasizes maximizing impact, which could lead to either immediate giving (if pressing current opportunities exist) or patient philanthropy (saving to give later if future opportunities might be more impactful).

## Probabilistic Assessment

Given the available information as of September 2021, I estimate the probability that SBF will donate $1 billion (in 2021 USD) to charitable causes before 2031 at approximately 75%.

Factors supporting this estimate:
- SBF's substantial current wealth ($16.2 billion) means he would need to donate only about 6.2% of his current net worth to reach the threshold
- His explicit commitment to Effective Altruism and the Giving Pledge
- His stated intention to give away most of his fortune
- The 10-year timeframe provides ample opportunity for planned giving

Factors creating uncertainty:
- Cryptocurrency market volatility could significantly affect his wealth
- The resolution criteria exclude political donations and unallocated donor-advised funds
- Potential business or personal circumstances might delay major giving
- The possibility that he might prioritize "patient philanthropy" and delay major donations

## Measurement Considerations and Limitations

Tracking SBF's donations will require monitoring:
1. Direct donations to charitable organizations
2. Grants made by foundations he primarily funds
3. Verification that donations meet the specific criteria outlined (excluding political donations, unallocated DAFs, etc.)

Limitations in measurement include:
- Potential lack of transparency in donation reporting
- Difficulty in attributing donations from jointly funded organizations
- Challenges in calculating inflation adjustments to maintain 2021 USD value
