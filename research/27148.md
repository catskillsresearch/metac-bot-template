# Forecasting Analysis: 2024 Mpox Outbreak Compared to 2022-2023

As of August 13, 2024, the current mpox outbreak shows concerning patterns that differ significantly from the 2022-2023 event. This analysis examines available data to help forecast whether the 2024 outbreak will exceed the previous outbreak's 66,387 confirmed cases during its PHEIC period.

## Current Situation (as of August 13, 2024)

The 2024 mpox outbreak has already reached significant scale, with over 20,000 cases reported in Africa alone, marking a dramatic escalation compared to previous outbreaks[5]. Most cases are concentrated in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), where cases began increasing in September 2023 and continued rising into 2024[4]. The Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention reported a 160% increase in cases compared to the previous year[4].

In total, over 24,000 confirmed or suspected mpox cases due to both clade I and clade II variants have been reported in 2024, including over 600 deaths[1]. The global situation remains fluid, with international spread already documented to countries including Sweden and Thailand[5].

## Comparison with the 2022-2023 Outbreak

The previous mpox outbreak (2022-2023):
- Infected approximately 87,000 individuals globally before the WHO ended the emergency in May 2023[4]
- Was primarily driven by clade IIb of the virus[4]
- Resulted in approximately 140 deaths (case fatality rate <0.2%)[4]

The current 2024 outbreak (as of August 2024):
- Has already recorded over 24,000 cases in the early stages[1]
- Is primarily driven by clade I, particularly the newly identified clade Ib variant[5]
- Has resulted in over 600 deaths, suggesting a significantly higher case fatality rate[1]

## Key Differences Affecting Forecast

Several critical factors distinguish the current outbreak:

1. **Viral Variant**: The predominant strain in the 2024 outbreak is clade Ib, which appears to have enhanced transmissibility compared to the clade IIb variant from the 2022-2023 outbreak[5]. This new variant was first detected in the DRC and has spread to multiple African nations and beyond[5].

2. **Case Growth Rate**: The 160% year-over-year increase in cases in the DRC region suggests a more rapid growth trajectory than the previous outbreak[4].

3. **Geographic Distribution**: While the 2022-2023 outbreak affected over 120 countries worldwide, the current outbreak is still primarily concentrated in Africa but has begun international spread[5].

4. **Higher Severity**: The current outbreak appears to have a higher case fatality rate, with over 600 deaths reported among the 24,000+ cases[1].

5. **Surveillance Limitations**: According to the European CDC, "The size of these outbreaks could be larger than reported due to under-ascertainment and under-reporting"[4]. This suggests the actual case count may be substantially higher than official figures.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several important limitations affect this forecast:

1. **Data Quality**: Significant under-reporting is likely occurring, especially in regions with limited healthcare infrastructure[4].

2. **Response Measures**: The effectiveness of vaccination campaigns, public health interventions, and international coordination will significantly impact case trajectories.

3. **Transmission Dynamics**: The full extent of human-to-human transmission mechanisms for the clade Ib variant is still being studied.

4. **Global Awareness**: The previous outbreak may have created greater global awareness, potentially leading to faster response measures.

5. **Competing Health Priorities**: Resources allocated to mpox response may be affected by other ongoing health crises.

## Forecast Considerations

Based on available information as of August 13, 2024, several factors suggest the 2024 outbreak could potentially exceed the 2022-2023 case count:

1. The rapid early growth rate (160% year-over-year increase)[4]
2. The enhanced transmissibility of the clade Ib variant[5]
3. The already substantial case count (24,000+) in the early stages[1]
4. Evidence of international spread beyond Africa[5]
5. Likely significant under-reporting in affected regions[4]

However, improved global preparedness following the previous outbreak and potential rapid deployment of vaccines and treatments could help contain spread more effectively than in 2022-2023.
