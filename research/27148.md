## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The 2022–2023 global mpox outbreak (Clade II) led to 66,387 confirmed cases worldwide between July 23, 2022, and May 10, 2023, with most cases outside Central Africa and relatively low mortality.
- In contrast, the 2024 outbreak, involving the more severe Clade I variant (notably Clade 1b), is centered in Central Africa, particularly the Democratic Republic of the Congo, with limited but notable exportation to other regions[2][4][5].
- As of September 2024, over 29,000 cases (confirmed or suspected) and more than 800 deaths have been reported globally, with the vast majority in Central Africa[2][5].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- The WHO declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on August 14, 2024, in response to the escalating Clade I outbreak[5].
- CDC and WHO have issued alerts regarding the increased severity and international spread potential of Clade I mpox[1][2].
- Active surveillance and containment measures are underway, but under-reporting remains a significant challenge, especially in resource-limited settings[2][5].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The World Health Organization (WHO) and European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) provide regular situation updates[2][3][4].
- The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) maintains a global mpox situation summary[1].
- Our World in Data compiles global mpox case counts, as referenced in the question description.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- Under-ascertainment and under-reporting in Central Africa likely mean the true burden of the 2024 outbreak is higher than reported[5].
- The majority of cases and fatalities remain in Central Africa as of September 2024. There is limited evidence, at present, of widespread, sustained transmission in regions outside of Africa—contrasting with the rapid global proliferation in 2022–2023[2][5].
- If the outbreak spreads beyond Central Africa and international case numbers climb rapidly, the total could surpass the 2022–2023 confirmed case count. However, as of mid-September, the trajectory remains well below the 66,387 threshold[2][5].

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

- Given the current trajectory, with approximately 29,000 confirmed or suspected cases globally less than two months into the PHEIC period, and considering substantial under-reporting, it is plausible that the 2024 outbreak could approach or exceed the 2022–2023 total if international transmission accelerates.
- However, as of September 2024, the majority of cases remain concentrated in Central Africa, and there is not yet clear evidence of the kind of global amplification seen in 2022–2023.
- Unless there is a significant increase in transmission outside Africa or a surge in confirmed case reporting from affected regions, the probability that the 2024 PHEIC period will exceed 66,387 confirmed cases by the close date remains moderate but not high.

**Summary Table: Outbreak Comparison**

| Outbreak Period         | Variant     | Confirmed Cases (to date) | Primary Affected Regions     | Case Fatality Rate |
|------------------------|-------------|---------------------------|------------------------------|--------------------|
| 2022–2023 PHEIC        | Clade II    | 66,387                    | Global (esp. Europe, Americas)| <1%                |
| 2024 PHEIC (as of Sep) | Clade I (1b)| ~29,000 (suspected/confirmed)| Central Africa, limited export | ~3%                |

**Conclusion:** As of mid-September 2024, the global confirmed case count for the 2024 mpox outbreak is substantially below the 2022–2023 total. The outbreak could surpass the previous total if international spread intensifies or reporting improves, but current trends suggest the probability of exceeding 66,387 confirmed cases remains moderate, with the primary driver being the potential for expanded transmission outside Central Africa[2][5].
