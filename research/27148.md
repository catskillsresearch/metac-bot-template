# Mpox Outbreak 2024: Forecast Analysis

The 2024 mpox outbreak presents a significant global health challenge with distinct characteristics from the 2022-2023 outbreak. This analysis examines available data as of August 13, 2024, to assess whether the current outbreak will exceed the previous one's 66,387 confirmed cases.

## Current Situation Assessment

### Key Metrics and Trends

As of September 2024, more than 29,000 mpox cases have been reported in the current outbreak, with over 800 fatalities, representing approximately a 3% fatality rate[4]. Most cases are concentrated in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, though the outbreak has spread to other regions[4]. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared this epidemic a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on August 14, 2024[4].

In 2024 alone, over 24,000 confirmed or suspected mpox cases due to both MPXV clade I and clade II have been reported, including over 600 deaths[2]. This rapid accumulation of cases in a relatively short period is concerning for potential widespread transmission.

### Variant Differences

A critical distinction in the current outbreak is the predominant variant. The 2024 outbreak primarily involves clade Ib mpox[4][5], whereas the 2022-2023 outbreak was primarily caused by clade II. Epidemiological data indicates that clade I has historically been associated with higher virulence and potentially more severe disease outcomes[5].

### Geographic Distribution

While the 2022-2023 outbreak had significant case numbers in North America and Europe, the current outbreak is primarily centered in Central Africa[4]. However, cases have been detected in multiple countries, suggesting potential for wider geographic spread. In countries like Burundi, these represent the first confirmed mpox cases ever identified in the nation[5].

## Comparative Analysis

### Case Trajectory

The current outbreak is showing concerning acceleration. With approximately 29,000 cases reported within the first month after PHEIC declaration, the trajectory suggests potential to exceed the previous outbreak's total. Importantly, experts believe the actual case numbers may be significantly higher due to "under-ascertainment and under-reporting"[4].

### Transmission Dynamics

The 2024 outbreak appears to have different transmission patterns compared to the 2022-2023 outbreak. While detailed transmission data is still emerging, the rapid case increase in diverse geographic regions suggests efficient spread mechanisms. In Burundi alone, confirmed cases have been reported from 26 of the 49 districts (53.1%)[5].

### Response Infrastructure

Current response efforts face significant challenges in affected regions where healthcare infrastructure is limited. The CDC reports that case data is "subject to change," indicating ongoing surveillance challenges[1]. This differs from the 2022-2023 outbreak, which benefited from robust surveillance systems in many affected countries.

## Forecast Considerations

### Factors Supporting Higher Case Counts

1. **Rapid initial spread**: The outbreak reached 29,000+ cases within approximately one month of PHEIC declaration
2. **Under-reporting**: Official figures likely underestimate actual case numbers
3. **Variant virulence**: Clade Ib may have different transmission dynamics than the previous outbreak's variant
4. **Healthcare access challenges**: Limited testing and treatment infrastructure in most affected regions

### Factors Supporting Lower Case Counts

1. **Heightened awareness**: Previous outbreak experience may improve response efficiency
2. **Geographic concentration**: Currently more limited geographic spread compared to 2022-2023
3. **Early PHEIC declaration**: May enable more rapid international response

### Limitations and Uncertainties

Current data has several limitations affecting forecast accuracy:
- Incomplete surveillance in affected regions
- Evolving understanding of clade Ib transmission dynamics
- Uncertain impact of intervention measures
- Limited genomic surveillance to track variant evolution

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on available information, the 2024 mpox outbreak shows significant potential to exceed the 2022-2023 outbreak in confirmed cases. The rapid case accumulation (29,000+ within approximately one month of PHEIC declaration), known under-reporting issues, and higher virulence of clade Ib suggest a concerning trajectory. If current trends continue, the outbreak could surpass the previous 66,387 confirmed cases within 3-4 months of PHEIC declaration.

However, this assessment carries substantial uncertainty due to data limitations, potential intervention effectiveness, and possible changes in transmission dynamics as the outbreak evolves.
