## Forecasting Saudi-Israeli Diplomatic Relations by September 30, 2024

### Key Historical Trends and Current Status
- **Historical Background**: Saudi Arabia and Israel have never had formal diplomatic relations, but there have been quiet diplomatic efforts and cooperation, especially in countering common threats like Iran[4][5].
- **Current Status**: The Biden administration has been pushing for Saudi Arabia to join the Abraham Accords or establish diplomatic relations with Israel, but Saudi Arabia insists on a two-state solution as a prerequisite[1][2].

### Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric
- **Two-State Solution Requirement**: Saudi Arabia has consistently emphasized that any normalization with Israel must be contingent on the recognition of an independent Palestinian state, which aligns with the 2002 Arab Peace Initiative[1][3].
- **Israeli Government's Position**: The current Israeli government, led by Prime Minister Netanyahu, has expressed opposition to a two-state solution, complicating efforts towards normalization[3].

### Authoritative Sources for Verification
- The White House and U.S. Secretary of State Tony Blinken have been involved in discussions to facilitate a U.S.-Saudi-Israel agreement, but the lack of progress on a two-state solution remains a significant hurdle[1][2].
- Reports from reputable sources like the Atlantic Council and the Carnegie Endowment provide insights into the ongoing negotiations and challenges[1][3].

### Limitations or Uncertainties in Measurement
- **Political Will**: The political will of both Saudi Arabia and Israel, along with U.S. diplomatic efforts, plays a crucial role in determining the likelihood of establishing diplomatic relations.
- **Regional Dynamics**: The ongoing conflict in Gaza and broader regional tensions can influence the timing and feasibility of such an agreement.

Given these factors, it seems unlikely that Saudi Arabia will establish diplomatic relations with Israel before September 30, 2024, primarily due to the unresolved issue of a two-state solution and Israel's current stance on it.
