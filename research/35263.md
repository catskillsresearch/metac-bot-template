## Key Trends and Current Status

- The latest available 40dB/El País poll (February 2025) puts Vox’s support among 18-24 year-olds at 27.4%, the highest of any party in this demographic and above its overall national average[2][4].
- Vox has experienced a steady increase in youth support since the 2023 general elections, outpacing traditional parties like PSOE and PP among young voters[4].
- This trend mirrors patterns observed in other major EU countries, where far-right or right-wing populist parties have gained significant ground among younger demographics: RN in France, FdI in Italy, and AfD in Germany all report similar or higher youth support[2].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- Vox’s rise is attributed in part to an aggressive, youth-targeted social media campaign and growing disenchantment with establishment parties, who have been affected by ongoing scandals and perceived ineffectiveness[3][4].
- No major policy announcements as of early 2025 suggest an imminent reversal of this youth trend; instead, generational polarization appears to be deepening in Spain, as in other European countries[4][2].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- 40dB/El País barometer surveys are the reference for youth voting intention in Spain and will determine the final assessment[2][4].
- Comparative data from pan-European studies and national polling agencies (e.g., Infratest Dimap, YouTrend) confirm the broader trend[2].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- The youth vote is more volatile than that of older demographics, with a large proportion of undecided/abstaining respondents (up to 34% in the latest poll)[2].
- The 27.4% figure is close to the threshold, so small swings could result in Vox falling below or rising above this mark by the end of 2025.
- If the final 2025 survey is published before October 1, 2025, the question is void per the resolution criteria.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the current trajectory, historical momentum, and comparative European context, there is a moderate-to-high probability (estimated 60-70%) that Vox will at least maintain or marginally surpass the 27% youth voting intention threshold by the end of 2025. However, the outcome is sensitive to late-breaking political developments and the inherent volatility of youth preferences.
