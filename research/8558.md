### 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- **Polygamy is illegal federally and in all 50 states** as of January 2022, with Utah as a partial exception: In March 2020, Utah decriminalized consensual polygamy, reducing it from a felony to a minor infraction, but still does not grant formal marriage recognition to polygamous unions[3][4].
- **Public support remains low**: Only 23% of Americans viewed polygamy as “morally acceptable” in 2022, far below the support levels for same-sex marriage at the time it began gaining nationwide traction[5].
- **No federal or state court has recognized polygamous marriage** as constitutionally protected. The Supreme Court's 2015 decision on same-sex marriage (Obergefell v. Hodges) was narrowly tailored to dyadic unions and explicitly distinguished polygamy[2].
- **Limited local recognition**: A 2022 New York housing court decision acknowledged the possibility of legal protection for polyamorous households in the context of tenancy rights, but this did not constitute formal marriage recognition[5]. Some Massachusetts cities have extended domestic partnership benefits to polyamorous groups, but these are not marriages and are not recognized outside those jurisdictions.

### 2. Recent Announcements and Policies

- **Utah’s legal reform (2020)**: Utah’s move to decriminalize, but not legalize, polygamy marks the most significant legislative change in decades[3].
- **Respect for Marriage Act (2022)**: This federal law codified protections for same-sex and interracial marriages but did not address or legalize polygamy. Drafting discussions revealed concern that the law might be interpreted to allow polygamy, but proponents clarified this was not the intent[1][5].
- **Judicial signals**: A 2022 New York judge suggested the law should evolve to recognize multi-partner relationships, but this remains an outlier and has not spurred broader legal change[5].

### 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- U.S. federal and state statutes on marriage and polygamy[1][4]
- Utah legislative records on decriminalization[3]
- Court rulings, including Obergefell v. Hodges and relevant state/local cases[2][5]
- Public opinion data from Gallup and other major polling firms[5]

### 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- **Public opinion could shift** over several decades, especially with generational change or cultural movements.
- **Legal strategies might evolve**, potentially resulting in new constitutional challenges, though none are currently underway at a scale comparable to same-sex marriage efforts.
- **Local policy experiments** may expand, but absent federal or state recognition, these are unlikely to satisfy the resolution criteria.
- **Potential conflation of polyamory and polygamy** in public and legal discourse may affect future legal developments, but as of 2022, marriage law remains strictly dyadic.

### Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the current legal, social, and political context—with virtually no momentum for national polygamy legalization, low public support, and only isolated local reforms—the probability that polygamy will be legal nationwide in the US by 2050 is low. An expert assessment, based on analogous social reforms, would place the probability well below 10% barring major unforeseen developments.
