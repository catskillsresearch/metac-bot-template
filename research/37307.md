# Will an Attempt Be Made to Fire Jerome Powell Before the End of His Term?

As of May 2025, the question of whether President Trump will attempt to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell before his term ends in May 2026 remains uncertain, but several key developments provide insight into this possibility.

## Current Status of Jerome Powell

Jerome Powell is currently serving his second term as Chair of the Federal Reserve Board, having been confirmed on May 12, 2022[2]. His current term runs through May 2026[1]. Powell was originally nominated by President Trump during his first administration in November 2017 and confirmed by the Senate in January 2018, assuming office on February 5, 2018[3].

## Recent Tensions Between Trump and Powell

The relationship between President Trump and Chair Powell has deteriorated significantly in recent months:

- On April 17, 2025, Trump publicly called for Powell's "termination" in a social media post, referring to him as "Too Late Jerome Powell" and stating that "Powell's termination cannot come fast enough!"[1]
- Trump criticized Powell for not lowering interest rates, despite falling oil prices and what Trump claimed were decreasing grocery prices (though official data from the Labor Department showed grocery prices actually rose in the previous month, with egg prices jumping nearly 6% between February and March)[1]

## Legal Framework for Removing a Fed Chair

The Federal Reserve is designed to operate independently from political pressure, allowing it to make unpopular but necessary decisions to fight inflation[1]. According to established precedent:

- Powell has insisted that the president does not have the authority to fire him except for "cause," meaning some form of misconduct[1]
- Current Supreme Court precedent supports this view of the Fed Chair's independence[1]

## Trump Administration's Approach to Independent Agencies

Despite the legal protections, there are signs the Trump administration may be willing to test these boundaries:

- The White House has signaled a willingness to challenge the standard protecting independent agency officials by firing board members of other independent agencies[1]
- Trump has nominated Fed governor Michelle Bowman for the vice chair post on March 17, 2025, following Michael Barr's resignation as vice chair effective February 28, 2025 (though Barr remains a Fed governor)[2]

## Powell's Response

Powell has attempted to navigate this difficult situation by:

- Trying to avoid antagonizing the president, often ducking questions about Trump's commentary[1]
- Remaining adamant that he intends to serve out the remainder of his term through May 2026[1]
- Noting that lawmakers from both parties have generally defended the Fed's ability to set interest rate policy without interference[1]
- Acknowledging the criticism with a touch of humor, stating, "We are blessed with a large number of amply-compensated critics"[1]

## Analysis of Potential Outcomes

The situation presents several possible scenarios:

1. **Attempted Firing**: Trump could formally attempt to remove Powell despite legal barriers, triggering a constitutional showdown over the independence of the Federal Reserve.

2. **Pressure Campaign**: The administration might continue a public pressure campaign hoping to influence Fed policy or force Powell's resignation without formally attempting to fire him.

3. **Legal Reinterpretation**: The administration could seek to reinterpret what constitutes "cause" for removal, potentially expanding its definition beyond the traditional understanding of misconduct.

4. **De-escalation**: As evidenced by some back-and-forth in Trump's public statements, the tension could potentially de-escalate if economic conditions change or political priorities shift.

The most recent FOMC press conference occurred on May 7, 2025[4], but the search results don't provide details about whether the tensions were addressed during this meeting.
