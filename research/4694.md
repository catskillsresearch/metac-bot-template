## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of 2020, real Gross World Product (GWP) was approximately $85.5 trillion in 2020 US dollars[2].
- GWP has grown steadily (with some fluctuations) for decades, though the COVID-19 pandemic caused a rare contraction in 2020[2].
- From 2010 to 2019, average annual real GWP growth was around 2.5–3.5%[2].
- David Roodman's "Modeling the Human Trajectory" fits historical GWP data with a stochastic process, suggesting a median "explosion" (i.e., extremely rapid growth, potentially infinite in finite time) around 2047, conditional on trends up to 2019.

## 2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- The COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 led to a rare global GDP decline, but recovery trends have resumed in subsequent years as economies reopened and adapted[2].
- No recent policy or global event as of June 2020 had fundamentally altered the long-run growth trajectory assumed by Roodman’s model, though the pandemic did introduce short-term uncertainty about global productivity, supply chains, and government debt levels.
- Major technological developments, such as artificial intelligence or energy breakthroughs, could affect long-term productivity, but as of mid-2020, such impacts remained speculative.

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- World Bank Data: Provides annual global GDP estimates and is widely used for international economic comparisons.
- Statista: Offers historical and projected global GDP values[2].
- IMF and United Nations: Source for cross-country and long-term economic forecasts.
- Roodman’s original report: For model methodology and detailed statistical reasoning.

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties in Measurement

- Measurement of GWP across all countries is subject to data quality, exchange rate adjustments, and differences in purchasing power.
- Long-term forecasts are highly sensitive to assumptions about technological change, demographic shifts, policy responses, and the ability to sustain past growth rates.
- Roodman’s model is internally consistent given historical data, but its implied "singularity" or "explosion" in GWP by 2047 is not universally accepted and could be seen as an artifact of fitting a particular functional form to past data.
- Conventional forecasts (e.g., by the IMF or World Bank) do not project GWP anywhere near infinity or even multiple orders of magnitude larger than current values by 2047.

## Probabilistic Assessment

- Standard economic growth projections (e.g., 2–3% annual real growth) would yield a 2047 GWP of roughly $175–250 trillion in 2020 US dollars, assuming compounding and no major disruptions.
- Roodman's model, if taken literally, implies a nontrivial probability that GWP could vastly exceed this, potentially by orders of magnitude, but also carries a large uncertainty and may be sensitive to structural breaks or limits to growth.
- Major risks (e.g., pandemics, wars, climate change) or breakthroughs (e.g., transformative AI) could push outcomes far from central projections.

## Adjusted Forecast

- **Median (Standard Growth):** $200 trillion (in 2020 US$) by 2047, consistent with historical compound growth.
- **Upper Bound (Explosion per Roodman):** Substantially higher, but probability mass on such outcomes is highly model-dependent and controversial.
- **Lower Bound:** $100 trillion, accounting for potential stagnation or major disruptions.
