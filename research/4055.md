# Forecasting Analysis: Will the first AGI be based on deep learning?

As of June 7, 2020, I'll analyze the available evidence regarding whether the first artificial general intelligence (AGI) will be based on deep learning principles.

## Current State of Deep Learning and AGI Research

Deep learning has emerged as a dominant paradigm in artificial intelligence research, particularly since the early 2010s. As defined in the Deep Learning Book, this approach enables computers to learn hierarchical concepts from experience, avoiding the need for explicit human-specified knowledge[3]. By 2020, deep learning has demonstrated remarkable capabilities in specific domains like image recognition, natural language processing, and game playing.

As of 2020, there are approximately 72 active AGI research and development projects across 37 countries[3]. These projects pursue various approaches, with deep learning being a significant but not exclusive methodology. The diversity of approaches reflects ongoing uncertainty about which path will ultimately lead to AGI.

## Expert Opinions on Deep Learning's Role in AGI

Expert opinions on whether deep learning will lead to AGI remain divided. Some researchers, like Paul Christiano, suggest that "prosaic AGI" based on deep learning principles is plausible. This approach would involve large neural networks replicating human cognition when coupled with mechanisms like memory, attention, and reinforcement learning[3].

However, other experts maintain that entirely new paradigms beyond current deep learning approaches will be necessary to achieve AGI. A significant contingent of researchers believes that while deep learning provides powerful tools, it lacks certain capabilities that may be essential for general intelligence, such as causal reasoning, common sense knowledge, and efficient transfer learning.

## Timeline Considerations

Expert surveys conducted prior to June 2020 suggest wide variation in AGI timelines, with median estimates ranging from 2040 to 2075[5]. These divergent timelines reflect different assumptions about which technological approaches will prove successful. Generally, those who believe deep learning will lead to AGI tend to predict earlier arrival dates, while those who anticipate the need for fundamentally new approaches predict later dates.

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on information available as of June 7, 2020, I estimate the probability that the first AGI will be based on deep learning (meeting the resolution criteria specified) at approximately 60-65%.

This assessment is based on several considerations:

1. Deep learning's continued dominance in AI research and increasing capabilities through 2020
2. The trend toward larger models with emergent capabilities not explicitly programmed
3. Substantial industry investment in scaling deep learning approaches
4. The success of hybrid systems that combine deep learning with other techniques

However, this estimate comes with significant uncertainty for several reasons:

1. The definition of AGI itself remains somewhat ambiguous
2. Unexpected breakthroughs in alternative approaches could shift the landscape
3. Deep learning may hit fundamental limitations that aren't yet apparent
4. The first AGI system will likely incorporate multiple approaches, making classification challenging

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors limit the precision of this forecast:

1. The binary framing of the question may not capture the likely hybrid nature of future AGI systems
2. Expert opinions on AGI approaches are highly variable and often influenced by researchers' own work
3. The resolution criteria rely on subjective expert assessments rather than objective measures
4. Historical precedent for forecasting transformative technologies suggests high uncertainty
