## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- In August 2024, the FDA rejected the first New Drug Application (NDA) for MDMA-assisted therapy for PTSD, citing concerns over trial methodology, safety, and risk of abuse, and signaling a rigorous, cautious approach to psychedelic approvals[2][3][5].
- Other psychedelics, such as psilocybin, LSD, and DMT, are advancing through clinical trials for mental health indications, but most programs are in Phase 2 or early Phase 3 as of early 2025, making NDA filings in 2025 possible but not guaranteed[4].
- The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) increased the 2025 production quota for DMT and other psychedelics, explicitly to support research and development for potential FDA-approved drugs, reflecting some federal support for the field[1].

## Recent Announcements and Policy Shifts

- The DEA’s December 2024 move to raise the DMT production quota for 2025, in response to requests from manufacturers and researchers, is a clear indicator that drug development efforts for DMT and possibly other psychedelics are intensifying[1].
- No public announcements have been made as of May 2025 regarding imminent NDA or Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) filings for psychedelics, nor has the DEA announced plans to reschedule any psychedelics for psychiatric indications in 2025.

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- FDA regulatory announcements and press releases
- DEA Federal Register notices regarding production quotas and scheduling
- Clinical trial registries tracking the progress of psychedelic drugs in development[1][2][3][4][5].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- The FDA’s heightened caution after the MDMA rejection may discourage or delay near-term NDA or EUA filings for psychedelics, unless applicants can address regulatory concerns and provide robust data[3][5].
- While the DEA’s increased production quota is a positive sign, it primarily facilitates research and does not guarantee a regulatory filing or rescheduling event in 2025[1].
- Clinical trial completion and data quality remain unpredictable, and filings may be delayed by logistical, financial, or regulatory hurdles.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the heightened regulatory bar set by the FDA after the MDMA decision, the early-to-mid stage of most other psychedelic trials, and the absence (as of May 2025) of public evidence of imminent NDA/EUA filings or DEA rescheduling, the likelihood that a qualifying regulatory step (NDA/EUA filing or DEA rescheduling) for a psychedelic will occur in the US in 2025 appears moderate but below 50%. However, the increased research activity, especially for DMT and psilocybin, and the DEA’s supportive administrative actions, keep the probability non-negligible—likely in the 20–40% range.
