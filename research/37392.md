# U.S. State GDP Growth Forecast Analysis: Q1 2025

As of May 29, 2025, I'm analyzing available data to forecast which state among New York, Texas, and Virginia will show the highest real GDP growth rate for Q1 2025. This analysis is constrained by currently available information.

## Current Economic Context

The U.S. economy experienced a contraction in Q1 2025, with real GDP decreasing at an annual rate of 0.3% according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) advance estimate released on April 30, 2025[1]. This represents a significant shift from previous quarters, as the economy had shown growth in Q4 2024 with 48 states and the District of Columbia experiencing positive GDP changes[4].

The national economic slowdown appears to be affecting states differently based on their economic composition and exposure to various risk factors:

- **Middle Atlantic Region** (including New York): Expected to see GDP growth ease to 1.3% for 2025 as interest rates remain steady[5]. New York specifically has been mentioned in the description as ranking "among slowest economies," suggesting continued challenges.

- **Texas**: The description references deteriorating economic outlook related to "tariff-related uncertainty," which could significantly impact this export-heavy state.

- **Virginia**: The description explicitly mentions a "lagging forecast" and "shrinking GDP," citing federal assessments, suggesting particular weakness in this state's economy.

## Forecast Challenges and Limitations

Several factors complicate this forecast:

1. The BEA's official Q1 2025 state-by-state GDP figures have not yet been released in the "Gross Domestic Product by State and Personal Income by State, 1st Quarter 2025" report that will ultimately resolve this question.

2. Regional forecasts (like the 1.3% for the Middle Atlantic region) cover the entire year 2025, not specifically Q1, and don't break down individual state performance[5].

3. The national GDP contraction of 0.3% in Q1 2025[1] suggests most states likely experienced slow or negative growth, but the distribution across states remains unclear.

4. The transition from Q4 2024's positive growth (with rates up to 5.1% in some states)[4] to Q1 2025's overall contraction indicates a rapidly changing economic environment.

## Assessment

Based on limited available information, I can offer the following probabilistic assessment:

- **New York State**: As part of the Middle Atlantic region with projected 1.3% growth for 2025[5], and described as "among slowest economies," New York likely experienced below-average growth in Q1 2025. The state's large financial services sector may have provided some buffer against the national contraction.

- **Texas**: The referenced tariff-related uncertainty suggests particular vulnerability for Texas's export-oriented economy. However, the state's diverse economic base including energy, technology, and manufacturing may have provided some resilience.

- **Virginia**: The description specifically references "shrinking GDP" in connection with federal assessments, suggesting Virginia may have experienced negative growth in Q1 2025, potentially performing worse than the other two states.

Without specific state-level Q1 2025 data, this assessment remains highly uncertain. The official resolution will depend on the BEA's forthcoming "Gross Domestic Product by State" report for Q1 2025.

## Measurement Considerations

- The BEA releases state GDP data with a greater lag than national figures, and initial estimates are subject to significant revisions.
- State GDP growth rates will be reported at the precision presented by the BEA, with potential rounding effects that could result in apparent ties.
- Regional economic patterns don't always translate directly to individual state performance, as states within regions can experience divergent economic conditions.
