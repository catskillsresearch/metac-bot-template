# Forecasting the 2024 Warhammer 40,000 World Team Championship

Based on the available information as of July 25, 2024, there is limited data to make a comprehensive forecast about whether USA, Sweden, England, or France will win the 2024 Warhammer 40,000 World Team Championship (WTC).

## Current Status and Available Information

The 2024 World Team Championship is scheduled to take place in Mechelen, Belgium from August 8th to 11th, with 40 national teams competing. Among the participants are first-time competitors including Andorra, China, Mexico, Singapore/Thailand, and South Korea[1].

Team lists for the 2024 WTC have been published, showing the factions and army compositions that teams will be fielding. For example, Team Andorra includes a player using the Leagues of Votann faction with a 2000-point army featuring units such as an Einhyr Champion with Wayfarer's Grace enhancement and a KÃ¢hl with Grim Demeanour enhancement[1].

## Limitations in Available Data

The search results do not provide specific information about:

1. The current roster or army compositions for Team USA, Sweden, England, or France
2. Historical performance of these teams in previous WTC events
3. Expert predictions or analysis for the 2024 WTC
4. Current meta-game advantages that might favor certain factions being used by these teams

## Other Warhammer Competitive Events in 2024

While not directly related to the WTC, it's worth noting that 2024 features numerous competitive Warhammer 40,000 events, including:

- The Champions Cup (September 20-22, 2024) in Dallas, Texas, which is described as "the largest 8 person team event to take place in the USA"[4]
- The World Championships of Warhammer, with qualifying events including the US Open series, the American Team Championships, and various Grand Tournaments[5]

## Conclusion

Without specific information about the current competitive standing, roster strength, or recent performance of Teams USA, Sweden, England, and France, it is not possible to make an evidence-based forecast about their chances of winning the 2024 WTC. The tournament's format, involving seeding groups, a group stage, and Swiss-format games, adds complexity to any prediction.

As the tournament date approaches, more information may become available through official WTC channels that could provide better insights into the relative strengths of these teams.
