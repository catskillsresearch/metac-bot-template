### 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- **Historical world GDP growth rates** have averaged about 4.3% annually in recent decades, with rare short-term spikes during postwar reconstruction or rapid industrialization, but never approaching 30% per year[1].
- **Robin Hanson's 2001 model** predicts that upon the development of machine intelligence capable of substituting for human labor, the annual growth rate of world GDP could jump to 45%, implying a doubling every 18 months—far above historical precedent[1].
- **No observed year in modern history** has seen world GDP grow by 30% or more; this figure is an order of magnitude higher than the fastest recorded peacetime expansions[1][5].

### 2. Key Differences Affecting the Forecast

- **Substitution of human labor**: Hanson's model predicts explosive growth when machines can fully substitute for humans, creating a vast new "population" of productive agents[1][2].
- **Complementary resource constraints**: Later economic analyses note that growth could be bottlenecked by non-accumulable resources like land or regulatory/political constraints, dampening the theoretical growth explosion[4].
- **Transition uncertainty**: The exact timing and pace of the transition to HLAI, as well as the degree to which AI systems can substitute for all forms of labor and decision-making, are uncertain[4][5].
- **Measurement challenges**: Standard GDP accounting may not fully capture the value of output in a post-HLAI world, potentially under- or overestimating real growth[5].

### 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The **World Bank** is the standard authority for annual world GDP growth figures, as required by the resolution criteria.
- Hanson's original paper provides the foundational reference for the explosive growth scenario[1].
- Recent reviews by economic researchers (e.g., Trammell & Korinek, Accenture) offer updated perspectives on the plausibility and potential limits of such growth rates[4][5].

### 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- **GDP measurement limitations**: Rapid technological shifts might challenge traditional economic accounting frameworks, introducing uncertainty into published figures.
- **Unmodeled economic and political frictions**: Transition costs, regulatory reactions, or social upheaval could limit realized growth.
- **Physical and environmental constraints**: Bottlenecks in energy, raw materials, or environmental limits could prevent sustained hyper-growth.
- **Ambiguity in defining "human-level AI"**: The resolution of when HLAI is achieved may itself be subject to debate.

### Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the unprecedented nature of 30%+ annual world GDP growth and the fact that even optimistic recent analyses tend to view Hanson's scenario as a theoretical upper bound, the probability of observing at least one year with such growth in the 15 years following the advent of HLAI is **significantly higher than under historical trends, but subject to substantial uncertainty**. If machine intelligence achieves full substitution for human labor and capital, and if no major bottlenecks intervene, Hanson's prediction suggests a high probability (>50%) of at least one such year[1]. However, accounting for real-world frictions and measurement challenges, a **probability in the range of 30–60%** appears plausible as of early 2020, with the lower end reflecting the possibility of significant limiting factors[4][5].
