## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The average American workweek has steadily declined over the past 150 years: 62 hours/week in 1870, 40.25 by 2000, and 34.4 hours/week in July 2019 (for US private nonfarm payrolls)[2].
- Most of the decline occurred before the 1980s; since then, the average workweek has plateaued near 34–35 hours[4].
- The plateau is attributed to cultural, economic, and institutional factors—such as labor laws, union influence, and employer practices—that have stabilized the standard full-time workweek[4].

## Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Metric

- There are ongoing discussions and pilot programs for shorter workweeks (e.g., four-day workweek, six-hour workday), but these are not yet widespread in the US labor market as of 2019.
- No major federal policy changes regarding standard workweek length have been enacted since the 40-hour week was established.
- Technological change is accelerating: McKinsey estimates that by 2030, up to 30% of current work hours in the US could be automated, particularly in routine, lower-wage occupations[5].
- The COVID-19 pandemic (post-2019) accelerated occupational shifts and remote work, but as of 2019 these impacts were not yet evident[5].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) tracks and publishes average weekly hours for private nonfarm payrolls[1].
- Forecasting platforms (e.g., Metaculus) aggregate expert and community predictions on future workweek averages[2].
- Economic research (e.g., McKinsey, CBO) provides insight into structural trends and technology impacts[3][5].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- The workweek average reflects both full-time and part-time employees, so shifts in employment composition affect the metric.
- Technological forecasts are uncertain: while automation could reduce hours in some sectors, other sectors may maintain or even increase hours due to labor shortages or demand shifts[5].
- Cultural and policy inertia in the US has historically slowed changes to workweek norms[4].
- Measurement methods or definitions by statistical agencies could change over time.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Based on the historical trend, ongoing technological changes, and current policy context as of 2019, the most likely outcome for January 2030 is a modest reduction in average weekly hours—from 34.4 hours/week in 2019 to approximately 31–33 hours/week in 2030. This aligns with community forecasts and recent analyses[2][5].

- Best estimate (median): ~32 hours/week.
- 50% confidence interval: 31–33 hours/week.
- Lower bound (10th percentile): ~29 hours/week (if major automation/part-time shift).
- Upper bound (90th percentile): ~34 hours/week (if trends stall further).
