# Forecasting: Will Google Maps display Gulf of America instead of Gulf of Mexico before April 1, 2025?

Based on information available as of February 9, 2025, here is an analysis to help forecast whether Google Maps will display "Gulf of America" instead of "Gulf of Mexico" before April 1, 2025.

## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

As of late January 2025, Google Maps still displayed the body of water west of Florida as the "Gulf of Mexico." However, Google has announced plans to rename it to "Gulf of America" following a directive from the Trump administration[1]. This represents a significant change in geographic naming conventions for a major body of water that has historically been known as the Gulf of Mexico.

The current status as of January 27, 2025, is that Google is waiting for the official American naming database, the Geographic Names Information System (GNIS), to be updated before implementing this change in Google Maps[1]. Despite the Interior Department announcing the name changes as official, the GNIS had not yet been updated as of late January 2025[1].

## Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

The most significant recent announcement is Google's statement that they will rename the Gulf of Mexico to "Gulf of America" in their Maps application[1]. This change was ordered by the Trump administration and officially announced by the Interior Department[1].

Important policy details include:
- The name change will not be universal across all Google Maps users globally
- Mexican users will continue to see "Gulf of Mexico" in their Google Maps application[1]
- Users in other countries will see both names (Gulf of America and Gulf of Mexico) displayed side by side[1]
- Google has explicitly stated they are waiting for the GNIS update before implementing the change[1]

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

The primary source for this information is Google's own announcement regarding the planned name change. Additionally, the Geographic Names Information System (GNIS) maintained by the U.S. government serves as the official database that Google is waiting to be updated before implementing the change[1].

The Interior Department's announcement regarding the official name changes provides further verification of this policy shift[1].

## Limitations or Uncertainties in Measurement

Several uncertainties exist regarding whether this change will occur before April 1, 2025:

1. The timeline for the GNIS database update is unclear. As of January 27, 2025, the update had not yet occurred despite the Interior Department's official announcement[1].

2. Google has not provided a specific timeline for implementation after the GNIS update occurs.

3. There could be technical or political delays in implementing such a significant change to a major geographic feature.

4. The implementation may be gradual or phased, potentially affecting different regions or platforms at different times.

5. The resolution criteria specify that Google Maps must display "Gulf of America" rather than "Gulf of Mexico" before April 1, 2025, but the search results indicate that some users (particularly in Mexico) will continue to see "Gulf of Mexico"[1].

Based on the available information, Google has committed to making this change following the GNIS update, but whether this will occur before April 1, 2025 (approximately two months after the January 27 announcement) remains uncertain and depends on government database update timelines and Google's implementation speed.
