### Key Factual Information as of July 16, 2024

- **Debate Scheduling and Announcements:**  
  ABC News has officially announced it will host the second and final 2024 presidential debate on Tuesday, September 10, 2024. The debate is set to feature President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump, with David Muir and Linsey Davis as moderators. The event will be broadcast on ABC, ABC News Live, and Hulu[2][4][5].

- **Candidate Participation:**  
  Both Biden and Trump have agreed to participate in this debate, as indicated by their campaigns' joint announcement of the new debate schedule, which bypasses the traditional Commission on Presidential Debates. The first debate, hosted by CNN, took place on June 27, 2024, with both candidates present[3][5].

- **Debate Criteria:**  
  ABC News has outlined participation criteria: candidates must poll at least 15% in four national polls, appear on enough state ballots to reach 270 electoral votes, and agree to the debate rules. As of the cutoff, both Biden and Trump are expected to meet these requirements[4].

- **Recent Developments and Uncertainties:**  
  The first debate was widely viewed as a poor performance for Biden, leading to speculation about his future participation. However, as of July 16, 2024, there is no official indication that either candidate has withdrawn or that the debate has been canceled or rescheduled[4][5].

- **Historical Trends:**  
  It is common for presidential debates to be scheduled and then sometimes altered due to campaign strategy or unforeseen events. However, both major party nominees have a strong precedent of participating in at least two debates in recent cycles.

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- The debate is scheduled, but not guaranteed. Unforeseen events (such as a candidate withdrawing, health issues, or campaign strategy changes) could still lead to cancellation or rescheduling.
- Final details regarding rules, location, and format are pending, which could influence participation or logistics[4].

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- ABC News official press releases and major news outlets (Time, NBC, Texas Tribune) confirm the scheduling and expected participation[1][2][3][4][5].
