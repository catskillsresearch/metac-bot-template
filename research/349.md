### 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- **Historical Proposals:** Human Mars missions have been proposed since at least the 1950s (e.g., von Braun’s Marsprojekt), but none have come close to execution. Historically, such missions have always been projected for 20–30 years in the future, with timelines repeatedly slipping[3].
- **Historical Success Rates:** Robotic Mars missions have a failure rate exceeding 50%. Only NASA has successfully landed and operated spacecraft on Mars for significant durations[5].
- **State of Industry, 2016:** No private company or national space agency had concrete, funded plans for a human Mars landing within the next decade as of 2016.

### 2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- **SpaceX’s 2016 Plan:** Elon Musk unveiled the “Interplanetary Transport System” (ITS), aiming for a fully reusable rocket and spaceship, orbital refueling, and in-situ resource utilization on Mars. SpaceX envisioned potentially launching a crewed mission as early as 2024, with a landing in 2025 if “lucky and things go according to plan”[3].
- **Uncrewed Precursor Mission:** SpaceX announced plans to send the “Red Dragon” capsule to Mars in 2018, with NASA’s technical support (no crew), to demonstrate critical entry and landing technologies[5].
- **Funding Requirements:** Musk acknowledged that the plan would require billions of dollars and likely government support, with the technical development cost for the new system estimated at around $10 billion[4].
- **Launch Windows:** Mars launch windows occur roughly every 26 months, offering limited opportunities for deep-space flights[3].

### 3. Key Differences Affecting the Forecast

| Factor                        | Reference Cases (e.g., NASA)      | SpaceX 2016 Plan                 | Impact on Forecast                    |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Timeline Aggressiveness       | 20–30 years out, often delayed    | As soon as 2024–2025             | SpaceX plan is much more aggressive   |
| Funding                       | Large, government-funded, stable  | Relies on private + hoped-for govt| Funding risk higher for SpaceX        |
| Technical Readiness           | Incremental, proven approach      | Simultaneous leap in many areas   | Higher technical risk for SpaceX      |
| Reusability                   | Partial (some ongoing work)       | Full reusability essential        | Unprecedented for super-heavy rockets |
| In-situ Resource Utilization  | Long-term goal                    | Required for return even in v1    | Adds technical complexity             |
| Past Mars Human Mission Rate  | 0                                 | 0                                 | No precedent for success              |

### 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- **Technical Risk:** Each component (large reusable boosters, orbital refueling, entry/landing, life support) is individually complex and unproven at required scale[1][3][4].
- **Funding and Support:** The plan’s viability depends on sustained funding and potential government partnership, neither secured in 2016[3][4].
- **Schedule Risk:** Historically, ambitious new spaceflight projects face multi-year delays.
- **Regulatory and Safety Concerns:** Human spaceflight beyond low-Earth orbit has not been attempted since Apollo 17 (1972); regulatory hurdles and human-rating requirements add further risk.
- **Mars Mission Success Rates:** The high failure rate of robotic Mars landings underscores the challenge[5].

### 5. Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given:
- The unprecedented technical, financial, and organizational hurdles
- Aggressive but as-yet-unproven schedule
- Historical slippage and failure rates in both human and robotic Mars missions

**A reasonable, expert-adjusted probability as of October 2016 is that SpaceX will land people on Mars before 2030 is low—likely below 20–25%.** The probability could rise if early uncrewed demonstrators succeed and funding materializes rapidly, but as of the information available in 2016, the forecast remains pessimistic relative to the public timeline.
