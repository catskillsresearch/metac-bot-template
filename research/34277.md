## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Mike Johnson was reelected as Speaker of the US House of Representatives on January 3, 2025, at the opening of the 119th Congress. The vote was extremely close, with Johnson initially appearing to fall short before two Republican holdouts switched their votes after discussions with Johnson and President-elect Donald Trump, giving him the majority needed to retain the gavel[1][4][5].
- Johnson's leadership has been marked by internal GOP divisions, particularly with hard-right members dissatisfied with his handling of government spending and other issues. Despite this, he managed to secure enough support to remain Speaker, largely due to last-minute negotiations and Trump's endorsement[1][4][5].

## Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- The most recent and relevant event is Johnson's narrow victory in the Speaker election at the start of the 119th Congress. This was a high-stakes, public test of his leadership, and he survived it, albeit with clear signs of ongoing party discord[1][4][5].
- There have been no official announcements or credible reports as of January 31, 2025, indicating that Johnson is facing an imminent ouster or that a motion to vacate the chair is actively being pursued.

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- CBS News, ABC News, and OPB all reported on Johnson's reelection and the political drama surrounding it, confirming his status as Speaker as of early January 2025[1][4][5].
- The official Speaker of the House website and Congress.gov list Mike Johnson as the current Speaker, with no indication of a change in leadership as of the cutoff date[2][3].

## Limitations or Uncertainties in Measurement

- While Johnson survived the most recent challenge to his leadership, the narrow margin and visible party divisions suggest his position is not entirely secure. The possibility of future challenges, especially from dissatisfied members of his own party, cannot be ruled out.
- The information available only covers events up to January 31, 2025. Any developments after this date are not included in this assessment.

## Summary

As of January 31, 2025, Mike Johnson remains Speaker of the US House of Representatives. He narrowly survived a significant leadership challenge at the start of the 119th Congress, but internal party tensions persist. There is no factual basis as of the cutoff date to conclude that he will cease to be Speaker before April 1, 2025, though the risk of future challenges remains due to ongoing GOP divisions[1][4][5].
