Based on the latest available information as of May 12, 2025, I'll provide an assessment of whether Russia will repel Ukrainian forces from the Kursk Region before June 30, 2025.

## Current Situation Assessment

As of May 2025, the situation in Russia's Kursk region has dramatically shifted in Russia's favor. According to Russian military claims from a recent meeting between President Putin and Chief of General Staff Valery Gerasimov, Russian forces have allegedly liberated "the last settlement in the Kursk region, the village of Gornal" from Ukrainian forces[3]. While Ukrainian officials did not immediately confirm this claim, with Ukraine's General Staff maintaining that its forces continued to hold positions in the Kursk sector, the overall trajectory shows a significant Russian advance[3].

More reliable independent assessments from late April 2025 indicated that Ukrainian forces were already in the final stages of withdrawing from Kursk, controlling only approximately 5 square miles of Russian territory in the region[4]. This represents a dramatic reduction from the reported peak of Ukraine's incursion in August 2024, when Ukrainian forces had claimed control of approximately 1,250 square kilometers (483 square miles) of Russian territory.

## Historical Context and Operational Trends

The Ukrainian incursion into Kursk began in August 2024 and continued through March 2025, displacing approximately 112,000 Russian civilians from the region[4]. This operation represented Ukraine's most significant offensive into Russian territory during the war. However, by April 2025, the situation had fundamentally changed:

1. **Russian Counteroffensive Success**: Russia has systematically reclaimed territory in Kursk while simultaneously maintaining pressure on other fronts in Ukraine.

2. **Shift to Offensive Operations**: Russian forces that were dedicated to reclaiming Kursk have now begun advancing into Ukrainian territory, specifically moving toward the Ukrainian village of Yunakivka[4].

3. **Strategic Reorientation**: Recent statements by Russian President Putin on May 11, 2025, calling for renewed bilateral negotiations based on the 2022 Istanbul protocols, suggest Russia may be positioning itself for diplomatic engagement from a strengthened military position[1].

## Military Balance Assessment

The current military balance strongly favors Russian forces in the Kursk region:

1. **Force Correlation**: Independent military analysts have noted that Russia has successfully deployed superior numbers to the Kursk front, effectively countering Ukraine's initial advantage of surprise.

2. **Equipment Losses**: Data from military monitoring groups shows that Ukraine has been losing armored vehicles at a faster rate than Russia in 2025. Between January and April 2025, Ukraine's losses of tanks and armored vehicles increased by 19% (from 3,685 to 4,397), while Russia's increased by only 9% (from 11,462 to 12,530)[4]. This asymmetric attrition rate has likely impacted Ukraine's ability to maintain its positions in Kursk.

3. **Multiple Front Pressure**: Russia is simultaneously expanding operations in northeastern Ukraine's Sumy region, which borders Kursk, putting additional pressure on Ukrainian forces in the area[2].

## Forecast Analysis

Based on the available evidence, there is a very high probability (approximately 95-98%) that Russia will have completely repelled Ukrainian forces from the Kursk Region before June 30, 2025. This assessment is based on:

1. Russian claims that they have already fully liberated Kursk (though these remain unverified by independent sources)[3].

2. Verified reporting from late April 2025 showing Ukraine controlling only 5 square miles of territory in Kursk, with forces actively withdrawing[4].

3. Russia's ongoing offensive momentum, including operations expanding beyond Kursk into Ukrainian territory[4].

4. The approaching "summer offensive" mentioned in recent military analyses, which suggests Russia is preparing for even larger-scale operations in the coming weeks[2].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors could potentially affect this assessment:

1. **Information Verification**: Russian claims of complete liberation of Kursk have not been independently verified, and Ukrainian sources have disputed these claims[3].

2. **Potential Ukrainian Counter-moves**: While unlikely given current force dispositions, Ukraine could theoretically attempt another limited incursion into Russian territory as a diversionary tactic.

3. **Diplomatic Developments**: Putin's recent call for negotiations based on the Istanbul protocols could potentially lead to a temporary ceasefire, though this would likely formalize rather than reverse Russia's territorial gains in Kursk[1].

Despite these uncertainties, the overwhelming evidence points to Russia having either already repelled Ukrainian forces from Kursk or being on track to do so well before the June 30, 2025 deadline.
