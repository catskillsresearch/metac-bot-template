# Assessment of Russian Forces Repelling Ukrainian Forces from Kursk Oblast

As of May 25, 2025, I'm analyzing the likelihood that Russia will completely repel Ukrainian forces from the Kursk Region before June 30, 2025, based on current military developments and historical patterns.

## Current Situation Analysis

Russia has already made significant progress in reclaiming territory in Kursk Oblast previously held by Ukrainian forces. As of May 24, 2025, what remains of a 50,000-strong Russian force that was involved in retaking areas of Russia's Kursk Oblast has repositioned itself near Ukraine's Kharkiv region[3]. This redeployment suggests Russia has secured substantial portions of Kursk Oblast, allowing it to redirect forces toward potential operations against Kharkiv.

The Ukrainian incursion into Kursk began in August 2024, with battles reported in areas like Olgovka, Korenevo, and Malaya Loknya[2]. By April 2025, the incursion had resulted in approximately 112,000 Russians being displaced from the Kursk region[4]. This indicates the significant scale of Ukraine's operation, which lasted from August 2024 through at least March 2025.

## Recent Military Developments

As of May 19, 2025 (six days ago), both Ukrainian and Russian forces have made recent advances in Kursk Oblast, indicating that fighting continues in the region with both sides achieving tactical successes[1]. This suggests that while Russia has regained control over most of the territory previously held by Ukraine in Kursk Oblast[2], complete expulsion of Ukrainian forces has not yet been achieved.

The Russian Ministry of Defense had previously claimed they had stopped Ukrainian advances in Kursk Oblast, and Russian authorities introduced a "counter-terrorist operation" regime in the region[2]. These measures appear to have been effective, as Russia has since regained control over most Ukrainian-held territory in Kursk.

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on the available information, I assess that Russia is likely to completely repel Ukrainian forces from the Kursk Region before June 30, 2025, with approximately 75-80% probability. This assessment is based on:

1. The significant momentum Russia has already achieved in reclaiming territory, with most of the previously Ukrainian-held areas already back under Russian control[2].

2. The redeployment of Russian forces toward Kharkiv suggests confidence in their control of the Kursk situation, allowing them to shift military focus[3].

3. The timeframe of approximately 5 weeks (from current date to June 30) provides sufficient time for Russia to complete operations against remaining Ukrainian positions, given their current rate of progress.

4. Russia has demonstrated the capability to mobilize substantial forces for this operation, with reports indicating a 50,000-strong force was involved[3].

## Key Uncertainties

Several factors could affect this forecast:

1. Ukrainian forces may have established well-fortified defensive positions in their remaining territory, which could slow Russian advances.

2. Weather conditions or seasonal factors might impact military operations.

3. Potential shifts in international support or diplomatic developments could influence both sides' military strategies.

4. The exact current extent of Ukrainian-controlled territory in Kursk is not precisely specified in available information.

Given the recent trajectory of Russian advances and their reclamation of most previously Ukrainian-held territory in Kursk Oblast, combined with the redeployment of forces toward other objectives, Russia appears well-positioned to achieve complete control of Kursk Oblast within the specified timeframe.
