## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Mifepristone has been approved and widely used for medical abortion in the US for over 25 years, regarded as safe and effective[1].
- It is currently legal and prescribed for abortion nationwide, with roughly two-thirds of US abortions using medication protocols that include mifepristone[4][5].
- Previous legal and legislative efforts to restrict or ban mifepristone have, as of January 2025, been unsuccessful at the federal level, most notably with the Supreme Court's 2024 reversal of an injunction that would have suspended its approval.

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- In May 2025, HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. ordered the FDA to review mifepristone regulations, citing a recent, controversial analysis promoted by anti-abortion groups. This review is widely expected to consider new restrictions, potentially including bans on telemedicine provision, return to in-person dispensing, and narrowing of prescribing windows[1][5].
- Project 2025 and aligned policy proposals—endorsed by influential Republican groups—call for reinstating and expanding federal restrictions on mifepristone, possibly invoking the Comstock Act to criminalize mailing abortion pills nationwide[2][3].
- These reviews and policy proposals have not yet resulted in new rules or laws, but they signal a shift toward possible federal action to restrict access.

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Statements and policies announced by the Department of Health and Human Services and FDA[1][5].
- Project 2025 proposals and summaries by policy groups[2][3].
- Data on US medication abortion rates and mifepristone use[4].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- The FDA review process may take months, and any new restrictions could be delayed or blocked by legal challenges.
- A change in political control (e.g., new presidential administration or Congress in late 2025) could rapidly increase the likelihood of a ban or significant restriction.
- The impact of Project 2025 and allied efforts depends on both regulatory and legislative developments, as well as potential court interventions.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

- As of January 2025, the probability that mifepristone prescribing for abortion will become illegal or significantly restricted in every US state before January 1, 2026, is elevated but not yet probable—estimated at 25–40%.
- This reflects ongoing regulatory review, strong political pressure for restrictions, and the possibility of swift policy changes, but also accounts for procedural delays and probable legal challenges that could prevent restrictions from taking effect nationwide within the timeframe.
