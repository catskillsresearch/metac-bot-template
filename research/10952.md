## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Anti-miscegenation laws were widespread in the US until the Supreme Court struck them down in Loving v. Virginia (1967), finding bans on inter-racial marriage unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment[2][5].
- As of May 2022, no US state had an active ban or enforcement of a ban on inter-racial marriage; all such laws were unenforceable after Loving, though some remained on the books in various states until later repealed[2].
- The leaked Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization draft (May 2022) signaled the Supreme Court’s willingness to overturn longstanding precedent (Roe v. Wade), raising concerns that other precedents relying on similar privacy and liberty doctrines (including Loving) could be at risk[5].

## 2. Recent Announcements and Policies

- In response to concerns about the security of marriage rights, Congress passed the Respect for Marriage Act (RMFA) in December 2022[1][3][4]. This law:
  - Provides statutory federal recognition for both same-sex and inter-racial marriages[1][3][4].
  - Requires states to recognize marriages validly performed in other states, including those of interracial couples[1][4].
  - Empowers the Department of Justice to act against any state official refusing to recognize such marriages[1][4].
- The RMFA does not compel states to perform all types of marriages, but it ensures recognition and legal equality for inter-racial marriages performed elsewhere[4].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The Respect for Marriage Act (H.R. 8404) text and summary (US Congress)[1]
- Human Rights Watch and ACLU commentary on federal marriage protections[3][5]
- Legal analysis from Ogletree Deakins and other law commentators on the scope and impact of RMFA[4]

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- While the Dobbs draft opinion and subsequent decision overturned Roe, the majority opinion stated that it did not cast doubt on precedents unrelated to abortion. However, concurring opinions and legal commentators noted that precedents like Loving, though rooted in similar constitutional principles, could be considered vulnerable by future courts[5].
- Political, legal, and cultural barriers to reinstating anti-miscegenation laws are immense. Any state attempt to ban inter-racial marriage would face immediate federal legal challenge under the RMFA and the existing Supreme Court precedent of Loving.
- The RMFA creates a strong statutory backstop: even if Loving were overturned, states would still be federally required to recognize inter-racial marriages performed elsewhere, and the DOJ could intervene[1][4].
- There is no evidence, as of May 2022 or through 2022, of any state legislature introducing or seriously considering a ban on inter-racial marriage.

## Key Differences Affecting the Forecast

- In 1967, there were active state bans and no federal statutory protection. In 2022-2025, there is both a Supreme Court precedent (*Loving*) and explicit federal statutory protection via the RMFA[1][3][4].
- The political and social climate is vastly more supportive of inter-racial marriage than in the past.
- The legal infrastructure (federal civil rights protections, DOJ enforcement powers) is now robust against such discrimination.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the above, the probability that inter-racial marriage will be banned and enforced in any US state by 2030 is **extremely low**—effectively near zero—barring an unprecedented constitutional crisis, simultaneous Supreme Court reversals, and a dramatic shift in federal and state politics. The combined presence of the Loving precedent and the Respect for Marriage Act makes the re-imposition and enforcement of such a ban extraordinarily unlikely.
