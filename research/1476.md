## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Since 1960, NASA has proposed over a dozen crewed Mars mission concepts, but none have materialized due to funding, technical, and political constraints.
- As of 2018, NASA had successfully landed multiple robotic spacecraft on Mars, most recently the InSight lander on November 26, 2018, to study the planet’s interior[2][4][5]. These robotic missions are described as precursors to eventual human exploration.
- NASA’s “Moon to Mars” exploration approach, announced in late 2018, prioritizes returning humans to the Moon, with Mars missions to follow. The policy outlines a phased effort—“beginning with missions beyond low-Earth orbit,” then “the return of humans to the Moon for long-term exploration and utilization, followed by human missions to Mars”[1].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- In December 2017, the U.S. government issued Space Policy Directive-1, directing NASA to “lead the return of humans to the Moon” as a stepping stone for Mars and beyond, emphasizing sustainability and partnerships[1].
- No specific, funded crewed Mars landing program was in place as of October 2018. While NASA documents mention ambitions to land humans on Mars “around 2030,” the concrete programmatic steps, hardware, and budget commitments were focused on lunar activities[1].
- NASA’s 2018 Mars activities centered on robotic science missions (e.g., InSight), not crewed vehicles[2][4][5].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- NASA press releases and mission status updates (e.g., InSight’s landing and status in late 2018)[1][2][4][5].
- Space Policy Directive-1 and NASA’s “Moon to Mars” overview[1].
- Wikipedia’s list of proposed crewed Mars mission plans (for historical context).

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- The absence of a funded crewed Mars lander, transit vehicle, or consistent budget for a Mars landing mission as of 2018.
- Long lead times for developing, testing, and launching deep-space crewed systems—historically at least a decade from committed funding to launch.
- Policy and funding priorities can shift with changes in U.S. administration and congressional support.
- Technological risks: Life support, radiation protection, and surface systems for Mars remain unproven as of 2018.
- The possibility of a NASA-branded mission using commercial partners (e.g., SpaceX) remains, but would still require primary U.S. government funding per the resolution criteria.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given:
- The historical pattern of missed Mars crewed mission targets,
- The explicit 2018 policy focus on the Moon first,
- The lack of tangible hardware or budget lines for a crewed Mars landing pre-2030,
- The scope and complexity of Mars human landing missions,

**A reasonable probabilistic assessment as of 2018 is:**

- The probability that NASA lands people on Mars prior to 2030 is low—likely below 10%—unless major new policy, budget, or partnership developments occur.
