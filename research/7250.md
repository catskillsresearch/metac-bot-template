## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- **Legal and Regulatory Environment:** As of 2022 through mid-2024, germline (heritable) gene editing is banned or severely restricted in the United States (by Congressional acts and FDA policy), the European Union (through the Oviedo Convention), and most other advanced economies[1][2][3]. There is no precedent—historically or currently—of any country legally requiring gene editing for all births.
- **Bioethical Consensus:** The global bioethical consensus has consistently opposed mandatory germline interventions, citing safety, consent, equity, and the risk of eugenics[3][5].
- **Technological Adoption:** Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) and embryo selection are available in some countries for medical reasons, but are optional and do not involve direct gene editing of embryos. These practices are tightly regulated and far from being mandated for all births[5].
- **Research and Commercial Trends:** The number of scientific publications and companies in gene editing continues to grow, and the technology is becoming more powerful and affordable. However, clinical applications remain focused on somatic (non-heritable) gene therapy and rare, severe genetic diseases[2][5].

## 2. Recent Announcements/Policies

- **US Policy:** The US maintains a ban on federal funding for research involving human embryo manipulation (Dickey-Wicker Amendment), and the FDA will not approve germline modifications for clinical use[1][2].
- **EU Policy:** Most EU countries prohibit heritable gene editing, and the Oviedo Convention explicitly bans the modification of the human germline[3].
- **China and Others:** While China has seen high-profile cases of illegal gene editing (e.g., the 2018 CRISPR babies), the response has been to tighten regulations and penalize violators, not to mandate genetic modification[5].
- **No Jurisdictional Mandates:** There are no known cases—nor any legislative proposals—requiring all births to be genetically engineered as of 2024.

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Regulatory review articles and legal trackers[1][2][3]
- Bioethics and scientific society guidance[5]
- Government and international treaty documents

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- **Technological Change:** Predicting developments and societal attitudes toward genetic engineering over an 80-year horizon is highly uncertain. Dramatic breakthroughs or global crises (e.g., pandemics, existential risks) could alter risk tolerance and political will.
- **International Divergence:** Some countries could, in principle, diverge from the current consensus—especially under authoritarian regimes or in the context of perceived national security or competitive advantage.
- **Enforcement and Definition:** Even if a law were passed, enforcement, societal compliance, and definitional boundaries (e.g., what counts as "genetic engineering" vs. screening) could complicate resolution.
- **Ethical Backlash:** History shows widespread resistance to eugenics and coercive reproductive policy, making mandatory genetic engineering a deeply controversial prospect.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the strong and enduring opposition to mandatory human germline modification, the absence of any precedent, and the lack of movement toward such mandates as of 2022–2024, the probability that any jurisdiction of 1 million+ people will enforce a law requiring all births to be genetically engineered by 2100 appears extremely low—substantially less than 5%. This probability could rise if unforeseen technological, political, or existential developments radically shift current ethical and legal frameworks, but there are currently no credible indicators pointing in this direction.
