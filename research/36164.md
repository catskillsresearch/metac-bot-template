**Key factors for forecasting "goodnews" subreddit subscribers**:

1. **Historical trends**:  
   - No direct historical data exists in available sources for "goodnews"  
   - Comparable subreddits (e.g., /r/Gwinnett) show ~30K subscribers in counties with ~1M residents[4], but "goodnews" likely operates at a national/global scale  
   - Reddit's overall logged-in daily active users grew 27% YoY to 46.1M in late 2024/early 2025[5], suggesting favorable platform conditions  

2. **Recent developments**:  
   - 6-week growth spurt noted (per question details), but magnitude unspecified  
   - Google algorithm changes in 2024-2025 drove increased Reddit visibility[5], potentially benefiting all subreddits  
   - Third-party app restrictions (2023)[3] might limit growth tools but are not directly relevant to subscriber counts  

3. **Verification methods**:  
   - **Reddstats.com** (resolution source) is the authoritative tracker  
   - **Subreddit Tracker Tool** (question reference) provides daily growth snapshots  
   - **Reddit API** (with limitations post-2023 changes[3]) could theoretically provide historical data  

4. **Uncertainties**:  
   - No visibility into "goodnews" moderation strategies or content trends  
   - Platform-wide growth ≠ subreddit-specific growth  
   - Resolution depends on third-party tool accuracy  

**Conclusion**: Without access to the Subreddit Tracker Tool's actual data or pre-03/19/2025 Reddstats snapshots, the forecast remains bounded by the provided [100,000–120,000] range. The 6-week growth spurt and Reddit's overall DAU growth[5] suggest the higher end of this range is plausible.
