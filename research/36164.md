### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Reddit as a whole has experienced rapid growth: monthly active users reached approximately 1.2 billion in February 2024, with daily active users up 47% year-over-year as of Q3 2024[1].
- The "goodnews" subreddit has seen a notable spurt in subscriber growth over the past 6 weeks (as of March 19, 2025), though exact numbers are not provided in the available sources.
- Increased Reddit visibility in Google search results, especially after a 2023 algorithm update and a 2024 AI content deal with Google, likely contributed to broader subreddit growth through 2024[2].

### Recent Announcements or Policies Affecting the Metric

- In early 2024, Reddit signed a $60 million deal with Google to allow its data to be used for AI training, increasing the platform's visibility and potentially driving more users to subreddits like "goodnews"[1][2].
- However, in January 2025, a significant drop in Reddit’s search visibility was reported, which could slow the rate of new subscribers joining subreddits, including "goodnews"[2].

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The primary resolution source is Reddstats, which provides daily subscriber counts for subreddits, including "goodnews." The specific page for verification is: https://reddstats.com/subreddit/goodnews.
- The Subreddit Tracker Tool is also referenced as a specialized analytics tool for monitoring subreddit growth, offering daily snapshots of subscriber counts.

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- No exact current or historical subscriber numbers for "goodnews" are available in the provided sources, making precise forecasting difficult.
- The recent drop in Reddit's search visibility (January 2025) introduces uncertainty about whether the recent growth spurt will continue at the same rate[2].
- If Reddstats does not display data for March 30, 2025, the closest preceding value will be used for resolution, which could introduce a small margin of error.

### Summary Table

| Factor                        | Impact on Forecast              |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Reddit platform growth        | Positive (supports growth)      |
| Recent "goodnews" growth      | Positive (recent spurt)         |
| Google AI/content deals       | Positive (increased visibility) |
| January 2025 SEO drop         | Negative (may slow growth)      |
| Data source (Reddstats)       | Authoritative, but may have gaps|

### Conclusion

The "goodnews" subreddit is likely to benefit from Reddit’s overall growth and recent visibility boosts, but the January 2025 drop in search visibility could temper its growth rate. The most authoritative and up-to-date subscriber count for March 30, 2025, should be obtained from Reddstats, with the closest preceding value used if data for that exact date is unavailable.
