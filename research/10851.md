# Norway's EU Membership Prospects: 2022-2035 Forecast Analysis

As of May 9, 2022, Norway maintains its position outside the European Union while participating in the European Economic Area (EEA). This analysis examines the likelihood of Norway joining the EU before 2035 based on current trends, historical context, and political developments.

## Historical Context and Current Status

Norway has twice rejected EU membership through national referendums:
- 1972: 53.5% voted against membership
- 1994: 52.2% voted against membership

These results demonstrate a consistent, though narrowing, opposition to full EU integration. Currently, Norway maintains a close relationship with the EU through the EEA agreement, which grants access to the EU's single market while remaining outside the political union.

## Recent Political Developments

Recent political shifts suggest a potential reopening of the EU membership debate:

1. The Conservative Party (Høyre) has renewed interest in an EU membership referendum, stating that "Norwegian EU membership has now become more important than ever" in the context of the Ukraine war.

2. Green Party leader Rasmus Hansson has expressed support for EU membership, indicating his party "will be a driving force for this debate to start in Norwegian society."

3. Despite these political movements, public opinion remains predominantly opposed to membership.

## Public Opinion Indicators

Recent polling data shows consistent opposition to EU membership:

- April 2022 (Norstat for Vårt Land):
  - 53% against membership
  - 26% for membership
  - 21% undecided

- March 2022 (Klassekampen og Nationen):
  - 54% against membership
  - 34% for membership

The significant undecided portion (21%) in the April poll suggests potential volatility in public opinion that could shift with changing geopolitical circumstances.

## Key Factors Affecting Future Membership

Several variables will likely influence Norway's EU membership prospects:

1. **Security concerns**: The Russia-Ukraine war has altered European security calculations, potentially increasing the perceived value of closer European integration.

2. **Economic considerations**: Norway's oil and gas wealth has historically been a factor in resistance to EU membership, as the country seeks to maintain control over these resources.

3. **Sovereignty concerns**: Traditional opposition to EU membership centers on maintaining national sovereignty, particularly regarding natural resources and fisheries.

4. **Political leadership**: Changes in government could significantly impact the likelihood of a new membership referendum.

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on information available as of May 9, 2022, the probability of Norway joining the EU before 2035 appears low to moderate:

- **Short-term (2022-2025)**: Very low probability (<10%)
  - Current public opinion remains firmly against membership
  - No immediate referendum is scheduled

- **Medium-term (2026-2030)**: Low probability (10-25%)
  - Potential for shifting public opinion due to geopolitical developments
  - Possible referendum during this period if political momentum builds

- **Long-term (2031-2035)**: Low to moderate probability (15-30%)
  - Generational shifts may lead to changing attitudes
  - Evolving European security architecture could influence Norwegian perspectives

## Limitations and Uncertainties

This forecast faces several limitations:

1. Geopolitical developments, particularly in European security, could dramatically alter the calculus for Norwegian membership.

2. Economic factors, including energy markets and Norway's sovereign wealth fund management, may influence public sentiment.

3. The significant undecided portion in polling suggests potential volatility in public opinion.

4. Limited recent comprehensive polling makes precise trend analysis difficult.

5. The analysis is constrained by information available as of May 9, 2022, and future developments may significantly alter the forecast.

Given these factors, while Norway joining the EU before 2035 remains a possibility, current evidence suggests it is more likely that Norway will maintain its present arrangement outside the EU while participating in the European Economic Area.
