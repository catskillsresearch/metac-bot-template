## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Since the end of the Chinese Civil War, the Taiwan Strait has seen persistent military and political tension but no open conflict since 1979.
- Traditionally, PLA military activity around Taiwan surged in response to political events. However, in early 2025, PLA incursions into Taiwan’s airspace and waters reached record highs, shifting toward a sustained, operational presence rather than event-driven maneuvers[3].
- Taiwan’s new president, Lai Ching-te, in May 2025 publicly declared China a "foreign hostile force" and conducted the island’s first whole-of-society civil defense drill, signaling increased domestic readiness for potential conflict[1].

## 2. Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Metric

- PLA military activity—including warship patrols and air incursions—has intensified and broadened in scope, with frequent median-line crossings and expanded drone operations encircling Taiwan[3].
- Taiwan continues to be diplomatically isolated, as shown by its ninth consecutive exclusion from the World Health Assembly in May 2025, while the US and allies reiterate support for Taiwan’s autonomy[2].
- Taiwan’s military assessments in 2025 indicate China could be "ready" to execute an invasion, but many analysts also point toward 2027—the 100th anniversary of the PLA—as a potential symbolic milestone for escalation[5].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Associated Press and The New York Times (for confirming any full-scale invasion)
- Taiwan Ministry of National Defense (for data on PLA incursions and troop movements)
- Council on Foreign Relations, Institute for the Study of War (for analysis of cross-Strait developments)

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- While military activity has reached unprecedented levels, there is no direct evidence—such as the mass movement of at least 1,000 PLA troops onto Taiwan’s main island—meeting the resolution criteria for a full-scale invasion as of late May 2025[3][5].
- PLA operations increasingly reflect a doctrine of persistent pressure and readiness, but not necessarily imminent invasion intent.
- The possibility of rapid escalation remains, but current developments suggest a sharpening of brinkmanship rather than a clear shift to kinetic conflict.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

- Compared to reference cases, the risk of conflict is elevated, but there is still insufficient evidence to suggest a greater-than-even probability of a full-scale Chinese invasion of Taiwan before January 1, 2026, as defined by the resolution criteria.
- The most likely scenario for the remainder of 2025 is continued military pressure and maneuvers, with persistent uncertainty and high risk of miscalculation, but no confirmed large-scale amphibious invasion.
