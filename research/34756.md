## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The PRC has significantly ramped up military activity around Taiwan in 2025. This includes four incursions by the China Coast Guard into Taiwan’s restricted waters in March, and large-scale joint PLA exercises simulating a blockade and assault on Taiwan in April. These drills involved all major service branches and demonstrated capabilities for encirclement, logistical disruption, and multi-domain superiority[2][5].
- The PLA has normalized aggressive air and naval operations, including record numbers of aircraft sorties crossing the median line and naval encirclements. These are intended to wear down Taiwanese defenses and signal Beijing's displeasure with the current Taiwanese administration[2][4].
- Chinese military modernization continues, with new landing barges and technology to disrupt communications, further enhancing amphibious and hybrid warfare capabilities. However, these improvements, while notable, do not in themselves indicate an imminent invasion[4].

## 2. Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Metric

- In response to comments from Taiwanese President Lai criticizing the PRC, China has increased military pressure, including unannounced live-fire drills, undersea cable cutting, and joint service exercises[2][4].
- The PRC continues to use "greyzone" tactics—persistent, sub-threshold coercion—rather than overt military aggression, though the scale and intensity of these actions have reached unprecedented levels in 2025[4][5].
- The U.S. maintains its strategic ambiguity policy but has strengthened military ties with regional allies and reiterated its commitment to Taiwan’s security, acting as a significant deterrent to outright invasion[5].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Institute for the Study of War, China-Taiwan Weekly Updates[2][3]
- Chatham House, "China's military build-up indicates it is serious about taking Taiwan"[4]
- Council on Foreign Relations, "China in the Taiwan Strait: February 2025"[1]
- CBS News, reporting on PLA war games and U.S. responses[5]

## 4. Limitations or Uncertainties in Measurement

- While PLA activity is at historic highs and the risk of miscalculation is elevated, authoritative sources stress that increased military capability and exercises alone do not equate to imminent invasion plans[4].
- No open-source reporting as of May 2025 suggests PLA mobilization for a full-scale invasion, and the operational pattern remains one of coercion and psychological pressure, not direct assault[2][4][5].
- The primary limiting factor for a PRC invasion remains the high likelihood of U.S. military intervention and the unpredictable, severe consequences of regional war[4][5].
- The probability of accidental escalation is higher than in recent years, but deliberate invasion before January 1, 2026, remains unlikely barring dramatic new developments.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the above, while the risk environment is at a multi-decade high and the PRC is making every effort to increase its coercive leverage, the likelihood of a deliberate Chinese invasion of Taiwan by January 1, 2026 remains below 20%. The strongest signals continue to indicate coercion, not imminent war. However, accidental escalation or miscalculation risks are non-trivial and bear continued monitoring.
