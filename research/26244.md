# Forecasting Analysis: Human Extinction Five Years After AGI

To assess whether humans will become extinct within five years after the development of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), I'll analyze current information and expert forecasts available as of July 22, 2024.

## Current AGI Timeline Predictions

Expert opinions on when AGI will arrive vary significantly:

- A 2024 survey of AI experts indicates a 50% probability of AGI emerging by 2040, with some experts predicting it could happen as early as 2030[3]
- The leaders of major AI companies have been shortening their AGI timeline estimates, with many suggesting a 2-5 year timeframe[2]
- According to a comprehensive analysis of 8,590 predictions published in May 2025, AI experts estimate that AGI will probably (>50% chance) emerge between 2040 and 2050, with a 90% chance of appearing before a later unspecified date[4]

The variation in these predictions highlights significant uncertainty about when AGI will actually be developed.

## Key Factors Affecting Post-AGI Human Survival

While the search results don't directly address human extinction risk following AGI development, several relevant factors emerge:

### Governance and Oversight

One scenario describes potential government intervention in AGI development:

- By late 2026, government could implement "extreme oversight bordering on nationalization" of AGI companies[5]
- This suggests recognition of AGI's potential risks and strategic importance
- The effectiveness of such oversight in preventing extinction scenarios remains uncertain

### Technical Challenges and Safety

Several technical factors may influence extinction risk:

- Experts remain divided on the technical approach to achieving AGI—whether scaling current architectures will suffice or if fundamentally new methods are needed[4]
- Unresolved ethical concerns and unclear benchmarks for AGI capabilities represent significant challenges[4]
- The rapid advancement of AI capabilities, particularly in software engineering and problem-solving domains, could create scenarios where AGI development outpaces safety measures[5]

### Expert Uncertainty

The search results reveal that even industry leaders express uncertainty about post-AGI outcomes:

- In one speculative timeline, after AGI creation in 2027, the author notes "History probably doesn't end here" but declines to describe the post-AGI world[5]
- This reluctance to predict post-AGI outcomes reflects the deep uncertainty surrounding this question

## Assessment Limitations

This forecast faces several significant limitations:

1. The search results provide minimal direct information about extinction risk specifically
2. Most AGI timeline predictions focus on when AGI will arrive, not on its consequences
3. The question involves complex technical, social, and governance factors that are difficult to predict
4. There appears to be no historical precedent for assessing extinction risk from a transformative technology of this nature

## Conclusion

Based on the available information, it is not possible to make a confident probabilistic assessment of human extinction five years after AGI. The search results focus primarily on AGI timelines rather than extinction scenarios, and expert opinions vary widely even on the more straightforward question of when AGI will arrive.

What we can conclude is that:

1. AGI development timelines remain highly uncertain, with estimates ranging from the mid-2020s to mid-century
2. There is recognition among some experts and governments of potential risks requiring intervention
3. Technical challenges in AGI development and alignment remain unresolved
4. The post-AGI world is characterized by deep uncertainty even among leading experts

A more comprehensive forecast would require additional information about AGI safety research progress, international coordination efforts, and technical details about potential control mechanisms.
