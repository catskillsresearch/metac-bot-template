### 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The India–Pakistan conflict in May 2025 involved four days of intense military hostilities, including missile and drone strikes, as well as artillery and small arms exchanges along the Line of Control[1][2][3].
- The crisis was described as the "deadliest in decades," indicating a likely high casualty count[1].
- Previous instances of escalations (such as the 2019 Pulwama-Balakot crisis or 1999 Kargil War) saw fatalities ranging from dozens to hundreds in short timeframes when heavy weaponry was used.
- A ceasefire was announced on May 10, and is reported to be generally holding as of late May, though diplomatic and economic hostilities persist[2][3].

### 2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- Ceasefire agreement reached on May 10, following several days of open conflict[2][3].
- Both countries have maintained other hostile measures (trade, diplomatic suspensions), but there is no evidence of ongoing large-scale military operations since the ceasefire[2][3].
- International actors, especially the US and UK, played key roles in achieving the ceasefire, which may have limited the duration and scale of the conflict[2].

### 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Independent verification of the death toll is not yet available in the cited sources.
- The International Institute for Strategic Studies and UK Parliament research briefings are among the authoritative sources documenting the events and their significance[1][2].
- Wikipedia's summary, itself based on news agencies and government announcements, provides a timeline but does not cite an official death count[3].

### 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- As of May 26, 2025, there is no explicit or independently verified count of military or civilian deaths resulting from the May conflict in the available sources.
- Numbers may be disputed by the parties, and independent organizations may take time to verify and publish accurate figures.
- The probability of 100+ deaths is high based on past precedent and the described scale, but confirmation awaits reliable public reporting.

### Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the scale, intensity, and description of the May 2025 conflict, along with historical precedent, it is highly probable (estimated 75–90% likelihood) that at least 100 deaths occurred as a result of overt military actions between May 1 and July 1, 2025. However, this assessment is subject to revision when authoritative independent death tolls become available.
