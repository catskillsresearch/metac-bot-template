## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The 2025 India–Pakistan conflict is ongoing, triggered by the 22 April Pahalgam attack and escalating sharply after Indian missile strikes on 7 May 2025[1].
- Both sides have engaged in military operations, including missile strikes, aerial operations, and naval deployments[1].
- As of 12 May 2025, there is a reported ceasefire, but with ongoing high alert and some claims (later retracted) of further violations along the border[1].
- Historical escalations (e.g., 2019 Pulwama–Balakot) have resulted in significant but typically sub-100 fatality counts, with international mediation often preventing further escalation.

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- India conducted missile strikes on Pakistani military installations in early May, followed by rapid military mobilization and public warnings of strong responses to further violations[1].
- Pakistan retaliated and agreed to a ceasefire after international mediation, though the stability of this ceasefire is fragile[1].
- As of 12 May, Indian military sources claim no recent drone activity and that the ceasefire is holding, though the situation remains tense[1].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Wikipedia's ongoing coverage of the [2025 India–Pakistan conflict][1].
- Official press briefings from Indian and Pakistani armed forces, referenced in major media outlets[1].
- Reports from international mediators and reputable news agencies (to be monitored for updated casualty figures).

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- Casualty figures in active conflict zones are often delayed, incomplete, or contested.
- The situation is fluid, with the possibility of rapid escalation or de-escalation.
- Both sides may underreport military casualties for strategic reasons.
- International intervention may prevent mass casualties, but this cannot be guaranteed.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the severe escalation in early May 2025, there is a significant risk of high casualties. However, based on historical patterns and current indications of attempted de-escalation and ceasefire, the probability that overt military conflict results in 100 or more deaths in May or June 2025 appears elevated compared to most prior years, but does not yet reach certainty. 

A reasonable forecast is a 35–55% probability that the threshold will be reached, contingent on whether the current ceasefire holds or breaks down.
