## 1. Historical Trends and Current Status

- **Wong Kim Ark Precedent (1898):** The Supreme Court’s decision in United States v. Wong Kim Ark established that the Fourteenth Amendment guarantees US citizenship to nearly all children born on US soil, regardless of their parents’ status, unless the parents are foreign diplomats or enemy occupiers[5].
- **Consistent Application:** For over a century, courts and administrative agencies have applied this rule, and no Supreme Court decision has limited birthright citizenship for US-born children of noncitizens, including those present unlawfully or on temporary visas[5].
- **Current Status:** As of May 2025, President Trump’s executive order restricting birthright citizenship has been blocked by multiple lower courts. The Supreme Court has consolidated three cases for review and has left these stays in place, meaning the order is not in effect pending the Court's decision[4].

## 2. Recent Announcements and Policies

- **Trump Executive Order (Jan 2025):** President Trump signed “Protecting the Meaning and Value of American Citizenship,” directing agencies to deny automatic citizenship to children born in the US to parents who are neither citizens nor lawful permanent residents[3][4].
- **Judicial Response:** Federal courts quickly issued nationwide injunctions blocking enforcement of the order. The Supreme Court, as of April 17, 2025, granted certiorari but allowed the stays to remain, signaling caution and possibly reluctance to let the order take effect before a full hearing[4].
- **Legislative Actions:** The Birthright Citizenship Act of 2025, introduced in Congress, proposes restricting birthright citizenship similarly to the executive order. However, as of May 2025, it has limited support and has not become law[5].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Supreme Court docket and orders[4]
- Coverage and analysis by SCOTUSblog[2][4]
- Legal commentary from constitutional and immigration scholars[1][3]
- Official text and progress of the Birthright Citizenship Act of 2025[5]

## 4. Key Differences Affecting the Forecast

- **Court Composition:** The Supreme Court’s current conservative majority theoretically increases the possibility of a significant constitutional shift, but no justice has publicly advocated overturning Wong Kim Ark[1].
- **Legal Arguments:** The administration argues that the Fourteenth Amendment’s “subject to the jurisdiction thereof” clause allows restrictions, but this interpretation is contrary to long-established precedent[3][5].
- **Oral Arguments:** Reports from oral arguments (May 15, 2025) indicate no clear decision or majority position emerged; justices appeared divided or cautious, with some focusing on procedural issues and others on the constitutional merits[1][2].
- **Practical Impact:** Legal experts warn that restricting birthright citizenship would create significant practical and legal problems, with widespread implications for millions of US-born children[1].

## 5. Limitations and Uncertainties

- **No Final Ruling Yet:** The Supreme Court has not issued a decision; a ruling is expected by late June or early July 2025[4].
- **Procedural vs. Merits Ruling Risk:** The Court could decide on procedural grounds, avoiding a merits decision; this would maintain the status quo but might not resolve the underlying constitutional question[2].
- **Potential for Narrow Ruling:** Even if the Court addresses the merits, it could rule narrowly (e.g., upholding the order only for specific categories), which would still qualify as restricting birthright citizenship for this forecast.

## 6. Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given:
- Strong and longstanding precedent (Wong Kim Ark)
- The Supreme Court’s decision to leave lower court stays in place
- No clear indication from oral arguments of a majority willing to overturn or sharply limit birthright citizenship
- Political pressure but limited legislative progress

**The probability that the Supreme Court will allow birthright citizenship to be restricted in its 2025 ruling remains low, though higher than in previous decades due to the current Court’s composition and willingness to revisit precedent.** As of May 26, 2025, the most likely outcome is that the Court will uphold the status quo or rule on procedural grounds, resulting in a “No” resolution for the forecast, but the possibility of a significant change cannot be ruled out entirely.
