### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Lebanon’s economy has been in crisis since 2019, with the currency losing 95% of its value and over 80% of the population falling into poverty. The collapse of the banking sector and government mismanagement have been central to the crisis[3][5].
- In April 2022, Lebanon and the IMF reached a conditional agreement on a $3 billion loan package. However, the deal required significant reforms—especially in banking transparency, exchange rate unification, and depositor compensation—which have not been fully implemented[3][5].
- As of March 2025, the IMF concluded a fact-finding mission to Lebanon. The IMF acknowledged some progress, such as stabilization of the exchange rate and reduced inflation, but emphasized that these steps are insufficient without comprehensive reforms, particularly in the banking sector[1][5].

### Recent Announcements and Policies

- Lebanon formed a new government in early 2025, which has expressed intent to work with the IMF and requested support for a new program[5].
- The IMF has welcomed Lebanon’s request and remains open to a new agreement, but continues to stress that major reforms—especially restructuring the banking sector—are prerequisites for any financial assistance[5].
- Political divisions in Lebanon’s National Assembly and resistance from private banks have stalled key reforms, particularly those related to banking secrecy and depositor compensation[3][4].
- The IMF’s March 2025 mission was described as “fact-finding” and did not result in a concrete bailout agreement. Analysts and media reports indicate that a full agreement is unlikely until Lebanon enacts the required reforms[3][4].

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- IMF official press releases and country reports[1][2][5]
- International news coverage and analysis (e.g., Foreign Brief, Stratfor)[3][4]

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- The main uncertainty is political: Lebanon’s ability to pass and implement the necessary reforms remains in doubt due to internal divisions and opposition from vested interests[3][4].
- While the IMF and Lebanon may continue negotiations or even produce a draft agreement, the IMF has made it clear that no funds will be disbursed without concrete reform implementation. A draft or preliminary agreement without a funding commitment would not meet the resolution criteria[3][5].
- There is no evidence of a signed agreement involving IMF funding as of March 20, 2025, and authoritative sources suggest that such an agreement is unlikely before April 1, 2025, unless there is an unexpected political breakthrough[3][4][5].

### Summary Table

| Factor                        | Status as of March 20, 2025                |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| IMF-Lebanon negotiations      | Ongoing, fact-finding mission concluded    |
| Major reforms implemented     | Insufficient, especially in banking sector |
| IMF openness to agreement     | Yes, but conditional on reforms            |
| Signed agreement (funding)    | No evidence as of cutoff date              |
| Likelihood before April 1     | Low, barring sudden reform breakthrough    |

**Conclusion:**  
Based on all available information as of March 20, 2025, there is no signed agreement between the IMF and Lebanon involving new funding, and the prospects for such an agreement before April 1, 2025, are low due to stalled reforms and political divisions[1][3][4][5].
