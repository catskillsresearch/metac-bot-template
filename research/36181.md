# Will the IMF and Lebanon Announce an Agreement Before April 1, 2025?

Based on the available information as of March 20, 2025, I'll analyze the likelihood of Lebanon and the IMF announcing an economic agreement before April 1, 2025.

## Current Status and Recent Developments

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) conducted a fact-finding mission to Lebanon from March 10-13, 2025[1]. During this visit, the IMF welcomed the Lebanese authorities' request for a new IMF-supported program to address the country's significant economic challenges[1][5]. This request came from Lebanon's newly formed government under Prime Minister Nawaf Salam, which was established after the country elected a new president in January 2025 following a two-year vacuum[5].

The IMF mission, led by Ernesto Ramirez Rigo, acknowledged some positive steps taken by Lebanon, including the stabilization of the dollar exchange rate and reduced inflation. However, the IMF emphasized that these measures were "insufficient to address the ongoing economic, financial, and social challenges"[5].

## Historical Context and Challenges

Lebanon's economy has been in crisis since 2019, when high government borrowing and mismanagement of public finances caused a complete collapse of the financial sector. This resulted in the Lebanese currency losing 95% of its value and 80% of the population falling into poverty[2]. In April 2022, Lebanon and the IMF reached a conditional agreement on a $3 billion loan package, but the painful reforms required by the 46-month financing program have not been implemented[5].

The key reforms demanded by the IMF include:
- Restructuring the banking sector
- Lifting banking secrecy laws
- Harmonizing exchange rates
- Establishing an official restructuring plan to compensate depositors[2][5]

## Prospects for an Agreement

While negotiations between the IMF and Lebanon will likely produce a draft agreement conditional on financing assurances from creditors, division in Lebanon's National Assembly will likely stall key economic reforms, preventing major disbursements[4]. The IMF's recent fact-finding mission was unlikely to produce concrete progress toward a full bailout agreement[2].

Lebanon has made some progress in harmonizing exchange rates and curtailing government borrowing. However, the IMF is likely concerned about high deficits incurred during the Israel-Hezbollah war last year. Additionally, reforms to the banking sector have languished: Lebanon's banking secrecy laws still impede transparency, and a draft law that would compensate depositors is facing significant pushback from private banks[2].

The conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, which ended with a November 27 ceasefire, has created substantial infrastructure and housing needs[5]. A March 2025 World Bank report estimated that damage in Lebanon from this conflict will require $11 billion in reconstruction and recovery[4].

## Conclusion

Given the complex reforms still needed, the political divisions within Lebanon, and the short timeframe between the most recent IMF mission (concluded March 13, 2025) and April 1, 2025, it appears unlikely that a full agreement will be announced before April 1. While both parties have expressed interest in working together, the substantial reforms required and Lebanon's history of delayed implementation suggest that finalizing an agreement within this timeframe would be challenging.

However, it's worth noting that the IMF has welcomed the new government's request for support, which represents a positive step in the negotiation process.
