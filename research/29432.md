# Will Donald Trump outperform Marsha Blackburn in Tennessee in 2024?

Based on polling data available as of October 2024, both Donald Trump and Senator Marsha Blackburn are showing strong performance in Tennessee, though current polling suggests Blackburn may slightly outperform Trump.

## Current Polling Status

According to the October 2024 Beacon Poll of 1,200 registered Tennessee voters:

- Donald Trump leads Vice President Kamala Harris by 21 points in Tennessee[3]
- Senator Marsha Blackburn leads Representative Gloria Johnson by 23 points (54%-31%) among likely voters[3]
- Third-party Independent candidate Pamela Moses is garnering 5% of the vote in the Senate race[3]

ActiVote's October 19, 2024 poll also confirms that "Republican incumbent Senator Marsha Blackburn leads her Democratic challenger" in the Tennessee Senate race, reinforcing Blackburn's strong position[4].

## Historical Context

Tennessee has been a reliably Republican state in recent elections. Looking at Blackburn's previous performance:

- In the 2018 Senate race, Blackburn won by 10.8 points, receiving 54.7% of the vote compared to Democrat Phil Bredesen's 43.9%[5]
- The 2012 Senate race saw an even larger Republican victory, with Bob Corker winning by 34.5 points[5]

This historical data suggests that Republican candidates typically perform well in Tennessee statewide races.

## Voter Perception and Approval

The October 2024 Beacon Poll provides additional insights that may impact relative performance:

- Senator Blackburn posted her best approval rating to date, with 53% of Tennesseans approving of her job performance and 35% disapproving[3]
- 30% of likely voters think Blackburn is too conservative, while 36% think Johnson is too liberal[3]
- Trump is trusted more by Tennesseans to deal with natural disasters, which may be particularly relevant given the recent Hurricanes Helene and Milton affecting the Southeast[3]

## Analysis and Forecast

Based on current polling, Blackburn's 23-point lead over Johnson is slightly larger than Trump's 21-point lead over Harris, suggesting that Blackburn might marginally outperform Trump in Tennessee. However, several factors could influence the final outcome:

1. **Margin of error**: Polling typically has a margin of error of a few percentage points, making the 2-point difference between Trump and Blackburn's leads potentially insignificant

2. **Third-party impact**: The presence of third-party candidate Pamela Moses (5%) in the Senate race could affect Blackburn's final percentage compared to Trump's in a race that may have different third-party dynamics

3. **Voter turnout**: Presidential elections typically drive higher turnout than midterm elections, which could affect the relative performance of candidates down-ballot

4. **Late developments**: Events occurring between the latest polls and Election Day could shift voter preferences

## Limitations and Uncertainties

The available polling data has several limitations:

- Limited number of polls specifically comparing Trump and Blackburn performance in Tennessee
- Potential sampling biases in the polls conducted
- Uncertainty about voter turnout and last-minute shifts in voter preference
- Lack of detailed demographic breakdowns that might reveal different patterns of support

## Conclusion

While both Trump and Blackburn show strong leads in Tennessee, current polling suggests Blackburn may slightly outperform Trump by approximately 2 percentage points. However, given the margins of error in polling and other variables, the race remains close enough that either candidate could ultimately receive more votes in Tennessee.
