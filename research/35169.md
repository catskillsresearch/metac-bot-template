## Key Factual Information for Forecasting February 2025 Southwest Land Border Encounters

**1. Historical Trends and Current Status**
- Encounters at the southwest border reached record highs in fiscal years 2021 and 2022, with over 1.6 million encounters in FY2021, far surpassing previous years[4].
- After the end of Title 42 expulsions in May 2023, encounters continued but have sharply declined since mid-2024.
- According to the Department of Homeland Security, encounters between ports of entry in November and December 2024 were at their lowest levels since August 2020, and recent monthly encounter levels have been lower than the monthly average in 2019[5].
- In the first half of January 2025, the 7-day daily average of encounters was 1,150, and remained below 1,500 for 21 consecutive days[5].

**2. Recent Announcements and Policy Changes**
- A Presidential Proclamation in June 2024, invoking the President’s 212(f) authority, and an accompanying DHS-DOJ rule, led to a more than 60% decrease in encounters between ports of entry from May to December 2024[5].
- These enforcement measures have contributed to the sustained reduction in border encounters into early 2025.

**3. Authoritative Sources for Verification**
- The official CBP Southwest Land Border Encounters dashboard is the primary source for monthly encounter data[2].
- The Office of Homeland Security Statistics also publishes encounter event data[3].
- DHS press releases and fact sheets provide context on policy changes and their impact[5].

**4. Limitations and Uncertainties**
- CBP data is subject to change due to corrections, system changes, or additional information, but the contest will resolve based on the first published value for February 2025[2].
- The metric now excludes Title 42 expulsions, focusing solely on Title 8 apprehensions and inadmissibles.
- Seasonal factors, policy changes, and external events (e.g., migration surges) can cause month-to-month volatility.

**Summary Table: Key Recent Data Points**

| Month         | 7-Day Daily Avg. Encounters | Notable Policy/Context                     |
|---------------|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Nov–Dec 2024  | Lowest since Aug 2020      | Post-212(f) Proclamation, new DHS-DOJ rule |
| Jan 2025 (1st half) | 1,150 (7-day avg.)         | Below 1,500 for 21 consecutive days        |

**Conclusion:**  
As of February 17, 2025, all available data and policy context indicate that southwest land border encounters have sharply declined since mid-2024, with daily averages in early January 2025 at or below 1,150. The number for February 2025 is likely to remain at or near these historically low levels, barring unforeseen events.
