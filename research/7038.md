## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of April 2021, the largest known planned plant-based meat facility was Plant & Bean’s UK site, designed for 55,000 metric tons/year[2].
- This capacity is still much less than major cattle-processing plants, which process the equivalent of around 250,000+ metric tons/year (20,000 head/week × ~250 kg/head × 52 weeks)[2].
- Industry analyses (e.g., Good Food Institute) estimate that to meet projected 2030 demand (6% of global meat, or ~25 million metric tons/year), the sector would need at least 800–810 extrusion facilities, each with a baseline of 30,000 metric tons/year[1][5].

## Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Metric

- No single facility exceeding Plant & Bean’s planned 55,000 metric tons/year had been publicly announced as of April 2021[2].
- The sector was attracting increased investment, with forecasts for much larger facilities likely as technology and demand mature[3][4].
- Policy trends in major markets (EU, US, China) were supportive of plant-based meat expansion, but with little direct effect on single-facility scale as of 2021.

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Good Food Institute reports and scenario modeling[1][3][5].
- Community forecasting platforms (Metaculus)[2].
- Industry news and company press releases for new facility announcements.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- The difference between nameplate (maximum) and actual operational capacity can be large.
- Future demand growth, regulatory changes, or supply chain disruptions could alter investment in mega-facilities.
- Some announced facilities may be delayed, scaled back, or never reach peak output.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

- As of April 2021, expert and community forecasts most commonly anticipated the largest single plant-based meat facility in 2030 would have an annual capacity between 67,000 and 159,000 metric tons/year, with a median estimate of 107,000 metric tons/year[2].
- Significant upside is possible if a multinational or major contract manufacturer builds a “flagship” plant, but the probability of a single facility exceeding 200,000 metric tons/year by 2030 is judged low (<10%)[2].
- Therefore, the most likely range for the largest single facility by January 1, 2030 is 67,000–159,000 metric tons/year, with a central forecast of approximately 100,000–110,000 metric tons/year, barring major unforeseen technological or market breakthroughs[2][5].
