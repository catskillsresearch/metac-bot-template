### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Both Donald Trump and Elon Musk have been vocal about U.S. immigration policy, particularly regarding high-skilled worker visas like the H-1B program[1][4][5].
- In early 2025, Trump publicly sided with Musk in supporting the H-1B visa, emphasizing the need for "smart people" in the U.S. and aligning with Musk's pro-immigration stance for tech workers[1][5].
- The current immigration debate among Trump, Musk, and their supporters is centered on the H-1B visa, not the Diversity Visa (DV) program[3][4].
- There is no evidence from recent news or social media activity that either Trump or Musk has referenced the Diversity Visa program in public statements or X posts as of March 5, 2025.

### Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- The most recent immigration-related controversy involving Trump and Musk is about the H-1B visa, with both expressing support for expanding access to high-skilled foreign workers[1][5].
- No recent policy announcements or public debates involving Trump or Musk have focused on the Diversity Visa program[3][4].
- The Diversity Visa has not been a prominent topic in the ongoing immigration discourse among Trump, Musk, or their close political circles.

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The resolution of this question relies on a direct search for the phrase "diversity visa" from either Donald Trump or Elon Musk on X (Twitter), as specified in the resolution criteria.
- As of March 5, 2025, no such post exists from either individual, based on the available search results and news coverage.

### Limitations or Uncertainties in Measurement

- Public figures like Trump and Musk can shift their focus quickly in response to breaking news or political developments. If the Diversity Visa program becomes a topic of controversy or policy debate, it is possible they could address it before April 1, 2025.
- The search method is robust but only captures posts containing the exact phrase "diversity visa." Posts using alternative phrasing or indirect references would not count toward resolution.
- The available information is current as of March 5, 2025; any developments after this date are not included.
