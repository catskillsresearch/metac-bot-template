## Comparison to Reference Cases

- Major infrastructure projects (e.g., the International Space Station) have shown that international collaboration on complex, expensive space projects is possible, but typically takes decades from concept to operation.
- Lowering space access costs has historically relied on advances in rocket technology (e.g., reusable boosters by SpaceX), rather than entirely new architectures like space elevators[5].
- The space elevator concept, first seriously studied in the late 20th century, has seen periodic interest but no major demonstration projects as of 2018[1][5].

## Key Differences Affecting the Forecast

- **Materials Science:** The greatest technical barrier remains the lack of a material with sufficient tensile strength and low density. As of 2018, no known material (including carbon nanotubes at industrial scale) met the requirements for a single-stage, Earth-based space elevator[4][5].
- **Multi-Stage Proposals:** The ISEC's 2018 report suggested that a multi-stage approach could allow incremental progress with current materials, potentially reducing the technological barrier[3]. This is a notable shift from prior all-or-nothing assessments.
- **Cost, Risk, and Security:** The projected cost is in the tens of billions, with high ongoing security and maintenance risks (from terrorism, accidents, debris, etc.)[5].
- **Lack of Major Policy Support:** As of 2018, there was no significant government or private sector commitment to large-scale funding or construction of a space elevator[5].
- **Competing Technologies:** The rapid improvement and cost reduction in reusable rockets diminishes the economic urgency of a space elevator, potentially delaying major investment[5].

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

- **Feasibility:** Expert consensus as of 2018 remains that space elevators are theoretically feasible, particularly if new materials are developed or multi-stage architectures prove viable[4][5].
- **Likelihood by 2100:** Given the persistent material science hurdle, lack of large-scale demonstration, and absence of policy momentum as of 2018, the probability that a working space elevator will be built and operated for at least one year on Earth before 2100 remains lowâ€”likely in the single-digit percent range. However, incremental progress (e.g., partial elevators, lunar or Martian elevators) is more plausible, and a major breakthrough in materials or a significant policy shift could sharply increase the odds[4][5].
- **Uncertainties:** High, particularly in the timeline for material breakthroughs, global political coordination, and the impact of competing launch technologies.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- Assessments are based on the state of science and policy as of 2018; unforeseen breakthroughs or global crises could radically alter the forecast.
- Measurement is limited by the absence of a detailed, stepwise development roadmap and the unpredictability of material science innovation.
