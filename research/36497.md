# US-Iran Nuclear Agreement Forecast: May-September 2025

As of May 25, 2025, the United States and Iran have been engaged in high-stakes negotiations to establish a new nuclear agreement. This analysis examines the current diplomatic landscape and forecasts the likelihood of an agreement being signed before September 2025.

## Current Status of Negotiations

The United States and Iran have been engaged in talks over a new nuclear deal since April 2025, with five rounds of negotiations already completed in Rome[1][4]. These represent the first significant diplomatic engagement between the two nations since the US withdrawal from the JCPOA in 2018, after which Iran began breaching the agreement's provisions starting in 2019[1].

The latest round of talks concluded with limited progress, and both sides have agreed to meet "in the near future" for continued discussions[4]. While negotiators maintain that progress is being made, there is growing skepticism in Tehran about the chances of reaching a deal as Washington appears to be hardening its position[4].

## Key Points of Contention

The primary obstacle to an agreement remains Iran's uranium enrichment program:

**US Position:**
- The Trump administration has made it clear it will not allow Iran to enrich uranium under a new agreement[3]
- US Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that while the US is open to allowing Iran to pursue a civilian nuclear program, it would not permit uranium enrichment[2]
- American officials maintain their "ultimate demand that Iran halt all uranium enrichment on its soil"[2]

**Iranian Position:**
- Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi has stated explicitly: "Zero nuclear weapons equals a deal. Zero enrichment equals no deal"[2]
- Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei dismissed calls to end uranium enrichment as "excessive and outrageous"[2]
- Iranian officials consider enrichment their right and have indicated they won't walk back from this position[4]

## Potential Pathways Forward

Despite the fundamental disagreement over enrichment, there are signs that both sides are exploring potential compromises:

1. **Interim Agreement:** The US has floated a proposal for an initial agreement in which Iran would demonstrate readiness to permanently abandon pursuit of nuclear weapons. As part of this framework, the administration is considering postponing certain sanctions against Iran[2].

2. **Sanctions Relief:** Economic considerations may provide leverage, as the possibility of sanctions relief could incentivize Iran to make concessions, though not likely on the core issue of enrichment[2].

3. **External Pressures:** Intelligence suggests Israel is preparing for strikes against targets in Iran, which could either derail negotiations or create urgency to reach an agreement[4].

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on the current trajectory of negotiations, the likelihood of the US and Iran signing an agreement restricting Iran's nuclear program before September 2025 appears **low to moderate**. The fundamental disagreement over uranium enrichment represents a significant obstacle, with both sides maintaining firm positions that appear difficult to reconcile within the given timeframe.

Several factors support this assessment:

1. The "zero enrichment" demand from the US directly conflicts with Iran's stated red line

2. Five rounds of talks have already occurred with limited progress, suggesting resolution of core issues remains distant

3. Growing skepticism in Tehran indicates Iranian officials may be preparing their domestic audience for a potential failure of negotiations[4]

4. Reports suggest Iran may be deliberately stalling negotiations to avoid sanctions[3]

5. The timeframe (approximately three months remaining) is relatively short for resolving such fundamental disagreements

However, factors that could increase the likelihood of an agreement include:

1. The possibility of an interim or partial agreement that defers the most contentious issues

2. Economic pressures on Iran that might eventually lead to compromise

3. The threat of military action creating urgency to reach a diplomatic solution

## Conclusion

While negotiations continue, the substantial gap between the US demand for zero enrichment and Iran's insistence on maintaining enrichment capabilities presents a formidable obstacle to reaching an agreement that meets the specified criteria before September 2025. The most likely outcome appears to be either continued negotiations beyond the September deadline or a collapse of talks due to irreconcilable positions on uranium enrichment.
