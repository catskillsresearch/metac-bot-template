# Will the Fed Cut Rates by 50 bps at Their September Meeting?

Based on information available as of August 2024, there are several factors to consider when assessing whether the Federal Reserve will implement a 50 basis point (bps) rate cut at their September 17-18, 2024 meeting.

## Current Status and Recent Trends

As of July 31, 2024, the Federal Reserve maintained its federal funds target rate at 5.25%-5.50%, where it had been since July 2023[3]. However, Fed Chair Jerome Powell signaled a significant shift in policy direction, stating that the time for a rate cut "is approaching" and that a reduction "could be on the table at our September meeting"[3]. This marked a notable change in the Fed's stance compared to earlier in the year.

The economic landscape has evolved considerably throughout 2024:

- **Inflation**: The Fed has described inflation as "somewhat elevated," a more moderate description than its previous characterization as simply "elevated," indicating progress toward their 2% target[3].

- **Labor Market**: The unemployment rate has increased to 4.3% from a historic low of 3.5% just 12 months prior, raising concerns about potential recession[5].

- **Market Expectations**: As of July 31, 2024, markets were projecting three rate cuts in 2024, which would take the federal-funds rate down to 4.50%-4.75% by December[1].

## Size of Potential Rate Cut

While a September rate cut appears increasingly likely, the available information presents mixed signals regarding its potential magnitude:

- Most analysts initially expected a standard 25 bps cut to begin the easing cycle. As of early August 2024, economists were beginning to project that the Fed could implement either quarter-point cuts or potentially larger half-point moves at the remaining meetings of 2024[5].

- The deteriorating labor market conditions could prompt more aggressive action. Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at Carson Group, noted that "inflation is slowing and the Fed doesn't need rates this high anymore"[3].

- Fed Chair Powell has been careful not to commit to specific guidance on the pace of rate cuts, stating: "You would think, base case, that policy rates would move down from here, but I don't want to give specific guidance on the pace of when that would happen"[3].

## Factors Influencing the Decision

Several key factors will influence the Fed's September decision:

1. **Economic Data**: Powell emphasized that the decision will depend on forthcoming inflation data[3]. If inflation continues to moderate and labor market weakness persists, the case for a larger cut strengthens.

2. **Recession Concerns**: The rising unemployment rate has fueled fears about a potential recession[5]. If economic indicators continue to deteriorate, the Fed may opt for a more aggressive 50 bps cut to provide stronger support.

3. **Policy Flexibility**: The Fed has shifted from projecting three cuts in 2024 (as of March) to potentially just one cut (as of June)[4]. However, analysts at Morningstar believe this outlook is "too pessimistic" and expect "two or three times in 2024, rather than just once"[4].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several uncertainties could affect the Fed's decision:

- **Data Dependency**: The Fed has consistently emphasized that its decisions are data-dependent. Upcoming economic reports before the September meeting will significantly influence the size of any potential cut.

- **Global Economic Conditions**: International economic developments and financial market stability could impact the Fed's decision-making process.

- **Communication Strategy**: The Fed may be cautious about starting with a larger-than-standard cut to avoid signaling excessive concern about economic conditions.

## Conclusion

Based on information available as of August 2024, a September rate cut appears increasingly likely as both inflation retreats and the labor market weakens[5]. While most initial expectations pointed to a standard 25 bps cut, deteriorating economic conditions have led some economists to begin projecting the possibility of a larger 50 bps reduction[5]. 

The Fed's decision will ultimately depend on economic data released between now and the September meeting, with particular attention to inflation metrics and labor market indicators. Chair Powell's cautious approach to providing specific guidance suggests the Fed is maintaining flexibility in its policy options while preparing markets for the beginning of an easing cycle[3].
