# Tour de France 2025 Winner Forecast

As we approach the 112th edition of the Tour de France starting July 5, 2025, in Lille, the cycling world is anticipating another potentially historic battle. Based on current information as of May 2025, here's my analysis of the likely winner:

## Current Contender Status

The field for the 2025 Tour de France features four primary contenders:

**Tadej Pogačar (UAE Team Emirates-XRG)** is the clear favorite, entering as the defending champion and current World Champion[1]. At 26 years old, the Slovenian is arguably not yet at his peak despite already having claimed three Tour victories (2020, 2021, 2024)[4]. Pogačar's early 2025 form has been exceptional, winning the UAE Tour in February and Strade Bianche despite a crash[1].

**Jonas Vingegaard (Visma-Lease a Bike)** remains Pogačar's most formidable rival. The Danish rider won consecutive Tours in 2022 and 2023 and finished second in 2024[5]. Between Pogačar and Vingegaard, they've claimed the last five Tour de France victories[4].

**Remco Evenepoel (Soudal-Quick Step)** finished third in his Tour debut in 2024, claiming the best young rider jersey. The Belgian has publicly stated his intention to compete directly with Vingegaard and Pogačar this year[5]. His time trial abilities make him particularly dangerous on stage five's flat ITT.

**Primož Roglič (Bora-Hansgrohe)** enters with four Vuelta titles and one Giro crown but has experienced persistent misfortune at the Tour de France throughout his career[5]. Despite his "Tour curse" of crashes and injuries, his talent makes him a perpetual podium threat.

## Historical Patterns & Recent Form

The historical dominance of Pogačar and Vingegaard is striking - they've monopolized the top two positions for several years. However, Pogačar's 2024 season was particularly remarkable, achieving the rare Triple Crown by winning the Giro d'Italia, Tour de France, and World Championships in the same year[5].

In early 2025, Pogačar has opted for an unorthodox preparation, focusing on one-day classics rather than stage races after his February UAE Tour victory[1]. This approach seems to be working, as evidenced by his dramatic Strade Bianche win after recovering from a crash[1].

The preliminary startlist also indicates strong team support for the favorites, with Vingegaard backed by talents like Wout Van Aert, Simon Yates, and 2023 Vuelta winner Sepp Kuss[3]. UAE Team Emirates-XRG features Juan Ayuso, who has shown excellent form by winning races in early 2025[1].

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on current information, the probability distribution for the 2025 Tour de France winner appears to be:

**Tadej Pogačar**: 55-60% probability
- Defending champion with exceptional early 2025 form
- Currently considered "the best rider in the peloton"[1]
- Has won 3 of the last 5 Tours
- Demonstrated ability to overcome adversity (crash recovery at Strade Bianche)

**Jonas Vingegaard**: 20-25% probability
- Two-time champion (2022, 2023) and 2024 runner-up
- Proven ability to challenge Pogačar
- Strong team support from Visma-Lease a Bike
- Some uncertainty about his current form compared to Pogačar

**Remco Evenepoel**: 8-10% probability
- Improving Tour rider with podium experience (3rd in 2024)
- Strong time trial capabilities that suit specific stages
- Still developing as a Grand Tour contender

**Primož Roglič**: 5-7% probability
- Experienced Grand Tour winner (4x Vuelta, 1x Giro)
- Historically unlucky at the Tour
- Capable of brilliant performances when healthy

**Others (including Juan Ayuso, Carlos Rodríguez)**: 3-5% probability
- Ayuso has shown excellent form in 2025
- Rodríguez finished 5th with a stage win in his 2023 Tour debut[5]

## Uncertainties and Limitations

Several factors could significantly alter this forecast:

1. **Health and crashes** - The Tour is notoriously dangerous, and crashes can eliminate favorites instantly
2. **Team dynamics** - UAE Team Emirates-XRG has multiple potential leaders (Pogačar, Ayuso, etc.)
3. **Course specifics** - The 2025 route may favor certain rider characteristics
4. **Form development** - Riders' conditions can change dramatically in the weeks before the Tour
5. **Weather conditions** - Extreme heat, rain, or wind could impact performance unpredictably

The forecast currently favors Pogačar significantly, but cycling history reminds us that the Tour de France often delivers the unexpected. With approximately six weeks until the Grand Départ, riders' preparation and form will continue to evolve.
