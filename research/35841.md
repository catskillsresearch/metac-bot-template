# Tour de France 2025 Winner Forecast

As of May 2025, with the Tour de France less than two months away, the cycling world is anticipating another thrilling battle for the yellow jersey. Based on current information, I'll assess the contenders' chances of standing atop the podium in Paris on July 27, 2025.

## Leading Contenders

### Tadej Pogačar (UAE Team Emirates)
Pogačar enters as the overwhelming favorite to claim his fourth yellow jersey in 2025[3]. The 26-year-old Slovenian is coming off an extraordinary 2024 season where he achieved the rare Triple Crown - winning the Giro d'Italia, Tour de France, and World Championships[4]. Despite already having three Tour wins (2020, 2021, 2024) and two second-place finishes in the past five years, many analysts believe Pogačar is not yet at his peak powers[3]. His versatility across different terrains makes him exceptionally difficult to beat in a three-week race.

**Probability assessment: 55-60%**

### Jonas Vingegaard (Visma-Lease A Bike)
As the 2022 and 2023 champion and 2024 runner-up, Vingegaard remains Pogačar's biggest rival[4]. The Danish climber has consistently proven himself capable of challenging and beating Pogačar, particularly in the high mountains. However, there appears to be a question mark hanging over Vingegaard for the 2025 race, though the specific concern isn't detailed in the available information[4]. The head-to-head battle between Vingegaard and Pogačar has become one of cycling's greatest rivalries.

**Probability assessment: 20-25%**

### Remco Evenepoel (Soudal-Quick Step)
The Belgian phenom finished third and claimed the best young rider's jersey in his Tour de France debut in 2024[4]. Evenepoel, a former Vuelta a España champion (2022), has publicly stated his aim to compete directly with Vingegaard and Pogačar in 2025. His exceptional time trial abilities make him a particular threat on stage five's flat individual time trial, where he could potentially take the yellow jersey[4].

**Probability assessment: 10-15%**

### Primož Roglič (Bora-Hansgrohe)
The experienced Slovenian has an impressive palmares with four Vuelta titles and one Giro crown but has suffered years of misfortune at the Tour de France, including crashes and injuries[4]. If Roglič can finally break his "Tour curse," he has the all-around ability to challenge for the podium and potentially the win.

**Probability assessment: 5-8%**

## Dark Horses

### Carlos Rodríguez (Ineos Grenadiers)
After coming 5th overall and taking a stage win in his Tour debut in 2023, Rodríguez will lead Ineos Grenadiers[4]. While not mentioned among the top four contenders, his trajectory suggests he could surprise if the favorites falter.

**Probability assessment: 2-3%**

### Other Potential Contenders
While not specifically mentioned in the available information, riders like João Almeida and Juan Ayuso (both UAE Team Emirates teammates of Pogačar) could be factors, though their roles would likely be in support of their team leader unless circumstances change.

**Probability assessment for all others combined: 2-3%**

## Key Factors That Could Influence the Outcome

1. **Course Profile**: While specific details about the 2025 route aren't provided, the balance of time trials, mountain stages, and potential cobblestone sections will favor different riders.

2. **Team Strength**: UAE Team Emirates has built a formidable squad around Pogačar, while Visma-Lease A Bike has traditionally provided excellent support for Vingegaard.

3. **Injuries and Form**: The Tour is notoriously dangerous, and crashes or pre-race injuries could dramatically alter the competitive landscape.

4. **Tactical Approaches**: The rivalry between Pogačar and Vingegaard has evolved over multiple Tours, with each team developing strategies to counter the other's strengths.

## Conclusion

Based on the available information as of May 2025, Tadej Pogačar stands as the clear favorite to win the 2025 Tour de France, seeking his fourth yellow jersey. His dominance in 2024, winning the Triple Crown, demonstrates his exceptional form. However, the unpredictable nature of the Tour de France means that Jonas Vingegaard, Remco Evenepoel, and Primož Roglič all represent credible threats to his ambitions if circumstances align in their favor.

The race beginning in Lille on July 5, 2025, promises three weeks of dramatic racing before concluding on the Champs-Élysées in Paris on July 27, 2025.
