## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- No former US president has ever been incarcerated, setting a powerful precedent. Indictments and jail time for high-ranking US political figures are rare, especially for those with ongoing political influence.
- As of May 2, 2022, Donald Trump was under investigation for several legal matters, including:
  - Business practices and finances (multiple state and federal probes)
  - The January 6, 2021, Capitol attack (subject of a House investigation)
  - Previous impeachments (2019, 2021), but not convicted in the Senate[1].
- Trump had publicly indicated intentions to run for president in 2024, maintaining a significant base of political support[1].
- No public record as of May 2025 indicates Trump has been convicted of a crime leading to a custodial sentence, let alone incarcerated for 30+ days.

## 2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- As of May 2025, recent Supreme Court decisions have focused on immigration policy, not Trump’s legal exposure[1][2][3].
- There is no evidence in the current search results or major news reporting of any conviction or pending sentence that would result in Trump’s incarceration.
- Trump’s legal and political stature remains unusually elevated for a figure facing such investigations, making prosecution and incarceration even less likely compared to reference cases.

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- News outlets (France24, Politico, Times of India) confirm recent Supreme Court decisions on unrelated Trump administration policies but do not mention criminal proceedings against Trump himself[1][2][3].
- Wikipedia entries and official congressional records provide context for Trump’s impeachments and ongoing investigations up to 2022.

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- Legal proceedings, especially at this level, can be delayed by appeals or procedural maneuvers, pushing any possible sentence beyond 2030.
- Political considerations (e.g., Trump’s candidacy or presidency) could further complicate or delay criminal proceedings.
- Measurement: The question requires a 30+ day custodial period beginning before January 1, 2030. Even if convicted, sentences could be stayed pending appeal or commuted.

## Probabilistic Assessment

- **Reference cases**: Probability of a former US president being incarcerated is close to zero based on US history.
- **Adjustments for Trump’s situation**: While Trump faces unique and significant legal challenges, as of May 2025 there is no evidence of imminent incarceration.
- **Estimated probability** (as of May 2025, based on available information): **Low** (well below 10%) that Donald Trump will be jailed or incarcerated before January 1, 2030.
