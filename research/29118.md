### Key Factual Information as of October 23, 2024

- The 2024 World Series will feature the New York Yankees (American League champions) and the Los Angeles Dodgers (National League champions), with the series scheduled to begin on October 25, 2024[2][1].
- The World Series is played in a best-of-7 format, so a 7-game series is possible under normal circumstances[2].
- As of October 23, 2024, no games in the 2024 World Series have been played; the series outcome is entirely undetermined[2][1][5].
- Expert analysis and predictions are divided:
  - Some analysts favor the Dodgers, citing their offensive depth and postseason performance, and suggest their bullpen and lineup could be decisive[1][5].
  - Others highlight the Yankees' strong pitching, hitting depth, and postseason momentum, with some predictions favoring the Yankees to win the series, often in fewer than 7 games (e.g., 4-2)[3].
- There are no reports of schedule changes, cancellations, or format adjustments that would prevent the series from potentially reaching 7 games[2][1].
- The Dodgers and Yankees both had strong regular seasons, finishing first and second in run differential, respectively[3].
- Injuries could play a role: the Dodgers' rotation is affected by injuries, and Freddie Freeman is managing an ankle issue, but both teams are expected to field competitive lineups[3].
- Regular season head-to-head results (Dodgers won 2 of 3 at Yankee Stadium) are considered by analysts to have little bearing on the World Series outcome[5].
