As a forecasting analyst examining whether the US will pass a federal bill on AI regulation before January 1, 2026, I'll analyze the current landscape and relevant factors affecting this prediction.

## Current Regulatory Status

As of May 2025, the United States still has not passed comprehensive federal artificial intelligence laws and regulations[5]. Instead, AI governance in the US continues to function under a patchwork system comprising:

- Executive orders
- State-level legislation
- Sector-specific regulatory oversight
- Industry self-regulation

This fragmented approach has persisted despite increasing AI development and adoption across sectors. The current administration has taken a distinctly different approach to AI regulation compared to its predecessor.

## Recent Executive Actions

In January 2025, President Trump issued an Executive Order titled "Removing Barriers to American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence," which explicitly revoked previous AI policies established by the Biden administration[2]. This executive order represents a significant shift in federal approach, emphasizing:

- Removal of "barriers to American AI innovation"
- Elimination of mandatory federal red-teaming requirements
- Discontinuation of watermarking requirements for AI-generated content
- No federal requirements for model cards, incident reports, or bias audits[5]

This deregulatory approach signals the current administration's preference for minimal federal intervention in AI development and deployment.

## Legislative Activities in 2025

Despite the executive branch's deregulatory stance, Congress has shown some appetite for AI-related legislation:

1. **CREATE AI Act (H.R.2385)** - Introduced on March 26, 2025, this bill aims "to establish the National Artificial Intelligence Research Resource, and for other purposes"[4]. However, this appears focused on research infrastructure rather than comprehensive regulation.

2. **TAKE IT DOWN Act** - Passed in April 2025, this legislation specifically addresses nonconsensual AI-generated intimate imagery, representing a narrow domain-specific approach rather than comprehensive AI regulation[5].

3. **State-Level Activity** - Throughout 2025, state legislatures have continued introducing various AI-related bills, potentially filling the void left by federal inaction[1].

## Regulatory Agency Actions

While comprehensive legislation is absent, federal agencies are incorporating AI considerations into their existing regulatory frameworks:

- The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has prioritized AI in its 2025 examination priorities[3].
- The New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) has released AI cybersecurity guidelines[3].

These agency-level actions suggest that sector-specific regulation may continue to develop independently of comprehensive federal legislation.

## Analysis of Passage Likelihood

Based on the available information, several factors weigh against the passage of a comprehensive federal AI regulation bill before January 1, 2026:

1. **Executive Branch Opposition**: The current administration's explicit deregulatory approach creates a significant obstacle for any comprehensive regulatory legislation.

2. **Limited Legislative Progress**: While some AI-related bills have been introduced, they appear focused on specific domains or research infrastructure rather than comprehensive regulation.

3. **Time Constraints**: With less than 8 months remaining until the January 1, 2026 deadline, the legislative calendar offers limited opportunity for introducing, debating, and passing complex regulatory legislation, especially considering the typical pace of federal lawmaking.

4. **Regulatory Fragmentation**: The continuing development of agency-specific and state-level approaches may reduce urgency for comprehensive federal action.

## Probabilistic Assessment

Given the current trajectory of federal AI policy, the executive branch's deregulatory stance, and the limited timeframe remaining, the probability of a comprehensive federal AI regulation bill passing before January 1, 2026 appears low (approximately 15-25%).

The most likely scenario is continued development of:
- Domain-specific federal legislation (like the TAKE IT DOWN Act)
- Agency-level regulatory guidance
- State-level regulatory frameworks
- Industry self-regulation standards

For this forecast to change significantly, we would need to see either:
1. A dramatic shift in the administration's approach to AI regulation
2. Strong bipartisan congressional momentum for comprehensive regulation
3. A major AI-related crisis that creates urgent demand for federal intervention

None of these catalyst events appear imminent based on current information.
