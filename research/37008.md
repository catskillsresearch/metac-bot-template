### Key Factual Information

- The Samoan government declared a state of emergency (SOE) for the island of Upolu on March 31, 2025, in response to a severe power crisis. The SOE was set for 30 days, expiring on April 29, 2025[2][3][5].
- The SOE was officially proclaimed by the Head of State, following Cabinet approval, and was intended to address the electricity shortfall and its economic and social impacts[1][2][5].
- The government’s public statements indicated that temporary generators were expected to be operational before the end of April, with permanent solutions anticipated in August 2025[2].
- As of April 21, 2025, there are no credible reports or official announcements indicating that the SOE will be extended beyond its scheduled end date of April 29, 2025[3][4].
- The SOE was limited to Upolu and did not apply to Savaii, Samoa’s other main island[1][3].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- The situation is dynamic, and the government could issue an extension or a new SOE at any time, but as of the knowledge cutoff (April 21, 2025), no such extension has been announced.
- Official government channels and local media should be monitored for any last-minute changes, but none are reported in the sources available up to April 21, 2025.

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Samoa Observer, Samoa Government official releases, and international news agencies have all reported the SOE’s start and scheduled end date[1][2][3][5].

### Conclusion

Based on all available information as of April 21, 2025, Samoa’s state of emergency is scheduled to expire on April 29, 2025, and there is no evidence that it will be in effect on April 30, 2025.

**Forecast:** No, a state of emergency is not expected to be in effect in Samoa on April 30, 2025, unless new information emerges after April 21, 2025.
