### Key Facts

- Samoa declared a state of emergency (SOE) for the island of Upolu due to a severe power crisis, effective from March 31, 2025, for 30 days, expiring at the end of April 29, 2025[1][2][3][4].
- The SOE was officially proclaimed by the Head of State, following Cabinet advice, and coordinated by the National Emergency Operations Center (NEOC)[3].
- Multiple credible sources, including the Samoa Observer, Xinhua, and government press releases, confirm the SOEâ€™s duration and scope[1][2][3][4].
- As of April 21, 2025, there are no public announcements or credible reports indicating that the SOE will be extended or renewed beyond its scheduled end date of April 29, 2025.

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- The situation is dynamic, and the government could potentially extend the SOE if the power crisis persists, but as of April 21, 2025, no such extension has been declared or reported.
- The SOE applies specifically to Upolu, not the entire country[1].

### Conclusion

Based on all available information as of April 21, 2025, a state of emergency in Samoa is scheduled to expire on April 29, 2025. There is no evidence of an extension or new declaration that would keep the SOE in effect on April 30, 2025. Therefore, the answer is:

**No, a state of emergency is not scheduled to be in effect in Samoa on April 30, 2025, according to all credible sources available as of April 21, 2025.**[1][2][3][4]
