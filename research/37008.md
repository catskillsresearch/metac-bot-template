## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Ukraine's most recent presidential election was scheduled for March/April 2024, but has been indefinitely postponed due to martial law imposed after Russia's February 2022 invasion[1][2][4].
- Under Ukrainian law, elections are not permitted while martial law is in effect. This legal restriction is upheld by both the executive branch and parliament to ensure stability during wartime[1][2].
- As of May 2025, martial law remains in force, with no public indication of its imminent lifting[1][2][4].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- President Zelenskyy consistently reiterates that elections will only be announced after the end of active hostilities and the lifting of martial law, emphasizing that these conditions are non-negotiable for any electoral process[4].
- The Ukrainian parliament has passed resolutions affirming Zelenskyy's legitimacy beyond his original term and reiterating that elections are not possible during wartime[2].
- While some U.S. officials and Western leaders have called for elections, Ukrainian authorities have not wavered in their position, citing security, logistical, and societal unity concerns[2][4].
- Public opinion surveys show a growing majority of Ukrainians oppose holding elections during the ongoing war, with support for elections during martial law at just 15% in February 2025[1][3].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The current legal framework and official statements can be verified via Ukrainian government and parliament communications, as well as reputable international news outlets and think tanks such as the Wilson Center, LA Times, Atlantic Council, and Times of India[1][2][3][4].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- The primary uncertainty is the duration of martial law and the timeline of the ongoing conflict with Russia. A sudden ceasefire or political breakthrough before July 1, 2025, could theoretically prompt a change[2][4]. However, there is no current evidence or official signal that such a development is imminent.
- No technical measurement uncertainties exist, as the question hinges on an official government announcement, which is trackable and verifiable.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the clear legal, political, and public opinion barriers, and the absence of any official moves toward lifting martial law or scheduling elections, the probability that Ukraine will announce a presidential election date before July 1, 2025, is extremely low.

### Probabilistic Estimate: Less than 5%
