## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The PRC has long sought to bring Taiwan under its control, considering it a breakaway province. However, Taiwan (the Republic of China, ROC) continues to govern itself independently, with its own government, military, and constitution[5].
- Since the inauguration of President Lai Ching-te in May 2024, the PRC has intensified its pressure campaign against Taiwan. This includes a significant increase in military aircraft incursions into Taiwan’s Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ), legal threats against advocates of Taiwanese independence, and hybrid warfare tactics such as political and cognitive operations[1][2][5].
- Despite these escalations, there is no evidence that the PRC has gained de facto or de jure control over any part of Taiwan’s main territory (including the islands of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu)[1][2][5].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- In June 2024, the PRC released new legal guidelines criminalizing advocacy for Taiwanese independence, with penalties up to the death sentence. These guidelines are deliberately vague and could be broadly interpreted, but they have not resulted in any transfer of control over Taiwanese territory[1][3].
- The PRC has increased the frequency and scale of military exercises near Taiwan, including record numbers of ADIZ violations in July 2024. These actions are intended to coerce and exhaust Taiwan’s defenses but have not resulted in territorial gains[2].
- The PRC has also detained Taiwanese fishing vessels for alleged violations of Chinese waters, but these incidents have occurred outside the main populated areas of Taiwan and do not constitute control over significant territory or population[1][3].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- No reliable, independent news articles or official reports assert that the PRC controls at least half of Taiwan’s territory or population as of July 15, 2024.
- There are no reports from credible sources that the ROC government is acting as a puppet of the PRC or that voluntary unification has occurred[1][2][5].
- Public opinion in Taiwan remains strongly opposed to unification, with the majority favoring the status quo and only a small minority supporting immediate unification[5].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- The PRC’s hybrid warfare tactics—legal, economic, and psychological pressure—are designed to undermine Taiwan’s resolve and international support but fall short of actual control as defined by the resolution criteria[5].
- Military incursions and legal threats increase tension and risk but do not equate to territorial or governmental control.
- Measurement of “control” requires clear evidence of PRC administration or occupation of territory, or credible, independent reporting that meets the specified thresholds. No such evidence exists as of the knowledge cutoff.

## Conclusion

Based on all available factual information as of July 15, 2024, there is no evidence that the People’s Republic of China controls at least half of Taiwan, nor that the ROC is a puppet state of the PRC, nor that voluntary unification has occurred. The PRC’s actions have increased pressure and tension but have not resulted in control over significant territory or population in Taiwan.
