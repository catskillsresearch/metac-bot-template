### 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The last major government push for a crewed mission beyond the Earth-Moon system was the Apollo program, which succeeded under extraordinary circumstances and intense Cold War competition.
- Since then, government space agencies have shifted focus primarily to low Earth orbit and cislunar (Earth-Moon) activities.
- As of December 2022, NASA's roadmap for human exploration targets the 2030s for a crewed Mars mission, with no commitment for a launch before 2030[1].
- Concepts such as Lockheed Martin's Mars Base Camp proposed Mars orbit missions as early as 2028, but these were not official, funded NASA programs as of late 2022[1].

### 2. Recent Announcements and Policies

- In 2015, NASA affirmed a broad goal of sending humans to Mars in the 2030s and outlined a phased approach: Earth Reliant (ISS), Proving Ground (cislunar/Gateway), and Earth Independent (Mars)[1].
- As of late 2022, the Artemis program (NASA's main crewed exploration effort) is focused on returning humans to the Moon, with Artemis II scheduled no earlier than 2025 and lunar surface missions to follow[5].
- No government agency has announced a funded, scheduled, and technically feasible crewed Mars mission before 2030[1][5].

### 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- NASA's official Mars exploration roadmap and Artemis schedules[2][3][5].
- Wikipedia's compiled list of crewed Mars mission plans and timelines[1].

### 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- Government space programs are subject to political shifts, budget constraints, and technical delays, which can push timelines back by years or decades.
- While government contractors have proposed earlier timelines (e.g., Mars Base Camp), these were not funded or adopted as official programs by NASA or other agencies as of December 2022[1].
- Technology for long-duration life support, deep-space propulsion, and crew health for Mars-class missions is still under development as of 2022[3].

### Probabilistic Assessment

Based on the above, as of December 2022, the probability that a government space agency will launch a crewed mission with the intent to leave the Earth-Moon system before 2030 is **very low**. While paper concepts exist, there was no official schedule, funding, or technical readiness for such a mission at that time. A reasonable probabilistic estimate would be **less than 5%**.

> As of December 2022, no government space agency has committed to or is on track to launch a crewed mission outside the Earth-Moon system before 2030, making it highly unlikely that such a mission will occur within this timeframe[1][3][5].
