# Spain vs. Eurozone Economic Growth Forecast (Q3 2024-Q3 2025)

## Historical Trends and Current Status

Spain has consistently outperformed the Eurozone in terms of economic growth in recent years. Between 2023 and 2024 (Q3), Spain's economy grew by 3.5% compared to just 0.9% for the Eurozone, demonstrating a significant growth differential. This trend of Spanish economic outperformance appears set to continue through 2025.

The Spanish economy ended 2024 with strong growth of 3.2%, approximately four times the average for the euro area[5]. This robust performance has established a solid foundation for continued growth into 2025.

## Growth Forecasts and Projections

Multiple economic forecasts indicate Spain will maintain its growth advantage over the Eurozone in 2025:

- The European Commission projects Spain's economy will expand by 3.0% in 2024 before moderating to 2.3% in 2025[1].
- Spain is expected to continue growing above the euro area average in 2025, supported by strong household consumption[2].
- Funcas forecasts Spanish economic growth of 1.8% in 2025, which they expect will "continue to outpace the European average by a considerable margin"[3].
- BBVA Research projects 2.0% GDP growth for Spain in 2025, which represents a downward revision from their previous forecast of 2.5%[4].
- The Spanish government maintains its GDP growth forecast at 2.6% for 2025 and confirms that "Spain will continue to lead economic growth among the main European economies in 2025"[5].

## Growth Drivers

Several factors are expected to support Spain's continued economic outperformance:

- **Labor market resilience**: Strong job creation and continued employment growth will support household consumption[1][5].
- **Investment strengthening**: Investment is expected to accelerate in 2025, contributing to overall growth[1].
- **Productivity improvements**: A sustained increase in productivity per employee is anticipated[5].
- **Wage growth**: Expected increases in employee salaries, combined with decelerating inflation, will improve citizens' purchasing power[5].
- **Private consumption**: The factors above will help maintain positive evolution of private consumption[5].

## Challenges and Uncertainties

Despite the positive outlook, several factors could impact Spain's growth trajectory:

- The Spanish government's analysis includes a central scenario with tariff impacts reducing GDP by 0.1 percentage points in 2025[5].
- BBVA Research cites several challenges that led to their downward revision of Spain's 2025 growth forecast, including:
  - Adjustment in public accounts
  - Expected weakness in the eurozone
  - Poor performance of private investment
  - Stagnating productivity alongside rising labor costs
  - Supply constraints due to lack of skilled labor or regulation
  - Economic policy uncertainty[4]

## Conclusion

Based on the available forecasts and economic indicators as of February 2025, Spain is highly likely to outperform the Eurozone in economic growth between Q3 2024 and Q3 2025. All major forecasts project Spain's growth to exceed the Eurozone average, with Spanish growth estimates ranging from 1.8% to 2.6% for 2025. The consistent historical pattern of Spanish outperformance, combined with multiple independent forecasts projecting continued stronger growth, strongly suggests Spain will maintain its growth advantage over the Eurozone during the specified period.
