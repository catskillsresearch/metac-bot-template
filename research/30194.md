## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of October 5, 2024, Nvidia was ranked #3 in the world by market capitalization, behind Microsoft and Apple, according to Companies Market Cap[1][4].
- Nvidia's market cap has experienced explosive growth due to the AI boom. In June 2023, it reached $1 trillion for the first time. By March 1, 2024, it closed above $2 trillion, and a little over three months later, it surpassed $3 trillion[2].
- In June 2024, Nvidia briefly became the most valuable company in the world, overtaking both Microsoft and Apple, driven by investor enthusiasm for AI and a stock split that boosted its share price[2].
- As of May 2025, Nvidia's market cap is reported at approximately $2.8 trillion, but it is again ranked #3 globally, indicating that Microsoft and Apple have maintained or regained higher valuations[1][3][4].

## Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Metric

- Nvidia's growth has been propelled by its leadership in AI chips and partnerships with major cloud service providers[2][3].
- The company has benefited from strong earnings reports and optimistic forecasts about the future of AI, which have fueled investor confidence and stock price rallies[2].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The definitive source for resolving this question is Companies Market Cap, which ranks public companies by market capitalization based on share price and outstanding shares[1][4].
- Other reputable sources tracking market cap trends include Statista and MacroTrends[2][3].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- Market capitalization is highly volatile and can change rapidly due to fluctuations in share price, investor sentiment, and broader market conditions.
- The Companies Market Cap site may have slight delays in updating data, but it is widely used for real-time rankings[1][4].
- The sustainability of Nvidia's high valuation is uncertain, with some analysts questioning whether the AI-driven rally can continue or if a correction is likely[2].

## Summary

As of the latest available data before November 18, 2024, Nvidia has at times reached the #1 spot in global market capitalization, but as of May 2025, it is ranked #3. The company's position is highly dynamic, driven by the volatile AI sector and competition from Microsoft and Apple. Whether Nvidia will be #1 on December 30, 2024, remains uncertain and will depend on market developments in the weeks leading up to that date.
