## Elon Musk's Net Worth Forecast for June 28, 2025 (Forbes Estimate)

**Key Historical Trends and Current Status**
- As of May 1, 2025, Elon Musk is ranked by Forbes as the world's richest person, with a net worth of $388 billion[1][4].
- April 2025 saw his net worth rise from about $342 billion to $386.5 billion, driven by a 7% recovery in Tesla shares after an early-month dip[3][4].
- Earlier in April, Forbes estimated his net worth at $363 billion[5].

**Recent Announcements and Market Factors**
- Tesla's share price is the primary driver of Musk's net worth; its recent recovery contributed significantly to his gains in April and early May[4].
- No major negative corporate events for Musk's holdings (e.g., Tesla, SpaceX) have been reported in the last month.
- The broader tech market has shown modest positive or stable performance, with the Nasdaq up 0.7% in April[4].

**Key Differences Affecting the Forecast**
- The most significant recent volatility in Musk's net worth was tied to Tesla's share price swings, but the trend since early April has stabilized with a modest upward trajectory.
- No new large-scale asset sales, dilutions, or regulatory hits have been reported in public filings or major news.

**Probabilistic Assessment**
Given these trends and assuming no major unforeseen events before June 28, 2025, it is reasonable to project that Elon Musk's net worth on the Forbes Real-Time Billionaires List will remain near its current level. Daily fluctuations of $10–$30 billion are typical, but absent a major market correction or rally, a central estimate is most defensible.

> **Forecasted Range:**  
> **$370–$410 billion**  
> **Best Point Estimate:**  
> **$390 billion**

**Limitations and Uncertainties**
- The daily volatility of Tesla's stock and private asset valuations introduces uncertainty.
- Forbes' real-time rankings can shift rapidly with market news.
- The estimate assumes no extraordinary events (e.g., large sell-offs, regulatory actions, or major market crashes/rallies) before June 28, 2025.
