# Hawaii Same-Sex Marriage Constitutional Amendment: 2024 Ballot Analysis

Hawaii voters will decide on November 5, 2024, whether to amend the state constitution to remove language that gives the legislature authority to restrict marriage to opposite-sex couples. This analysis examines available information to help forecast the amendment's prospects.

## Historical Context and Current Status

Hawaii's constitution currently contains Article I, Section 23, which states: "The legislature shall have the power to reserve marriage to opposite-sex couples."[1] This provision was adopted in November 1998 when voters approved a constitutional amendment giving the legislature this authority.[2]

Despite this constitutional language, Hawaii has legally recognized same-sex marriage since 2013 when it passed the Marriage Equality Act, two years before the U.S. Supreme Court's 2015 Obergefell v. Hodges decision that legalized same-sex marriage nationwide.[2][4] The current constitutional amendment would remove what supporters consider outdated and discriminatory language from Hawaii's constitution.

The 2024 ballot measure asks voters: "Shall the state constitution be amended to repeal the legislature's authority to reserve marriage to opposite-sex couples?"[2]

## Political Support and Opposition

### Support
The amendment has significant political backing in Hawaii:
- The Democratic Party of Hawaii supports the amendment[1]
- Democratic Governor Josh Green has provided written testimony in favor of the measure[1]
- U.S. House Representative Jill Tokuda (D-2nd) has offered written testimony supporting the amendment[1]
- The Change 23 Coalition has been actively campaigning to remove Section 23[5]

### Opposition
Opposition arguments include:
- Some view it as "political bullying" from Hawaii's liberal Democratic majority[2]
- Traditional marriage proponents argue that marriage has historically been between one man and one woman[2]

## Legal Context and Motivations

A key motivation for the amendment is concern about the future of federal same-sex marriage protections. Supporters cite the U.S. Supreme Court's 2023 ruling repealing Roe v. Wade as raising fears that same-sex marriage rights could be similarly threatened by the conservative-leaning court.[2]

Jeff Hong, chair of the Change 23 Coalition, explained: "The (U.S.) Supreme Court has ruled that same-sex marriage is covered under equal protection under the law, but that was a five-to-four decision, and if it came up to the Supreme Court today, that probably would not have happened."[5]

If federal protections were removed, "a future Legislature would not have to do anything but to pass a law, and then same-sex marriage would go away in Hawai ªi" if the current constitutional language remains.[5]

## Forecasting Considerations

Several factors may influence the outcome of this ballot measure:

1. **Historical precedent**: Hawaii has developed a reputation as a leader in marriage equality, having statutorily legalized same-sex marriage before the Supreme Court ruling.[2]

2. **Political landscape**: Hawaii is generally considered a politically progressive state with Democrats holding significant majorities in the legislature.

3. **Changing attitudes**: Public opinion on same-sex marriage has shifted significantly nationwide since 1998 when the original amendment passed.

4. **Legal concerns**: The potential vulnerability of federal same-sex marriage protections may motivate voters concerned about preserving these rights.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

The available information has several limitations:
- No recent polling data is available in the search results to directly gauge voter sentiment on this specific amendment
- The level of organized opposition to the amendment is unclear from available sources
- Voter turnout and demographic factors that might influence the outcome are not addressed in the available information
