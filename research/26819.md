### Key Facts and Trends

- The account was launched on July 25, 2024, and gained 2.1 million followers in its first 24 hours[3].
- In the six days following launch, Harris’s account grew by approximately 7 million followers, indicating a rapid but likely unsustainable growth rate[1][3].
- For comparison, Donald Trump’s TikTok account (@realdonaldtrump) launched on June 2, 2024, gained 3.2 million followers in its first 24 hours, and reached 9.3 million followers by July 28, 2024—showing a sharp slowdown after the initial surge[1][5].
- Harris’s campaign has actively targeted Gen Z voters and leveraged meme culture, contributing to her rapid early growth[4][5].
- The campaign also operates a secondary account, Kamala HQ (@kamalahq), with 5.6 million followers as of July 31, 2024, but only the primary account is relevant for this forecast[2].

### Recent Announcements and Policies

- The Harris campaign’s shift to TikTok and meme-driven content has been widely reported as a strategic move to engage younger voters[4][5].
- There are no public announcements or policy changes as of July 31, 2024, that would indicate an imminent event likely to cause another massive spike in followers.

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The official follower count for Kamala Harris’s TikTok account can be verified directly on her primary account (@kamalaharris)[1].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- Viral moments, unforeseen political events, or major campaign shifts could alter follower growth dynamics.
- Historical data for political figures on TikTok shows rapid early growth followed by significant deceleration, making sustained exponential growth unlikely[5].
- Only the primary account (@kamalaharris) is considered for this forecast; secondary or campaign accounts are excluded per the resolution criteria.

### Conclusion

Based on current trends, historical analogs, and the observed deceleration in follower growth for similar accounts, it is unlikely that Kamala Harris will have more than 15 million followers on her primary TikTok account by September 30, 2024.
