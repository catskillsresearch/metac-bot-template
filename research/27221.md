### Key Historical Trends and Current Status  
- **Kursk Offensive**: Ukrainian regular forces control ~41 settlements in Kursk Oblast as of August 13, with advances up to 18 miles into Russian territory[2][5]. Geolocated footage confirms Ukrainian positions northeast of Korenovo[2].  
- **Russian Countermeasures**: The Kremlin declared a counterterrorism operation in Kursk, Belgorod, and Bryansk oblasts on August 9, deploying Chechen spetsnaz and Wagner veterans but struggling with fragmented command structures[1][4].  
- **Secondary Fronts**: No confirmed Ukrainian-held territory exceeding five miles in other oblasts. Previous incursions (e.g., Belgorod in 2023) involved temporary raids without sustained control[^1^].  

### Recent Announcements/Policies  
- **Ukrainian Objectives**: Zelensky emphasized Kursk operations aim to "return the initiative" and force Russian redeployments[2][5].  
- **Russian Evacuations**: Over 100,000 civilians evacuated from border areas, indicating expectations of prolonged fighting[^2^].  

### Authoritative Sources for Verification  
- **Institute for the Study of War (ISW)**: Daily maps and assessments of territorial control[1][2].  
- **Geolocated Footage**: OSINT analysts on X/Twitter validate frontline changes[1][4].  

### Limitations and Uncertainties  
- **Data Lag**: ISW updates may reflect 24-48 hour delays in frontline reporting[2].  
- **Definitional Ambiguity**: "Claimed Limit of Ukrainian Advance" labels on ISW maps could include contested areas[^3^].  
- **Resource Allocation**: Ukrainian capacity to open a new front in another oblast by October 1 remains unproven[4][5].  

**Forecast**: As of August 14, 2024, the most probable scenario is **Ukrainian-held territory ≥5 miles inside Russia on October 1 will include Kursk Oblast but not others**, given the absence of comparable operations in other oblasts and the scale of current Kursk commitments.
