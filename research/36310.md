# Forecasting the 2025 Reconciliation Bill's Impact on Medicaid Spending (FY 2025-2034)

Based on the current political landscape and recent developments, I'll analyze the potential impact of the 2025 reconciliation bill on Medicaid spending over the next decade.

## Current Status and Recent Developments

As of May 12, 2025, House Republicans have unveiled significant healthcare cuts through budget reconciliation. The House Energy & Commerce Committee released a reconciliation bill that aims to substantially reduce federal healthcare spending[4]. According to preliminary Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates, the proposal would reduce the deficit by $912 billion between 2025 and 2034, with at least $715 billion of those savings coming from healthcare programs[4].

The CBO analysis indicates that these cuts would result in approximately 8.6 million people losing health insurance coverage by 2034[1][4]. This coverage loss is directly tied to the proposed Medicaid changes, which include implementing new "community engagement requirements" mandating that able-bodied adults complete at least 80 hours per month of work, education, or service to maintain eligibility[4].

## Key Factors Affecting the Forecast

Several important factors will influence the ultimate size of Medicaid cuts:

1. **Scope of proposed changes**: While the total healthcare cuts are estimated at $715 billion, the exact portion specifically targeting Medicaid remains unclear from the CBO's preliminary analysis[1]. The bill includes significant changes to Medicaid eligibility requirements rather than direct funding caps to states that have expanded Medicaid[2].

2. **Political dynamics**: Not all Republicans appear to be aligned on these cuts, with some expressing concerns. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) has publicly voiced reservations in a New York Times op-ed published on May 12, 2025[1]. This internal party division could potentially moderate the final cuts.

3. **Implementation timeline**: The proposal would likely phase in cuts gradually over the 10-year budget window, with the full impact of 8.6 million people becoming uninsured not realized until 2034[1][4].

4. **Optional services impact**: The reconciliation bill would likely force states to cut optional Medicaid services including physical therapy, hospice, and respiratory care for people on ventilators[1].

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on the available information, I estimate the following probability distribution for Medicaid spending cuts over the FY 2025-2034 period:

- **Most likely range (60% confidence)**: $600-700 billion
- **Possible range (30% confidence)**: $500-600 billion or $700-800 billion
- **Low probability scenarios (10% confidence)**: Less than $500 billion or more than $800 billion

This assessment is based on the following reasoning:

1. The CBO has identified at least $715 billion in health program cuts[1][4], and given the focus on Medicaid in the reconciliation instructions, a substantial portion of these cuts will likely come from Medicaid.

2. Hospital groups have already come out strongly against the proposed Medicaid cuts, describing them as "significant cuts to the Medicaid program that will weaken the federal-state Medicaid partnership"[4]. This industry response suggests the cuts are substantial.

3. The implementation of work requirements alone would have significant impact, as while 64% of Medicaid enrollees are already working (44% full-time, 20% part-time), the 80-hour monthly requirement would still disqualify many current beneficiaries[4].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several important limitations affect this forecast:

1. The CBO has only released preliminary estimates, and the final scoring may differ substantially once the full legislative text is analyzed.

2. It remains unclear exactly how much of the $715 billion in health program cuts would come specifically from Medicaid versus other healthcare programs[1].

3. Political negotiations could significantly alter the final bill before passage, especially given the apparent divisions within the Republican party on the scale of Medicaid cuts[1].

4. The impact of work requirements is difficult to precisely quantify, as implementation details and state-by-state responses will vary.

The forecast is based on currently available information as of May 12, 2025, and will need to be updated as more detailed CBO analysis becomes available and as the reconciliation bill moves through Congress.
