# Forecasting the 2025 Reconciliation Bill's Impact on Medicaid Spending

Based on the latest information available as of May 2025, the House of Representatives has passed a reconciliation bill that would significantly reduce Medicaid spending. This analysis examines the available data to help forecast the likely magnitude of these cuts.

## Current Status and Recent Developments

As of May 22, 2025, Republicans in the House of Representatives have passed their reconciliation bill, which now heads to the Senate with a goal of final passage this summer[1]. The bill contains substantial cuts to several social programs, including Medicaid, Medicare, the Affordable Care Act, and SNAP[1].

According to preliminary estimates from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the Medicaid provisions in the reconciliation bill would:

- Cut Medicaid by at least $700 billion over the FY 2025-2034 period[5]
- Result in approximately 7.6-8.6 million people losing Medicaid coverage[3][5]
- Represent an average annual cut of $70 billion to the program[5]

Notably, these Medicaid cuts would be the largest in U.S. history, with the $70 billion average annual reduction being more than 10 times larger than any previous cut to the program[5].

## Comparison to Reference Cases

The scale of the proposed cuts is unprecedented. The preliminary $700+ billion estimate far exceeds any historical reductions to the Medicaid program[5]. The CBO's analysis indicates that these cuts would not simply target administrative inefficiencies but would fundamentally alter the program's coverage and benefits[5].

The reconciliation bill contains multiple provisions affecting Medicaid, including changes to:
- Enrollment and eligibility requirements[3]
- Home equity limits for beneficiaries (currently between $730,000 and $1,097,000 in 2025)[4]
- Potentially reducing affordability and access to care for specific populations[1]

## Key Factors Affecting the Forecast

Several important factors could influence the final impact of the bill on Medicaid spending:

1. **Senate modifications**: The bill must still pass the Senate, which may modify the House-passed version. The final version could contain different levels of Medicaid cuts.

2. **CBO final scoring**: The CBO has not yet reviewed the final House bill, which includes "eleventh-hour revisions that are likely to deepen coverage losses"[1]. The preliminary estimate of $715 billion includes cuts to other health programs beyond Medicaid[5].

3. **Implementation timeline**: The bill's provisions would likely be phased in over time, affecting the year-by-year impact on Medicaid spending.

4. **Potential statutory PAYGO effects**: The bill could trigger additional Medicare cuts estimated at $45 billion for fiscal year 2026 due to statutory PAYGO requirements[2].

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on the available information, the most likely range for Medicaid spending cuts in the final reconciliation bill (if passed and signed into law) is between $700 billion and $800 billion over the ten-year period from FY 2025-2034. This assessment is supported by:

1. The CBO's preliminary estimate of at least $700 billion in Medicaid cuts[5]
2. The reported average annual cut of $70 billion (which would total $700 billion over 10 years)[5]
3. The possibility that late revisions to the House bill could increase the magnitude of cuts[1]

However, there remains significant uncertainty due to:
- Potential Senate changes to the bill
- The lack of a final CBO score for the House-passed version
- Political negotiations that may occur before final passage

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several limitations affect this forecast:
1. The CBO has not yet released a comprehensive analysis of the final House-passed bill
2. The bill still requires Senate approval and could undergo significant changes
3. The exact breakdown between Medicaid cuts and reductions to other health programs is not fully detailed in available sources
4. The implementation timeline for various provisions could affect the year-by-year impact
