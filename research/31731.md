# Forecasting Lukashenko's Vote Percentage in the 2025 Belarusian Presidential Election

Based on available information as of January 2025, here is an analysis of factors that could help forecast Alexander Lukashenko's official vote percentage in the upcoming January 26, 2025 presidential election.

## Historical Electoral Patterns

Alexander Lukashenko has maintained power in Belarus since 1994, with his most recent electoral victory in 2020 showing a pattern of officially reported high support despite questions about electoral integrity:

- In the 2020 presidential election, official results showed Lukashenko receiving 81.04% of the vote[3]
- The main opposition candidate, Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, officially received just 10.23% according to the Central Election Commission[3]
- These results were widely disputed, with independent exit polls at Belarusian diplomatic posts showing dramatically different numbers: Tikhanovskaya at 82% and Lukashenko at approximately 6%[2]

This significant discrepancy between official results and independent polling suggests a pattern that may continue in the 2025 election.

## Current Approval Ratings and Public Opinion

Available polling data indicates a substantial gap between Lukashenko's official electoral results and his actual popularity:

- A survey released in April 2020 by the government-backed Institute of Sociology within Belarus' National Academy of Sciences put Lukashenko's approval rating at just 24% among Minsk residents[2]
- This suggests a significant disconnect between his officially reported electoral support and measured public opinion

## Recent Actions to Boost Popularity

Lukashenko has been implementing various strategies to improve his public image ahead of the 2025 election:

1. **Pardoning Political Prisoners**: Since July 2024, Lukashenko has released over 200 political prisoners in multiple rounds, with the most recent release of 23 individuals occurring on January 18, 2025[4]
2. **Populist Measures**: He has adopted populist policies to enhance his personal image and garner support[1]
3. **Crisis Management**: Following a hurricane in the Gomel region, Lukashenko personally flew to the Mazyr district for inspection, attempting to redirect public dissatisfaction with his administration's response toward officials[1]
4. **Administrative Changes**: The return of influential chief of staff Natalia Petkevich to the Presidential Administration may indicate a strategic shift in managing public perception[1]

## Political Environment and Repression

The political climate leading up to the 2025 election is characterized by intensified repression:

- The 2025 presidential campaign is being conducted in an atmosphere of repression and intimidation[1]
- Security forces are conducting large-scale detentions of activists known since the 2020 protests[1]
- Courts are increasingly labeling materials and organizations as "extremist" and targeting regime opponents[1]
- Despite the pardons, nearly 1,300 political prisoners remained behind bars as of January 2025[4]
- Human rights activists report that arbitrary repression of political opponents has intensified in the run-up to the 2025 elections, with 120 new political prisoners added in November-December 2024 alone[4]

## Limitations in Forecasting

Several factors complicate accurate forecasting of Lukashenko's official vote percentage:

1. **Electoral Control**: Lukashenko "controls vote counting" and has a "vast security apparatus and a noisy state media machine unwavering in its support for him"[3]
2. **Opposition Suppression**: The continued crackdown on opposition figures limits their ability to campaign effectively
3. **Information Control**: Independent polling is restricted, making it difficult to gauge true public sentiment
4. **Historical Precedent**: Previous elections have been described as having results that were "never in any real doubt" and of a "foregone nature"[3]

## Conclusion

Based on historical patterns and the current political environment, Lukashenko's official vote percentage in the 2025 election is likely to remain high despite questions about his actual popularity. His 2020 official result was 81.04%, and given his efforts to boost approval while maintaining tight control over the electoral process, a similar official result could be expected. However, the significant gap between official results and independent measures of his popularity suggests that such figures may not accurately reflect genuine public support.
