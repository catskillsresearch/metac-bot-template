# Forecasting Bluesky's Unique Posters for March 30, 2025

## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

### User Growth Trajectory
Bluesky has experienced significant growth since its launch. As of early 2025, the platform has reached approximately 23.2 million total users with 3.2 million daily active users[1]. The platform's growth has been particularly notable following certain key events:

- When Bluesky opened to the public in early 2024 (removing its invite-only restriction), it experienced a surge of 850,000 new users in just the first day, and 1.5 million new users within a week[5].
- Following the November 5, 2024 presidential election, Bluesky's user base nearly doubled, growing from approximately 12 million to more than 22 million users[4].

### Current Posting Activity
As of November 2024, Bluesky had approximately 1.3 million daily unique posters[1]. This represents a significant portion of the active user base, especially when compared to competitor platforms. Bluesky reports that 30% of its users are active posters, compared to just 1% on Twitter (now X)[4].

### Content Volume
The platform has accumulated impressive engagement metrics:
- Total posts: Over 770 million as of early 2025[5]
- Total posts: Over 658 million (according to another source)[1]
- Total follows: 1.1 billion[1]
- Total likes: 1.1 billion[1]

## 2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

While the search results don't mention specific policy changes that might directly impact posting activity in March 2025, several factors could influence the trajectory:

- Bluesky appears to be positioning itself as an alternative to X (formerly Twitter), particularly appealing to users dissatisfied with changes implemented under Elon Musk's ownership[4].
- The platform has introduced tools like the Bluesky Feed Creator, which allows users to customize their experience without coding knowledge[2]. Such features could potentially increase user engagement and posting activity.

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

Several sources track Bluesky's metrics that could be used to verify the March 30, 2025 figure:

- Jaz's Bluesky index (bsky.jazco.dev) - This appears to be the official resolution source and tracks total posts and other metrics[1][5].
- Theo.io and Similarweb - These sources provide data on daily active users[1].
- Bluesky's own reported data - The platform occasionally releases official user statistics[4][5].
- VQV.APP - Tracks follower counts and popular accounts[1].

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties in Measurement

Several factors create uncertainty when forecasting Bluesky's unique poster count:

### Measurement Variability
The search results indicate some discrepancy in reported metrics. For example, one source reports 658 million total posts while another reports 770 million[1][5]. This suggests potential differences in measurement methodologies or timing.

### Growth Pattern Uncertainty
While Bluesky has shown impressive growth, the pattern has been uneven, with significant spikes following specific events (like the platform opening to the public or the U.S. presidential election)[4][5]. This makes linear projections less reliable.

### Retention Questions
The search results don't provide clear data on user retention rates. While many users joined following the November 2024 election, it's unclear how many remained active posters in the months that followed[4].

### Competitive Landscape
Changes to competitor platforms could impact Bluesky's growth. For example, the search results mention that despite user dissatisfaction with X, the presidential election actually drove increased traffic to that platform, with 46 million U.S. users visiting on November 6, 2024[4].

## Conclusion

Based on available data, forecasting Bluesky's unique posters for March 30, 2025 would need to account for:
- The baseline of approximately 1.3 million daily unique posters (as of November 2024)[1]
- The consistent growth in total users (reaching 23.2 million by early 2025)[1]
- The relatively high poster-to-user ratio (30% compared to competitors' 1%)[4]
- Potential seasonal or event-driven fluctuations

Given these factors, and without any major platform changes or competitive disruptions, the number of unique posters on March 30, 2025 would likely fall within the open bounds specified (500,000 to 2,000,000), with the current trajectory suggesting it would be toward the higher end of that range.
