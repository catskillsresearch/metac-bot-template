# Forecasting Analysis: Will Any Country Have a TFR Below 0.5 Before 2053?

As a forecasting analyst examining whether any country will have a Total Fertility Rate (TFR) below 0.5 before 2053, I'll assess the current situation, historical trends, and factors that may influence future fertility rates.

## Current Global Fertility Landscape

As of 2024-2025, the countries with the lowest fertility rates globally are:

- Taiwan: 1.11 children per woman[2][3]
- South Korea: 1.12 children per woman[2]
- Singapore: 1.17 children per woman[2]
- Ukraine: 1.22 children per woman[2]
- Hong Kong: 1.24 children per woman[2]
- Macau: 1.24 children per woman[2]
- Italy: 1.26 children per woman[2]

These figures represent the lowest fertility rates currently observed worldwide, with Taiwan having the lowest recorded TFR in 2024. The most recent data from the World Bank (2023) shows slightly different figures but confirms the overall pattern of extremely low fertility in East Asian countries and parts of Europe[1].

## Historical Trends and Projections

The historical trajectory of fertility rates in East Asian countries is particularly noteworthy. According to information provided in the query, South Korea's TFR was estimated at approximately 0.77 in 2022, while Hong Kong and Macao had even lower rates at 0.66 and 0.64 respectively. These rates, if accurate, represent a significant decline from the figures shown in the most recent data (2024-2025), suggesting either measurement inconsistencies or very recent policy interventions.

The UN World Population Prospects has consistently projected that fertility rates in low-fertility countries would eventually rebound toward replacement level. However, this assumption has been criticized, particularly for East Asian economies (Korea, Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan), where fertility has continued to decline contrary to UN projections.

## Factors Influencing Future Fertility Rates

Several factors suggest continued downward pressure on fertility rates:

1. **Biological factors**: Declining sperm counts globally represent a biological constraint on fertility
2. **Socioeconomic factors**: Increasing educational attainment, urbanization, and contraceptive use correlate with lower fertility
3. **Demographic factors**: Aging populations and delayed parenthood contribute to lower fertility rates
4. **Policy effectiveness**: Despite pro-natalist policies in many low-fertility countries, few have successfully reversed fertility declines

The persistence of these factors, particularly in East Asian societies, suggests that the downward trend in fertility rates may continue.

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on the available data and trends, I assess the likelihood of any country reaching a TFR below 0.5 before 2053 as **moderate to high** (approximately 60-70% probability).

This assessment is based on:

1. **Current trajectory**: Several East Asian regions have already reached TFRs below 0.7, with a clear downward trend
2. **Projection errors**: Historical underestimation of fertility declines in East Asia suggests that conventional models may be missing important factors
3. **Time horizon**: The 28-year period until 2053 allows sufficient time for the continuation of existing trends
4. **Absence of effective interventions**: Despite awareness of fertility declines, few countries have demonstrated effective policies to significantly reverse them

The countries most likely to breach the 0.5 TFR threshold first would be those already exhibiting the lowest rates: South Korea, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan. Given that Hong Kong and Macau reportedly had TFRs of 0.66 and 0.64 in 2022, they appear to be on a trajectory that could reach 0.5 within the next decade if current trends continue.

## Key Uncertainties

Several uncertainties could affect this forecast:

1. **Policy interventions**: Aggressive and effective pro-natalist policies might slow or reverse fertility declines
2. **Methodological changes**: Changes in how TFR is calculated could affect reported rates
3. **Societal adaptation**: Cultural or social changes might emerge in response to extremely low fertility
4. **Biological limits**: There may be natural floors to how low fertility can go in a population

## Conclusion

The historical trend of consistently declining fertility rates in East Asian countries, combined with the failure of conventional models to accurately predict these declines, suggests that a TFR below 0.5 is plausible before 2053. The regions most likely to experience such extreme low fertility are Hong Kong, Macau, South Korea, and Taiwan, which have already demonstrated fertility rates approaching this threshold. While UN models implicitly assume TFR won't fall below 0.5, the empirical evidence suggests this assumption may be challenged in the coming decades.
