### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- **Record Peaks:** The highest single-day ADIZ violation on record is 56 aircraft, which occurred on July 10, 2024, tying the previous record from October 4, 2021. Both events involved large-scale PLA exercises or joint training, often with aircraft transiting to the Western Pacific[4].
- **Recent Monthly Totals:** June 2024 saw at least 325 violations, and May had 289, making them the second and third-highest monthly totals on record. The only higher month was August 2022 (446), which coincided with China's response to Nancy Pelosi's Taiwan visit[3][4].
- **Trend Since May 2024:** After Lai Ching-te's inauguration on May 20, 2024, the frequency and scale of ADIZ violations increased sharply. In the first ten days of July 2024 alone, there were 232 violations, with several days exceeding 20 aircraft and one day (July 10) exceeding 40[4].
- **Nature of Large Incursions:** Large-scale (>40 aircraft) incursions are typically reactionary, triggered by political events or major exercises. For example, the July 10, 2024, spike was linked to joint air-sea training with the Shandong aircraft carrier[4][5].

### Recent Announcements and Policies

- **Escalated Rhetoric and Pressure:** Chinese officials have maintained fierce rhetoric against the new Taiwanese administration, labeling it as separatist and justifying increased military pressure[3].
- **No Signs of De-escalation:** There have been no public announcements indicating a reduction in PLA activity. Instead, the pattern suggests continued or even heightened pressure in the near term[3][4].

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- **PLATracker Spreadsheet:** The primary source for daily ADIZ violation counts, as used by analysts and referenced in the resolution criteria.
- **Taiwan Ministry of National Defense (MND):** Official daily reports corroborate the data and provide detailed breakdowns of aircraft types and incursion routes[3][4].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- **Event-Driven Spikes:** While the overall trend is upward, days with >40 aircraft remain rare and are usually tied to specific events or exercises. Predicting the exact timing of such events is inherently uncertain.
- **Data Scope:** The reported numbers exclude PLA activity around Taiwanâ€™s outlying islands and only count aircraft entering the de facto ADIZ, not those merely crossing the median line or operating nearby[3][4].
- **Potential for New Exercises:** If China announces or conducts a major exercise during the forecast window, the likelihood of a >40 aircraft day increases substantially.

### Summary Table: Recent Large-Scale ADIZ Violations

| Date           | Aircraft Count | Context/Trigger                        |
|----------------|---------------|----------------------------------------|
| July 10, 2024  | 56            | Joint air-sea training, Shandong carrier|
| Oct 4, 2021    | 56            | Major PLA exercise                     |
| Aug 2022       | Multiple >40  | Pelosi visit, record monthly total     |
| May 23-24, 2024| 42 (May 23)   | Joint Sword 2024A exercise             |

### Conclusion

Given the recent record-setting activity, the ongoing political tensions, and the established pattern of reactionary surges, there is a significant probability that more than 40 Chinese aircraft could violate Taiwan's ADIZ in a single day between August 15 and September 15, 2024. However, such events are still exceptional and typically tied to major exercises or political signaling.
