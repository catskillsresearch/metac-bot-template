## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of 2020, over 400 people had been cryopreserved using techniques involving replacement of blood with cryoprotectants and storage at liquid nitrogen temperatures. No human or mammal had ever been revived from a cryopreserved state[2][3].
- Cryopreservation of cells (e.g., stem cells, embryos, oocytes) is well-established, with improvements in post-thaw viability and increasing market size reflecting confidence in these technologies for specific biomedical applications[1][5].
- For cryopreserved embryos, return rates (actual use after thawing) have ranged between 9% and 63%, but these figures do not translate to whole-organism revival and are not directly comparable to human cryonics[2].
- Growth in the cell cryopreservation market and advances in regenerative medicine are driving research, but these mainly benefit cell and tissue preservation, not whole-body or brain preservation[1][5].

## Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- Increasing investment in cryopreservation infrastructure and improvements in cryoprotective agents are enhancing cell and tissue preservation outcomes, but no policies or breakthroughs as of 2020 have addressed the major technical barriers to revival of cryopreserved humans[1][5].
- Government and healthcare support is focused on biobanking and research, not on clinical revival of cryopreserved humans[5].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Market and academic reports confirm rising investment, scientific interest, and technical progress in cell and tissue cryopreservation, but these do not indicate progress towards revival of whole organisms[1][2][5].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- No successful revival of a mammal, let alone a human, has occurred as of 2020[2][3].
- The technical challenges—cryoprotectant toxicity, ice damage, and the need to restore complex neural structures—remain unsolved.
- Forecasting for 2200 must account for the possibility of radical technological advances but is constrained by the absence of any proven pathway toward human revival.
- The field is speculative, and most experts in neuroscience and cryobiology remain skeptical of eventual success.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the state of the art as of 2020 and allowing for possible, but highly uncertain, technological progress by 2200, the expected percentage of people cryopreserved between 2020 and 2050 who will be revived by 2200 is **extremely low, likely less than 1%**—possibly in the range of **0–0.1%**. This reflects both the absence of precedent and the enormous technical hurdles, while allowing for a small chance that future breakthroughs will make revival feasible for a few individuals.
