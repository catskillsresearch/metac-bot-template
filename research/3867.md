## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Since 1945, there has not been a major war between great powers; this period of "Long Peace" is attributed by some to nuclear deterrence, U.S. hegemony, economic interdependence, and international institutions, though others argue this calm may not last[5].
- The Metaculus community as of 2020 estimated the probability of a "World War 3" before 2050 at about 10%[5].
- Conflict trackers in 2020 identified the Middle East, Korean Peninsula, South China Sea, and Eastern Europe as the most likely regions for conflicts that could escalate to involve great powers[5].

## 2. Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Metric

- In 2020, major risks identified were:
  - Armed confrontation between the U.S. and Iran or its allies, most likely occurring in the Middle East (~45–55°E)[5].
  - Renewed crisis on the Korean Peninsula (~127–129°E)[5].
  - Armed confrontation in the South China Sea (~110–120°E)[5].
  - Escalation of fighting between Russia and Ukraine (~30–40°E)[5].
- No major policy changes in 2020 fundamentally shifted these risk centers, though ongoing tensions and military posturing continued in all highlighted regions[5].

- Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) "Conflicts to Watch in 2020"[5]
- Global Conflict Tracker[1]
- CrisisWatch (International Crisis Group)[2]
- ACLED Conflict Index[3]
- Wikipedia: List of Ongoing Armed Conflicts[4]

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- The forecast is inherently uncertain due to the low probability of WW3 and the unpredictable nature of escalation, especially with new domains like cyberwarfare.
- Some incidents (e.g., cyber or space-based attacks) may not have clear terrestrial longitude, creating ambiguity in resolution.
- The possibility of diplomatic breakthroughs or rapid changes in alliances could alter the risk landscape on short notice.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the above, the most probable longitudes for the start of a hypothetical WW3—as of 2020-04-09—are:

| Region                   | Approximate Longitude |
|--------------------------|----------------------|
| Middle East (Iran, Gulf) | 45–55°E              |
| Korean Peninsula         | 127–129°E            |
| South China Sea          | 110–120°E            |
| Russia-Ukraine Border    | 30–40°E              |

The Middle East and East Asia remain the most likely candidates, with the highest risk longitude ranges concentrated around 40–130°E. The probability of a specific longitude is diffuse, but the mean expected value would fall within this band, with a slight tilt toward the Middle East and East Asia due to the density of flashpoints and recent confrontational incidents[5][1][3].
