## Key Factual Information for Forecasting the 2025 Tokyo Marathon Winner's Country

**1. Historical Trends**
- Since the Tokyo Marathon's debut in 2013, Kenyan runners have won 6 times and Ethiopian runners 5 times in the elite men's race, making these two countries the dominant forces in the event[1].
- No other country has produced a winner in this period, underscoring the strength of East African marathoners[1].

**2. Current Elite Field and Recent Performances**
- The 2025 elite men's field features several top contenders from Kenya and Ethiopia:
  - **Benson Kipruto (Kenya):** Reigning 2024 Tokyo Marathon champion, set a new course record (2:02:16), and has also won the Boston and Chicago Marathons[1].
  - **Deresa Geleta (Ethiopia):** Second place in the 2024 Valencia Marathon with a time of 2:02:38, making him one of the fastest marathoners globally[1].
  - **Vincent Kipkemoi (Kenya):** Finished 3rd in the 2024 Tokyo Marathon and is familiar with the course[1].
  - **Titus Kipruto (Kenya):** 4th in Tokyo 2023, publicly aiming for victory in 2025[1].
  - **Joshua Cheptegei (Uganda):** World record holder in shorter distances, but inexperienced at the marathon distance, with Tokyo 2025 being only his second major marathon[1].
- The Japanese contingent includes Akira Akasaki (6th at the 2024 Paris Olympics) and Yohei Ikeda (2:05:12 PB), but their best times are still behind the top Kenyans and Ethiopians[1].

**3. Recent Announcements and Policies**
- The elite field for 2025 is confirmed to include the above athletes, with pacemakers expected to target sub-2:02:00 times for the lead group[1].
- Japanese runners are targeting national records but are not yet at the level of the top East African contenders[1].

**4. Authoritative Sources for Verification**
- The official Tokyo Marathon website provides details on the elite field, historical results, and race policies[1][2].
- Additional verification can be found through World Athletics and major marathon news outlets.

**5. Limitations and Uncertainties**
- Marathon outcomes can be influenced by weather, injuries, tactical decisions, and unforeseen events.
- While Kenya and Ethiopia are overwhelming favorites, the possibility of an upset by another country, though remote, cannot be fully excluded.
- The question resolves strictly by the registered nationality of the winner, not by ethnicity or residence[1].

## Summary Table: Historical Wins (2013â€“2024)

| Country   | Number of Wins |
|-----------|----------------|
| Kenya     | 6              |
| Ethiopia  | 5              |
| Other     | 0              |

## Conclusion

Based on historical dominance, the strength of the 2025 elite field, and recent performances, the winner of the 2025 Tokyo Marathon is most likely to be from Kenya or Ethiopia, with Kenya having a slight historical edge. The probability of a winner from another country is low, given the current field and past results[1].
