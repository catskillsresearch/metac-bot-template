### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The Botas Gas Agreement, signed in January 2023, is a 13-year contract between Bulgaria’s Bulgargaz and Turkey’s BOTAS, granting Bulgaria access to Turkish gas infrastructure and LNG terminals[1][5].
- As of May 2025, Bulgargaz is not importing gas under the deal but continues to pay substantial fees—approximately 300 million leva (€150 million) in arrears, and about 1 million leva per day for unused capacity[1][2].
- The financial burden and growing public scrutiny in Bulgaria have led to calls for renegotiation and even hints at withdrawal from the deal[1][2].

### Recent Announcements and Policy Developments

- Negotiations to revise the agreement were ongoing as of early May 2025, with a key meeting between energy ministers producing no public breakthrough[1].
- Bulgarian political leaders and media are increasingly vocal about the unsustainable costs and perceived unfairness of the deal, highlighting continued payments for unused gas[2].
- There is no public record of formal cancellation or a clear government announcement of intent to terminate as of June 6, 2025[1].

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- News outlets such as ICIS, Novinite, and Anadolu Agency have reported extensively on the financial strain, government statements, and the status of renegotiations[1][2][5].
- These sources should be monitored for any formal announcements by Bulgargaz, BOTAS, or the respective governments.

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- The details of the contract’s termination clauses and potential penalties for cancellation are not publicly available.
- The ongoing nature of renegotiations introduces significant uncertainty.
- Diplomatic considerations may delay or complicate any move toward formal cancellation.
- Political instability or shifts in leadership could rapidly change the situation.

### Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Based on current information, the probability that the Botas Gas Agreement will be cancelled before July 1, 2025, is higher than during periods of stability, reflecting financial stress, public pressure, and active renegotiation. However, without a formal declaration or imminent indication of cancellation, the odds remain below 50%. Continued monitoring is needed, as any new announcement could rapidly change the outlook.
