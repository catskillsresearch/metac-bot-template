### 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of December 2018, the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) was the fastest spacecraft, having reached 343,112 km/h (0.000318c) relative to the Sun on 6 November 2018.
- PSP was designed to approach the Sun more closely than any previous spacecraft, using multiple Venus gravity assists to continually tighten its orbit and increase its speed.
- NASA projected in 2018 that PSP would ultimately reach speeds of about 690,000 km/h (0.00064c) at its closest approach (perihelion) to the Sun during its planned final orbits[1][2].
- Subsequent records confirm that as of 2024, the Parker Solar Probe has achieved 692,000 km/h (192 km/s, or approximately 0.00064c), fulfilling its design projection[2][3][4].

### 2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- No public announcements as of 2018 (and none found in later records) indicated that any planned or proposed mission would exceed the PSP's projected top speed by 2050.
- The Parker Solar Probe's mission plan, as established pre-2018, set the upper bound for human-made spacecraft velocity out to at least the mid-2020s. No new solar probe or interstellar precursor mission with a higher planned velocity was announced by NASA, ESA, or other major agencies as of 2018.

### 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- NASA mission updates and perihelion event logs provide primary data on Parker Solar Probe's speeds[1][4].
- Guinness World Records confirms PSP's record speed as of 2021, matching the projected ultimate velocity[2].
- Science news coverage and NASA's own mission blog track PSP's progress and confirm it has achieved its designed velocity[3][4].

### 4. Limitations or Uncertainties in Measurement

- Speeds are always relative to a specified frame; for this question, the Sun-centered frame is used.
- Measurement precision is high for perihelion events due to spacecraft tracking and mission design.
- While it is theoretically possible that a breakthrough propulsion concept could be developed and implemented before 2050, no such program existed or was credible as of 2018.
- The only plausible way the record could be broken by 2050 would be through an unforeseen, high-priority mission—such as an interstellar probe with a radical propulsion system—none of which were in advanced planning stages as of the cutoff date.

### Probabilistic Assessment

Given all available information up to December 2018, the most likely scenario is that the Parker Solar Probe’s projected maximum velocity—approximately 0.00064c (692,000 km/h)—will remain the greatest ever attained by a human-made spacecraft in the Sun-centered frame by 2050. The probability of a higher speed being achieved is extremely low (<5%) barring unexpected technological breakthroughs or unprecedented mission announcements.

### Numeric Forecast

- Greatest velocity (in c) attained by a human-made spacecraft before 2050 (Sun-centered frame):  
  **0.00064c** (rounded to significant digits).
