# Forecasting Analysis: Antimicrobial Drug Sales for Livestock in 2024

To forecast whether antimicrobial drug sales for livestock will increase by at least 0.5% in 2024 relative to 2023, I'll analyze recent trends, current market conditions, and relevant policy developments.

## Historical Trends and Current Status

The FDA reported that domestic sales and distribution of medically important antimicrobials for food-producing animals decreased by 2% from 2022 to 2023[1][2]. This represents the most recent year-over-year change available as of December 2024.

However, looking at a longer timeframe reveals a different pattern:

- Sales of antibiotics for livestock increased by 10% between 2017 and 2023, rising from 5.6 million kg to 6.1 million kg[3]
- The 2023 total for medically important antimicrobial drugs was 6,127,991 kg
- For this question to resolve as "Yes," the 2024 figure would need to reach at least 6,158,631 kg

The growth in antimicrobial use has not been uniform across livestock categories:

- Swine: Fastest growing category, with a 33% increase from 2017 to 2023 (2.0 million kg to 2.7 million kg)[3]
- Cattle: 8% increase from 2017 to 2023 (2.3 million kg to 2.5 million kg)[3]
- Poultry: Continued decline in medically important antibiotic use[3]

## Recent Developments and Market Factors

Several factors suggest potential growth in antimicrobial use for 2024:

1. **New Drug Approvals**: In April 2024, the FDA approved Pradalex, a pradofloxacin injection for treating respiratory diseases in cattle and swine[5]. This expansion of available treatments could drive increased antimicrobial use in the latter part of 2024.

2. **Market Growth Projections**: The global veterinary antibiotics market was valued at USD 5.10 billion in 2024 and is projected to grow at a CAGR of 2.54% from 2025 to 2030[5]. While this is a global figure, it indicates ongoing growth in the sector.

3. **Disease Prevalence**: The increasing prevalence of livestock diseases is cited as a key factor expected to drive market growth[5]. Any significant disease outbreaks in 2024 would likely result in increased antimicrobial use.

## Countervailing Factors

Several factors could limit growth in antimicrobial sales:

1. **Antibiotic Stewardship Initiatives**: Major industry players have shifted focus toward animal-only antibiotics and stewardship programs[5]. For example, Elanco Animal Health Incorporated has implemented a global antibiotic stewardship plan focused on reducing shared-class antibiotics[5].

2. **Antibiotic Amnesty Programs**: The 2024 Veterinary Antibiotic Amnesty, sponsored in part by Zoetis, encourages the return of unused antibiotics to veterinary practices to combat antimicrobial resistance[5]. Such programs could potentially reduce overall sales.

3. **Regulatory Pressure**: Ongoing concerns about antibiotic resistance may continue to pressure the industry to limit antimicrobial use.

## Analysis and Forecast

Given the conflicting indicators, a probabilistic assessment is warranted:

**Factors supporting an increase of â‰¥0.5% in 2024:**
- The longer-term trend from 2017-2023 shows a 10% increase over six years (approximately 1.6% per year on average)[3]
- New FDA drug approvals in 2024 expand treatment options[5]
- Continued strong growth in antimicrobial use for swine (33% over six years)[3]
- Global market growth projections of 2.54% CAGR[5]

**Factors supporting a decrease or minimal increase (<0.5%) in 2024:**
- The most recent year-over-year trend showed a 2% decrease from 2022 to 2023[1][2]
- Industry initiatives focused on antibiotic stewardship and reducing shared-class antibiotics[5]
- Continuing decline in use for poultry[3]

The 2% decrease in 2023 is significant but appears to be against the longer-term trend of increasing use. The approval of new antimicrobial treatments in April 2024 and the continued strong growth in the swine sector suggest that 2024 could see a reversal of the 2023 decrease.

## Conclusion

Based on the available data, there appears to be a higher probability that antimicrobial sales for livestock will increase by at least 0.5% in 2024 compared to 2023. The long-term growth trend, new drug approvals, and continued expansion in key livestock sectors (particularly swine) outweigh the single-year decrease observed in 2023.

Key uncertainties include the potential impact of stewardship programs and any significant disease outbreaks that may occur in the latter part of 2024. The FDA's 2024 report, likely to be published in late 2025, will provide the definitive answer to this question.
