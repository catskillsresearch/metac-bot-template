# UK OBR CPI Inflation Forecast Analysis for 2025

As of March 15, 2025, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) is scheduled to release its next economic and fiscal outlook on March 26, 2025. Based on available information, I can provide an analysis of trends and factors that will likely influence the upcoming OBR inflation forecast for 2025.

## Historical Trends and Current Status

The OBR's inflation forecasts for 2025 have shown an upward trajectory over recent publications:

- In October 2024, the OBR projected CPI inflation to rise to 2.6% in 2025[1]
- This represented an increase from their March 2024 forecast of 1.5% (as mentioned in the query)

For context, other authoritative bodies have also revised their inflation projections upward:

- The Bank of England's February 2025 Monetary Policy Report significantly raised its inflation outlook, projecting CPI inflation to reach 3.7% in Q3 2025[3]
- This was a substantial increase from their November forecast of around 2.75% for the second half of 2025[3]

## Key Factors Influencing the Upcoming Forecast

Several factors are likely to influence the OBR's March 2025 inflation forecast:

**Energy Costs and Regulated Prices:**
- Recent increases in wholesale gas futures and oil prices are expected to raise household energy bills[3]
- The direct energy price contribution to 12-month CPI inflation is projected to shift from -0.6 to +0.4 percentage points by Q3 2025[3]
- Planned increases in water bills will also contribute to higher regulated prices[5]

**Government Policy Impacts:**
- The Autumn Budget 2024 included policies that are expected to push up CPI inflation[3]
- Higher National Insurance Contributions (NICs) are anticipated to have inflationary pass-through effects[5]

**Global Factors:**
- Global energy cost developments are a significant driver of the inflation outlook[3]
- The query mentions potential US tariffs as a geopolitical risk factor

## Forecast Indicators from Other Sources

While not direct OBR forecasts, other inflation projections provide context:

- The Green Gas Support Scheme (GGSS) budget calculations, which use OBR forecasts, estimated CPI inflation at 2.4% for the 2025/26 financial year (as of December 2024)[4]
- An earlier GGSS document from December 2024 used a higher estimate of 2.8% for 2025/26[2]

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several uncertainties could affect the actual OBR forecast:

- The Bank of England noted a "spread of views about the near-term evolution" of inflationary pressures[5]
- Weaker economic activity and a looser labor market could exert downward pressure on inflation[5]
- Weak productivity and global trade policy uncertainty present upside risks[5]
- The Bank of England judges that the near-term pickup in headline inflation will not lead to additional second-round effects on underlying domestic inflationary pressures[3]

Given these factors and the upward trend in forecasts from both the OBR and Bank of England, the March 2025 OBR forecast for 2025 CPI inflation is likely to be higher than their previous October 2024 estimate of 2.6%, potentially moving closer to the Bank of England's more recent projection of 3.7%.
