# UK OBR CPI Inflation Forecast for 2025: Analysis as of March 2025

Based on available information as of March 15, 2025, I've compiled relevant data to help forecast the UK's Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) estimate of CPI inflation for 2025 in their upcoming March 2025 outlook.

## Historical Trends and Current Status

The OBR's inflation forecasts for 2025 have shown an upward trajectory over recent publications:

- In October 2024, the OBR projected CPI inflation to rise to 2.6% in 2025, which was significantly higher than their previous forecast of 1.5% from March 2024[1][5].

- This upward revision reflects increasing inflationary pressures in the UK economy, despite inflation having dropped to a three-year low of 1.7% in September 2024[5].

- The Bank of England's February 2025 Monetary Policy Report provides the most recent authoritative view on inflation, projecting that headline inflation will rise more sharply than previously expected, reaching 3.7% in Q3 2025[2]. This represents a significant increase from their November 2024 projection of around 2¾% for the second half of 2025.

## Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting Inflation

Several factors are contributing to the revised inflation outlook:

1. **Energy Prices**: The direct energy price contribution to 12-month CPI inflation is expected to increase from -0.6 to +0.4 percentage points in 2025 Q3, reflecting increases in wholesale gas futures and oil prices[2].

2. **Government Policies**: The Bank of England notes that CPI inflation is expected to rise in the near term due to regulated price changes and the impact of government policies announced in the Autumn Budget 2024[2].

3. **Budget Policies**: The October 2024 Budget policies are projected to push up CPI inflation by around ½ a percentage point at their peak[1].

4. **Inflation Forecasts for Budget Planning**: Government publications show varying inflation forecasts being used for budget planning purposes:
   - One document indicates a 2.8% CPI inflation estimate for 2025/26[3]
   - A more recent document shows a revised 2.4% estimate for the same period[4]

## Authoritative Sources and Verification

The most authoritative recent sources on UK inflation forecasts include:

1. The OBR's Economic and Fiscal Outlook from October 2024, which projected 2.6% inflation for 2025[1].

2. The Bank of England's February 2025 Monetary Policy Report, which provides the most recent official projection, indicating inflation will reach 3.7% in Q3 2025[2].

3. Government publications on budget planning that incorporate inflation forecasts for 2025/26, showing estimates ranging from 2.4% to 2.8%[3][4].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors create uncertainty in forecasting the OBR's March 2025 estimate:

1. **Timing Differences**: The OBR typically provides an annual average inflation rate, while some forecasts (like the Bank of England's) focus on specific quarters.

2. **Recent Developments**: Any economic developments between February 2025 and the OBR's March 2025 forecast could significantly impact their projections.

3. **Policy Considerations**: The OBR will need to incorporate the impact of any new fiscal policies announced in the upcoming March 2025 budget.

4. **External Factors**: Global energy prices, supply chain issues, and geopolitical tensions remain volatile factors that could influence inflation projections.

## Conclusion

Based on the available information as of March 15, 2025, the OBR's estimate for 2025 CPI inflation in their March 2025 outlook is likely to be higher than their October 2024 projection of 2.6%. The Bank of England's February 2025 projection of 3.7% inflation for Q3 2025 suggests significant upward pressure, though the OBR may take a somewhat different view based on their own models and assumptions.

Given the upward trend in inflation forecasts and the Bank of England's recent projections, the OBR's March 2025 estimate for 2025 CPI inflation is most likely to fall in the range of 2.8-3.3%.
