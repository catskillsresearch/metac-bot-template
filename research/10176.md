# Forecasting Analysis: Anti-Solar Geoengineering Pact Adoption

Based on information available as of November 3, 2022, this analysis examines the likelihood of more than 34 countries committing to a stringent anti-solar-geoengineering pact before 2026.

## Current Status (as of November 2022)

As of November 2022, there exists an initiative calling for an International Non-Use Agreement on Solar Geoengineering, launched in early 2022[1]. This initiative aims to prevent the development and deployment of technologies designed to modify solar radiation reaching Earth's surface to combat climate change.

The proposed agreement would require signatories to commit to five specific prohibitions:

1. Prohibiting national funding for solar geoengineering technology development
2. Banning outdoor experiments of solar geoengineering technologies
3. Not granting patent rights for solar geoengineering technologies
4. Not deploying solar geoengineering technologies developed by third parties
5. Objecting to the institutionalization of solar geoengineering as a policy option in international institutions[5]

These five commitments align precisely with the resolution criteria specified in the forecasting question.

## Momentum Analysis

As of November 2022, the initiative was in its early stages. The proposed agreement was being championed by a coalition of academics and civil society organizations, with the intention of building support among like-minded governments[5]. However, there is insufficient evidence in the available data to determine how many countries, if any, had expressed formal support for such an agreement by November 2022.

The initiative explicitly notes that such an agreement "could begin with a coalition of like-minded governments"[5], suggesting that at the time of publication, no formal coalition of governments had yet formed around this specific proposal.

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on the limited information available as of November 2022, I assess the probability of more than 34 countries committing to a stringent anti-solar-geoengineering pact meeting all five criteria before 2026 as **low to moderate** (approximately 15-30%).

Key factors influencing this assessment:

1. **Timeline Constraints**: The period between November 2022 and December 2025 (approximately 3 years) provides limited time for:
   - Building international consensus
   - Negotiating treaty language meeting all five stringent criteria
   - Completing domestic ratification processes in 35+ countries

2. **Precedent Analysis**: International environmental agreements typically require significant time to reach widespread adoption. For comparison, the Paris Climate Agreement, despite urgent climate concerns, took years to achieve widespread ratification.

3. **Stringency Barrier**: The resolution criteria require all five prohibitions to be included without reservations on substantive matters, creating a high bar for adoption.

4. **Emerging Nature**: As of November 2022, the initiative was still in its early promotional phase rather than formal treaty negotiation stage.

## Uncertainty Factors

Several key uncertainties affect this forecast:

1. **Scientific Developments**: Evolving research on climate change severity could either accelerate interest in solar geoengineering (reducing agreement likelihood) or heighten concerns about its risks (increasing agreement likelihood).

2. **Political Landscape**: Changes in government administrations and climate policy priorities could significantly impact diplomatic appetite for such restrictions.

3. **Competing Priorities**: Other climate initiatives may take precedence over regulating speculative technologies.

4. **Data Limitations**: As of November 2022, there was limited public information about government positions specifically on this proposed agreement.

## Conclusion

While there was a formal initiative promoting an International Non-Use Agreement on Solar Geoengineering as of November 2022, the available evidence suggests that achieving commitments from more than 34 countries to a stringent agreement meeting all five specified criteria by the end of 2025 faces significant challenges. The initiative was still in its early stages, and the stringent nature of the required commitments presents a substantial hurdle for widespread adoption within the available timeframe.
