### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of November 3, 2022, there were **no binding multilateral treaties or pacts** in force in which more than 34 countries had committed to a stringent anti-solar-geoengineering framework as defined in the question[1][3][4].
- The Solar Geoengineering Non-Use Agreement initiative, launched by scholars and civil society, was gaining attention and endorsements from academics and NGOs, but **had not yet resulted in formal state-level treaty commitments**[1][4][5].
- By 2023–2025, **political momentum increased**. Several regions and countries—such as the African Ministerial Conference on the Environment, the European Parliament, Mexico, Vanuatu, Fiji, and Germany—publicly called for national bans or a “Non-Use” approach to solar geoengineering[2][5]. However, these actions were primarily **declarations, resolutions, or expressions of intent** rather than legally binding treaties fulfilling all criteria.

### Key Differences Affecting the Forecast

- **Nature of Commitments:** Most governmental actions so far are statements of intent, political declarations, or parliamentary resolutions—not binding international treaties with comprehensive prohibitions enforced by law[2][4][5].
- **Stringency and Scope:** The five-point criteria (ban on experiments, deployment, public funding, patents, and international opposition) are more comprehensive than most current resolutions or moratoriums, which often focus on select aspects (e.g., outdoor experiments or deployment)[4][5].
- **Precedent:** Historically, treaties banning emerging or controversial technologies (e.g., chemical/biological weapons, certain genetic modifications) have taken years to negotiate, sign, and ratify to a level exceeding 34 countries[3][4].
- **Momentum vs. Binding Action:** While the political and civil society momentum is rising, there is no evidence that this has translated into rapid, large-scale, binding treaty adoption.

### Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the above, as of late 2022, and with developments through early 2025, the **probability that more than 34 countries will have committed to a stringent, binding anti-solar-geoengineering pact (meeting all five criteria) before 2026 is low**. While momentum and interest are increasing, the lack of precedent, the absence of an existing draft treaty with widespread high-level state buy-in, and the complexity of the requirements make rapid, broad ratification unlikely within this timeframe[2][3][4][5].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- **Diplomatic Surprises:** While unlikely, rapid international diplomatic shifts or a catalyzing event (e.g., a major controversial experiment provoking global backlash) could accelerate treaty formation. However, no evidence suggests this is imminent.
- **Measurement:** Tracking precise treaty commitments requires access to official instruments of ratification or accession, not just public statements.
