## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Since Lebanon’s 2019 economic collapse, the country has repeatedly sought IMF assistance. In April 2022, Lebanon and the IMF reached a staff-level agreement for a $3 billion bailout, conditional on extensive reforms, including banking sector restructuring, exchange rate harmonization, and enhanced fiscal transparency[2].
- Progress has been slow, with recurring political gridlock and resistance to key reforms, especially from influential banking and political elites. As recently as March 2025, IMF staff concluded a visit to Beirut to review reform progress[1][2].
- Lebanon’s newly appointed government, formed in early 2025, has publicly signaled renewed willingness to negotiate with the IMF, with Prime Minister Nawaf Salam stating in late February that the government will seek a new program[3].

## 2. Recent Announcements and Policies

- As of late May 2025, Lebanon is in the final stages of reviewing the IMF’s recommendations and evaluating their alignment with local realities[4].
- The government’s tone has shifted toward urgency and pragmatism, with public statements about the necessity of a deal for economic survival[3][4].
- However, enduring obstacles remain: banking secrecy laws have not been fully reformed, and key legislation to compensate depositors is still facing pushback from private banks[2].
- The IMF’s most recent public statements in March 2025 indicated that, while there was some progress (notably in exchange rate harmonization and limiting borrowing), the core reforms remain incomplete, making a full bailout agreement unlikely without further action[1][2].
- No official announcement of an agreement has been made as of May 30, 2025.

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- IMF official website and press releases[1][5]
- Executive Magazine coverage of recent government statements[3]
- Recent news reports on the status of IMF negotiations in Lebanon[2][4]

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- Lebanese political dynamics remain volatile; reforms could stall due to elite resistance or new political crises.
- The IMF generally requires concrete progress on reforms before approving financial assistance, and the timeline for legislative changes in Lebanon is highly unpredictable.
- Public statements by Lebanese officials may reflect political positioning rather than imminent policy shifts.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

- **Compared to previous years**, there is a slightly higher chance of an agreement due to the new government’s stated willingness to re-engage and the completion of the latest round of IMF negotiations.
- **Key differences** now include a more urgent tone from officials and some technical progress, but the same structural obstacles to reform persist.
- **Given these factors**, the probability of a formal IMF-Lebanon agreement being announced before July 1, 2025, is still modest. While progress is possible, the process has historically been slow and subject to last-minute derailments.
- **Assessment:** There is a low-to-moderate probability (estimated at 25–35%) that an agreement meeting the resolution criteria will be announced by July 1, 2025.
