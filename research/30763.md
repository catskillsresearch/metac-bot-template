### 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Since 2020, H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b has caused unprecedented bird and poultry deaths globally, with outbreaks reported in Africa, Asia, Europe, the Americas, and specifically widespread outbreaks in North and South America since 2021-2022[4][5].
- Human infections remain rare, with some severe outcomes (e.g., the first US death in 2025, and two cases in Mexico), but almost all cases are related to direct animal exposure[1][3].
- As of April 2025, the WHO assesses the overall public health risk from H5 to be low, with risk to occupationally exposed persons considered low-to-moderate. There is no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission[1][2][5].

### 2. Recent Announcements and Policies

- The WHO and CDC report:
  - No indicators of unusual influenza activity in people, including H5[2].
  - Ongoing investigations into isolated human cases, but no secondary cases detected among contacts or evidence of broader transmission[1][3].
- The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) confirms, as of January 2025, that human-to-human transmission of H5N1 has not been reported[5].
- WHO continues to monitor for mutations that could facilitate human-to-human transmission, but currently, such changes have not been observed[1][5].

### 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- WHO Disease Outbreak News and Avian Influenza risk assessment pages[1][4]
- CDC Bird Flu Situation Summary and Newsroom releases[2][3]
- PAHO's Epidemiological Update (January 2025)[5]

### 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- The main limitation is unpredictability: a mutation enabling efficient human-to-human transmission could change the risk assessment rapidly.
- Surveillance gaps in some regions may delay detection of novel clusters or transmission patterns.
- The current risk assessment could change if epidemiological or virological data shift significantly, especially if unexplained human clusters or significant viral evolution are documented.

### Probabilistic Assessment

Given the WHO's current risk assessment, the absence of sustained human-to-human transmission, and historical precedent that PHEIC declarations have followed clear international human-to-human spread or major risk thereof, the likelihood that the WHO will declare H5 avian influenza a PHEIC before 2026 is low unless there is a major change in the virus's behavior or epidemiology.

#### Key Differences from Reference Cases

| Factor                      | H5N1 (2024-2025)                              | Reference PHEIC Cases (COVID-19, mpox, Ebola, Zika)              |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Human-to-human transmission | Not sustained, only rare/isolated exposures   | Documented, efficient, or high risk of person-to-person spread   |
| International human spread  | None detected                                 | Confirmed or imminent                                           |
| Public risk assessment      | Low (general), Low-to-moderate (occupational) | Moderate to high                                                |
| PHEIC declaration status    | Not under active consideration                | WHO convened Emergency Committee, declared PHEIC                |

### Conclusion

Unless H5N1 evolves to cause efficient human-to-human transmission or there is a significant, unexplained increase in human cases globally, the probability of a WHO PHEIC declaration before 2026 remains low.
