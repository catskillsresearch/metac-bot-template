## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Since the early 2010s, California has led the U.S. in zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) policy, launching the ZEV Program under Governor Brown and updating it with more stringent mandates over time[3].
- Advanced Clean Cars II regulations, adopted in 2022, specifically require all new passenger cars, trucks, and SUVs sold from 2035 onward to be zero-emission vehicles (including battery electric and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles)[2][3].
- California’s ZEV market share has rapidly increased: by 2023, ZEVs accounted for 25% of new vehicle sales in the state, with nearly 450,000 new ZEVs sold that year—a 30% year-over-year increase[2].
- The state met its goal of 1.5 million cumulative ZEV sales two years ahead of schedule, and automakers are currently exceeding regulatory requirements for ZEV sales[2].

## 2. Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Metric

- On September 23, 2020, Governor Newsom’s executive order directed state regulators to require all new passenger car and truck sales to be ZEVs by 2035[2].
- The Advanced Clean Cars II framework formalizes this transition, setting interim targets (e.g., 35% ZEVs in 2026, 68% by 2030, 100% by 2035)[1][2].
- In May 2025, the U.S. Senate voted to block California’s electric car mandate by revoking the waiver that allows the state to set stricter emissions standards than federal requirements—an unprecedented legal development that could derail or at least delay the 2035 ZEV mandate[1].
- The California Air Resources Board (CARB) is considering further regulatory adjustments, with a review scheduled for summer 2025[2].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- California Air Resources Board (CARB) official documentation and FAQs[2][3]
- The official Executive Order N-79-20 from Governor Newsom’s office (September 2020)
- Recent media analysis, including CalMatters (2025), confirming the Senate’s move to block the mandate[1]

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- **Federal Preemption Risk:** The Senate’s 2025 revocation of California’s Clean Air Act waiver is a major, unresolved risk. If upheld, it could prevent California from enforcing the 2035 ZEV mandate[1].
- **Legal and Political Volatility:** Legal challenges are likely, and the outcome may depend on future court decisions or shifts in federal policy.
- **Market and Infrastructure Challenges:** Ongoing concerns include whether charging/refueling infrastructure and vehicle affordability will keep pace with mandated targets[2].
- **Definition Consistency:** Resolution depends on the definition of ZEV remaining stable through 2035 and statewide application, as outlined in the executive order and referenced documentation.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

- As of late May 2025, California has made substantial progress toward the 2035 ZEV sales mandate, exceeding interim goals and advancing supportive regulations[2][3].
- However, the U.S. Senate’s action to revoke California’s regulatory authority is a significant new threat. If this revocation is upheld, the probability of California carrying through with the plan as written drops substantially.
- **Adjusted Probability:** Prior to the federal legal challenge, the probability of full implementation by 2035 would be assessed as high (70–80%). Given the Senate’s 2025 intervention, the probability should be adjusted downward to reflect the possibility of preemption or delay, likely to a moderate or uncertain range (40–60%) pending legal outcomes.
