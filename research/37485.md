## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Since 2022, the US has periodically announced new broad sanctions packages against Russia, usually in response to escalations in Ukraine or coordinated efforts with allies.
- In 2025, pressure for new sanctions increased after continued conflict in Ukraine and allied (UK/EU) actions[2][3].
- As of June 24, 2025, the US has not officially announced a new, broad package of sanctions against Russia since January 2025, although legislative and executive branch discussions have continued[1][2][5].

## 2. Recent Announcements and Policies

- In May 2025, US officials finalized a new package of economic sanctions targeting major Russian sectors, but official announcement and executive action were pending, largely due to President Trump’s stated reluctance[1].
- President Trump, at the June 2025 G7 Summit, expressed opposition to further sanctions, citing the economic cost to the US and a desire not to jeopardize possible peace talks. He indicated a wait-and-see approach, contingent on EU/UK moves[1].
- The UK and EU announced new coordinated sanctions in June 2025, targeting energy, financial, and military sectors, and further constraining Russia’s oil revenues[3].
- US Senators introduced the “Sanctioning Russia Act of 2025” with significant bipartisan support (81 co-sponsors), but passage and executive enactment remain uncertain[2].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- US Treasury (OFAC) and State Department official sanctions program updates[4][5].
- Steptoe international compliance blog and risk outlook, reporting on both US and allied sanctions actions as of June 2025[1][3].
- Reuters and other major news agencies for official announcement tracking.

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- The main limiting factor is President Trump’s explicit reluctance to issue new Russia sanctions, despite allied action and Congressional pressure[1].
- Official sanctions require formal executive action; Congressional passage alone is insufficient without Presidential approval, per the resolution criteria.
- Rapid geopolitical changes or escalations could prompt a policy shift.

## Probabilistic Assessment (as of June 24, 2025)

- Given the finalized (but unannounced) sanctions package, strong Congressional support, and increasing allied pressure, the structural likelihood of a new package being ready is high.
- However, President Trump’s public opposition and the lack of an official announcement as of late June markedly lower the probability of a new broad sanctions package being announced before September 1, 2025.
- Adjusted forecast: Moderate-to-low probability (approximately 30-40%) that the US will officially announce a new, broad package of sanctions against Russia before September 1, 2025, unless there is a significant change in executive stance or a major new event.
