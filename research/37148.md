### 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The Indian Armed Forces executed significant kinetic attacks on targets within Pakistan proper (including Sindh, Punjab, and other provinces) between May 7–10, 2025, in response to a major terrorist attack in Indian-administered Kashmir[1][2][3][4].
- These attacks included missile strikes and airstrikes on military installations, with substantial damage confirmed by independent satellite imagery[3].
- A ceasefire was announced and implemented on May 10, 2025, after rapid escalation and mediation efforts[2][4].
- Historically, after major escalations and subsequent ceasefires (e.g., 2019 Balakot strikes, 2001–02 standoff), both sides have generally avoided immediate further large-scale kinetic actions in the weeks following a truce, unless provoked by a new major incident.

### 2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- As of May 22, 2025, there have been no official announcements from either India or Pakistan indicating an intent to resume kinetic operations in Pakistan proper.
- Diplomatic channels, though strained, remain open, and both sides have signaled a desire to avoid further escalation[2][4].
- International actors are reportedly engaged in efforts to stabilize the situation and prevent renewed hostilities[4].

### 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) and major international media outlets have confirmed the timeline and scope of the May 2025 conflict[1][3].
- Wikipedia entries, updated with recent events, provide a consolidated summary with references to official statements and independent analysis[2][3].
- UK House of Commons Library briefings offer additional context on the diplomatic and military developments[4].

### 4. Limitations or Uncertainties in Measurement

- The security environment remains volatile, and intelligence on covert preparations or intentions is limited.
- Escalation risks persist, especially if a new terrorist incident or border clash occurs.
- Open-source reporting may lag behind real-time developments, and both sides have incentives to control the narrative.
- The definition of "kinetic attack" is clear for this forecast, but attribution and verification of cross-border incidents can be disputed.

### Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the intense conflict and subsequent ceasefire in May 2025, the historical pattern of post-ceasefire restraint, and the lack of new provocations or official signals of renewed attacks as of May 22, 2025, the probability that the Indian Armed Forces will execute a new kinetic attack in Pakistan proper during June 2025 is assessed as **low** (estimated at less than 20% barring a major new trigger).
