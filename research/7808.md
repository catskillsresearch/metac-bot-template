## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- **Pre-1979:** Iran and Israel maintained close diplomatic and economic relations under the Shah. Iran was one of the few Muslim-majority countries to recognize Israel and cooperate with it on security and trade matters[1][2][5].
- **Post-1979:** The Islamic Revolution led by Ayatollah Khomeini fundamentally altered Iran’s foreign policy. Iran severed relations with Israel, denounced its legitimacy, and adopted an antagonistic stance, referring to Israel as the “Little Satan.” This hostility became a core element of the new regime’s identity[2][4][5].
- **Proxy Conflict:** Since the revolution, Iran and Israel have engaged in a sustained proxy conflict across the Middle East, with Iran supporting groups opposed to Israel and both states contesting each other's right to exist[1][3][4].

## Recent Announcements and Policies (as of 2021-10-30)

- There have been no public statements or policy changes from Iran indicating movement toward recognizing Israel.
- The rivalry has intensified in recent years, with Iran increasing its involvement in regional conflicts and Israel responding with covert and overt operations[3].
- Iran’s leadership continues to use anti-Israel rhetoric for domestic legitimacy and regional positioning[4].

## Reference Cases for Comparison

| Case          | Precedent for Normalization | Key Differences with Iran |
|---------------|----------------------------|--------------------------|
| Egypt/Israel  | Peace treaty (1979)        | Egypt’s regime was secular, not ideologically opposed to Israel’s existence. Peace brought significant U.S. aid.|
| Jordan/Israel | Peace treaty (1994)        | Similar to Egypt; pragmatic monarchy, less ideological hostility.|
| Abraham Accords (UAE, Bahrain, Morocco, Sudan) | Normalization (2020) | Gulf states and Sudan lacked deep ideological enmity; motivated by strategic, economic, and anti-Iran alignment.|

Iran differs strongly from these cases: its regime’s legitimacy is partly built on opposition to Israel, and there is no history since 1979 of rapprochement at the official level[2][4][5].

## Key Differences Affecting the Forecast

- **Ideological Commitment:** Iran’s regime is uniquely committed to anti-Zionist rhetoric as a foundational pillar, unlike Egypt, Jordan, or Gulf states[4].
- **Regime Survival:** While public hostility is high, some evidence suggests the regime is capable of pragmatic decisions if survival is at stake, as shown by covert cooperation with Israel during the Iran–Iraq War[5].
- **Regional Rivalry:** The proxy conflict with Israel has deepened, making normalization less likely under current government structures[1][3].
- **Potential for Regime Change:** A significant internal revolution or collapse of the Islamic Republic could open the door to recognition, but this is highly uncertain and difficult to forecast.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the above, the probability that Iran will recognize Israel before 2070 is low if the current regime or similar ideological successors remain in power. However, the long timeframe (nearly 50 years from 2021) introduces substantial uncertainty, particularly regarding the possibility of regime change or major geopolitical realignment.

- **If the Islamic Republic endures:** Recognition is highly unlikely, perhaps less than 10% probability.
- **If major regime change occurs:** Probability increases, but such change is hard to forecast and not guaranteed to result in recognition, as nationalism and anti-Israel sentiment could persist in new leadership.

Overall, a reasonable adjusted probabilistic estimate as of 2021-10-30 might be **10–20%** for Iran formally recognizing Israel before 2070, reflecting low-but-not-zero odds due to the possibility of unforeseen political transformation.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- Long-term forecasts are highly sensitive to unpredictable events (regime change, wars, global realignments).
- Measurement is binary and straightforward (recognition or not), but outcomes depend on regime continuity and external shocks.
- The ideological foundations of the Islamic Republic make recognition uniquely unlikely compared to other regional cases.
