# Forecasting UK MP Suspensions, Resignations, or Party Changes Before 2025

To forecast whether any UK MPs will be suspended, resign, or change allegiance between October 15, 2024, and January 1, 2025, we need to examine historical patterns and current political dynamics.

## Historical Trends and Current Status

The UK Parliament has experienced a significant increase in MP suspensions in recent years. Since the 2019 General Election, sixteen Members of Parliament were suspended from the House of Commons, with some facing suspensions lasting up to six weeks[5]. This represents a notable increase compared to the previous decade, when only nine MPs were suspended between 2010 and 2019[5].

Beyond formal House suspensions, there has been a growing trend of MPs being suspended from their political parties, creating what some observers have called "Britain's fastest-growing political group: the suspended MPs"[3]. These MPs continue to sit in Parliament as independents after being removed from their party affiliations.

The 2019-2024 Parliament saw substantial turnover, with 132 MPs choosing not to stand for re-election in the July 4, 2024 general election[1][2]. Among those who stood down, 75 were Conservatives, representing approximately 22% of their parliamentary party[1]. The SNP also experienced significant turnover with nine MPs (21% of their parliamentary party) choosing not to seek re-election[1].

## Factors Influencing MP Status Changes

Several factors contribute to the likelihood of MPs being suspended, resigning, or changing allegiance:

1. **Disciplinary Issues**: Five MPs resigned from the Commons since 2019 after facing charges of serious impropriety[5]. This pattern suggests that scandals and misconduct allegations continue to be significant drivers of MP status changes.

2. **Party Discipline**: Party whips enforce voting discipline, particularly on key legislation. MPs who rebel against their party line on significant votes risk suspension, as evidenced by historical patterns.

3. **Political Realignments**: The previous parliament saw several MPs change party affiliations due to ideological differences or strategic considerations. Four independent MPs who retired before the 2024 election were originally elected as Conservatives[1].

## Calls for Reform

The increase in suspensions has prompted calls for reform to Parliament's disciplinary procedures. Chris Bryant, chair of the Standards Committee, has advocated for the next government to implement "sweeping reforms" to MP conduct regulation[5]. Various think tanks, including the Institute for Government and the Bennett Institute for Public Policy, have also proposed changes to parliamentary standards[5].

Conservative MP Charles Walker has specifically called for reforms to "make the removal of sitting MPs less common"[5], suggesting concern about the frequency of suspensions and the recall process.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors complicate forecasting MP status changes:

1. **New Parliament Dynamics**: The July 2024 election has created new parliamentary dynamics that may influence party discipline and MP behavior.

2. **Timing of Parliamentary Business**: Controversial legislation that might trigger rebellions and subsequent suspensions depends on the government's legislative agenda.

3. **Unpredictability of Scandals**: Personal misconduct allegations that might lead to suspensions or resignations are inherently unpredictable.

4. **Party Management Approaches**: Different party leaders employ varying approaches to managing dissent within their ranks, affecting the likelihood of suspensions.

Given the historical increase in suspensions and the various factors that can trigger MP status changes, there remains a significant possibility of further suspensions, resignations, or party changes before 2025. However, the specific timing and circumstances of such events remain uncertain.
