# Will President Trump Issue a Presidential Action on the Diversity Visa Before April 1, 2025?

As of March 5, 2025, there are several factors to consider when forecasting whether President Trump will issue a presidential action specifically mentioning the "Diversity Visa" before April 1, 2025.

## Current Status of the Diversity Visa Program

The Diversity Visa (DV) Program, commonly known as the Green Card Lottery, currently provides approximately 52,000 visas annually to applicants from countries with historically low rates of immigration to the United States[4]. This represents a reduction from the original 55,000 visa allocation due to provisions in the NACARA program and the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2024[4]. The DV-2025 program is currently active, with applicants required to be found eligible for and obtain their visa or adjust status by the end of the program period[1].

## Recent Immigration Policy Actions by the Trump Administration

Since beginning his second term following the November 5, 2024 election, President Trump has already taken significant steps to reshape immigration policy[2][3]. Most notably:

- On February 25, 2025, President Trump announced plans to end the EB-5 Immigrant Investor Program, which provides foreign investors with permanent residency in the United States[5].
- In the same announcement, he proposed replacing the EB-5 program with a new "Gold Card" program requiring a $5 million investment (compared to the current $800,000-$1,050,000 requirement for EB-5)[5].
- The president indicated that detailed plans for the Gold Card program would be published within two weeks of the February 25 announcement[5].

## Likelihood Assessment

Several factors suggest President Trump might target the Diversity Visa program for executive action before April 1:

1. **Historical precedent**: The Trump administration has already demonstrated willingness to make significant immigration policy changes early in 2025, testing "the limits of executive power" in immigration matters[3].

2. **Focus on legal immigration**: While much of Trump's campaign focused on restricting illegal immigration, his past policies and recent actions suggest potential changes to legal immigration systems as well, which would include the Diversity Visa program[2].

3. **Timing of recent announcements**: The February 25, 2025 announcement regarding the EB-5 program indicates that immigration visa programs are currently under active review by the administration[5].

However, there are also factors suggesting a presidential action specifically mentioning the Diversity Visa might not occur before April 1:

1. **Short timeframe**: As of March 5, there are less than four weeks remaining before the April 1 deadline.

2. **Current focus on investor visas**: The administration's most recent immigration focus appears to be on investor-related programs rather than the Diversity Visa program specifically[5].

3. **Implementation considerations**: The DV-2025 program is already in progress, with selections already made, which could complicate immediate changes[1][4].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

The forecast is limited by several factors:

- No explicit statements about the Diversity Visa program have been made by President Trump in the available search results.
- Presidential actions often undergo internal review processes that can affect timing.
- The administration may prioritize other immigration policies before addressing the Diversity Visa program.
