## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- **Operating Losses and Financial Performance:** ChargePoint reported over $68 million in operating losses for the quarter ended October 31, 2024, but this is consistent with prior quarters, and the company has been actively working to reduce expenses and improve margins[1]. For the third quarter of fiscal 2025, ChargePoint reported a gross profit of $22.8 million and operating expenses of $38.3 million[1]. Revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 was $102 million, with a full fiscal year revenue of $417 million and a GAAP gross margin of 28%[4].

- **Cost-Cutting and Reorganization:** In September 2024, ChargePoint announced a reorganization, including a 15% reduction in its global workforce, aiming to save approximately $41 million annually in operating expenses[2]. The restructuring costs were estimated at $10 million, to be incurred primarily in the third and fourth fiscal quarters[2].

- **Management Guidance:** ChargePoint's management has consistently communicated a focus on operational excellence, cost reduction, and a goal to achieve positive non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA in fiscal year 2026[1][3]. There have been no public statements from management indicating imminent bankruptcy or liquidity crises.

- **Business Environment:** The company continues to highlight record EV sales and increasing network utilization, suggesting ongoing demand for its services[1].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- **No Bankruptcy Filing or Warning:** As of February 21, 2025, there is no public record or announcement of ChargePoint filing for bankruptcy or indicating plans to do so[1][2][3][4][5].
- **Operational Adjustments:** The company is actively implementing efficiency measures and streamlining operations to improve its financial position[2].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- ChargePoint's official investor relations website provides quarterly financial results and press releases, which are the primary sources for up-to-date financial and operational information[1][2][3][4][5].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- **Forward-Looking Uncertainty:** While ChargePoint has taken steps to reduce costs and improve margins, the company continues to operate at a loss. The absence of a bankruptcy filing or explicit warning as of February 21, 2025, does not preclude the possibility of a filing before April 1, 2025, especially if unforeseen financial or market shocks occur.
- **Lack of Real-Time Data:** This analysis is based on information available up to February 21, 2025. Any developments after this date are not reflected.
- **No Explicit Bankruptcy Risk Disclosure:** There are no public disclosures of imminent bankruptcy risk, but the companyâ€™s ongoing losses and restructuring indicate financial pressure.

## Conclusion

As of February 21, 2025, ChargePoint has not filed for bankruptcy, and there are no public indications of an imminent filing. The company is actively pursuing cost reductions and operational improvements, with management expressing confidence in its path to profitability. However, continued operating losses and the need for further financial improvement present ongoing risks. The best available evidence suggests that, as of the cutoff date, a bankruptcy filing before April 1, 2025, is not indicated by public disclosures.
