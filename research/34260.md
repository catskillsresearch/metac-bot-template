# Forecasting US State Department Arms Sales Approvals for March 2025

The United States maintains its position as the world's largest arms exporter, accounting for 42% of global arms exports. To forecast the number of arms sales approvals expected in March 2025, I'll analyze available historical data, recent policy changes, and ongoing trends.

## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

The US arms sales process follows a structured approach through the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program. This process begins when a foreign country submits a formal Letter of Request (LOR) detailing their desired military capability[1]. The approval process involves multiple government agencies and, depending on the value and nature of the sale, may require Congressional notification.

Historical approval rates have been consistently high. Between March 2020 and June 2023, the Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) processed 26,422 license applications for arms exports, approving 24,741 of themâ€”a 93.6% approval rate[2]. During this period, the total value of approved licenses reached $34.7 billion[2].

## Recent Policy Developments

Several recent policy changes may impact the volume of arms sales approvals in early 2025:

1. **Regulatory Updates**: On January 17, 2025, the Department of State published an interim final rule in the Federal Register with a 240-day delayed effective date[3]. While the specific content of this rule isn't detailed in available sources, regulatory changes typically aim to streamline or modify the arms export control process.

2. **Legislative Reforms**: As of January 2024, Congress was considering legislation to expedite the foreign military sales process. A House task force established for this purpose was debating a bill that would:
   - Raise the dollar threshold at which presidential approval of arms transfers requires Congressional notification[5]
   - Require the drawdown of weapons from U.S. stockpiles to compensate for delayed foreign military sales[5]
   - Mandate the Secretary of State to use drawdown authority for transfers to security partners if sales have been delayed for three years or more[5]

These reforms, if implemented, could significantly increase the efficiency of the arms sales approval process and potentially lead to a higher volume of approvals in early 2025.

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

The most reliable sources for tracking and verifying US arms sales approvals include:

1. The Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) Major Arms Sales notifications page, which officially documents State Department approvals
2. The Department of State's Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (DDTC), which oversees the export and temporary import of defense articles and services[3]
3. Congressional reports on foreign arms sales, which provide detailed analysis of the approval process and recent trends[4]

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors create uncertainty in forecasting March 2025 arms sales approvals:

1. **Threshold Changes**: Potential changes to notification thresholds may affect how many sales are publicly reported. The proposed legislation would raise the dollar threshold for Congressional notification, potentially reducing the number of publicly reported approvals while increasing the actual number of sales processed[5].

2. **Implementation Timeline**: The interim final rule published in January 2025 has a 240-day delayed effective date[3], meaning its impact may not be fully realized by March 2025.

3. **Drawdown Provisions**: The proposed requirement for the Secretary of State to use drawdown authority for long-delayed sales could create a surge in approvals if implemented before March 2025[5].

4. **Data Transparency**: Not all arms sales are publicly reported. According to 2021 data from the Commerce Department, nearly $15.7 billion in licenses had been approved and $961.7 million in weapons had been shipped without Congressional notification between March 2020 and June 2021[2].

Given the high historical approval rate (93.6%) and ongoing efforts to streamline the process, combined with the United States' dominant position in global arms exports (42% market share), the March 2025 approval numbers are likely to remain robust, though exact forecasting is challenging due to the policy changes in progress.
