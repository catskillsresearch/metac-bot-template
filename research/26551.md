## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Revolut, founded in 2015, has grown rapidly and now serves over 40 million users globally, with around 7–9 million in the UK[1][4].
- The company has held a banking license in the EEA (via Lithuania) since 2021 but has operated as an e-money institution (EMI) in the UK, limiting its ability to offer certain banking products[1][3].
- Revolut applied for a UK banking license in January 2021. The process typically takes about a year, but Revolut’s application has faced delays due to regulatory concerns, including accounting practices and anti-money laundering (AML) controls[4].

## Recent Announcements and Developments

- As of July 2024, Revolut has secured a "restricted banking licence" in the UK. This is a significant milestone but is not equivalent to a full banking license[4].
- The restricted license initiates a "mobilisation" period, a standard regulatory phase during which Revolut must demonstrate its ability to operate as a bank under close supervision. This phase can last up to a year, and during it, Revolut is limited to holding £50,000 in customer deposits and must continue operating as an EMI[4].
- Only after successfully completing mobilisation will Revolut be eligible for a full UK banking license, which would allow it to offer lending products and provide deposit protection under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme[4].
- Revolut’s CEO has publicly expressed optimism that a full license is coming soon, but no specific timeline or regulatory confirmation has been provided[2].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) are responsible for granting banking licenses. Any formal announcement from these bodies or credible financial news outlets would confirm the granting of a full license.
- As of July 24, 2024, no such announcement has been made regarding Revolut receiving a full UK banking license[4].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- The mobilisation phase is a regulatory requirement and typically lasts several months to a year. There is no public indication that Revolut will complete this phase before September 30, 2024[4].
- Previous delays were due to regulatory concerns about Revolut’s internal controls and risk management, which could still impact the timeline[4].
- While Revolut’s leadership remains optimistic, this does not guarantee regulatory approval within the specified timeframe[2].

## Conclusion

Based on all available factual information as of July 24, 2024, Revolut has not yet obtained a full UK banking license. It has entered the mobilisation phase with a restricted license, but this process is expected to take several more months. Therefore, it is unlikely that Revolut will obtain a full UK banking license before September 30, 2024, unless the mobilisation phase is completed much faster than is typical.
