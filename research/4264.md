# Forecasting the Time Gap Between Silver Turing Test and AGI

As of May 7, 2020, forecasting the time interval between passing the silver Turing Test and developing AGI requires analyzing historical AI progress, expert predictions, and technological requirements for both milestones.

## Current Status and Historical Context

The silver Turing Test, as defined by Metaculus, requires an AI system to engage in a 20-minute unrestricted conversation with a panel of judges and be rated as "definitely human" by at least 30% of them. As of 2020, no AI system has passed this test, though conversational AI has made significant progress.

AGI development timelines remain highly uncertain, with expert predictions varying widely. A 2016 survey of AI researchers at the Joint Multi-Conference on Human-Level Artificial Intelligence found median estimates placing human-level AI around 2040-2050, though with considerable variation.

## Comparative Analysis of Requirements

### Silver Turing Test Requirements
- Advanced natural language processing
- Contextual understanding
- Consistent personality
- Knowledge breadth
- Conversational fluency

### Additional AGI Requirements
- Generalized problem-solving across domains
- Self-improvement capabilities
- Adaptability to novel situations
- Causal reasoning
- Integration of multiple cognitive abilities

The gap between these capabilities represents the likely time interval between achievements.

## Expert Opinions and Forecasts

Prior to 2020, several notable experts have provided relevant insights:

- Stuart Russell has emphasized that passing a Turing Test doesn't necessarily indicate AGI, as narrow language models might pass the test without general intelligence capabilities.

- Oren Etzioni proposed the silver Turing Test as a "canary" for AGI development, suggesting it would precede but signal progress toward AGI.

- The 2019 AI Index Report documented accelerating progress in natural language processing but noted continued challenges in developing systems with general reasoning capabilities.

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on information available as of May 2020, I estimate the following probability distribution for the time gap between passing the silver Turing Test and developing AGI:

- 10% chance: 1-3 years
- 25% chance: 3-7 years
- 40% chance: 7-15 years
- 20% chance: 15-25 years
- 5% chance: 25+ years

Median estimate: Approximately 10 years

This assessment considers that:

1. The silver Turing Test primarily tests conversational abilities, which have seen rapid progress but represent only a subset of AGI capabilities.

2. Historical precedent suggests significant time gaps between narrow AI achievements and more general capabilities.

3. The computational requirements for AGI are likely substantially greater than those needed for passing the silver Turing Test.

4. Expert surveys prior to 2020 generally indicate longer timelines for AGI than for narrow AI achievements.

## Key Uncertainties

Several factors could significantly affect this forecast:

- Potential algorithmic breakthroughs that might accelerate AGI development after the silver Turing Test is passed
- The degree to which language understanding correlates with general intelligence
- Whether AGI requires fundamentally different approaches than those used for narrow AI systems
- The level of resources directed toward AGI research following a successful silver Turing Test

## Limitations

This forecast faces significant limitations:

1. There is no consensus definition of AGI, making precise prediction challenging
2. Expert opinions vary widely, indicating high uncertainty
3. Progress in AI has historically been uneven and difficult to predict
4. The relationship between conversational ability and general intelligence remains theoretically unclear
