## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The original "Cash for Clunkers" program, officially known as the Car Allowance Rebate System (CARS), was enacted in 2009 amid the recession to stimulate auto sales and increase fuel efficiency. It distributed about $3 billion and retired roughly 700,000 old vehicles, with strict requirements for scrappage and engine disablement[1][2].
- The 2009 program was designed as short-term economic stimulus, not long-term environmental policy[1][2].
- Since then, there has not been another federal program of comparable scale, though some state-level "clunker" programs persist[3][4].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- In 2021 and 2022, Senator Chuck Schumer and other policymakers proposed a new "Cash for Clunkers" plan aimed at accelerating the transition to zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs), focusing on environmental outcomes rather than economic stimulus. Schumer’s proposal envisioned $392 billion to replace 63 million ICE vehicles with ZEVs[5].
- However, as of March 2023, this proposal was not included in the major infrastructure bill under consideration, nor had any similar federal legislation advanced to a floor vote[5].
- The federal policy focus has instead been on EV tax credits, expanding charging infrastructure, and incentives for manufacturers, but not on a massive ICE vehicle buyback targeting over 50 million vehicles or allocating $100 billion+ for this purpose[5].
- Momentum for major new vehicle incentives has slowed, with incremental policy via tax credits (e.g., $7,500 per EV) rather than large-scale scrappage or trade-in programs[5].

## Key Differences Affecting the Forecast

- **Economic Context**: The 2009 program was a response to a deep economic crisis and collapsing auto sales. In contrast, by 2023 car sales had rebounded, supply was constrained due to chip shortages, and industry profits were high[5].
- **Policy Focus**: The current policy focus is on infrastructure and targeted consumer incentives rather than a sweeping scrappage-and-replacement program[5].
- **Political Environment**: Large-scale federal spending on new consumer incentives for vehicle replacement faces significant legislative hurdles, with divided government and competing priorities in Congress.
- **Industry Trends**: Automakers are investing heavily in ZEVs, but are focused on supply chain, manufacturing capacity, and charging infrastructure. Major automakers have also hit caps on existing EV tax credits, which policymakers have sought to address incrementally[5].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Kelley Blue Book, Wikipedia, and advocacy summaries confirm no federal program meeting the strict resolution criteria was passed or imminent as of March 2023[1][2][5].
- Proposals for large-scale ICE scrappage programs remain at the discussion stage, not advanced in legislation[5].
- Key details for program eligibility, scope, and funding are outlined in the referenced sources[1][2][5].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- Political dynamics could change with future elections, shifting the feasibility of large-scale climate or vehicle-incentive legislation.
- Economic shocks or recessions could prompt renewed interest in consumer stimulus programs.
- The EV market’s trajectory—now a higher policy priority—could affect incentives, but current federal strategies are incremental, not transformational.
- No pending legislation as of March 2023 matches the resolution criteria: at least $100 billion earmarked for ICE-to-ZEV replacement with direct incentives for over 50 million vehicles[5].

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Based on the above, the probability that the US will enact a new federal "Cash for Clunkers" law (as defined in the resolution criteria) before January 1, 2027, is low. The lack of legislative momentum, policy focus on incremental rather than transformative change, and absence of economic crisis comparable to 2009 all weigh against passage. A reasonable forecast as of March 2023 is **less than 15%** probability that such a law will be enacted before 2027.
