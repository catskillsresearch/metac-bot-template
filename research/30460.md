# Dallas, TX Home Price Forecast Analysis (November 2024)

Based on available data as of November 2024, here's an analysis of factors relevant to forecasting whether Dallas home prices will show a year-over-year increase according to Zillow's Home Value Index.

## Regional Housing Market Trends

The broader Texas housing market shows concerning signals for Dallas home price appreciation. According to Zillow's projections published in early 2024, several major Texas metropolitan areas were forecast to experience price declines from November 2023 to November 2024:

- Houston: -2.0% decline (from $300,667 to $294,654)
- Austin: -2.1% decline (from $455,424 to $445,860)
- San Antonio: -2.1% decline (from $284,292 to $278,322)[3]

While these forecasts don't specifically address Dallas, they suggest a regional trend of modest price declines across major Texas metropolitan areas. This regional pattern could potentially extend to the Dallas market as well.

## Current Dallas Property Values

Limited data is available for specific Dallas properties. As of November 20, 2024, a high-end property at 3417 Villanova St in Dallas was valued at $3,129,600 according to Zillow's Zestimate, with an estimated sales range between $2.88M and $3.41M[5]. However, this represents just one luxury property and doesn't provide year-over-year comparison data needed to assess the broader market trend.

## Limitations in Available Data

The available information has several significant limitations:

1. No direct Dallas-specific ZHVI year-over-year comparison data is provided in the search results
2. The forecasts for other Texas cities are from early 2024 and may not reflect more recent market developments
3. Individual property data cannot be extrapolated to represent the entire Dallas market
4. The search results don't include the specific Zillow Home Value Index data for Dallas that would be needed to directly answer the question

## Contextual Factors

The broader housing market in 2024 has been influenced by several factors that could impact Dallas home prices:

- Interest rate fluctuations affecting mortgage affordability
- Regional economic performance
- Housing supply constraints
- Migration patterns to and from Texas cities

Without specific Dallas ZHVI data comparing November 2023 to November 2024, it's difficult to make a definitive forecast. However, the projected declines in other major Texas metropolitan areas suggest that Dallas may follow a similar pattern of modest year-over-year price decreases rather than increases.
