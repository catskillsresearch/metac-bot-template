### Key Factual Information Relevant to Forecast

- Ukrainian MP Oleksandr Dubinsky has publicly demanded President Volodymyr Zelensky's impeachment, citing diplomatic failures, Ukraine's increasing international isolation, the loss of Western support, mishandling of the war with Russia, and suppression of dissent[3][4][5].
- Dubinsky has called for an emergency session of the Verkhovna Rada (Ukraine's parliament) to initiate impeachment proceedings against Zelensky, making his demands widely known through public statements and social media posts[3][4][5].
- These calls for impeachment gained momentum following a high-profile incident at the White House involving Zelensky, Donald Trump, and JD Vance, which Dubinsky and some others characterized as a diplomatic failure for Zelensky[3][4][5].
- Despite these demands, there is no evidence in the available sources that the Verkhovna Rada has formally initiated impeachment proceedings against President Zelensky as of March 19, 2025. The sources only document calls for such action, not the actual initiation of the process[3][4][5].
- The impeachment process in Ukraine requires specific procedural steps, including a formal parliamentary vote to initiate proceedings, none of which are reported as having occurred in the cited sources.

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- The available information is limited to public statements and media reports about demands for impeachment, not about actual parliamentary action.
- No authoritative source confirms that the Verkhovna Rada has begun the formal impeachment process against Zelensky as of the knowledge cutoff date.
- Political dynamics in Ukraine can shift rapidly, but as of March 19, 2025, only calls for impeachment—not formal proceedings—are documented.

### Conclusion

As of March 19, 2025, there is no factual evidence that Ukraine's parliament has initiated impeachment proceedings against President Volodymyr Zelensky. While public calls for impeachment have been made by at least one MP, these have not translated into formal parliamentary action according to available sources.
