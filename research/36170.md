# Forecasting Ukraine's Potential Impeachment Proceedings Against Zelensky

As of mid-March 2025, there have been calls for impeachment proceedings against Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, but no confirmation that the parliament has formally initiated such proceedings. Here's the relevant information to help forecast whether this will occur before April 1, 2025.

## Current Status and Recent Developments

In early March 2025, Ukrainian MP Oleksandr Dubinsky publicly called for President Zelensky's impeachment following what he described as a "diplomatic failure" during a meeting with US President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance at the White House[1][3]. This meeting reportedly involved a "heated exchange" or "shouting match" between the Ukrainian and American leaders[3].

Dubinsky demanded an "emergency session of the Ukrainian Parliament" to initiate impeachment proceedings against Zelensky[2]. His statement, posted on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), characterized the White House meeting as a "public humiliation" of Zelensky and claimed it marked "the final act of the regime's collapse"[2][3].

The impeachment demands appear to have gained some momentum in early March 2025[2], though the search results don't specify how many MPs support this initiative or whether parliamentary leadership has responded to these calls.

## Grounds for Impeachment Claims

Dubinsky cited several specific reasons for his impeachment demand:

1. **Foreign policy failure**: He claimed Zelensky's diplomacy has led to "Ukraine's international isolation and the loss of allied support"[3][4]

2. **War management**: Dubinsky characterized the conflict with Russia as a "lost war" resulting from "incompetent leadership and catastrophic decisions"[3][4]

3. **Authoritarian tendencies**: He accused Zelensky of "violations of citizens' rights and usurpation of power" through "suppression of the opposition, persecution of dissenters, and authoritarian methods of government"[3][4]

Dubinsky's statement included a direct appeal to fellow parliamentarians: "I appeal to all Members of the Ukrainian Parliament: stop wasting time, stop waiting. Zelensky is bankrupt. Zelensky is not Ukraine. It is time to put him on trial."[2]

## Impeachment Process in Ukraine

For impeachment proceedings to be initiated in Ukraine, the parliament (Verkhovna Rada) would need to follow the process established by Ukrainian law. While the search results don't detail the specific procedural steps that have or haven't been taken, they indicate that Dubinsky is calling for an "emergency session" specifically to address impeachment[2][3].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several important factors remain unclear from the available information:

1. The level of parliamentary support for impeachment proceedings beyond Dubinsky's individual call
2. The position of other political factions and party leaders on this issue
3. Whether the parliamentary leadership has scheduled or plans to schedule the requested emergency session
4. The procedural status of any potential impeachment motion
5. Zelensky's response to these impeachment demands

Additionally, it's worth noting that Dubinsky himself appears to have legal troubles, as he mentions being "thrown into prison not for a crime, but for telling the truth"[4], which may affect how his impeachment call is perceived by other lawmakers.

Given the limited timeframe between these calls in early March and the April 1 deadline, and the lack of information about concrete parliamentary actions, there is significant uncertainty about whether formal impeachment proceedings will be initiated within this period.
