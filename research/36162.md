## Great Lakes Ice Cover Forecast for March 30, 2025

**1. Historical Trends and Current Status**
- Maximum ice cover on the Great Lakes typically occurs from mid-February to early March. By late March, ice cover usually declines rapidly due to seasonal warming[1].
- For the 2025 season, the U.S. National Ice Center and NOAA GLERL forecast slightly below normal ice conditions for most lakes, with a mild winter expected overall[2].
- As of mid-March 2025, temperatures have been well above normal, accelerating ice melt and causing significant ice decay across the region[4].
- The most recent observed data (from mid-March) reported a total Great Lakes ice cover of 30.8%[3].

**2. Recent Announcements and Policies**
- NOAA GLERL and the U.S. National Ice Center have both indicated that the 2025 ice season is expected to be mild, with below-average ice cover due to strong warm weather patterns (AMO and PDO) outweighing neutral ENSO effects[2].
- No new policies directly affecting ice cover have been announced; the changes are driven by climate and weather patterns.

**3. Authoritative Sources for Verification**
- The primary source for official ice cover data is the Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory (GLERL), which provides daily updates and historical records[1].
- The official resolution for this question will use the "GL Total" figure from the GLERL data set for day 89 of 2025.

**4. Limitations and Uncertainties**
- The exact percentage for March 30, 2025, is not available as of March 18, 2025; the most recent data is from mid-March.
- Ice cover can change rapidly in late March due to weather variability, so forecasts may have a margin of error.
- Data updates may lag, and if the resolution source is not updated by the target date, the most recent preceding value will be used.

> Based on historical patterns, the mild winter forecast, and the rapid ice decay observed in March 2025, it is likely that the Great Lakes ice cover on March 30, 2025, will be significantly below the mid-March value of 30.8%, possibly in the low double digits or single digits. However, the precise percentage will be determined by the official GLERL "GL Total" figure for day 89 of 2025.
