# Nebraska Drought Forecast Analysis: February 2025

As of February 2025, Nebraska is experiencing significant drought conditions that could impact the number of residents living in drought areas by late March 2025. This analysis examines the current drought status, trends, and factors that may influence conditions by March 28, 2025.

## Current Drought Status (February 2025)

Nebraska is currently experiencing widespread drought conditions:

- As of February 13, 2025, moderate drought was affecting 91% of Nebraska's land area[2]
- Northern and northwestern Nebraska are facing more severe conditions, with 48% of land in these regions experiencing severe or extreme drought[2]
- Less than 1% of Nebraska is free from drought stress as of mid-February 2025[3]
- The remaining areas include 8% classified as abnormally dry and 44% in D1 (moderate drought) conditions[3]

## Recent Trends and Developments

The drought situation has been worsening in early 2025:

- After a period of minimal change, the week before February 17 saw degradation across the southern Panhandle and southwestern Nebraska[1][5]
- Severe drought (D2) expanded into more of Morrill and Garden counties and parts of Cheyenne counties[1][5]
- Abnormally dry conditions (D0) expanded into more of Perkins, Chase, and Dundy counties[1][5]
- Moderate drought (D1) expanded into more of Keith and Lincoln counties and from western Buffalo into Frontier counties[1][5]

Most of Nebraska has experienced a dry start to 2025:

- With the exception of far southeastern Nebraska, precipitation from January 1 through February 16 ranks among the top 25 driest year-to-date periods for many districts[1][5]
- Similar dry conditions are present across much of the Corn Belt and Northern Plains[1][5]

## Soil Moisture and Agricultural Implications

Current soil moisture conditions are concerning:

- Most of Nebraska and the broader north-central U.S. has lower than average soil moisture despite snow cover and frozen ground[1][5]
- These moisture deficits will need correction in spring to provide adequate reserves for crops entering the summer growing season[1][5]

## Potential for Improvement

There is some potential for improvement in drought conditions:

- Recent snow and winter precipitation led to improvements in far southeastern Nebraska[5]
- Climatologists note that "a couple of good rains in March would likely eliminate or at least improve drought across much of south-central and eastern Nebraska"[5]
- However, experts caution that "it's not going to be one event. It's not going to be one snowstorm" that resolves the drought situation[2]

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors create uncertainty in forecasting drought conditions for late March:

- The search results do not provide specific population figures for drought-affected areas
- March precipitation patterns remain uncertain
- The rate at which drought conditions might improve or worsen over the next month is difficult to predict

## Conclusion

Based on the available information as of February 26, 2025, Nebraska is experiencing widespread drought conditions affecting at least 91% of the state's land area. While there is potential for improvement with March precipitation, the current trend shows worsening conditions in several regions. The determination of whether 1.7 million or more Nebraska residents will be living in drought areas by March 28, 2025, would require additional population distribution data and more specific precipitation forecasts than are available in the current sources.
