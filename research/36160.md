As of March 18, 2025, The Tucker Carlson Show is ranked #10 and The New York Times Daily is ranked #11 on Spotify’s U.S. Top Podcasts chart, indicating very close competition between the two. Spotify’s podcast rankings are primarily influenced by unique listener counts, follower numbers, recent listener engagement, and user interactions such as shares and playlist adds [5].

The New York Times Daily has a long-standing, loyal audience with consistent engagement, historically keeping it near the top of the charts [3]. The Tucker Carlson Show has recently gained enough popularity to reach #10, showing strong listener interest, though political podcasts may experience more volatility depending on current events.

No recent Spotify policy changes or announcements suggest shifts in ranking methodology that would favor one podcast over the other [5]. Given the narrow margin and the factors involved, the podcast ranked higher on March 31, 2025, will likely be the one that maintains or increases its listener engagement and follower growth in the intervening period.

Therefore, while The Tucker Carlson Show currently holds a slight ranking advantage, the outcome is uncertain and depends on dynamic listener behavior. Both podcasts have the potential to be ranked higher on March 31, 2025, but the current data slightly favors The Tucker Carlson Show maintaining the #10 spot.
