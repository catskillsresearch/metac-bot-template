### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The deadliest earthquake in the 2020–2029 period so far is the 7.8 magnitude Gaziantep, Turkey earthquake on February 6, 2023[1][2].
- Other deadly earthquakes in this period include the 2021 Haiti earthquake (2,248 deaths), the 2022 Afghanistan earthquake (1,163 deaths), and the 2020 Aegean Sea earthquake (119 deaths)[2].
- For comparison, the 2010 Haiti earthquake caused an estimated 100,000 deaths, while the 2011 Tōhoku, Japan earthquake and tsunami resulted in 15,899 deaths.
- No earthquake from 2020 through mid-2025 has approached the Haiti event in terms of fatalities. Recent deadly earthquakes in both developing and developed countries have produced death tolls in the low thousands or less[1][2][4].

### Key Differences Affecting the Forecast

- **Building Codes and Preparedness:** Countries with strict building codes and robust emergency response (e.g., Japan) tend to have lower fatality rates, even in large quakes. In contrast, countries with poor infrastructure, such as Haiti or Afghanistan, are at higher risk for mass casualties[4].
- **Population Density:** Earthquakes near densely populated and poorly constructed urban areas remain the greatest risk for very high fatalities.
- **Recent Trends:** Recent deadly earthquakes, while tragic, have not reached the extreme death tolls of past decades. The largest recent event (Turkey 2023) resulted in a death toll significantly lower than Haiti 2010[1][2].
- **No Major Policy Shifts:** No substantial global policy, technological, or engineering advancements since 2020 have dramatically altered earthquake mortality risk, though some at-risk countries (e.g., the Philippines) remain underprepared[4].

### Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

- The most probable scenario, based on events from 2020 to mid-2025, is that the deadliest earthquake in 2020–2029 will have a death toll in the low tens of thousands, rather than a six-figure catastrophe as seen in Haiti 2010.
- The recent maximum is the Turkey 2023 earthquake, with a death toll likely in the range of tens of thousands but well below 100,000[1][2].
- Catastrophes on the scale of Haiti 2010 remain possible but are historically rare and would require a large-magnitude event in a densely populated, poorly prepared region.

#### Probabilistic Range (2020–2029):

| Deaths           | Probability Estimate |
|------------------|---------------------|
| Under 10,000     | Moderate-high       |
| 10,000–30,000    | Moderate            |
| 30,000–100,000   | Low                 |
| Over 100,000     | Very low            |

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- National government statements (Turkey, Haiti, Afghanistan, etc.)
- U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)
- European-Mediterranean Seismological Centre
- Prominent scientific studies (by citation count)

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- Fatality estimates are often revised upward or downward as new information emerges.
- In under-resourced regions, significant undercounting is possible, especially in rural or inaccessible areas.
- There remains a low but nonzero probability of an unprecedented event in a highly vulnerable area.
