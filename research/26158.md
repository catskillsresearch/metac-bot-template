### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- In May 2024, sunspot region AR3664 (now AR3697) produced numerous M- and X-class solar flares, causing intense geomagnetic storms and auroras visible at unusually low latitudes. This indicates the region's potential for strong space weather events[1].
- As of early June 2024, AR3697 returned to face Earth, and space weather forecasters continued to monitor it for further activity, suggesting ongoing potential for geomagnetic disturbances[1].
- Sunspots like AR3697 are known to produce solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs), which can trigger geomagnetic storms when directed toward Earth[1].

### Kp Index and Geomagnetic Storm Severity

- The Kp index measures fluctuations in Earth's magnetic field on a scale from 0 to 9, with values of 5 or higher indicating a geomagnetic storm (G1 or greater on the NOAA Space Weather Scales)[1].
- A Kp value greater than 4 but less than or equal to 5 would correspond to unsettled to minor storm conditions (just reaching the G1 threshold)[1].

### Recent Announcements and Forecasts

- As of July 2024, no specific forecast or alert for the period July 17–28, 2024, is available in the provided sources.
- Long-range aurora forecasts exist, but their reliability decreases with time, and they do not provide precise Kp values for specific dates more than a few days in advance[1].
- The German Research Center for Geosciences provides running 30-day Kp histories, which are used for official verification, but these are retrospective and not predictive[1].

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The German Research Center for Geosciences is the authoritative source for Kp index values and will provide the official record for the resolution of this question[1].
- NOAA and other space weather agencies provide real-time and short-term forecasts, but their predictive skill for specific Kp values weeks in advance is limited[1].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- Forecasting the exact Kp index for a specific future period is inherently uncertain, especially more than a few days in advance, due to the unpredictable nature of solar activity and CME propagation[1].
- While AR3697 has a history of producing strong geomagnetic storms, the likelihood of a Kp value specifically in the range (>4, ≤5) during July 17–28, 2024, cannot be determined with high confidence from available data as of July 15, 2024[1].
- The Kp index is measured in thirds and rounded to the nearest thousandth, so small differences can affect the classification[1].

### Summary

- As of July 15, 2024, there is no definitive forecast indicating that the strongest geomagnetic storm between July 17 and July 28, 2024, will have a Kp index greater than 4 and less than or equal to 5.
- The potential for geomagnetic activity remains elevated due to the presence of AR3697, but the exact Kp values for the specified period are not predictable with current data.
- Official resolution will depend on the retrospective Kp data from the German Research Center for Geosciences.
