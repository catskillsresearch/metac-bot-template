### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of July 12, 2024, the CDC reports a cumulative total of five human cases of A(H5) infection in the United States: one in 2022 (poultry worker) and four in 2024 (dairy workers in Texas, Michigan, and Colorado)[4][5].
- All recent U.S. cases have been associated with direct exposure to infected animals (dairy cows or poultry), with no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission[4][5].
- The CDC and WHO both assess the risk to the general public as low, and there is no indication of a significant change in the epidemiology of H5N1 in the U.S. as of July 2024[4][5].

### Recent Announcements and Policies

- The CDC is collaborating with USDA, FDA, and state health departments using a One Health approach to monitor and respond to the outbreak[4].
- Enhanced surveillance and reporting are in place, but no major policy changes or new interventions have been announced that would suggest a sudden increase in case detection[4].

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- CDC’s official H5N1 situation summary and response updates[4].
- WHO Disease Outbreak News on avian influenza A(H5N1) in the United States[5].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- Surveillance systems are robust, but mild or asymptomatic cases may go undetected, potentially leading to underreporting[4].
- The situation could change if there is a significant outbreak or a shift in the virus’s transmissibility, but as of July 2024, there is no evidence of such a development[4][5].

### Forecast

Based on the current cumulative total (five cases as of July 12, 2024), the historical rate of new case reporting (about one per month), and the absence of new risk factors or policy changes, it is unlikely that the CDC will report 12 to 20 total human cases of H5 in the United States by October 1, 2024, unless there is an unexpected and significant change in the outbreak dynamics.
