## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Israel is a global leader in IVF: It has the highest per capita rate of IVF cycles in the world, with extensive state funding and 26 recognized IVF units as of 2024[2].
- PGD (Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis) is widely used and covered by public insurance, but only for medical reasons—primarily to avoid serious genetic diseases. The state covers PGD for up to two children per family[2].
- Embryo selection for non-medical traits (like intelligence) is not included in Israel's standard healthcare coverage. Applications for sex selection for non-medical reasons require special approval and are self-funded[4].
- Israeli public and religious authorities are comparatively permissive regarding embryo research and selection, especially relative to Christian-majority countries, with a track record of rapid adoption of new medical technologies[2][4].
- Recent legal cases indicate strong regulatory oversight and a readiness to address complex ethical issues around IVF, though these mostly concern parentage and genetic connection, not trait selection[5][1].

## 2. Key Differences Affecting the Forecast

- **Regulatory/Policy Environment**: Current Israeli regulations restrict publicly funded PGD to medical indications. Non-medical uses (like intelligence selection) are neither explicitly banned nor covered, but require special approval and are not part of the healthcare basket[4].
- **Technological Readiness**: Israel’s IVF/PGD infrastructure is advanced, and there is local expertise in polygenic scoring (e.g., research by Shai Carmi), but as of 2022, polygenic selection for intelligence is only marginally effective (expected gain of about 2.5–7 IQ points based on current and near-future scores)[2].
- **Cultural/Religious Factors**: Judaism’s permissive stance toward embryo research and selection, combined with a strong public interest in genetic health, suggests reduced ethical barriers compared to many other countries.
- **Comparative International Context**: No other country of similar size or larger (over 1 million people) has both the technical capacity and the permissive cultural/regulatory environment that would plausibly allow >10% of births via intelligence-based embryo selection in the near future.

## 3. Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

- **Short-to-Medium Term (2022–2030):** It is highly unlikely that Israel, or any other country, will reach the >10% threshold for intelligence-based embryo selection by 2030. The main barriers are regulatory (current exclusion from public health funding and need for special approval), predictive power of polygenic scores, and potential public opposition if non-medical selection becomes widely debated.
- **Longer Term (2030–2050):** If polygenic selection for intelligence is shown to be safe, effective (≥3 IQ points expected gain), and socially accepted, Israel is plausibly the most likely first-mover among countries with >1 million people, due to its unique combination of factors. Probability is moderate-to-high relative to peer countries, but overall probability remains below 50% absent clear policy shifts.
- **Key Triggers to Watch:** Advances in polygenic scoring, legal or policy changes to allow non-medical selection for traits like intelligence, and early signals of consumer demand and uptake in private clinics.

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- **Measurement**: Data on the proportion of births resulting from polygenic selection for intelligence are not routinely collected or published. Uptake may be underestimated or overestimated in the absence of mandatory reporting.
- **Definition**: What qualifies as “embryo selection for intelligence” (e.g., minimum predictive gain, use of polygenic scores vs. monogenic selection) could affect future reporting and resolution.
- **Regulatory Risk**: Sudden policy shifts, either permissive or restrictive, could dramatically change the forecast.
- **Technological Uncertainty**: Predictive power and cost-effectiveness of polygenic embryo selection remain uncertain as of 2022.

## Summary Table: Israel vs. Reference Cases

| Factor                     | Israel           | Other Developed Countries      |
|----------------------------|------------------|-------------------------------|
| IVF Cycles per Capita      | Highest globally | High (Denmark, US), lower elsewhere |
| PGD Public Coverage        | Yes, for medical reasons | Rare or limited                |
| PGD for Intelligence       | Not approved, requires special application | Not approved                |
| Regulatory Attitude        | Permissive for research; restrictive for non-medical PGD | Generally restrictive         |
| Technical Readiness        | Advanced         | Advanced in some, but less universal |
| Cultural/Religious Attitude| Permissive       | More restrictive in many cases |
