## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- In 2017, Catalonia held an independence referendum and declared independence, but Spain did not recognize this, invoking direct rule and removing the Catalan government. No country recognized Catalonia as independent, and the declaration had no legal effect[3].
- Since then, the Spanish state has prosecuted and imprisoned or exiled key independence leaders, though a 2024-2025 amnesty has partially eased these tensions, allowing for some leadersâ€™ return and broader dialogue[5].
- Recent years have seen continued efforts to increase Catalan autonomy and linguistic rights, but even proposals to make Catalan an official EU language have repeatedly stalled due to lack of consensus within Spain and the EU[1][2][4].

## 2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- The 2024-2025 Spanish amnesty for Catalan independence activists represents a thaw in relations, but not a move toward recognition. Key leaders remain in exile or barred from office until at least 2031[5].
- The Spanish government and major parties continue to reject any legal path to independence or secession, and the Spanish Constitution remains unchanged on national unity.
- Efforts to secure greater recognition for the Catalan language have not translated into political recognition or autonomy[1][2][4].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- [Euractiv][1], [Oxford Political Review][2], and [Euronews][4] provide updates on language status and political negotiations.
- [Verfassungsblog][5] and [Wikipedia][3] detail the legal and political history of the conflict.

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- Forecasting to 2070 introduces major uncertainties: possible constitutional reforms, shifts in public opinion, geopolitical upheavals, or EU-level changes could alter the situation.
- The resolution criteria allow for rare scenarios such as state dissolution or foreign invasions, which are unpredictable but possible over a long timeframe.
- The lack of current momentum for recognition, even for minor concessions, suggests a low near-term probability, but over a 45-year horizon, small probabilities compound.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given:
- The entrenched position of the Spanish state and lack of international support for Catalan independence,
- Recent conciliatory but not recognition-oriented policies,
- The historical difficulty of secession from stable democracies,
- The long time horizon (to 2070) allowing for rare, disruptive events,

**A probabilistic forecast would assign a low, but non-negligible, probability (on the order of 10-20%) that Spain will recognize Catalonia or that a qualifying scenario occurs by 2070.** Most plausible paths involve major constitutional crises or unforeseen disruptions, rather than a negotiated settlement in the current political context.
