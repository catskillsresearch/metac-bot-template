### Key Factual Information for Forecasting Homestead's Opening Weekend

- **Distributor Track Record**: Angel Studios' recent releases in 2024 include Sight ($7.2 million opening) and Haikyu!! The Dumpster Battle ($7.07 million opening), both hovering around the $7 million threshold[5]. This suggests that Homestead, with similar distribution and marketing resources, could plausibly open in this range.

- **Analyst Predictions**: Industry commentary as of December 2024 forecasts Homestead's opening weekend in the $8â€“10 million range, citing comparable films and the potential for strong audience interest during the holiday season[1]. The analyst notes that Richard Jewell, with a less appealing premise, managed a $4 million opening, implying Homestead could outperform that benchmark.

- **Release Window Dynamics**: The Christmas period typically boosts box office performance, but the crowded slate of releases introduces uncertainty. The analyst highlights both the potential for a breakout and the risk of underperformance due to competition[1].

- **Format Considerations**: Homestead is marketed as a theatrical event featuring the first two episodes of a series, which may attract a dedicated audience but could also limit broader appeal compared to standalone films[2].

- **Measurement and Verification**: The official domestic opening weekend gross will be reported by Box Office Mojo, covering the U.S., Canada, and Puerto Rico, and will not include ancillary revenues[5].

- **Uncertainties**: Forecasting is complicated by the competitive landscape, unknown critical/audience reception, and the unique format of the release. The cited analyst acknowledges the high degree of unpredictability for the 2024 Christmas box office[1].

### Conclusion

Based on available data as of December 11, 2024, the best-supported forecast is that Homestead's domestic opening weekend box office is likely to slightly exceed $7 million, given Angel Studios' recent performance and industry predictions. However, significant uncertainty remains due to the crowded holiday release schedule and the film's unconventional format.
