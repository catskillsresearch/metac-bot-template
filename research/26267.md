## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of 2024, nuclear fusion has not yet delivered net electricity to the grid, though laboratory “ignition” (net energy gain in experimental setups) was achieved and replicated in 2022 and 2023, demonstrating proof-of-concept[5].
- Nuclear fission, by comparison, peaked at 6.6% of world primary energy in 2001 and has since declined in share as global energy demand grew.
- Over 45 private companies globally, including Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS), Helion Energy, and Zap Energy, are pursuing commercial fusion; private equity funding surpassed $7.1 billion, with significant public funding from the US, Germany, and South Korea[1][2][3].

## 2. Recent Announcements and Policies

- The US increased fusion research funding to $790 million in 2024 and passed a fusion commercialization bill in June 2024[5].
- Major international projects (e.g., ITER in France, EU-Japan fusion testing near Tokyo) are ongoing, though ITER has been delayed by at least a decade due to technical and supply chain issues[5].
- Public and private funding for fusion R&D and commercialization continues to accelerate, reflecting increased confidence but also acknowledging the timeline and infrastructure challenges[1][2][3][5].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- BP Statistical Review of World Energy (annual)
- International Energy Agency (IEA) reports
- Fusion Industry Association annual reports[2]
- US Department of Energy Fusion Energy Strategy[4]

## 4. Key Differences and Factors Affecting the Forecast

- Fusion’s transition from “net energy gain” in the lab to industrial-scale, grid-connected deployment requires major advances in engineering, regulatory approval, supply chains, and capital investment.
- Even with AGI-driven acceleration, physical constraints (construction lead times, component manufacturing, workforce, grid upgrades) limit how fast fusion could scale.
- No precedent exists for a new energy source to capture >10% of global primary energy within five years of first commercial operation.
- Current expert consensus places commercial fusion 10–30 years away even with optimistic assumptions, barring transformative breakthroughs[5].

## 5. Probabilistic Assessment (Adjusted for AGI)

Given the above, even under an AGI-accelerated scenario, the probability that nuclear fusion will provide more than 10% of the world’s primary energy within five years after AGI is low—likely less than 10%. The main constraints are physical deployment speed, not just scientific breakthroughs. Rapid AGI-enabled innovation may shorten timelines, but scaling to >10% global share would require a historically unprecedented rate of infrastructure buildout.

## 6. Measurement Limitations and Uncertainties

- Fusion’s share of global energy will only count if it is clearly reported and distinct from fission/nuclear in BP or equivalent datasets.
- Uncertainties include the actual arrival date of AGI, the possibility of further fusion breakthroughs or setbacks, and global economic or geopolitical disruptions.
