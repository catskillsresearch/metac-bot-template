# IBEX 35 Year-End 2025 Forecast Analysis

As of May 26, 2025, I've analyzed available forecasts and technical indicators to assess whether the IBEX 35 will close above its starting value of 11,595.00 by the end of 2025.

## Current Status and Historical Context

The IBEX 35 has shown strong performance in recent years, having led European markets with a 23% increase in 2023 and continuing as the second-best performing major European index in 2024 with a 14.78% gain. This positive momentum provides context for analyzing 2025 projections.

Several forecasting services have provided outlooks for the IBEX 35 through the end of 2025:

- WalletInvestor projects IBEX 35 Futures price to reach $10,391.40, indicating an expected increase from current levels[2].

- TradersUnion offers a more bullish outlook, forecasting the IBEX 35 to potentially reach â‚¬16,470.93 by the end of 2025[4].

- GovCapital presents the most optimistic scenario, with a forecast suggesting the index could reach 30,000 points by the end of 2025[3].

## Technical Analysis Indicators

Elliott Wave analysis from TradingView suggests the IBEX is positioned for continued growth. The technical pattern indicates the index may surpass its March 25, 2025 peak, which marked the end of wave I in Elliott Wave analysis[5]. The subsequent correction (wave II) appears complete, with the index having recovered strongly since then, following an impulsive pattern that suggests further upside potential.

The analysis indicates that as long as the 11,570.06 low holds, any pullbacks should attract buyers in a 3, 7, or 11-swing pattern, supporting further gains[5].

## Fundamental Factors

The dividend outlook for the IBEX 35 appears strong, with dividend yield projected to reach 5.05% in 2025, which is noted to be double the yield of bonds[5]. This attractive dividend profile could support continued investor interest in Spanish equities through year-end.

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on the available forecasts and technical indicators, there appears to be a higher probability that the IBEX 35 will close 2025 above its starting value of 11,595.00:

1. Most forecasts project values significantly higher than the starting point
2. Technical patterns suggest continued upward momentum
3. Strong dividend yields provide fundamental support

However, several uncertainties remain:

1. The wide range of forecasts (from approximately 9,000 to 30,000 points) indicates significant disagreement among analysts[3][4]
2. Some forecasts may not have accounted for recent market developments
3. Global macroeconomic conditions could shift in the remaining months of 2025

## Limitations

It's important to note that these forecasts were made at different points in time, and some may not reflect the most current market conditions. Additionally, stock market predictions are inherently uncertain and subject to numerous unpredictable factors including geopolitical events, monetary policy changes, and macroeconomic shifts.
