## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- By early 2025, over 659 million people hold cryptocurrencies (30% growth YoY), and the number of merchants accepting digital assets has nearly doubled to 15,000 globally. However, this still represents a tiny share of all businesses, and most are small or medium-sized enterprises rather than tech giants[1].
- Major companies like Microsoft accept crypto for select digital services, but Amazon, Google, Meta, Tesla, and X have not enabled direct crypto payments for their core products or services[4][5].
- Amazon continues to not accept direct crypto payments, though third-party solutions (e.g., Purse.io) allow crypto holders to shop indirectly. This does not meet the strict resolution criteria, as Amazon itself does not display prices in crypto or accept crypto at checkout[5].
- No evidence suggests Google, Meta, Tesla, or X currently accept direct crypto payments for core offerings[4][5].

## 2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- The US regulatory environment remains largely unchanged: cryptocurrencies are not legal tender, and companies face legal, tax, and accounting complexities in accepting crypto[1][3].
- Despite a pro-crypto political climate following Trump’s election and the Bitcoin price surge, there have been no public announcements by these companies signaling a shift to native crypto acceptance at checkout as of January 2025[4][5].
- Adoption is growing fastest in industries like e-commerce, luxury retail, and travel—but typically via smaller players or through payment processors, not through direct integration by the largest tech firms[1][3].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Industry reports and lists (Crypto.com, Volet.com, B2BinPay) consistently show Microsoft as the largest US tech name with crypto acceptance, but not Google, Meta, Amazon, Tesla, or X[2][4][5].
- News outlets and crypto industry trackers continue to monitor new adoption, but at present, none of these five companies have made the move to direct crypto checkout for core products.

## 4. Limitations/Uncertainties in Measurement

- Companies may run pilots or limited tests, or allow crypto through select subsidiaries or regions. But unless crypto pricing and checkout is available for a core product or service, and not as an experiment or through a third party, the resolution criteria are not met.
- Policy shifts or sudden competitive moves could alter the landscape rapidly, but as of January 2025, there is no public evidence of such a change.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given current trends, regulatory headwinds, and the lack of direct action by these companies, the probability that Google, Meta, Amazon, Tesla, or X will directly accept crypto at checkout for a core product or service by December 31, 2025, is **low** (estimated in the 10–20% range). Indirect solutions and experimentation may continue, but native, first-party crypto acceptance remains unlikely without a major policy or market shift.
