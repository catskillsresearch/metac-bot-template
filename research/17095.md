# US Compute Capacity Restrictions Forecast Analysis

As of May 26, 2025, I'm analyzing the likelihood that the US will place restrictions on total compute capacity for individuals or companies before 2026, based on historical and current data.

## Current Regulatory Landscape

The US government has implemented significant policies affecting compute capacity and AI development since late 2023, though these have primarily focused on international transfers rather than absolute domestic possession limits:

In October 2023, President Biden issued Executive Order 14110 on "Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence," establishing a comprehensive framework for AI governance[1]. This marked a turning point in US policy approach to advanced computing and AI systems.

By January 2025, the US implemented the "AI Diffusion Framework" which strategically positions US compute providers as key vehicles for global AI compute diffusion while imposing limits on international deployment[5]. This framework includes country-specific quotas, with non-US entities facing more restrictive conditions than US cloud providers.

Most significantly, in January 2025, the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) introduced new export controls featuring Total Processing Power (TPP) quotas[3]. These quotas limit where computing power can be installed and determine license application review policies for various countries. While these restrictions primarily target exports, they represent the first instance of the US government quantitatively limiting compute capacity in specific contexts.

## Key Indicators and Trends

The US has shifted from hardware-focused controls to also regulating AI model weights themselves as of January 2025[3]. This represents a significant expansion in regulatory scope, suggesting increasing government willingness to directly control AI capabilities.

The implementation of TPP quotas demonstrates that the technical and administrative frameworks for measuring and restricting compute capacity are now operational[3]. This creates precedent and infrastructure that could be extended to domestic restrictions.

US cloud providers (Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud) have been positioned as privileged channels for global AI compute diffusion under the framework[5]. This suggests the US government is actively shaping the competitive landscape around compute resources.

## Forecast Assessment

Based on the available evidence through May 2025, I assess the probability of the US implementing absolute restrictions on total compute capacity for individuals or corporations before 2026 as **moderate to low** (approximately 25-35%).

**Supporting factors:**
- The regulatory trajectory shows increasing government willingness to control advanced computing resources
- Technical frameworks for measuring and monitoring compute capacity are now in place
- National security concerns around AI capabilities continue to grow

**Limiting factors:**
- Current restrictions focus on international transfers rather than domestic possession
- The US maintains interest in preserving competitive advantages for domestic AI companies
- Implementing domestic possession limits would face significant industry resistance
- The technical complexity of creating fair and effective absolute limits is substantial

## Uncertainties and Limitations

It's important to note that as of the specified reference date (May 17, 2023), none of the policies discussed in this analysis had been publicly announced. The Executive Order and subsequent regulatory frameworks all came after this date.

The search results don't indicate any specific plans to implement absolute domestic restrictions on compute capacity, though the regulatory infrastructure being developed could potentially enable such restrictions with relatively minor modifications.
