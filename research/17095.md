# US Compute Capacity Restrictions: Forecast Analysis as of May 2025

As of May 2025, the United States has implemented several regulatory measures affecting computational resources, particularly those related to artificial intelligence development. However, these measures differ significantly from the type of absolute restrictions described in the forecasting question.

## Current Regulatory Landscape

In October 2023, the Biden administration issued Executive Order 14110 focusing on "Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence," establishing the foundation for subsequent regulatory actions[1]. The most significant developments came in January 2025, when the Commerce Department unveiled a comprehensive regulatory framework for the "responsible diffusion of artificial intelligence technology"[3][5].

The January 2025 regulations include:

1. **Export Controls on Advanced Computing Chips**: Requiring authorizations for exports, reexports, and transfers involving a broad set of countries[5]

2. **Total Processing Power (TPP) Quotas**: A novel approach limiting where and how computing power can be deployed internationally[4]

3. **AI Model Weight Controls**: For the first time, regulating numerical inputs to AI models trained with 10^26 computational operations or more[4][5]

4. **Data Center Validated End User Program**: Creating two tiers (Universal and National) of authorized entities for data center development[5]

5. **Computing Power Transfer Limits**: UVEUs may not transfer more than seven percent of total AI computing power to non-Artificial Intelligence Authorization Countries[3]

## Key Differences From Forecast Criteria

The current regulatory framework differs from the scenario described in the forecasting question in several important ways:

1. **Focus on International Transfers**: The regulations primarily target exports and international transfers rather than domestic ownership or possession limits[2][5]

2. **Selective Application**: Controls apply to specific types of advanced computing resources and international transfers, not blanket restrictions on domestic compute ownership[4]

3. **Exception-Based Approach**: The framework creates various exceptions (AIA, ACM, LPP) allowing continued access to computing resources under certain conditions[5]

4. **No Absolute Domestic Caps**: There are currently no absolute restrictions on the total amount of compute capacity that US individuals or corporations may purchase, manufacture, or possess domestically[5]

## Forecast Analysis

Based on the current trajectory of US policy as of May 2025, several factors are relevant to forecasting whether absolute restrictions on compute capacity will be implemented before 2026:

**Factors Supporting a "YES" Resolution:**
- The implementation of TPP quotas demonstrates willingness to quantify and limit computational resources in certain contexts[4]
- Controls on AI model weights show evolution toward regulating the outputs of computational processes rather than just hardware[4]
- The regulatory framework continues to expand in scope and complexity since 2023[1][5]

**Factors Supporting a "NO" Resolution:**
- Current regulations focus on international transfers rather than domestic ownership caps[2][3]
- The regulatory approach emphasizes exceptions and authorizations rather than absolute prohibitions[5]
- No evidence yet of planned domestic ownership restrictions in the remaining months of 2025

## Conclusion

As of May 2025, while the US has implemented significant controls on the international transfer and use of advanced computing resources for AI, these do not yet constitute the type of absolute restrictions on domestic compute capacity ownership described in the forecasting question. The current regulatory framework focuses on controlling international flows of computing resources rather than capping domestic ownership.

For the question to resolve as "YES," new regulations would need to be implemented in the remaining months of 2025 that specifically place absolute limits on domestic compute capacity ownership, rather than just regulating international transfers or imposing licensing requirements.
