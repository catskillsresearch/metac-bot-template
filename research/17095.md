# Forecast: US Restrictions on Total Compute Capacity Before 2026

As of May 2025, the United States has implemented significant regulations around advanced computing and AI technologies, though these have primarily focused on exports and international transfers rather than domestic possession limits. Let's analyze the current landscape to forecast whether domestic compute restrictions are likely before 2026.

## Current Regulatory Framework

The US government has established an increasingly comprehensive export control framework for advanced computing and AI technologies:

- In January 2025, the Commerce Department unveiled new rules on "responsible diffusion of artificial intelligence technology," implementing a system of quotas and restrictions on computing power transfers[3].
- These regulations include novel Total Processing Performance (TPP) quotas that limit where computing power can be installed and determine license application review policies[4].
- The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) has expanded controls on advanced computing integrated circuits (ICs) through multiple regulatory updates since October 2022, with additional expansions in 2023 and 2024[5].

## Key Emerging Trends

Several important trends in the current regulatory approach provide insight into potential domestic restrictions:

### 1. Quota-Based Restrictions

The US has implemented TPP quotas that limit computing power transfers:

- License Exception Low Processing Performance (LPP) authorizes export of low volume compute up to 26,900,000 Total Processing Performance per calendar year to individual ultimate consignees[3].
- BIS requires license applicants to specify computing power in their applications and posts public updates on each country's progress toward its quota[4].

### 2. Shift From Hardware to Model Controls

The regulatory focus has expanded beyond hardware:

- As of January 2025, BIS is controlling AI model weights for the first time, marking a notable shift from controlling only the hardware needed to train AI models to controlling numerical inputs to AI models themselves[4].
- This represents a more comprehensive approach to regulating AI capabilities regardless of the underlying hardware.

### 3. Increasingly Restrictive Framework

The regulatory framework has become progressively more restrictive:

- The January 2025 rules revised existing ECCN entries for advanced computing ICs and related items[5].
- The framework expanded the Advanced Computing Foreign Direct Product Rule to apply to all foreign-produced items meeting the product scope, regardless of destination[5].
- The US imposed a worldwide license requirement on the export, reexport, and in-country transfer of such items[5].

## Forecast Analysis

Based on the evidence available as of May 2025, there is a moderate to high probability that the US will implement some form of domestic restrictions on total compute capacity before 2026. The following factors support this assessment:

1. **Existing Regulatory Framework**: The US has already established a comprehensive framework for controlling advanced computing and AI technologies internationally. This framework could be extended to domestic applications.

2. **TPP Quota Precedent**: The implementation of TPP quotas for international transfers sets a precedent for quantitative restrictions on computing power that could be applied domestically[4].

3. **Expanding Scope of Controls**: The regulatory scope has expanded from hardware to model weights, suggesting a trajectory toward more comprehensive controls on AI capabilities[4].

4. **National Security Focus**: The stated rationale for existing controls is to protect "U.S. national security and foreign policy interests"[5], which could easily extend to domestic compute concentration.

## Uncertainties and Limitations

Several factors could influence the timing and nature of potential domestic restrictions:

1. **Political Considerations**: The implementation of domestic restrictions would likely face more significant political challenges than export controls.

2. **Implementation Challenges**: As noted in the search results, there are already "questions about how the [TPP] quotas will be implemented"[4], which could delay domestic applications.

3. **Industry Pushback**: Major US technology companies would likely resist domestic restrictions on compute capacity.

## Conclusion

The evidence suggests a 60-70% probability that the US will implement some form of restrictions on total compute capacity for individuals or companies before 2026. The most likely form would be an extension of the TPP quota system to domestic applications, potentially with higher thresholds than those applied to exports. The trend toward increasing regulation of AI capabilities, coupled with the precedent set by the January 2025 rules, points toward continued expansion of the regulatory framework to address domestic concentration of compute power.
