## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- **Historical Background**: Korea was a unified state for centuries prior to its division in 1945. The Korean War (1950–1953) entrenched the division, and subsequent decades saw the two Koreas develop along sharply divergent political, economic, and ideological lines[1].
- **Reunification Policies**: Both North and South Korea have, at least officially, maintained reunification as a long-term national goal. Notable agreements, such as the 1972 Joint Statement, called for peaceful, independent, and gradual unification[1].
- **Recent Engagements**: The late 2010s saw a thaw in relations, highlighted by North Korea’s participation in the 2018 Winter Olympics and a series of inter-Korean summits. South Korean President Moon Jae-in set a target for reunification by 2045, but substantive progress stalled after 2019[1].
- **Current Situation (as of 2021)**: North Korea remains authoritarian, isolated, and hostile to external influence, while South Korea is a prosperous democracy closely allied with the United States. Communication channels were periodically restored and cut off, with North Korea often using brinkmanship tactics[1].

## 2. Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Forecast

- **Moon Jae-in’s 2045 Proposal**: In 2019, President Moon proposed reunification by 2045, but this was seen more as a symbolic gesture than a concrete plan, given the lack of North Korean reciprocation or actionable steps[1].
- **North Korean Stance**: As of 2021, North Korea’s official rhetoric remained committed to reunification in theory, but in practice prioritized regime survival and military strength, showing little genuine interest in integration on South Korean terms[1].
- **Public Attitudes**: Surveys in South Korea indicate declining public enthusiasm for reunification, especially among younger generations, who are more wary of the economic and social costs[1].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Wikipedia entry on Korean reunification, which provides a comprehensive summary of historical context, agreements, and recent developments[1].

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- **Regime Stability**: The forecast is highly sensitive to unexpected events such as regime change in North Korea, which could radically alter the trajectory.
- **External Shocks**: Major geopolitical shifts (such as changes in China’s stance or US policy) could create unforeseen openings—or new barriers—to reunification.
- **Long Time Horizon**: Predicting events 24 years out is inherently uncertain, as social, political, and technological changes may reshape the landscape in unanticipated ways.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given entrenched division, lack of substantive progress, and significant obstacles (regime type, military posture, public opinion, external stakeholders), the probability that North Korea and South Korea will be recognized as a unified sovereign state by 2045 is low—likely below 10% absent major systemic change.
