## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Pierre Poilievre has been the leader of the Conservative Party and the Official Opposition since September 2022[2].
- The next Canadian federal election is scheduled for no later than October 20, 2025, but could occur earlier due to the minority status of the current Liberal government.
- As of late May 2025, the Liberals remain in government, and Poilievre's Conservatives have released their 2025 campaign platform, indicating that the election period is imminent or ongoing[3][4].

## Recent Developments Affecting the Forecast

- New reporting from May 2025 indicates that Pierre Poilievre lost his seat in Parliament during the 2025 federal election[1].
- Losing his seat would prevent Poilievre from serving as Prime Minister, as Canadian constitutional convention requires the Prime Minister to be a sitting Member of Parliament.
- There is no evidence of a Conservative victory or a change in government as of this date.

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Major Canadian news outlets and party releases confirm the above developments[1][3][4].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- Theoretically, a by-election could allow Poilievre to re-enter Parliament, but such a scenario is highly unlikely within the remaining time frame before January 1, 2026.
- No precedent exists for a party leader who lost their seat to then rapidly become Prime Minister within months.
- The question closes 24 hours before polls open if a federal election is imminent, further narrowing the available window for Poilievre to assume office before 2026.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the loss of his seat in the 2025 federal election, no evidence of a Conservative government, and with the election deadline approaching, the likelihood that Pierre Poilievre will become Prime Minister of Canada before 2026 is effectively zero.
