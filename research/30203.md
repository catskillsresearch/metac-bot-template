They compete against three other nominees:

## Artist Momentum and Overall Nominations

**Lainey Wilson**:

- Currently the reigning Entertainer of the Year and two-time Female Vocalist winner[1]

## Expert Predictions and Analysis

According to industry predictions published on November 7, 2024:

- "White Horse" by Chris Stapleton is considered the favorite to win Single of the Year[5]
- "Watermelon Moonshine" by Lainey Wilson is identified as the main challenger ("keep an eye on")[5]

The analysis suggests that while there are several crossover hits in this category, the Nashville establishment tends to favor established country stars over relative outsiders. This potentially benefits both Stapleton and Wilson over nominees like Post Malone and Shaboozey[5].

Stapleton is described as a "CMA golden boy," which suggests strong industry support that could translate to votes[5]. His track "White Horse" has been particularly successful on radio, which is often a key factor in CMA voting.

Wilson's "Watermelon Moonshine" also enjoyed significant radio impact, making it a strong contender[5]. As the reigning Entertainer of the Year, Wilson carries considerable momentum into this year's awards.

## Historical Context and Voting Patterns

The CMA Awards typically value traditional country sounds and artists with strong industry connections. Both Stapleton and Wilson fit this profile well, with Stapleton often receiving recognition for his more traditional approach and Wilson for her authentic country storytelling.

Stapleton has historically performed well at the CMAs, with multiple wins across various categories over the years. Wilson's star has risen dramatically in recent years, culminating in her Entertainer of the Year win.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors could influence the outcome that cannot be fully predicted:

1. Voting is conducted by industry professionals whose preferences may not always align with commercial success or critical acclaim
2. Late-breaking momentum shifts are possible in the final days before voting closes
3. The strong crossover appeal of Post Malone and Morgan Wallen's collaboration could potentially split votes or create an unexpected outcome
4. The CMA voting body sometimes surprises with unexpected choices that defy predictions

## Conclusion

Based on available information, Chris Stapleton appears to have a slight edge in the Single of the Year category with "White Horse," but Lainey Wilson remains a very strong contender with "Watermelon Moonshine." Stapleton's status as a CMA favorite and the commercial success of "White Horse" work in his favor, while Wilson's current reign as Entertainer of the Year and the strong performance of "Watermelon Moonshine" keep her firmly in contention.

The outcome will likely depend on whether voters prefer to recognize Stapleton's traditional country excellence or continue to celebrate Wilson's rising star status in the industry.
