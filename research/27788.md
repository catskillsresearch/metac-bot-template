## Key Factual Information for Forecasting Tesla Q3 2024 Deliveries

**1. Historical Trends and Current Status**
- Tesla's deliveries for the past six quarters were:
  - Q1 2023: 422,875
  - Q2 2023: 466,140
  - Q3 2023: 435,059
  - Q4 2023: 484,507
  - Q1 2024: 386,810
  - Q2 2024: 443,956[3]
- Q2 2024 deliveries rebounded after a weak Q1 2024, but remain below the Q4 2023 peak.

**2. Recent Announcements and Policies**
- In Q2 2024, Tesla produced about 411,000 vehicles and delivered approximately 444,000[3].
- Industry commentary and independent forecasters suggest Q3 2024 deliveries could be similar to or slightly higher than Q2 2024, with some projections approaching 500,000 vehicles[2][5].
- Tesla's Shanghai factory is reportedly operating at high capacity, with strong Model Y and Model 3 production in August and expectations for continued high output in September[2].
- Inventory levels for certain models (notably Model S/X) were high at the end of Q2, which could support higher Q3 deliveries if demand is sufficient[5].

**3. Authoritative Sources for Verification**
- Tesla's official delivery numbers are published on its Investor Relations site, which is the definitive source for quarterly delivery data[3].

**4. Limitations and Uncertainties**
- Forecasts are subject to uncertainty due to potential fluctuations in demand, supply chain issues, and regional market dynamics.
- Some analysts expect Q3 2024 deliveries to be only modestly higher than Q2 2024, while others anticipate a more significant increase based on production trends and inventory levels[2][5].
- The final outcome depends on Tesla's ability to convert production and inventory into actual deliveries before the end of Q3.
