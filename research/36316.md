# Forecasting Analysis: Likelihood of Federal Investigation into Tariff-Related Insider Trading

As of May 25, 2025, there are growing indications that a federal investigation into alleged insider trading related to Trump's April 2025 tariff announcements may be launched before September 2025. Let's analyze the available evidence and factors that will influence this outcome.

## Current Status of Allegations

Multiple credible reports indicate suspicious trading activity surrounding Trump's tariff announcements in April 2025:

- ProPublica has examined hundreds of records for trades shortly before major tariff announcements, finding evidence of potentially problematic trading patterns[1]
- There are specific allegations regarding White House lawyer Tobias Dorsey, who sold shares in nine companies before a significant tariff announcement[1]
- Unusual volumes of call options were reportedly purchased minutes before the April 9th announcement of the tariff pause, with some traders allegedly earning profits of 2100% (as mentioned in the question context)
- Democrats in Congress, led by Senator Adam Schiff, have formally pressed the White House over potential insider trading concerns[4]

## Political and Regulatory Pressure

There is significant political momentum building toward an investigation:

- Democratic Senators have explicitly called for a probe into possible insider trading around Trump's tariff announcements[4]
- Senator Adam Schiff has specifically requested an investigation into Trump's "great time to buy" message, suggesting it could indicate insider trading or market manipulation[5]
- The timing of these allegations is noteworthy, as they occurred shortly after Trump took office on January 20, 2025[4]

## Legal Framework and Historical Precedent

The legal framework for prosecuting such cases exists but has rarely been utilized:

- The Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge (STOCK) Act theoretically prohibits government officials from using insider information for securities trading[1]
- However, no cases have ever been brought under this law, and legal experts have expressed doubts about whether it would withstand judicial scrutiny[1]
- Courts in recent years have generally narrowed what constitutes illegal insider trading[1]
- The 2020 congressional insider trading scandal resulted in no charges being brought, despite similar allegations

## Key Factors Affecting Probability of Investigation

Several factors will influence whether a formal investigation is launched:

**Factors increasing probability:**
- Formal requests from multiple members of Congress create institutional pressure
- The scale of market movements (10% drops and 9.5% rebounds) increases public interest
- Specific evidence of suspicious trading patterns documented by ProPublica
- The existence of named individuals who allegedly traded before announcements

**Factors decreasing probability:**
- Historical reluctance to enforce the STOCK Act
- Legal challenges in proving insider trading intent
- Political considerations may impede investigations during an election cycle
- Competing priorities for investigative resources

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on the available evidence as of May 25, 2025, I assess the probability of a formal investigation being launched before September 2025 at approximately 70-75%.

This assessment is based on:
1. The existence of formal calls for investigation from multiple Senators[4][5]
2. Documented evidence of suspicious trading patterns[1][3]
3. The high-profile nature of the market movements
4. The specificity of allegations, including named individuals[1]
5. Historical precedent suggesting investigations are possible but prosecutions are rare

The most likely investigative body would be a Congressional Oversight committee, followed by the SEC. A DOJ investigation appears less likely given historical precedent.

## Key Uncertainties

Several significant uncertainties remain:
- Whether additional evidence of suspicious trading will emerge
- The extent of political will to pursue investigations during a contentious period
- Whether media attention will sustain pressure for investigation
- The allocation of investigative resources among competing priorities

These factors should be monitored closely for updates that might significantly shift this probability assessment.
