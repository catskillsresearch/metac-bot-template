### 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index for May 2025 was 52.2, unchanged from April 2025 and among the lowest readings on record[1][3][4].
- Sentiment had declined for four consecutive months before stabilizing in May. The preliminary May reading was 50.8, later revised upward, reflecting late improvements tied to a temporary pause in some tariffs on Chinese goods[1][3][4].
- Year-over-year, consumer sentiment is down 24.5% compared to May 2024, highlighting persistent pessimism[1][4].

### 2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- The key recent event was a temporary pause on some tariffs for Chinese goods, which modestly improved business condition expectations after mid-May[1][3][4].
- However, overall economic sentiment remains weak, with ongoing worries about the future, particularly related to stagnant incomes and personal finances[1][4].
- No additional major policy changes or economic shocks have been reported as of June 4, 2025.

### 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The official University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers website will publish the June 2025 final results[1].
- Additional data and forecasts are available via Investing.com and Trading Economics[2][3].

### 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- The preliminary June reading is not yet available, so this forecast is based on recent history and known events as of June 4, 2025[1][2].
- Sudden economic or policy changes before the final June release could shift sentiment.
- Measurement is based on consumer surveys, which can be sensitive to short-term news and may be revised between preliminary and final releases.

### Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

- Given the stabilization at 52.2 for April and May 2025, the absence of significant new positive developments, and the still-muted consumer outlook, it is highly probable that the June 2025 University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Final Report will be less than 54.0[1][3][4].
