## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- North Korea has conducted six nuclear tests: 2006, 2009, 2013, twice in 2016, and 2017. There has been no confirmed nuclear test since 2017, but the country has continued to advance its nuclear and missile programs[1][3].
- In 2022, North Korea declared its nuclear-armed status "irreversible," prohibiting talks on denuclearization and allowing for pre-emptive nuclear use[3].
- North Korea has significantly increased missile testing, with over 40 missile launches in 2023, and has developed more advanced delivery systems, including ship-launched cruise missiles[3].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- In January 2025, Kim Jong Un visited nuclear facilities and called for further expansion of nuclear forces, describing 2025 as a "critical year" for bolstering the country's nuclear capabilities[4].
- North Korean state media reported "remarkable successes" in nuclear material production in 2024 and outlined plans for continued progress in 2025[4].
- Satellite imagery and analysis have shown ongoing excavation and preparation at the Punggye-ri nuclear test site, suggesting technical readiness for another test[5].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The International Monitoring System (IMS) of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO) is the primary global authority for detecting nuclear tests.
- Wikipedia's "List of nuclear weapons tests of North Korea" compiles confirmed events from multiple credible sources, including the IMS and major news agencies.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- North Korea's decision-making is opaque, and while there are strong indications of intent and technical capability, there is no direct evidence (as of January 30, 2025) that a nuclear test will occur before April 1, 2025.
- Announcements about strengthening nuclear forces and increased fissile material production signal potential for a test, but do not guarantee one within the specified timeframe.
- Monitoring is robust, but North Korea's secrecy means some activities may not be detected until after the fact.

## Summary

As of January 30, 2025, North Korea has demonstrated increased nuclear activity, leadership intent to expand nuclear forces in 2025, and technical preparations at known test sites. However, no nuclear test has been confirmed since 2017, and there is no definitive evidence that a test will occur before April 1, 2025. The situation remains highly dynamic, and authoritative confirmation would come from the International Monitoring System or similar credible reporting.
