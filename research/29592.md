## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Sadiq Khan was re-elected as Mayor of London on May 2, 2024, securing a third consecutive term with 44% of the vote[1][2][3][5].
- His new term began in May 2024 and, under normal circumstances, would run for four years.
- As of November 5, 2024, there are no credible reports or official announcements indicating that Khan has resigned, been removed, or otherwise vacated the office. There is also no indication that a permanent successor has been appointed or elected[1][2][3][5].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- While Sadiq Khan has faced periodic calls to resign from various commentators and political opponents, including public figures such as Nile Gardiner, these have not resulted in any formal process or official action toward his removal[5].
- No announcements from Khan, the Greater London Authority, or credible news sources suggest he intends to step down or has been forced out before January 1, 2025[1][2][3][5].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The City of London's official website and the Greater London Authority provide up-to-date information on the status of the mayoralty[1][2][3].
- Major news outlets and election monitoring organizations confirm that Khan remains in office as of the knowledge cutoff date[5].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- While the possibility of unforeseen events (such as health issues or scandals) cannot be entirely ruled out, there is no evidence or credible reporting of such developments as of November 5, 2024.
- Calls for resignation or criticism do not meet the resolution criteria unless they result in Khan vacating the office and a permanent successor being installed.

## Conclusion

Based on all available factual information as of November 5, 2024, there is no credible basis to forecast that Sadiq Khan will cease to be mayor of London before January 1, 2025. He remains in office, and no official processes or announcements indicate an impending change.
