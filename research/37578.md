## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- China's Consumer Price Index (CPI) year-on-year change was negative in February 2025 (-0.7%), and remained negative in both March and April 2025 at -0.1%, marking three consecutive months of deflation[1][5].
- Producer Price Index (PPI) continues to show deeper deflation, with a YoY drop of -2.7% in April 2025, reflecting weak upstream pricing power[1].
- Food (31.8% of the CPI basket) and residence costs are the main components affecting CPI in China[1].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- No major policy moves or stimulus announcements specifically targeting consumer prices or inflation were reported as of June 2, 2025.
- The deflation rate has stabilized at -0.1% for two months, rather than deepening, suggesting deflationary pressures have not intensified but are persistent[1].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- [Trading Economics](https://tradingeconomics.com/china/inflation-cpi): Provides official monthly CPI data for China[1].
- [CEIC Data](https://www.ceicdata.com/en/indicator/china/consumer-price-index-cpi-growth): Tracks historical and current CPI growth rates[5].
- [National Bureau of Statistics of China](https://data.stats.gov.cn/english/easyquery.htm): Official government releases and methodological notes[4].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- May CPI data is not yet released, and short-term fluctuations (e.g., seasonal food price changes, policy measures) could impact the result.
- Data is subject to revision, and the deflation observed is mild, indicating a possible inflection point if demand or costs shift.
- Measurement reflects year-on-year change, potentially masking short-term shifts in momentum.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given:
- Three consecutive months of negative CPI (Feb–Apr 2025)[1][5]
- Continued producer price deflation[1]
- No major policy changes or economic shocks reported as of early June 2025

It is more likely than not that China will report a fourth consecutive month of deflation (negative YoY CPI) in its May 2025 data. The probability is estimated at 60–70%, given persistent but mild deflationary pressures and lack of clear reversal signals.
