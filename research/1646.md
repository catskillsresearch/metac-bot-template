# Forecasting Analysis: Fundamental Change in the Human Condition by 2100

As of September 5, 2020, several historical patterns and emerging technological trends provide insight into whether the human condition might fundamentally change before 2100 in a manner comparable to the Agricultural and Industrial Revolutions.

## Historical Context

The human condition has undergone two fundamental transformations in our species' history:

1. **The Agricultural Revolution (10,000-12,000 years ago)** transformed humans from nomadic hunter-gatherers into settled agricultural societies, enabling:
   - Population density increases
   - Social stratification and hierarchical governance
   - Specialization of labor
   - Accumulation of surplus resources
   - Standing armies and organized warfare[1]

2. **The Industrial Revolution (1760-1840)** created another discontinuity where:
   - Economic and technological growth outpaced population growth
   - Average income increased substantially
   - Humans escaped the Malthusian trap
   - Political systems transformed with the decline of feudalism
   - Slavery was largely abolished in industrialized nations[1][5]

Both revolutions fundamentally altered human capabilities, social organization, and daily experience at a civilizational level.

## Current Technological Trajectories

The most likely candidate for a similar transformation before 2100 appears to be artificial intelligence, particularly the development of superintelligence.

### Artificial Intelligence Development

As of 2020, AI development shows accelerating progress:

- The conceptual path from narrow AI (ANI) through general AI (AGI) to superintelligence (ASI) has been articulated in the literature[3]
- Some experts argue that superintelligent AI would represent a transformation comparable to or exceeding previous revolutions[2]
- Nick Bostrom specifically identifies machine intelligence as perhaps the foremost technology that could drive a comparable transformation[1]

The potential timeline for such developments remains uncertain, but the trajectory of research suggests significant advances are possible within the 2100 timeframe.

## Key Differences Affecting the Forecast

Several factors distinguish the potential AI revolution from previous transformations:

1. **Acceleration of change**: The time between revolutionary changes has compressed dramatically:
   - Hundreds of thousands of years separated early humans from the Agricultural Revolution
   - Roughly 10,000 years separated the Agricultural and Industrial Revolutions
   - Less than 300 years have passed since the Industrial Revolution began[4]

2. **Intentional development**: Unlike previous revolutions that emerged gradually through distributed innovations, advanced AI systems are being deliberately created by research teams with specific goals.

3. **Potential for superintelligence**: Previous revolutions enhanced human capabilities while leaving fundamental human limitations intact. Superintelligence could potentially exceed human capabilities across all domains simultaneously.

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on available information as of September 2020, I assess the following:

- **Medium-high probability (60-75%)** of a fundamental change in the human condition before 2100, primarily driven by artificial intelligence developments.
- **Timeline distribution**: 
  - 10% probability before 2040
  - 30% probability between 2040-2070
  - 35% probability between 2070-2100
  - 25% probability after 2100 or not occurring

**Key uncertainties** include:
- Technical challenges in developing AGI may prove more difficult than currently anticipated
- Societal responses including potential regulation or restriction of advanced AI
- Competition between nations potentially accelerating or decelerating development
- Unforeseen technological developments unrelated to AI that could drive transformation

## Conclusion

The historical pattern of transformative changes to the human condition suggests we are due for another such transformation. The accelerating development of artificial intelligence, particularly the theoretical pathway toward superintelligence, represents the most likely candidate for driving such a transformation before 2100. While significant uncertainty remains about the precise timeline and nature of such a transformation, the evidence available as of September 2020 suggests a greater than even probability that the human condition will fundamentally change by century's end.
