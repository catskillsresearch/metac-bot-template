## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of December 13, 2024, Bluesky had surpassed 25 million registered users, up from 15 million on November 15 and 20 million on November 19, reflecting a rapid influx of new users following the U.S. presidential election and the end of the invite-only period[1].
- The platform saw over 5 million new users join in the two weeks after the election, and gained 800,000 users in a single day after opening registration to the public[1].
- Historically, the number of unique posters (users who have posted at least once) has been a small fraction of total registered users. Earlier in 2024, estimates placed this ratio at around 3â€“5%[1].

## Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Metric

- Bluesky ended its invite-only period, leading to a sharp increase in user registrations[1].
- There have been no reported technical issues or policy changes that would significantly suppress posting activity as of December 2024.

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The primary source for unique poster counts is Jaz's Bluesky index, which tracks the number of users who have posted at least once. This index is referenced in the question's resolution criteria and is considered authoritative for this metric.
- Additional user and activity statistics are available from sources such as The Hollywood Reporter, TechCrunch, and Similarweb[1][2][3][4].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- The exact number of unique posters on December 29, 2024, is not available as of the knowledge cutoff. The most recent public data focuses on total registered users, not unique posters.
- The ratio of unique posters to total users may fluctuate, especially during periods of rapid user growth, as many new signups may not post immediately.
- If Jaz's Bluesky index ceases reporting or is found inaccurate, resolution may rely on other credible sources, but these may not provide as granular or timely data.
