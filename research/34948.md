- VGChartz and other gaming news outlets report on these charts and provide additional analysis[3].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- The exact list for February 2025 is not available as of the cutoff date, so the forecast is based on recent historical data.
- Unforeseen events, such as surprise releases or sudden shifts in player interest, could affect the number of sports games in the top downloads.
