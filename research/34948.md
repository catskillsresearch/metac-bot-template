## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- PEPFAR has been a cornerstone of U.S. global health diplomacy since 2004, credited with saving over 26 million lives and maintaining bipartisan congressional support for two decades[5].
- In recent years, support has eroded, with reauthorization in 2024 lasting only one year instead of the typical five[5][2].
- As of March 25, 2025, PEPFAR’s congressional reauthorization has expired, placing the program in legal and operational limbo[5][3].
- PEPFAR remains a permanent part of U.S. law, but without active authorization, it is more vulnerable to executive and congressional action[1][3].

## 2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- On January 20, 2025, President Trump signed an executive order pausing new foreign aid disbursements, including PEPFAR, for 90 days pending a review[4].
- A federal judge ordered the administration to resume foreign aid, but there have been reports of noncompliance and continued operational chaos, including clinic closures and funding lapses for PEPFAR-supported programs[3][5].
- Congress has not agreed on a full FY 2025 budget, instead extending government funding via continuing resolution through at least March 28, 2025. This temporary funding now extends into September 2025[2][5].
- Proposals from the administration and some in Congress include deep discretionary spending cuts for FY 2026 and possible consolidation of U.S. global health programs, with PEPFAR specifically named as a target for cuts or elimination[2][3][5].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Kaiser Family Foundation: Comprehensive tracking of PEPFAR’s legal, funding, and policy status[1][2].
- CSIS and UNAIDS: Reports on operational impacts and international reactions to U.S. foreign aid decisions[3][4].
- Think Global Health: Analysis of the reauthorization lapse and implications for global HIV programs[5].

## 4. Limitations or Uncertainties in Measurement

- While the expiration of statutory authorization and current funding uncertainty are unprecedented, PEPFAR still exists in law and practice as of late May 2025 due to ongoing (albeit temporary) appropriations[1][2][5].
- Judicial intervention has so far prevented full cessation of operations, but continued executive resistance and congressional gridlock create real risk of destabilization or termination[3].
- The outcome for FY 2026 appropriations and possible legislative or executive action to formally terminate or consolidate PEPFAR remains unknown as of this writing[2][3].
- There is some ambiguity in what would constitute "ceasing to exist" under the resolution criteria, especially if PEPFAR is merged or its functions absorbed elsewhere.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the lapsed authorization, weakened political support, ongoing executive hostility, and active discussion of major budget cuts or consolidation, there is a substantially elevated risk that PEPFAR will cease to exist before January 1, 2026, either through termination, elimination of funding, or absorption into another entity. However, the presence of temporary funding and judicial oversight introduces uncertainty, making outright cessation possible but not assured.

**Probabilistic Estimate:**  
- Risk of PEPFAR ceasing to exist before January 1, 2026: **Medium to High (estimated 55–70%)**, significantly above historical baselines, but short-term survival via appropriations or court intervention remains plausible.
