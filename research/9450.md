## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The share of US primary energy from nuclear fission rose from 0.4% in 1970 to about 7.5% in 1990, and has plateaued between 8–9% since 1999[3].
- US nuclear generation growth stalled after the 1980s due to high-profile accidents, plant decommissionings, and policy uncertainty.
- As of 2023, the US remains the world’s largest producer of nuclear electricity, responsible for roughly 30% of global nuclear electricity[3].

## 2. Recent Announcements and Policies

- In November 2024, the US set a target to triple domestic nuclear capacity by 2050, aiming to add 35 GW by 2035 and sustain 15 GW of new capacity per year by 2040[1].
- These targets align with international pledges to triple global nuclear capacity, but require unprecedented new construction, supply chain development, and regulatory reform[1].
- The International Energy Agency (IEA) and IAEA project global nuclear capacity to grow, with China and emerging markets leading the expansion; US growth is expected to be more modest under current policies[4][5].

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- The ambitious new US nuclear targets face major implementation challenges: financing, regulatory hurdles, public acceptance, and technical risks.
- Plant retirements and delays could offset gains from new builds.
- Rapid growth in renewables and improvements in energy efficiency may limit nuclear’s share, even if capacity grows.
- The forecasted share can fluctuate depending on total energy demand, which may change with electrification and decarbonization efforts.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

- If current (pre-2024) policies persist, authoritative projections suggest US nuclear’s share of primary energy in 2050 will be similar to today—around 8–10%[4][5].
- If the announced 2024 targets are fully met, the share could rise to 15–20% by 2050, depending on total energy demand and actual buildout[1].
- Given the historical track record and high barriers, a reasonable probabilistic estimate as of January 2022 would assign:
    - ~60% probability of US nuclear share in 2050 remaining in the 8–12% range
    - ~30% probability of 12–18% (if new policies partially succeed)
    - ~10% probability of exceeding 18% (if targets are fully met and energy demand remains stable)

**Best single-point forecast as of January 2022:**  
US nuclear fission will likely supply **10–12%** of primary energy in 2050, with upside potential if aggressive policy targets are realized, but significant risk of remaining near current levels.
