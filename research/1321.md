### Key Historical Trends and Current Status (as of 2018-08-05)

- **Ray Kurzweil’s Predictions**: Kurzweil is renowned for forecasting rapid, exponential technological progress, culminating in the "technological singularity" around 2045. His predictions span AI, computing, biology, and more, with claims such as human-level AI by the 2020s and the merging of humans and machines in the decades after[1].
- **Track Record**: Analyses up to 2018 (such as the widely cited LessWrong report) indicate that Kurzweil's predictions have had mixed accuracy. While some forecasts about internet growth, mobile technology, and computational power have proven prescient, others—especially those involving strong AI and human longevity—have not yet materialized or remain contentious.
- **Expert Consensus**: As of 2018, there is no strong expert consensus that Kurzweil’s most ambitious predictions (especially the singularity by 2045) are on track. Many AI researchers and technologists consider his timeline optimistic, with significant skepticism about the feasibility and timeframe for AGI and the singularity.
- **Community Forecasting Mechanism**: The resolution of whether Kurzweil is "proven right" depends on the aggregated community prediction at close. If >80%, the question resolves positively; if <20%, negatively; otherwise, a staff decision is required.
- **Surveys and Methodology**: The question allows for periodic surveys of Kurzweil’s prediction accuracy, weighted by importance. As of 2018, no universally accepted, importance-weighted survey has been conducted, though the LessWrong report provides a structured but unweighted assessment.

### Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- No major announcements or policies in 2018 fundamentally altered the trajectory of AI or other technologies in a way that would decisively support or refute Kurzweil’s specific predictions.
- Progress in AI (notably deep learning) was significant but still far from AGI, and most experts projected slower timelines than Kurzweil for strong AI and the singularity.

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- LessWrong’s 2016 report on Kurzweil’s predictions (and any similar analyses available as of 2018).
- Wikipedia’s curated list of Kurzweil’s predictions and their status.
- Published expert surveys on AI timelines (e.g., the 2016 AI Impacts survey).
- Metaculus community predictions and staff adjudications.

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- "Generally right" lacks a precise, universally agreed definition, and is subject to interpretation and weighting of individual predictions.
- Technological trajectories can shift rapidly, so forecasts made in 2018 may be rendered obsolete by breakthroughs or stagnation after that date.
- Community and expert sentiment may evolve as more predictions are tested and as new evidence emerges.
