### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Puerto Rico has held several referendums on statehood since 1967, with the most recent in November 2024 showing 57% of participating voters favoring statehood (with 57% turnout)[1][3].
- The pro-statehood New Progressive Party (NPP) has won the governorship in recent elections, but Puerto Rico’s party system does not map directly onto US Republican or Democratic parties[1][3].
- Puerto Rican political parties are divided between those favoring statehood (NPP), commonwealth (Popular Democratic Party, PPD), and independence[3].
- US Congressional action is required for statehood; recent bills (such as H.R. 1522 in 2021) have been introduced but not passed[2][4][5].
- The Republican Party platform (2008–2020) supported the right of Puerto Ricans to determine their status, while Democrats have expressed support for statehood if chosen by referendum.

### Reference Cases

- The DC statehood debate is a reference: Republicans strongly oppose DC statehood, predicting two reliably Democratic senators due to DC's overwhelmingly Democratic electorate.
- In contrast, Puerto Rico’s electorate is not reliably aligned with either major US party, and Puerto Rican parties have no formal ties to US parties[1][3].
- Historical admissions of new states (e.g., Alaska and Hawaii, 1959) have produced mixed partisan results; neither state was guaranteed to favor one party at admission.

### Key Differences Affecting the Forecast

- Puerto Rico's party system is unique; the NPP (pro-statehood) contains both Democratic and Republican affiliates, and its leaders have caucused with both US parties.
- Puerto Rican voters have, in non-federal elections, favored more centrist or liberal positions on social issues and have not shown a Republican partisan lean in territory-wide votes.
- The US Republican Party has not invested significant organizational resources in Puerto Rico, and Republican opposition to statehood is partly based on expectations that the new senators would not be Republicans.
- Recent referendums have narrow margins and moderate turnout, indicating no overwhelming mandate for any single party or ideology[1][3].

### Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Based on the above, the probability that Puerto Rico's first two elected senators would both be Republicans is very low:

- Puerto Rico has not demonstrated a strong, consistent Republican voting pattern.
- The territory's unique party system and demographic profile (e.g., urban, Hispanic, Catholic-majority) align more closely with US Democratic constituencies than Republican ones.
- The DC reference case is not comparable: DC is overwhelmingly Democratic, but Puerto Rico is more mixed, though still unlikely to lean Republican.
- The most plausible scenario is that Puerto Rico would elect at least one senator affiliated with the Democratic Party or an independent caucusing with Democrats, reflecting both historical voting patterns and expectations from both US parties.

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- Puerto Rico’s party system could realign upon statehood, and future political developments (including US party efforts to recruit candidates) cannot be fully anticipated.
- Shifts in national or Puerto Rican politics by 2035 could alter the partisan landscape.
- The first two elected senators could be from new or rebranded parties, complicating direct affiliation with US parties.

### Conclusion

Given current evidence as of May 2021, it is highly unlikely that Puerto Rico's first two elected senators, if it becomes a US state by 2035, would both be Republicans.
