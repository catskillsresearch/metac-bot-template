## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Google's global search engine market share, as measured by StatCounter, fell below 90% for the first time since 2015 during the final quarter of 2024, with monthly shares of 89.34% (October), 89.99% (November), and 89.73% (December)[4].
- This decline marks a shift from a decade-long period where Google consistently held 90-92% of the global market[4].
- The drop is attributed to increased competition, especially in Asia, and incremental gains by Bing, Yandex, and Yahoo. Bing's global share remained just under 4% during this period[4].
- For mobile search specifically, Google's dominance remains stronger, with a 93.82% share in January 2025[3] and 93.89% in another January 2025 report[5]. However, the global market share figure (combining desktop and mobile) is the relevant metric for this forecast.

## Recent Announcements or Policies Affecting the Metric

- No major announcements or policy changes have been reported as of January 2025 that would significantly alter Google's search engine market share trajectory.
- The ongoing trend is a gradual, slight decline in Google's share, with no evidence of a sudden acceleration or reversal[1][4].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- StatCounter is the definitive source for global search engine market share and is the specified resolution source for this metric.
- Statista provides additional context and corroboration, especially for mobile-specific data[3][5].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- StatCounter's methodology primarily tracks traditional search engines and may not fully account for emerging AI-based search platforms such as ChatGPT Search or Perplexity[4].
- Regional variations can affect the global average, and small month-to-month fluctuations are possible.
- Data is subject to revision and should be interpreted with caution, especially when differences are within tenths of a percentage point.

## Forecast for February 2025

Based on the established trend of Google's global search engine market share hovering just below 90% in late 2024, and absent any disruptive changes, it is reasonable to forecast that Google's global search engine market share for February 2025, as reported by StatCounter, will likely remain in the range of 89.5% to 90.0%. The most probable value is approximately 89.7%, continuing the pattern observed in the last quarter of 2024[4].
