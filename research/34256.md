### Key Factual Information Relevant to the Forecast

**1. Historical Trends and Current Status**
- As of December 28, 2024, SpaceX’s Updates page had not been updated since September 10, 2024, marking a gap of over three months without a new post[1].
- During this period, SpaceX has remained highly active, conducting multiple Falcon 9 launches and Starship test flights in January 2025, as reported by independent news outlets and launch trackers[2][3][4].
- Historically, SpaceX has used the Updates page to announce major milestones, launches, and company news, but the recent lack of updates despite significant events suggests a possible change in communication priorities.

**2. Recent Announcements or Policy Changes**
- There have been no official announcements from SpaceX regarding discontinuation or changes to the Updates page posting policy.
- The absence of posts during a period of high operational activity may indicate a shift toward using other communication channels (such as social media or press releases) or a deprioritization of the Updates page.

**3. Authoritative Sources for Verification**
- The definitive source for resolving this question is the SpaceX Updates page itself, accessible at the provided URL.
- Secondary sources, such as launch trackers and news sites, confirm ongoing activity but do not provide official Updates page timestamps[1][2][3][4].

**4. Limitations and Uncertainties**
- The primary limitation is the unpredictability of SpaceX’s internal communication strategy. The company could resume posting at any time, or continue the current pattern of inactivity.
- There is no public information as of January 28, 2025, indicating whether or when the next Updates post will appear.

### Summary Table: SpaceX Updates Page Posting Behavior

|---------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------|-------------|
| September 10, 2024  | Multiple launches, Starship tests    | None found               | High        |

### Conclusion

- As of January 28, 2025, SpaceX has not posted any new updates since September 10, 2024, despite ongoing high-profile activities.
- There is no official indication of a permanent change to the Updates page, but the extended gap and continued operational activity suggest a possible shift in communication focus.
- The question remains open and will be resolved by direct observation of the Updates page before April 1, 2025.
