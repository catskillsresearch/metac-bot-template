### Historical Trends and Current Status
- **Recent Arrest and Detention**: Mahmoud Khalil was arrested on March 8, 2025, by immigration authorities without a warrant, allegedly in retaliation for his advocacy for Palestinian rights at Columbia University[1][2].
- **Legal Challenges**: Khalil's lawsuit challenging his detention is proceeding in federal court, focusing on constitutional rights violations[1]. His legal team is seeking bail, a return to New Jersey, and a preliminary injunction to release him[2].
- **Deportation Proceedings**: A Louisiana immigration judge ruled Khalil deportable based on a letter from Secretary of State Marco Rubio, citing adverse foreign policy consequences[4][5]. However, his deportation is currently stayed by a federal court[4].

### Recent Announcements/Policies
- **Government Policies**: The Trump administration has been criticized for targeting individuals engaged in pro-Palestine activism, using a Cold War-era law to justify deportation[4].
- **Legal Filings**: Recent filings highlight the government's lack of a warrant for Khalil's arrest and emphasize his protected speech rights[2].

### Authoritative Sources
- **ACLU**: The American Civil Liberties Union is involved in Khalil's legal case and provides updates on court decisions[1][2].
- **Amnesty International**: Has called for Khalil's release, citing violations of his freedom of expression and due process rights[3].
- **Wikipedia**: Provides a comprehensive overview of Khalil's detention, including legal developments and political context[4].

### Limitations or Uncertainties
- **Legal Proceedings**: The outcome of Khalil's constitutional challenge and the ongoing legal proceedings create uncertainty about his deportation timeline.
- **Political Factors**: Political pressure and public opinion could influence the legal process and decision-making.

### Probabilistic Assessment
Given the legal challenges and political context, the probability of Khalil being deported before July 1, 2025, is uncertain. The current legal stay and ongoing constitutional challenge suggest a lower likelihood of deportation in the near term. However, if the legal stay is lifted, political factors could still play a significant role in determining his fate.
