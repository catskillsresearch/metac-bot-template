# Forecasting US National Average Retail Price of Regular Gasoline for December 9, 2024

Based on available data and forecasts as of December 2024, here's an analysis to help determine whether the US national average retail price of regular gasoline will fall between $3.020 and $3.080 for the week of December 9, 2024.

## Historical Trends and Current Status

The US Energy Information Administration (EIA) projected in January 2024 that average US retail gasoline prices would decrease throughout 2024 due to increased inventories related to expanded refinery capacity[1]. This forecast was supported by the fact that additional refinery capacity came online in 2023, raising US operable refinery capacity from 18.06 million barrels per day in January 2023 to 18.31 million b/d by December 2023[1].

As of April 2024, the national average price for regular gasoline was $3.62 per gallon, which was $0.02 higher than the same period in 2023[5]. This represented a moderate year-over-year increase, though prices remained approximately 15% lower than their 2022 levels[5].

## Seasonal Patterns and Winter Forecasts

GasBuddy's 2024 Fuel Outlook, released in December 2023, predicted that gas prices could fall below a national average of $3 per gallon during winter 2024 before starting to rise again in late February[4]. Their overall forecast suggested that the yearly national average would drop from $3.51 per gallon in 2023 to $3.38 in 2024[3][4].

Gasoline prices typically follow seasonal patterns, with prices often declining during winter months due to:
- Lower demand during winter
- Switch to winter-blend gasoline, which is less expensive to produce
- Reduced driving during holiday seasons

## Factors Affecting Late 2024 Prices

Several factors were expected to influence gasoline prices in late 2024:

1. **Refinery Capacity**: Increased refinery capacity was expected to ease price pressure on petroleum products throughout 2024[1].

2. **Consumption Patterns**: The EIA projected slightly reduced gasoline consumption in 2024-2025, which would contribute to lower prices[1].

3. **Crude Oil Prices**: The EIA expected crude oil prices in 2024 to remain similar to 2023 levels, with potential decreases in 2025[1].

4. **Regional Variations**: While national averages provide a general picture, significant regional price differences were expected to persist. For example, California cities might see prices above $6 per gallon during supply disruptions, while most major US cities were expected to peak at or slightly below $4 per gallon in 2024[4].

## Forecast Reliability and Limitations

It's important to note several limitations in forecasting gasoline prices:

1. **Volatility**: Gasoline prices are inherently volatile and subject to rapid changes based on geopolitical events, supply disruptions, or economic shifts.

2. **Forecast Timeframe**: The most recent data available (April 2024) indicated prices were at $3.62 per gallon[5], but this was still several months before the December 9, 2024 target date.

3. **External Factors**: The 2024 presidential election was identified as a potential factor that could impact fuel prices in the latter part of the year[4].

4. **Weather Events**: Unexpected weather events, particularly hurricanes affecting refinery operations, could introduce uncertainty in late summer and fall price projections[4].

## Conclusion

Based on the available forecasts and historical patterns, there appears to be a reasonable possibility that gasoline prices could fall within the $3.020-$3.080 range by December 9, 2024. GasBuddy's projection that prices could fall below $3 per gallon in winter 2024[4] aligns with this possibility, though the exact timing and magnitude of winter price decreases remain uncertain.

The EIA's expectation of decreasing prices throughout 2024 due to increased refinery capacity and slightly reduced consumption[1] further supports the possibility of prices reaching the target range by December.

However, given the volatility of gasoline markets and the multiple factors that could influence prices between April and December 2024, this forecast carries significant uncertainty.
