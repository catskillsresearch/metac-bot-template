## Key Facts Relevant to Forecasting a Minimum Wage Increase in Turkey Before September 30, 2024

**Historical Trends and Current Status**
- Turkey experienced high inflation in recent years, prompting the government to increase the minimum wage twice in both 2022 and 2023, diverging from its previous annual adjustment policy[2][5].
- The most recent minimum wage increase took effect on January 1, 2024, raising the net monthly minimum wage to TRY 17,002.12, a 49% increase from the previous rate[2][5].
- Despite this increase, the real value of the minimum wage has been eroded by ongoing high inflation, with the Turkish lira depreciating and inflation rates remaining above 60%[3][4].

**Recent Announcements and Policies**
- In April 2024, Labor and Social Security Minister Vedat Işıkhan publicly ruled out a second minimum wage hike for 2024, stating, "We have no such agenda. We will continue as we decided at the beginning"[4].
- This position was reaffirmed in June 2024, when Minister Işıkhan stated there would not be an interim increase in the minimum wage, and that the next review would occur in December 2024[3].
- The government’s refusal to consider an interim increase comes despite calls from opposition parties and unions, and despite the minimum wage being the primary income for roughly one-third of Turkey’s workforce[3].

**Authoritative Sources for Verification**
- Statements from the Turkish Labor Minister reported by reputable news outlets[3][4].
- Official government publications and wage indicator organizations confirming the timing and amount of the last increase[2][5].

**Limitations and Uncertainties**
- Turkey’s economic environment is volatile, and the government has previously reversed course on wage policy under political or public pressure.
- While the government’s current stance is clear, unforeseen developments could theoretically prompt a policy change, but as of July 23, 2024, there is no credible evidence or announcement indicating an increase will occur before September 30, 2024.

**Conclusion**
Based on all available factual information as of July 23, 2024, there is no credible indication that the minimum wage in Turkey will increase again before September 30, 2024. The government has explicitly ruled out an interim increase, and all authoritative sources confirm this position.
