## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Since the early 1980s, the Federal Reserve has used the federal funds rate as its main monetary policy tool. The lowest the target rate has reached is effectively zero, most recently during the 2008 financial crisis and again in the COVID-19 pandemic, but it has never been negative[3].
- In contrast, the European Central Bank and some other central banks (e.g., in Switzerland, Denmark, and Japan) have set negative policy rates, reflecting differing institutional environments and policy preferences[3].
- As of January 2022, the Fed’s official stance has remained against setting negative rates, citing both legal authority concerns and skepticism about the effectiveness or necessity of such a policy[3].

## 2. Recent Announcements and Policies

- Various Fed officials have repeatedly stated that the US central bank does not see negative rates as an appropriate tool. They point to legal uncertainties and potential negative side effects on financial stability and savers[3].
- The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and other forecasters expect US real interest rates to remain low through 2050 but do not project negative nominal rates[5].
- Long-term projections, such as those by Lisack et al. (2017) and Carvalho et al. (2016), forecast continued downward pressure on rates but do not specifically anticipate the US adopting negative policy rates by 2050[2].
- Forecasting platforms like Metaculus, as of early 2022, gave an approximate 53% probability that the Fed would set a negative policy rate by 2050—indicating substantial uncertainty but not a consensus that it is likely[3].

## 3. Key Differences Affecting the Forecast

- **Legal and Institutional Constraints:** The Federal Reserve’s legal authority to set negative rates is less clear than in the Eurozone, and US financial infrastructure (e.g., prevalence of physical cash, money market funds) poses unique barriers[3].
- **Political and Cultural Factors:** US policymakers and the public have shown more resistance to negative rates compared to Europe, viewing them as unconventional and potentially destabilizing[3].
- **Economic Structure:** The US economy, with its global reserve currency and deep financial markets, may face different incentive structures regarding negative rates than smaller or more export-oriented economies.

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- **Forecast Uncertainty:** Projections over several decades are highly uncertain due to potential changes in economic theory, political leadership, legal frameworks, or macroeconomic shocks[5].
- **Technological Change:** If the US moves toward digital currency or restricts physical cash, technical barriers to negative rates could diminish, making negative rates more feasible[3].
- **Global Trends:** Global economic shocks, persistent low inflation, or a significant shift in consensus macroeconomic policy could alter current assumptions.

## 5. Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given:
- The Fed’s historical reluctance and strong institutional constraints,
- The fact that other advanced-economy central banks have adopted negative rates, indicating feasibility in principle,
- The presence of long-term forecasts suggesting persistent low rates but not negative rates in the US,
- And platforms aggregating expert forecasts giving a roughly even chance (about 50%) as of early 2022,

I assess that, as of January 2022, the probability that the Federal Reserve will set a negative target policy rate by 2050 is between 40% and 60%. The outcome is highly sensitive to future institutional, technological, and macroeconomic developments that are difficult to anticipate[3][2][5].
