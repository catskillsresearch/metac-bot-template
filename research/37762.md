# 30-Year Fixed-Rate Mortgage Forecast for June 26, 2025

As of June 11, 2025, I'm analyzing the likely trajectory of the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage average for June 26, 2025. The current economic landscape provides several indicators to inform this forecast.

## Current Mortgage Rate Environment

The 30-year fixed mortgage rate stands at 6.85% as of June 5, 2025[1][3]. This represents a slight decrease from previous weeks, which is positive news for potential homebuyers who are also seeing improvements in housing inventory[3]. 

The most recent trends show mortgage rates have been experiencing volatility in 2025, with the current rates being among the highest average mortgage rates observed since the beginning of the year[4]. For context, the question mentions that the rate was 6.81% for the week of May 15, 2025, indicating a small increase of 4 basis points over approximately three weeks.

## Expert Forecasts for June 2025

Economic experts have provided several predictions for June 2025 mortgage rates:

- Molly Boesel, principal economist at Cotality, expects the 30-year mortgage rate to hover in the 6.8% to 6.9% range throughout June 2025[4]
- Ralph DiBugnara, founder at Home Qualified, specifically forecasts a 30-year fixed mortgage rate average of 6.875% for June[4]
- Broader institutional forecasts from Fannie Mae and the Mortgage Bankers Association predict that rates will decline slightly but remain at or above 6.5% throughout this period[2]

## Key Factors Influencing the Forecast

Several macroeconomic factors are currently affecting mortgage rates:

1. **Inflation Trends**: Inflation is showing signs of gradually decreasing, which typically has a positive effect on mortgage rates. However, this reduction is expected to be slow without a significant economic event[4].

2. **Bond Market Dynamics**: The 30-year mortgage rate's near-term direction is heavily influenced by the bond market, particularly reactions to long-term U.S. debt and deficit concerns. Once there is more clarity around the U.S. budget, experts anticipate long-term rates should stabilize[4].

3. **Trade Policy Concerns**: Current tariff discussions have complicated inflation reduction efforts, which is keeping both the 10-year Treasury yield and mortgage rates elevated[4].

4. **Housing Market Conditions**: There are indications of improving housing inventory, which might influence buyer demand and indirectly affect rates[3].

## Probabilistic Assessment for June 26, 2025

Based on the available data and expert opinions, the most likely range for the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage average on June 26, 2025 is between 6.8% and 6.9%.

**Most Likely Scenario (70% probability)**: The rate will be between 6.8% and 6.9%, aligning with expert forecasts for June 2025. The specific prediction of 6.875% from Ralph DiBugnara represents a reasonable point estimate within this range.

**Upside Scenario (20% probability)**: Rates could rise above 6.9% if inflation reduction stalls, tariff tensions escalate, or unexpected economic events create additional market volatility.

**Downside Scenario (10% probability)**: Rates might fall below 6.8% if there's sudden progress on inflation, unexpected Federal Reserve policy shifts, or significant clarity emerges regarding U.S. budget concerns.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors could disrupt this forecast:

1. Federal Reserve policy announcements between now and June 26
2. Unexpected economic data releases
3. Geopolitical events affecting global markets
4. Changes in housing market dynamics
5. New government fiscal policies

The forecast is particularly sensitive to any shifts in inflation data or Federal Reserve communications, which could rapidly alter market expectations for future interest rates.
