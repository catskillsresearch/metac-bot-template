## Key Historical Trends and Current Status (as of 2018)

- The Saturn V remains the all-time record holder for LEO payload, with a maximum of 140,000 kg delivered in the Apollo era[1].
- As of 2018, the most capable operational launch vehicle is the SpaceX Falcon Heavy, with an advertised LEO payload capacity of 63,800 kg (fully expendable configuration)[1][2].
- Falcon Heavy’s practical payload is lower when boosters are recovered, but the maximum theoretical figure is 63,800 kg[2].
- No other operational or near-term launch vehicle as of 2018 matches these figures. Other rockets (Delta IV Heavy, Ariane 5, Proton) are significantly less capable.

## Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- Multiple organizations have announced plans for “super heavy-lift” vehicles:
    - SpaceX’s BFR (later Starship/Super Heavy), targeting 100,000 kg+ to LEO.
    - NASA’s Space Launch System (SLS), Block 2 potentially exceeding 130,000 kg.
    - Blue Origin’s New Glenn and New Armstrong, conceptually aiming for high payloads.
- However, as of December 2018, none of these vehicles are operational, and all face technological and funding uncertainties.

## Key Differences Affecting the Forecast

- Since the 1970s, no operational vehicle has surpassed the Saturn V’s LEO payload record.
- The Falcon Heavy, while a major step forward in commercial heavy lift, still delivers less than half of Saturn V’s maximum to LEO[1][2].
- The shift toward reusability may continue to limit maximum per-launch payloads in favor of cost and frequency.
- Announced vehicles (e.g., Starship) could break the record if operational, but history shows significant risk in development timelines and shifting market/government priorities.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Taking these factors into account:
- It is highly likely that technological progress, ongoing lunar/Mars initiatives, and competition will result in at least one super-heavy-lift vehicle entering service and delivering a new record payload to LEO by January 1, 2050.
- The most probable range for the heaviest payload delivered to LEO by a launch vehicle in service on that date is **between 150,000 kg and 250,000 kg**.
    - This assumes at least one operational vehicle (e.g., SpaceX Starship/Super Heavy or equivalent) achieves a successful demonstration and is retained in service.
    - There is a moderate probability the record could be higher if a single-launch lunar or Mars mission is pursued.
- There is a very low probability that no new record is set, as trends and announcements strongly indicate the capability will exist.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- The forecast is limited by uncertainty in actual future launch needs, technological progress, funding, and policy continuity.
- The metric is straightforward (payload mass to LEO by an operational vehicle), but ambiguity may arise if only a one-off test or demonstration occurs, or if the vehicle class is discontinued immediately after.
- Continued miniaturization of payloads or alternative architectures (on-orbit assembly, fuel depots) could reduce the incentive for maximum single-launch payloads, but large-scale lunar/Mars missions may require record-setting lifts.
