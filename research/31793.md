# Forecasting US Airline Passenger Volume for Presidents' Day Weekend 2025

Presidents' Day Weekend (February 14-17, 2025) represents a significant travel period in the US, as many Americans take advantage of the federal holiday to escape winter conditions. To forecast TSA passenger volumes for this period, we need to examine recent travel trends, seasonal patterns, and official projections.

## Historical Travel Trends

Travel volume in the US has shown strong recovery and growth in the post-pandemic period. According to AAA, holiday travel has consistently increased, with Thanksgiving 2024 projections reaching 79.9 million travelers (50+ miles from home), an increase of 1.7 million people compared to 2023[1]. This upward trend continued through the 2024-2025 year-end holiday season, with AAA projecting 119.3 million travelers, narrowly surpassing the previous record set in 2019[3].

For air travel specifically, the year-end holiday season of 2024-2025 was expected to set a new record with 7.85 million passengers, exceeding the previous record of 7.5 million[3]. This demonstrates the continued strength of air travel demand heading into 2025.

## TSA Capacity and Projections

The Transportation Security Administration has been preparing for increased travel volumes. In 2024, TSA anticipated screening over 3 million passengers on a single day at some point during the year[4]. This represents a significant milestone in passenger volume and indicates TSA's expectation of continued growth in air travel.

For comparison, during Memorial Day weekend in 2023, TSA projected screening approximately 2.6 million passengers on Friday, May 26, which was forecast to be the busiest day of that holiday weekend[2]. This provides a baseline for high-volume holiday travel days.

## Presidents' Day Weekend Patterns

Presidents' Day, falling on the third Monday of February, has historically created a distinct travel pattern. The holiday weekend typically shows "a clear rise in airport traffic during this period, with a blip on the Thursday before and the Monday of Presidents' Day." Many travelers extend the break to a full week, particularly families with children in school districts that close for the entire period.

Popular destinations during this period include warm-weather locations and attractions like Walt Disney World, which experiences one of its busiest periods of the year around Presidents' Day.

## Factors Affecting 2025 Forecasts

Several factors could influence the TSA passenger volume for Presidents' Day Weekend 2025:

1. **Calendar Alignment**: With Presidents' Day falling on February 17, 2025, the four-day weekend will span February 14-17, aligning with Valentine's Day on Friday. This could potentially boost travel as couples combine Valentine's celebrations with the long weekend.

2. **Staffing Improvements**: TSA has reported improved staffing levels, which should help accommodate higher passenger volumes. As noted in May 2023, TSA Administrator David Pekoske stated, "Our staffing levels are better and this is largely due to better pay for all TSA employees"[2]. This trend likely continued through 2024.

3. **Seasonal Factors**: February typically represents a lower travel period overall compared to summer and major holidays, but Presidents' Day creates a significant spike within this period.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several limitations affect our ability to precisely forecast TSA passenger volumes:

1. **Measurement Differences**: AAA forecasts focus on domestic leisure travel in person-trips (round-trip itineraries), while TSA data counts each passenger screening (including international travelers and one-way trips)[1][3]. This makes direct comparisons challenging.

2. **Limited Recent Data**: The search results don't provide specific TSA passenger volumes for recent Presidents' Day weekends, which would be valuable for establishing year-over-year growth patterns specific to this holiday.

3. **External Factors**: Weather events, fuel prices, economic conditions, and other unforeseen circumstances could significantly impact travel volumes.

Based on the available information, we can expect TSA passenger volume for Presidents' Day Weekend 2025 to show an increase over previous years, potentially approaching or exceeding 10 million total passengers across the four-day period, with peak days likely on Thursday (February 13), Friday (February 14), and Monday (February 17).
