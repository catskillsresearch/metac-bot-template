## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Artificial objects placed in heliocentric orbit are rarely revisited; spacecraft encounters with non-functional, non-scientific targets are unprecedented[1][4].
- The Tesla Roadster orbits the Sun on a trajectory crossing Mars' orbit, with an inclination close to the ecliptic, but does not approach any planet closely on a predictable basis[1][4][5].
- The Roadster completed its first orbit around the Sun in August 2019 and has continued to travel at a rate of about 557 days per orbit[4].
- As of early 2025, the vehicle is moving away from Earth and toward Mars, with future close approaches projected to be far outside the 10,000 km threshold before 2050[4][5].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- Elon Musk has publicly speculated about a future SpaceX mission to "catch up" with the Roadster, but no official mission has been announced or funded[5].
- There are no known government or commercial plans to intercept the Roadster.
- SpaceX and other entities continue to increase launch cadence and deep-space capabilities, but mission priorities focus on scientific or commercial targets.

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The current and projected location of the Roadster can be tracked via sources like WhereIsRoadster.com, which use NASA data for simulation and prediction[4][5].
- Wikipedia and reputable news outlets track significant updates on the Roadster's trajectory and public statements from SpaceX[1][4][5].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- Space exploration technology is advancing rapidly, and private or symbolic missions could become more feasible.
- Elon Musk and SpaceX have surprised the industry before, but aspirational statements are not guarantees.
- The lack of any concrete plans, combined with the cost and technical challenges of such a mission, weigh heavily against a positive forecast.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the context above, the likelihood that any active spacecraft will approach the Tesla Roadster to within 10,000 km before December 31, 2049, is lowâ€”estimated at less than 10% barring a major shift in priorities or a dedicated symbolic mission by SpaceX or another private actor.
