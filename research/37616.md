## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of August 2024, 48 out of 54 African Union member states had deposited instruments of ratification for the AfCFTA, signifying widespread continental commitment[3].
- Sudan has signed the AfCFTA but has not ratified it[2][3].
- Countries that have completed ratification generally possessed stable governmental structures able to process and deposit international treaties.

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- Sudan has developed and reviewed a draft National AfCFTA Implementation Strategy, indicating some policy-level engagement with AfCFTA preparations.
- There is no public evidence of the Sudanese parliament or a recognized national authority moving to ratify or deposit the instrument with the African Union Commission[2].

## Key Differences Affecting the Forecast

- Sudan is in the midst of an armed conflict, with divided authorities and the absence of a unified, effective government[5].
- The legislative and executive functions required for ratification are compromised by ongoing fighting, government fragmentation, and the parallel formation of rival administrations[5].
- Other African states ratified AfCFTA in contexts of relative political stability or under functioning transitional authorities, unlike Sudan’s current situation.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the ongoing conflict, institutional fragmentation, and lack of formal ratification procedures underway, the probability that Sudan will ratify the AfCFTA before July 1, 2025, is very low. Major obstacles include the absence of a unified government, legislative paralysis, and competing authorities. Barring an abrupt and unlikely political settlement, Sudan is not expected to ratify the AfCFTA within the specified timeframe.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- A rapid political breakthrough or external intervention could alter the forecast, but current trends do not support this scenario.
- Limited transparency in Sudan’s internal policy deliberations and the unpredictable nature of conflict add uncertainty to the assessment.

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The African Union Commission (AUC) official ratification list[3].
- Trade Law Centre (tralac) AfCFTA ratification status updates[1][3].
- Regional organizations and news on Sudan’s political developments[5].
