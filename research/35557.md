Based on the available information as of February 2025, Călin Georgescu will not be elected President of Romania in the 2025 elections because he has been banned from running as a candidate.

## Historical Context and Current Status

In November 2024, pro-Russian nationalist candidate Călin Georgescu caused a major surprise by winning the first round of Romania's presidential election with approximately 2 million votes[1]. Despite his initial success, Georgescu never proceeded to the second-round run-off because:

- Romanian authorities annulled the election results amid accusations of Russian interference in the campaign[1]
- Intelligence reports indicated that foreign actors had manipulated social media platforms, especially TikTok, to benefit Georgescu[1]
- The campaign was likely orchestrated by Russia, though Moscow denied any involvement[1]

Following the annulment, Romanian authorities banned Georgescu from participating in the new elections scheduled for May 4, 2025[1]. This disqualification was confirmed when authorities cleared a dozen candidates for the May election while rejecting a dozen others, including Georgescu[3].

## Recent Developments

The political landscape in Romania remains complex following these events:

1. **New elections scheduled**: Romania is holding a presidential election rerun on May 4, 2025, with new rules implemented to prevent foreign interference[1][4].

2. **Far-right momentum continues**: Despite Georgescu's disqualification, far-right politics maintain significant support in Romania. George Simion, another far-right candidate, has emerged as a prominent figure in the May 2025 election[2].

3. **Potential alternative path to power**: While Georgescu cannot be elected president, his influence remains. Simion has publicly maintained support for Georgescu and suggested he might consider appointing Georgescu as prime minister should Simion become president[2]. However, this would require parliamentary approval, which is uncertain given the current political dynamics.

4. **International attention**: The situation has drawn significant international attention, with US Vice President JD Vance criticizing Romania's decision to cancel the previous election results during a speech at the Munich Security Conference in February 2025[1].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors create uncertainty in this situation:

1. **Political instability**: The current governing coalition appears to be fracturing following the May 4 vote, which could impact future political appointments and decisions[2].

2. **Democratic concerns**: The unprecedented annulment of election results has raised questions about Romania's democratic processes and the influence of intelligence agencies in political matters[1].

3. **Ongoing Russian influence concerns**: Given the previous allegations of Russian interference, continued attempts to influence Romanian politics remain a possibility.

## Conclusion

Based on the available information, Călin Georgescu will not be elected President of Romania in the 2025 elections as he has been explicitly banned from running as a candidate. While he maintains support among certain political factions, and there exists a theoretical path to political power through appointment as prime minister, this would not satisfy the resolution criteria of being "officially declared president-elect."
