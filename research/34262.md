- The decline was exacerbated by Tesla missing its annual delivery targets for the first time, leading to a 4% drop in one week[1].
- Despite this, some analysts remain bullish, expecting potential double-digit gains in 2025, especially if Tesla's AI initiatives perform well[1].

## Conclusion
As of January 29, 2025, Tesla's stock is trading below $420, with recent negative catalysts and a consensus analyst target also below $420.
