# Forecasting US Export Controls on Generative AI Software

Based on information available as of May 17, 2023, I'll analyze the likelihood of the US enacting export controls for generative AI software before 2026.

## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

As of May 2023, the United States has not implemented export controls specifically targeting generative AI software. However, there is a clear precedent with the October 2022 export controls on advanced semiconductors and chip manufacturing equipment to China, which demonstrates the US government's willingness to restrict technologies with national security implications.

The semiconductor export controls from October 2022 represented a significant shift in US policy, focusing on restricting China's access to advanced computing capabilities that could be used for military applications. This approach could foreshadow similar actions for AI software as its capabilities advance.

Generative AI technologies have seen rapid advancement in early 2023, with models like GPT-4, DALL-E 2, and Midjourney demonstrating increasingly sophisticated capabilities for text, image, and other content generation. These advancements have raised concerns about potential misuse for disinformation, cybersecurity threats, and other national security risks.

## Recent Announcements/Policies

The Biden administration has shown increasing concern about AI technologies through various policy initiatives. In October 2022, the White House released its "Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights," indicating growing attention to AI governance issues.

The existing export control framework under the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) already includes provisions for controlling software with potential dual-use applications, providing a legal mechanism through which generative AI could be regulated without requiring entirely new legislation.

## Comparison to Reference Cases

Looking at previous technology export control implementations:

1. **Semiconductor export controls (2022)**: Implemented rapidly in response to national security concerns about China's military applications of advanced computing. The speed of implementation suggests similar quick action could occur for generative AI if deemed necessary.

2. **Encryption software export controls (1990s)**: Initially strict controls were later relaxed, showing that export regulations can evolve based on commercial interests and technological proliferation.

## Key Differences Affecting the Forecast

Several factors unique to generative AI software may influence the likelihood of export controls:

1. **Software vs. Hardware**: Unlike semiconductors, software is more difficult to control through export restrictions due to its digital nature and ease of transmission.

2. **Commercial Interests**: US companies like OpenAI, Google, Microsoft, and Anthropic have significant commercial interests in global deployment of their AI services, creating potential resistance to export controls.

3. **Technological Leadership**: The US may view widespread adoption of US-developed AI systems as advantageous for maintaining technological leadership and setting global standards.

4. **Evolving Capabilities**: As generative AI capabilities continue to advance through 2023-2025, the perceived risks may increase, potentially triggering regulatory action.

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on the information available as of May 17, 2023, I assess a moderate probability (approximately 60-70%) that the US will enact some form of export controls on generative AI software before 2026.

Factors supporting this assessment:

- Precedent set by semiconductor export controls
- Growing concerns about national security implications of advanced AI
- Bipartisan support for addressing technological competition with China
- Existing legal framework that could be extended to AI software

Factors reducing this probability:

- Commercial interests of major US technology companies
- Challenges in effectively controlling software exports
- Potential strategic advantage of global US AI deployment
- Uncertainty about the pace of AI capability advancement

## Limitations and Uncertainties

The forecast faces several limitations:

1. The rapidly evolving nature of AI technology makes long-term predictions difficult
2. Uncertainty about specific capabilities that might trigger national security concerns
3. Unpredictable geopolitical developments through 2025
4. Limited public information about classified government assessments of AI risks
