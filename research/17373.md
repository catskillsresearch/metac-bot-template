## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of May 2025, the U.S. has not passed federal legislation explicitly requiring all actors in possession of powerful AI models to take cybersecurity measures to secure those models.
- Recent federal legislative efforts include:
  - The Federal Artificial Intelligence Risk Management Act (S.3205), which directs federal agencies to use an AI risk management framework but does not impose cybersecurity requirements on all AI holders[1].
  - The AI for National Security Act (H.R.1718), which updates cybersecurity policy for the Department of Defense and mentions AI-based endpoint security, but is limited to military and federal government contexts, not private or civilian AI developers[3].
- State-level activity on AI legislation is robust, with at least 25 states introducing AI bills in 2023, but these do not create a federal mandate and generally focus on transparency, discrimination, or sector-specific risks[2][5].
- Legislative updates through the first quarter of 2025 do not note the passage of any broad federal law meeting the described criteria[4].

## 2. Recent Announcements and Policies

- Bills introduced in 2025, such as California’s SB53, focus on whistleblower protections related to AI risk, not on mandating cybersecurity standards for powerful AI models[5].
- Other state and federal bills address AI risks in narrow or sector-specific ways but do not constitute comprehensive cybersecurity requirements for powerful AI models.
- No major federal legislative breakthrough has been reported as of April 2025[4].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- U.S. Congress legislative database for bill status (congress.gov)[1][3].
- National Conference of State Legislatures summaries for AI legislation[2].
- Law firm and regulatory updates for monitoring state and federal AI laws[4][5].

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- Legislative gridlock and the slow pace of federal policymaking make it unlikely, but not impossible, that comprehensive AI cybersecurity legislation will pass by the end of 2025.
- The possibility remains that a major AI-related incident or strong bipartisan agreement could catalyze rapid legislative action.
- Definitions of "powerful AI" and the scope of cybersecurity requirements could affect whether future laws would meet the resolution criteria.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the current status, historical trends, and lack of imminent federal action, the probability that the U.S. will have passed, by December 31, 2025, a federal law requiring all U.S. actors in possession of powerful AI models to take cybersecurity measures specifically aimed at securing those models is **low**—likely below 25%.
