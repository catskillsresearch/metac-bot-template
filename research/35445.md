# Forecasting FAA Unruly Passenger Incidents for March 2, 2025

To forecast the number of reported incidents of unruly passengers per 10,000 flights for the week of March 2, 2025, I'll analyze historical trends, recent policies, and available data points that could influence this metric.

## Historical Trends and Current Status

The frequency of unruly passenger incidents has shown significant fluctuation over recent years:

- 2017: 544 incidents
- 2018: 889 incidents
- 2019: 1,161 incidents
- 2020: 1,009 incidents
- 2021: 5,973 incidents (dramatic spike)
- 2022: 2,455 incidents
- 2023: 2,076 incidents
- 2024: 2,102 incidents[4]

This data reveals a concerning pattern: after a massive spike in 2021 (nearly 6,000 cases) as passengers returned to air travel following pandemic restrictions, numbers decreased but stabilized at around 2,100 incidents annually in 2023-2024, which is still approximately double the pre-pandemic levels[4].

For 2024 specifically, we have several data points showing the progression of incidents:
- From January 1 to June 9, 2024: 915 reported cases[1]
- By August 21, 2024: More than 1,240 reported cases[2]
- Full year 2024: 2,102 total incidents[4]

This suggests that unruly passenger incidents occurred at a relatively consistent rate throughout 2024, with no dramatic spikes or declines within the year.

## Recent Policies and Enforcement Actions

The FAA implemented several measures that may influence the rate of unruly passenger incidents:

1. **Zero-Tolerance Policy**: Implemented on January 13, 2021, this policy eliminated warnings and counseling in favor of immediate fines for unruly behavior[1].

2. **Increased Penalties**: The FAA can propose civil penalties up to $37,000 per violation for passengers who assault, threaten, intimidate, or interfere with airline crew members[1][2].

3. **FBI Partnership**: Since late 2021, the FAA has referred over 310 of the most serious cases to the FBI for potential criminal prosecution, including 43 cases in the year preceding August 2024[2][5].

4. **Enhanced Enforcement**: In 2024, the FAA initiated 512 investigations, representing approximately 24% of the total incidents reported that year[4].

These measures have contributed to an 80% reduction in the rate of unruly passenger incidents since the peak in early 2021[2]. However, airlines continue to report concerning numbers of incidents, with behavior that is "increasingly aggressive and of a physical nature"[5].

## Limitations in Forecasting

Several factors limit the precision of any forecast for the specific week of March 2, 2025:

1. The search results do not provide data on incidents per 10,000 flights, only absolute numbers.

2. No weekly breakdown of incidents is available to identify potential seasonal patterns.

3. While we know there were 2,102 incidents in 2024, we don't have information on how these were distributed throughout the year beyond the partial-year snapshots.

4. The data doesn't indicate whether March typically sees higher or lower rates of incidents compared to other months.

## Conclusion

Based on the available data, we can observe that:

1. Unruly passenger incidents have stabilized at approximately 2,100 per year (2024), which is higher than pre-pandemic levels but significantly lower than the 2021 peak.

2. The FAA's enforcement actions and zero-tolerance policy continue to be in effect, which should help maintain the reduced rate compared to 2021.

3. Without specific data on incidents per 10,000 flights or seasonal patterns, it's difficult to make a precise forecast for the specific week of March 2, 2025.

The most reliable indicator may be the overall trend from 2024, which showed relative stability in the rate of incidents throughout the year. If this trend continues, we might expect the rate for the week of March 2, 2025, to be consistent with the average rate observed in early 2025.
