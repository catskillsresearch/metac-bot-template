### Key Factual Information for Forecasting DeepSeek vs. ChatGPT App Store Ranking

- DeepSeek held the #1 position in 57 countries and was in the Top 10 in 111 countries, indicating global momentum[2][3].
- The app saw explosive growth, with downloads doubling from 1 million to 2.6 million in just a few days, and daily search interest peaking at 7 million[2].

**2. Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Metric**

**Summary Table: DeepSeek vs. ChatGPT App Store Status (as of late January 2025)**

| Metric                        | DeepSeek           | ChatGPT           |
|-------------------------------|--------------------|-------------------|
| App Store Rank (US)           | #1                 | #2                |
| #1 Rank in Countries          | 57                 | Fewer than DeepSeek|
| Top 10 in Countries           | 111                | Not specified     |
| Recent Download Growth        | Explosive          | Declining         |
| New User Restrictions         | Yes (non-China)    | No                |

**Conclusion:**  
As of February 6, 2025, DeepSeek holds a strong lead over ChatGPT in App Store rankings, driven by superior technical performance, aggressive pricing, and global momentum. The main risk to maintaining this lead is the restriction on new sign-ups for non-Chinese users. If this restriction is lifted or does not significantly impact user growth, DeepSeek is likely to remain ranked higher than ChatGPT on April 1, 2025. However, App Store rankings are volatile, and unforeseen events could alter this outlook.
