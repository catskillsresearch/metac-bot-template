## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- All EU countries operate some form of minimum income scheme, but these are almost universally means-tested, last-resort, and not unconditional or universal[1][2][3].
- Recent years have seen increased interest in strengthening minimum income guarantees, but reforms (e.g., in Spain, Netherlands, Portugal) have focused on expanding and unifying means-tested systems—not on moving to unconditional or universal GMI[2][5].
- Several UBI pilots (notably in Finland, the Netherlands, and elsewhere) have demonstrated interest and provided valuable data, but none have led to the adoption of a national, unconditional GMI[4].

## 2. Recent Announcements/Policies

- Spain’s 2020 Minimum Vital Income (IMV) is the most ambitious recent move in the EU, offering a standardized, nationwide minimum income. However, it remains means-tested, targeted at households in extreme poverty, and adjusted for household composition—not universal, unconditional, or individual[5].
- No recent EU policy announcements indicate imminent implementation of a GMI that meets the resolution criteria (unconditional, individual, non-withdrawable, ≥80% poverty line, >50% labor force coverage)[1][5].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- European Commission and Eurofound data confirm the prevalence of means-tested, last-resort minimum income schemes across the EU, with no country meeting the stricter GMI definition as of 2020[1][2][3][5].
- Wikipedia and research summaries document UBI pilots but confirm the absence of national rollouts meeting GMI criteria[4].

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- Welfare policy is subject to rapid change in response to economic crises, political realignment, or shifting public opinion.
- The definition of GMI used here is strict; incremental reforms may approach but not fully meet these criteria.
- Data on coverage and adequacy (relative to the poverty line) are periodically updated and may lag behind policy changes.

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on available data as of mid-2020, the probability that any EU country will introduce a GMI, as strictly defined (unconditional, automatic, individual, non-withdrawable, covering >50% of the labor force at ≥80% of the poverty line for at least six months), before 2041 is **low (estimated at less than 20%)**. The trend is toward more generous and inclusive minimum income schemes, but significant political, fiscal, and ideological barriers remain to full GMI implementation.
