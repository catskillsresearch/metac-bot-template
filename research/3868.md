### Key Historical and Current Status

- Since 1945, there has been a "Long Peace" with no direct military conflict between great powers, though proxy wars and regional conflicts have been common.
- Reference cases for world war outbreaks (WWI, WWII) occurred in the higher northern latitudes (Europe and East Asia, ~35°N–55°N).
- As of 2020, the most conflict-prone and militarized regions with potential for escalation to great power war are:
  - The Middle East and North Africa (e.g., Syria, Iran, Iraq: ~30°N–37°N)
  - The Korean Peninsula (~38°N)
  - The South China Sea (0°–20°N)
  - Eastern Europe (Ukraine: ~48°N–50°N)[4][5]
- Active armed conflicts in 2020 were overwhelmingly clustered in the MENA region and parts of South/Southeast Asia[4][5].

### Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- In 2020, top conflict risks identified by the Council on Foreign Relations included:
  - Potential US-Iran armed confrontation (~30°N–32°N)
  - Korean Peninsula crisis (~38°N)
  - South China Sea maritime disputes (~0°–20°N)
  - Russia-Ukraine escalation (~48°N–50°N)[5]
- No new treaties, alliances, or arms control agreements in early 2020 significantly shifted these risk geographies.
- Ongoing deterrence (especially nuclear), US global hegemony, and economic interdependence continued to restrain escalation[5].

### Probabilistic Assessment (Adjusted for 2020 Data)

- Given the concentration of flashpoints and historical precedents, the most probable latitude for a WW3-initiating incident is between 30°N and 40°N.
- This range covers the Middle East, the Korean Peninsula, and parts of South Asia—regions with active conflicts and high great-power involvement.
- A secondary risk band lies higher (Eastern Europe, ~48°N–50°N), but the primary risk remains in the lower band due to greater number of disputes and ongoing hostilities.
- Adjusted probabilistic estimate (as of 2020): If WW3 occurs, there is a >60% chance the initiating incident occurs between 30°N and 40°N latitude, with the most likely central value near 35°N.

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- The initiating "incident" could be non-military (e.g., cyberattack) or ambiguous in location.
- Great power war could escalate from peripheral regions due to alliance entanglement.
- The forecast is based on conflict geography and escalation risk as of 2020; sudden political changes or technological developments could alter probabilities.
