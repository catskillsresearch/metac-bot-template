## Key Factual Information Relevant to Forecasting Greg Brockman’s Return

**1. Current Status and Nature of Leave**
- Greg Brockman, OpenAI’s president and co-founder, announced on August 6, 2024, that he is taking a sabbatical for the rest of the year, stating, “First time to relax since co-founding OpenAI 9 years ago. The mission is far from complete; we still have a safe AGI to build”[1][4].
- Brockman did not announce a resignation or permanent departure. He remains listed as OpenAI’s president as of his announcement[4].

**2. Recent Announcements and Organizational Context**
- Brockman’s sabbatical follows a period of significant leadership turnover at OpenAI. Of the original 11 founders, only three remain: Brockman (on sabbatical), CEO Sam Altman, and research leader Wojciech Zaremba[4].
- Other co-founders, including John Schulman and Ilya Sutskever, have left the company in 2024, with Schulman joining Anthropic and Sutskever founding a new venture[4].
- Brockman has historically been a close ally of Sam Altman and returned to OpenAI after the November 2023 boardroom coup, suggesting a pattern of resilience and loyalty to the organization[3].

**3. Authoritative Sources for Verification**
- Brockman’s own public statements on X (formerly Twitter) and coverage by reputable outlets such as the Financial Times and Entrepreneur confirm the sabbatical and ongoing affiliation with OpenAI[1][4].
- There is no credible reporting as of August 23, 2024, indicating that Brockman has resigned or will not return to OpenAI after his sabbatical[1][4].

**4. Limitations and Uncertainties**
- Brockman’s statement specifies a sabbatical “through end of year,” but does not clarify whether he will return before October 1, 2024, or immediately after the sabbatical ends[1][4].
- No official OpenAI communications have provided a timeline or conditions for Brockman’s return.
- The broader context of leadership instability at OpenAI introduces uncertainty, as several other high-profile departures have occurred in 2024[4].
- There is no evidence of a new policy or event that would preclude Brockman’s return, but the lack of a firm commitment leaves open the possibility of a change in plans.

## Summary

As of August 23, 2024, Greg Brockman is on an announced sabbatical from OpenAI, with no credible reporting of a resignation or permanent departure. He remains president of OpenAI, and his public statements suggest an intention to return, but there is no explicit commitment to a return date before October 1, 2024. The situation is characterized by uncertainty due to recent leadership turnover and the absence of detailed plans for his return.
