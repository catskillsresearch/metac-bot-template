## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- ASAT tests have historically been rare, with high-profile events like China's 2007 and Russia's 2021 tests drawing global concern over space debris[4][5].
- As of December 2022, successful kinetic ASAT tests (i.e., actual intercept and destruction of a satellite) have been infrequent, with only a handful conducted in the last two decades[4][5].
- The international community has repeatedly condemned debris-generating tests, but no binding global ban on ASAT tests exists[4].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- The United Nations and several spacefaring nations have discussed guidelines and potential bans on kinetic ASAT tests. However, consensus has not been reached, and enforcement remains weak[4].
- The US, China, and Russia continue to invest heavily in military space capabilities, including the development of ASAT technologies, driven by heightened geopolitical competition[3].
- Proposals exist to limit debris from ASAT activities, such as conducting tests at low altitudes or providing advance notification, but these are not universally implemented[4].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The [Metaculus ASAT test spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e5GtZEzdo6xk41i2_ei3c8jRZDjvP4Xwz3BVsUHwi48/edit#gid=1623728214) and relevant Wikipedia entries track confirmed tests.
- Major news outlets and space policy think tanks (e.g., Harvard International Review, SIPRI) provide analysis of test events and policy responses[4][2][3].
- The United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research (UNIDR) and NASA monitor space debris and regulatory developments[4][3].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- There is significant uncertainty around unreported or covert ASAT tests, especially of non-destructive or classified systems.
- Political developments (e.g., a major conflict, new treaties) could rapidly alter the rate of testing.
- The definition for this forecast includes only successful kinetic tests with permission from the satellite owner, excluding covert attacks or non-kinetic approaches.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

- Historical trend: 1â€“2 successful kinetic ASAT tests per decade among state actors.
- Key differences for 2022â€“2030: 
  - Higher geopolitical tensions may marginally increase the likelihood of tests[3].
  - Growing international pressure and reputational risks act as deterrents[4][2].
  - Commercial and R&D activity in the ASAT domain is increasing, but destructive tests remain costly and risky[3].

**Probabilistic forecast (as of December 2022):**
- Expected number of successful kinetic ASAT tests by 2030: 1 to 4.
- Probability of zero tests: ~20%
- Probability of 1â€“3 tests: ~60%
- Probability of >3 tests: ~20%
- Probability of >10 or >100 tests: <1% (extremely unlikely without a major conflict or policy reversal).
