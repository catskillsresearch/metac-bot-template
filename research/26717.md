# Forecasting Analysis: Radical Life Extension Post-AGI

To forecast whether widely available radical life extension treatments will exist five years after AGI, I'll analyze current longevity science developments, technological trajectories, and potential AGI impacts.

## Current Situation & Reference Cases

### State of Longevity Science (as of July 2024)

The field of longevity research has seen significant advancements in recent years, with several key developments:

- The SENS (Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence) approach, pioneered by Aubrey de Grey, has become a foundational framework in longevity science. This "divide-and-conquer" strategy focuses on repairing cellular and molecular damage as the primary method to combat aging[4].

- De Grey's approach identifies seven major categories of aging damage and proposes specific therapies to periodically repair or remove this damage. His theory suggests that maintaining these repairs could allow humans to maintain a physiological age of around 25 indefinitely[5].

- The Robust Mass Rejuvenation (RMR) project represents cutting-edge experimentation combining multiple rejuvenation therapies in mice to delay aging, with the aim of inspiring breakthroughs applicable to human longevity[4].

- A $101 million XPRIZE Healthspan award has been established to incentivize the development of therapies that can significantly reverse biological aging in humans by 2030[4].

### Current Technological Enablers

- AI technologies like AlphaFold and advanced data analytics are already accelerating progress in drug discovery and aging-related research[4].

- The scientific community increasingly recognizes aging as a phenomenon caused by accumulated molecular and cellular damage that is theoretically repairable through targeted interventions[5].

## Key Differences Affecting the Forecast

### AGI as a Potential Accelerator

- AGI would likely dramatically accelerate biological research, potentially solving complex problems in longevity science that currently remain challenges.

- The integration of AGI with existing AI tools in drug discovery could exponentially increase the pace of developing effective anti-aging compounds and therapies.

### Scientific Paradigm Shifts

- De Grey has challenged traditional notions about aging, arguing against the idea that "informatic" aspects of aging will make radical life extension impossible in the near future[5].

- The scientific debate around aging is showing signs of consensus building around the damage repair model, which would be favorable for radical life extension development[5].

### Institutional Support

- The emerging biotech industry is increasingly developing therapies aimed at periodic repair of various types of age-related damage[5].

- The establishment of organizations like the Longevity Escape Velocity (LEV) Foundation, where Aubrey de Grey serves as president and chief science officer, demonstrates growing institutional support for rejuvenation research[5].

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on current trajectories and potential AGI acceleration effects, I estimate the following probabilities for widely available radical life extension treatments five years post-AGI:

- **35-45% probability of success**: This assessment is based on:
  1. The established scientific framework (SENS) that already identifies specific intervention targets
  2. Current progress in rejuvenation therapies and growing institutional support
  3. The potential multiplicative effect of AGI on solving complex biological problems
  4. The timeline constraint of just five years post-AGI for widespread availability

### Key Uncertainties

- **Scientific hurdles**: Despite progress, we cannot be certain that all seven categories of damage identified in the SENS approach can be effectively addressed within the timeframe.

- **Manufacturing and distribution challenges**: Even with scientific breakthroughs, scaling production and ensuring global availability presents significant challenges.

- **Regulatory pathways**: The regulatory framework for radical life extension treatments remains undefined and could significantly delay widespread availability.

- **Definition of "widely available"**: The question specifies more than one-fifth of 70-year-olds would need to still be alive 50 years later, which is an extremely high bar requiring both efficacy and widespread adoption.

## Conclusion

While the foundations for radical life extension are being established today through approaches like SENS and projects like RMR, the five-year post-AGI timeframe represents a significant constraint. The probability of success depends heavily on how AGI accelerates existing research trajectories and overcomes current bottlenecks in longevity science.

Even with AGI's assistance, the requirement for treatments to be not just developed but widely available enough to dramatically extend the lifespan of a significant portion of the elderly population presents substantial challenges. The most likely outcome is that while breakthrough treatments may exist five years post-AGI, truly widespread availability capable of meeting the question's criteria would require additional time.
