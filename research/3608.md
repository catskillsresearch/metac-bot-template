**Key Factual Information as of February 11, 2020, Relevant to Forecasting Majority Cosmologist Opinion on Cosmic Acceleration in 2030**

**1. State of Evidence for an Accelerating Universe (as of 2020)**
- The discovery of cosmic acceleration in 1998–1999, based on observations of distant Type Ia supernovae, remains one of the most celebrated results in cosmology.
- Multiple, independent lines of evidence as of 2020 support an accelerating universe: 
  - Type Ia supernovae luminosity distances
  - Measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), especially from the WMAP and Planck satellites
  - Baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) in large-scale galaxy surveys
  - Clustering of galaxies and weak gravitational lensing
- The standard cosmological model (ΛCDM), which includes a cosmological constant (Λ) to account for dark energy, is widely accepted and fits the data from these probes extremely well.

**2. Scientific Consensus Among Cosmologists**
- As of early 2020, the overwhelming majority of leading cosmologists agree that the evidence strongly supports an accelerating universe.
- Major reviews, textbooks, and conference summaries reflect this consensus.
- The ΛCDM model is considered the "standard model" of cosmology, with acceleration as a central feature.

**3. Known Anomalies or Challenges**
- There are some tensions in cosmological data (e.g., the "Hubble tension" between early- and late-universe measurements of the Hubble constant), but none of these have overturned the evidence for acceleration.
- Alternative models (such as modified gravity or evolving dark energy) are actively researched but have not displaced ΛCDM as the consensus framework.
- Some papers have questioned specific supernova analyses or systematic uncertainties, but the overall conclusion of acceleration is robust to these critiques as of 2020.

**4. Stability of Consensus and Likelihood of Change**
- The consensus on acceleration has held for over two decades, despite intensive scrutiny and new data releases.
- The process for selecting "leading cosmologists" by citation count tends to favor researchers who contribute to mainstream, widely-cited work, which is typically based on the standard model.
- Barring a major, paradigm-shifting discovery, it is unlikely that the majority of top-cited cosmologists will reverse their position by 2030.

**5. Authoritative Sources for Verification**
- WMAP and Planck mission results (CMB)
- Sloan Digital Sky Survey (BAO and galaxy surveys)
- Supernova Cosmology Project, High-Z Supernova Search Team (Type Ia supernovae)
- Review articles in journals such as *Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics* and *Physics Reports*

**6. Limitations and Uncertainties**
- Forecasts assume no dramatic, currently unforeseen discoveries or disproofs of cosmic acceleration.
- If major systematic errors in supernova or other data are uncovered, or if a new model supplants ΛCDM, the consensus could shift.
- The precise composition of the "leading cosmologists" group in 2030 is unknown, but citation-based selection is likely to favor those aligned with the standard paradigm.

**Summary Table: Key Factual Points (as of 2020)**

| Aspect                      | Status in 2020                                                   |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Evidence for acceleration   | Strong, multi-probe, widely accepted                             |
| Scientific consensus        | Overwhelming majority "yes"                                      |
| Major anomalies             | Some tensions, but not challenging acceleration itself           |
| Alternative theories        | Explored, but not dominant                                       |
| Likelihood of consensus shift| Low, unless major unforeseen scientific revolution occurs        |
