# Forecasting Trump's Golf Habits Through April 1, 2025

Based on available data as of March 2025, we can analyze President Trump's golfing patterns in his second term to forecast what percentage of his presidency will be spent golfing by April 1, 2025, according to Trump Golf Track.

## Current Golfing Patterns

As of February 20, 2025, approximately one month into his second term, President Trump has spent 7 out of his first 29 days in office playing golf, representing 24.14% of his presidency thus far[2]. This is consistent with his established pattern of regularly incorporating golf into his presidential schedule.

For comparison, during Trump's first presidential term (2017-2021), he visited Trump Organization properties on 428 of the 1,461 days in office (30%) and played an estimated 261 rounds of golf, averaging one round every 5.6 days[2]. This translated to approximately 17.9% of his days in office spent golfing during his first term.

## Recent Golf Activity

The current data suggests Trump may be golfing at a higher frequency in his second term:

- Trump has played golf during all four weekends since returning to the White House in January 2025[5]
- According to reports, Trump played golf at his own properties on nine of his first 30 days in office[5]
- The Trump Golf Track website is specifically dedicated to monitoring the number of days President Trump spends playing golf during his second term[3]

## Financial Considerations

Based on a HuffPost calculation using a 2019 Government Accountability Office report, Trump's golfing excursions in the first month of his second term have cost approximately $10.7 million in taxpayer money[5]. While this financial aspect doesn't directly impact the percentage calculation, it represents a significant aspect of his golfing habits.

## Forecast Considerations

To forecast the percentage for April 1, 2025, we need to consider:

1. **Current rate**: The 24.14% rate observed in the first month represents a higher frequency than his first-term average of 17.9%
2. **Seasonal factors**: Winter weather may have limited some golfing opportunities in January-February, suggesting the rate could increase as spring arrives in March
3. **Consistency**: Trump's demonstrated commitment to golf appears unchanged from his first term

Given that Trump has maintained a consistent pattern of weekend golf outings and has spent approximately one-quarter of his early presidency on golf courses, it's reasonable to project that by April 1, 2025 (71 days into his term), the percentage shown on Trump Golf Track will likely remain in the 22-25% range if current patterns hold.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors could affect this forecast:

1. **Measurement methodology**: Trump Golf Track's exact criteria for counting a day as "golfing" may affect the final percentage
2. **Presidential duties**: Unforeseen national or international events could reduce golfing opportunities
3. **Weather conditions**: Unusual weather patterns could impact planned golf outings
4. **Data verification**: The accuracy of Trump Golf Track's monitoring system relies on public reporting and may not capture every instance
