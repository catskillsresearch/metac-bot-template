# Harvard University's SEVP Certification Status Assessment

Based on factual information available as of May 26, 2025, I'll analyze the current situation regarding Harvard University's Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) certification and provide a probabilistic assessment for the July 1, 2025 deadline.

## Current Status and Timeline

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) revoked Harvard University's SEVP certification on May 22, 2025, which would have prevented Harvard from enrolling or granting practical training to international students on F or J visas for the 2025-2026 academic year[3]. This unprecedented move would have affected approximately 6,800 international students (27% of Harvard's student body) who would need to transfer to other SEVP-certified institutions to maintain their legal status.

In response to this revocation, Harvard University filed a Motion for Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) on May 23, 2025[3]. The university acted swiftly, filing the motion just one day after the revocation was announced. The court granted Harvard's motion, allowing the university to continue enrolling international students and scholars while the case proceeds[1][3].

## Reasons for Revocation

According to DHS, the revocation stemmed from multiple factors:

1. **Compliance issues**: Harvard allegedly failed to meet SEVP compliance requirements, including timely responses to federal records requests and providing adequate documentation regarding international students[3].

2. **Campus environment concerns**: DHS raised allegations regarding Harvard's campus environment, describing it as "hostile to Jewish students," promoting "pro-Hamas sympathies," and enforcing what they characterized as "racist" diversity, equity, and inclusion policies[3].

This action appears to be part of a broader confrontation between the Trump administration and Harvard University, as detailed in the background information.

## Legal Status and Implications

The court's decision to grant the TRO is significant as it effectively suspends the revocation of Harvard's SEVP certification while legal proceedings continue[1]. This means that, as of May 24, 2025, Harvard retains its ability to enroll international students despite DHS's attempt to revoke this authorization.

The granting of the TRO suggests that the court found merit in Harvard's legal challenge, or at least determined that:
1. Harvard would suffer irreparable harm without the TRO
2. Harvard has a reasonable likelihood of success on the merits of its case
3. The balance of equities favors Harvard
4. The public interest would be served by granting the TRO

## Probabilistic Assessment for July 1, 2025

Based on the current facts, Harvard currently has a functioning SEVP certification due to the court's TRO, which allows them to continue enrolling international students while the case proceeds[1]. The key question is whether this legal protection will remain in place through July 1, 2025.

**Factors supporting Harvard maintaining certification by July 1:**
- The court has already ruled in Harvard's favor by granting the TRO[1][3]
- The time between now (May 26) and the target date (July 1) is relatively short (about 5 weeks)
- Legal proceedings of this complexity typically take months to resolve fully
- TROs are typically followed by preliminary injunctions that extend protection during litigation

**Factors suggesting Harvard might lose certification by July 1:**
- TROs are temporary by nature and must be followed by further legal proceedings
- The administration could appeal the TRO or seek emergency relief from a higher court
- The court could rule on the merits of the case before July 1 and side with DHS

Given that the court has already granted Harvard's TRO, and the relatively short timeframe until July 1, 2025, it appears more likely than not that Harvard will still have SEVP certification on July 1, 2025, either through continued court protection or through a resolution of the dispute. However, this assessment comes with significant uncertainty given the political nature of the dispute and the unpredictability of both court proceedings and potential administrative actions.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

This assessment is based on information available as of May 26, 2025, and is subject to change based on:
- Future court rulings or appeals
- Potential settlements between Harvard and the administration
- New administrative actions by DHS or other government agencies
- Legislative interventions

The situation remains fluid, and developments in the coming weeks could significantly alter the outlook for Harvard's SEVP certification status.
