### Key Factual Information Relevant to Forecasting CDC's Mpox Risk Assessment

**1. Current CDC Risk Assessment**
- As of July 8, 2024, the CDC assessed the risk to the US general population from mpox as "VERY LOW" in its most recent qualitative analysis. The CDC is working to update this assessment in response to recent developments, but no new, higher risk level has been published as of August 23, 2024[1].

**2. Recent Outbreaks and Global Declarations**
- On August 14, 2024, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) due to an upsurge of mpox cases, particularly clade I, in Central and Eastern Africa. However, as of late August 2024, there are no known cases of clade I mpox in the United States[1][5].

**3. US Domestic Situation**
- The US has reported 33,435 mpox cases and 60 deaths as of August 6, 2024, with 1,700 new cases in 2024. These cases are primarily attributed to clade IIb, which continues to circulate at a low but steady pace. There is no evidence of clade I mpox transmission within the US[5].
- The CDC's August 7, 2024, Health Alert Network (HAN) notice explicitly states that "the risk of clade I mpox spreading to the United States is very low at this time"[2].

**4. US Preparedness and Public Health Response**
- The US government has increased surveillance, including wastewater testing and expanded diagnostic capacity, and continues to recommend vaccination for at-risk populations. The US is described as well-prepared to detect, contain, and manage clade I cases should they occur domestically[1].
- The CDC continues to recommend two doses of the JYNNEOS vaccine for eligible individuals, which is believed to protect against both mpox clades[2].

**5. Limitations and Uncertainties**
- The CDC is actively updating its risk assessment in response to the evolving situation in Africa and potential travel-associated cases. However, as of August 23, 2024, there is no indication of a significant increase in domestic risk or a published assessment exceeding "Moderate."
- The risk could change rapidly if clade I mpox were detected and began spreading in the US, but as of the latest available data, this has not occurred.

### Conclusion

Based on all available factual information as of August 23, 2024, there is no evidence to suggest that the CDC's assessment of the risk posed by mpox to the US general public will exceed "Moderate" before October 1, 2024. The risk remains "VERY LOW" according to the latest CDC assessment, and no domestic cases of clade I mpox have been reported. The situation is being closely monitored, and the CDC is prepared to respond if circumstances change.
