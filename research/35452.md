### Key Factual Information for Forecasting Bluesky Posts on March 30, 2025

**1. Historical Trends and Current Status**
- As of February 2025, Bluesky has over 30 million registered users, reflecting a period of rapid growth, particularly after the 2024 U.S. presidential election[3][4].
- By early February 2025, users had made over 658 million posts in total, according to Jaz's Bluesky index, which is the authoritative source for this metric[5].
- The platform experienced a surge in both user registrations and activity following major events, with monthly downloads peaking at 7.35 million in November 2024[4].

**2. Recent Announcements and Policies**
- The growth in posts and users has been largely organic, driven by migration from X (formerly Twitter) due to unpopular policy changes there, rather than any artificial boosts from Bluesky itself[3][4].
- There are no reported Bluesky policy changes or technical issues as of February 2025 that would significantly alter posting rates.

**3. Authoritative Sources for Verification**
- Jaz's Bluesky index (bsky.jazco.dev) is the definitive source for total post counts and will be used to resolve the actual number for March 30, 2025[5].
- Additional statistics and context are available from TechCrunch, Statista, and Adam Connell’s analytics[3][4][5].

**4. Limitations and Uncertainties**
- The latest available total post count is from early February 2025 (658 million posts)[5].
- The daily posting rate is not explicitly stated, so any forecast for March 30, 2025, must extrapolate from the most recent data, factoring in user growth and engagement trends.
- Actual post counts may vary due to unforeseen events or shifts in user behavior, and only Jaz's Bluesky index will provide the definitive number for the specified date.
