## Comparison to Reference Cases

- The idea of a Dyson swarm—a massive array of solar collectors orbiting the Sun to capture its energy—remains theoretical, with no practical steps toward construction as of 2025[3].
- Armstrong’s 2015 plan suggested disassembling Mercury for materials, with timelines of 10 years to the first collector and roughly 100 years for a full swarm, assuming exponential growth in construction capability.
- Paul Christiano estimates a 40% chance that by 2040, AI could build a Dyson swarm, but this is contingent on rapid technological advances and societal mobilization.

## Key Differences Affecting the Forecast

- **Current Technological Status**: Humanity has not yet launched any mission for planetary-scale resource extraction or large-scale autonomous manufacturing in space. The scale is far beyond anything currently deployed or planned, even with ambitious private and national space programs[2].
- **Material Constraints**: A full silicon-based Dyson swarm would require more material than is readily available from any single planet except Mars; even the Moon and asteroid belt may fall short unless alternative materials and manufacturing techniques are developed[2].
- **Engineering Readiness**: The necessary autonomous robotics, in-space manufacturing, and interplanetary logistics do not exist at remotely required scales. Even with rapid AGI-driven progress, the industrial base would need years of exponential scaling from a near-zero baseline[2].
- **Societal and Economic Factors**: No major government or private entity has announced plans or policies to pursue a Dyson swarm as a near-term goal. Political, economic, and environmental considerations could delay or disrupt even AGI-driven projects.
- **AGI Impact Uncertainty**: While AGI could theoretically accelerate technological and scientific progress, there is no empirical precedent for the speed and scale of change required to shift from AGI deployment to megastructure construction in five years.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the above, the probability that, five years post-AGI, humanity will have begun construction of a Dyson swarm (i.e., launched the first mining probe for swarm materials) remains low, though not zero. While AGI could greatly accelerate planning and technology development, the bottleneck is industrial scaling in space, which is subject to physical, organizational, and economic constraints.

A reasonable forecast, adjusting down from the most optimistic expert predictions, would place the probability in the 5–15% range. This reflects the unprecedented scale-up required, persistent material and engineering challenges, and the absence of any current concrete steps toward such a project.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- The definition of AGI and the timing of its arrival are themselves uncertain.
- AGI’s actual capabilities and the degree to which it will be directed toward megastructure construction remain speculative.
- Societal, political, and economic will to pursue a Dyson swarm immediately post-AGI is not guaranteed.
- Measurement is limited by the lack of precedents for this scale of space industrialization.
