# Forecasting December 2024 Temperatures at Barrow/Port Rogers NWS Station

Based on the information available as of my knowledge cutoff, I cannot provide a comprehensive forecast regarding whether December 2024 temperatures at the Barrow/Port Rogers NWS weather station will exceed the 1945-2023 average. The search results do not contain relevant information about Arctic temperature trends, historical data for this specific weather station, or climate projections for the region.

## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

The search results do not provide any specific information about historical temperature trends at the Barrow/Port Rogers weather station or current Arctic climate conditions. To properly assess this question, one would need data on:

- Historical December temperature averages at Barrow/Port Rogers from 1945-2023
- Recent temperature trends in the Arctic region, particularly along the Alaskan Arctic coast
- Year-to-date temperature anomalies for 2024 in the region

## Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

The search results do not contain information about recent climate policies, announcements, or studies that might impact Arctic temperatures for December 2024.

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

While not present in the search results, the following sources would typically be valuable for verifying this information:

- Iowa Environmental Mesonet (specified as the resolution source)
- National Weather Service (NWS) data
- National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) climate reports
- Arctic Council climate assessments
- Alaska Climate Research Center

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Without access to relevant climate data, it's impossible to make an informed assessment about December 2024 temperature projections. Additionally, even with historical data, weather forecasting beyond a few weeks contains significant uncertainty, making long-term temperature predictions challenging.

To properly address this question, one would need to analyze:
- Long-term warming trends in the Arctic
- El Niño/La Niña conditions and their historical impact on Alaskan winter temperatures
- Arctic sea ice extent and its correlation with coastal temperatures
- Seasonal forecasts from meteorological organizations

Unfortunately, the search results do not provide this information, making it impossible to offer a data-driven forecast for December 2024 temperatures at the Barrow/Port Rogers weather station.
