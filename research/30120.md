### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Pantone's Color of the Year selections from 2015–2024 have alternated between cool and warm hues, with blue shades chosen in 2020 ("Classic Blue") and 2022 ("Very Peri"), and warm tones like "Peach Fuzz" (2024) and "Viva Magenta" (2023)[2][3].
- The 2025 color trend forecasts from Pantone and fashion industry observers highlighted a broad palette, including earthy browns, greens, purples, and some blue shades, but with a notable emphasis on warm, comforting tones[2][4].

### Recent Announcements and Industry Reporting

- Multiple industry sources report that Pantone's 2025 Color of the Year is "Mocha Mousse," described as a warm, muted brown inspired by chocolate and coffee[3].
- This selection aligns with broader 2025 color trends across paint brands and fashion, which have favored browns, plums, and earthy neutrals over blues[2][3].
- While some predictions speculated about a possible blue ("Deja Vu Blue") or green ("White Grape"), these were not realized in the final selection[4].

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The most direct evidence comes from industry reporting and color trend guides that have previewed or leaked the 2025 Pantone selection ahead of the official December announcement[3].
- Pantone's own trend forecasts for Spring/Summer 2025, while including blue as a supporting color, do not indicate it as the dominant or headline shade[1][5].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- The official Pantone announcement is scheduled for December 5, 2024, so all information is based on credible leaks and industry consensus as of November 15, 2024.
- If Pantone were to announce two colors or change its selection at the last minute, this could affect the outcome, but there is no evidence of such a plan as of the knowledge cutoff.

### Conclusion

Based on all available information as of November 15, 2024, the Pantone Color of the Year for 2025 is "Mocha Mousse," a warm brown. This color does not fall within the HSV hue range for blue (165–255). Therefore, "Blue" will **not** be the closest color to the 2025 Pantone Color of the Year[3].
