## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- **Tallest Human on Record:** Robert Wadlow, born in 1918, grew to 8’11” (272 cm) due to a pituitary disorder causing unchecked growth hormone production[2][5]. He died at age 22 due to complications related to his condition.
- **Recent Tallest Humans:** Since Wadlow, no one has come within several inches of his height. The current tallest living person is Sultan Kösen (born 1982), who measures 251 cm (8’2.8”)[1][3][4][5]. Kösen’s growth was halted in 2010 through medical intervention[5].
- **Rarity of Extreme Height:** Only a handful of confirmed individuals have exceeded 8 feet, and the trend is not increasing[2]. Most recent cases are well below Wadlow’s record.

## Key Differences Affecting the Forecast

- **Medical Advances:** Improved diagnostics and early treatment of pituitary tumors (often via surgery or radiosurgery) halt excessive growth, making it less likely for someone to reach Wadlow’s height, let alone surpass it[5].
- **Physiological Constraints:** Experts agree that heights approaching or exceeding 9 feet bring extreme health risks. These include dangerously high blood pressure in the legs, immense strain on the heart, severe joint and bone issues, and general difficulty in basic mobility[5].
- **Environmental and Engineering Limits:** The human skeleton and circulatory system face exponential stress as height increases, making survival at or above 9 feet unlikely for more than a short period[5].
- **No Upward Trend:** Since Wadlow’s era, the tallest verified individuals have not approached his height. The direction has been toward earlier intervention and shorter ultimate stature.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given:
- The tallest person ever was 1 inch shy of 9 feet, and this was nearly a century ago.
- No subsequent cases have approached this mark.
- Medical intervention now typically halts extreme growth well before these heights.
- Physiological limits likely prevent long-term survival above 9 feet.

**Probability of a verified living person (as measured by Guinness or a comparable authority) exceeding 9 feet by 2075 is extremely low—well under 1%.** The only plausible pathway would be a rare, untreated case of extreme pituitary gigantism, but such cases are less likely as global medical access improves.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- Extremely rare genetic mutations or undiagnosed cases could, in theory, produce someone taller than Wadlow, but survival prospects are poor due to the severe health risks.
- Measurement challenges and the possibility of unreported cases in remote areas cannot be fully excluded.
- Future changes in medical technology or biology are unpredictable but are unlikely to favor unchecked extreme growth.

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Guinness World Records and comparable organizations maintain rigorous verification of height claims, using direct measurement under controlled conditions[1][3][5].
