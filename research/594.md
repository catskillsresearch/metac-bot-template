## Key Historical Trends and Current Status (as of 2017-11-30)

- Since 2000, the International Space Station (ISS) has supported a continuous crew of 2–6 people in low Earth orbit.
- The absolute record for simultaneous human presence off Earth is 13, reached only twice (in 1995 and 2009), both during brief crew changeovers involving the Space Shuttle and Mir or ISS.
- As of November 2017, there were 6 people in space, all aboard the ISS; there were no permanent outposts or active crewed missions beyond low Earth orbit.
- No humans have been on the Moon, Mars, or any other celestial body since the Apollo program, and no firm, funded plans existed for such missions in the near future.
- The ISS was approaching the end of its planned operational life, with discussions about possible extensions, privatization, or deorbiting, but no definitive successor project was certain.

## Reference Case Comparison

| Reference Case                  | People Off Earth   | Duration/Context               |
|---------------------------------|--------------------|-------------------------------|
| ISS continuous operation (2000-) | 2–6                | Ongoing, LEO only             |
| Shuttle/Mir or ISS crew changes  | Up to 13           | Short periods, not sustained  |
| Apollo era (1968-1972)           | 3 (max at Moon)    | Only for brief missions       |

The sustained number of people off Earth has never exceeded 6, except for short periods. There is no precedent for maintaining >13 people off Earth for more than a few days.

## Key Differences Affecting the 2050 Forecast

- **Uncertainty about ISS future**: By 2050, the ISS will almost certainly be retired unless replaced or succeeded by a new outpost. No as-yet-committed international or commercial successor existed in 2017.
- **Commercial Spaceflight**: Though companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin were making progress, no commercial station or large-scale space tourism operation had yet been demonstrated or funded at a scale to support >13 people off Earth simultaneously.
- **Government Prioritization**: NASA, ESA, Roscosmos, and other agencies were discussing lunar and Mars missions, but no major crewed program with the capacity for >13 people off Earth was locked in or funded.
- **Population Growth**: Earth's population is projected to reach nearly 10 billion by 2050[1][3][4], but this does not directly impact the space population without corresponding breakthroughs in technology, economics, or political will.

## Recent Announcements/Policies (as of 2017)

- Ongoing discussions about ISS extension, commercialization, or replacement, but no firm commitments.
- Commercial crew programs (SpaceX Dragon, Boeing CST-100) were in late development, aiming to restore US human launch capability, but only to LEO and not at high capacity.
- Ambitious long-term visions (e.g., Mars colonization, lunar bases) were being discussed, but substantial technical, financial, and political hurdles remained.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- **Measurement**: “Off Earth” is clearly defined as >100 km altitude, so suborbital flights could briefly contribute, but sustained presence would require space stations or bases.
- **Distribution**: The probability distribution is not Gaussian; most scenarios cluster at zero to a handful of people off Earth, with a long tail for high-population scenarios if large-scale colonization occurs.
- **Black Swans**: Technological or geopolitical game-changers (e.g., breakthrough propulsion, major asteroid mining) could alter the landscape, but are highly uncertain.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the historical record, the lack of clear, funded programs capable of supporting >13 humans off Earth for any duration as of 2017, the technical and economic barriers to large-scale human spaceflight, and the uncertainty about the future of the ISS and its possible successors, the probability that more than 13 people will be off Earth at midnight UTC on December 31, 2050, is low but not zero.

- **Modal outcome**: Fewer than 13 people off Earth, or possibly none if crewed spaceflight is temporarily paused.
- **Tail scenarios**: If commercial or governmental actors successfully establish large-scale outposts or space tourism ventures, the number could exceed 13, but this would require significant, sustained investment and progress not yet evident as of 2017.

**Estimated probability (subjective, given available information as of 2017-11-30):**
- Less than 20% chance of >13 people off Earth at the specified date/time.
