## Historical Trends and Current Status

- From 2020 to 2024, the US experienced two or more COVID-19 hospitalization wave peaks per respiratory season, as defined by the criteria provided—typically a pronounced winter wave and a smaller summer or early autumn wave. For example, the 2023–2024, 2022–2023, 2021–2022, and 2020–2021 seasons each featured two or more peaks by this methodology[1][2].
- COVID-19 differs from influenza and RSV, which generally display a single, well-defined winter peak. COVID-19 has demonstrated less predictability, with significant activity sometimes occurring outside of winter, including in summer months[2].

## Key Differences Affecting the Forecast

- **Seasonality**: Unlike influenza and RSV, COVID-19 has not yet settled into strict winter seasonality. CDC and expert commentary in mid-2024 acknowledge that while some seasonal pattern is emerging (with consistent winter peaks), meaningful off-season (e.g., summer) surges continue to occur, driven by waning immunity and new variant emergence[2].
- **Variant Evolution and Immunity**: The unpredictability of SARS-CoV-2 variants and the waning of immunity from both vaccination and prior infection remain the primary drivers of non-seasonal waves. These factors can cause surges outside the traditional respiratory virus season, a pattern seen repeatedly since 2020[2].
- **Healthcare and Reporting Environment**: Hospitals have improved care outcomes and safety, and national surveillance (e.g., RESP-NET) remains robust. However, any future changes in reporting standards or health system pressures could affect data completeness[2][5].

## Recent Announcements or Policies

- The CDC shifted from emergency response to endemic management, focusing on annual vaccination campaigns and targeted mitigation. No new restrictive policies or interventions are expected, though this could change if a novel, highly transmissible, or immune-evasive variant emerges[2].
- No major policy changes are anticipated that would reduce the likelihood of off-season waves in the near future.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- The main uncertainty is the potential for unpredictable variant emergence, which could drive waves outside of historical patterns[2].
- Measurement is currently robust, but future data completeness could be affected by changes in national surveillance priorities, especially if COVID-19 is increasingly grouped with other respiratory illnesses[2][5].

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the persistent pattern of multiple COVID-19 hospitalization waves per season, the lack of full convergence to single-peak winter seasonality, and continuing drivers of off-season waves (variant evolution, waning immunity), it is **more likely than not** (estimated probability: 70–85%) that at least one of the 2028 or 2029 respiratory seasons will feature two or more COVID-19 hospitalization wave peaks as defined.

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- CDC COVID Data Tracker and RESP-NET remain the authoritative sources for hospitalization data[1][2].
- Academic and public health analyses (e.g., CDC, Johns Hopkins, peer-reviewed studies) support the ongoing multi-peak pattern in the US and the unpredictability of future COVID-19 waves.
