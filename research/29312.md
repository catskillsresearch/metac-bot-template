## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- **Polling Averages (May–October 2024):**
  - In May 2024, Trump led Biden by 6 points in Arizona (49%-43%) and by 9 points in Georgia (50%-41%) among likely voters. When third-party candidates were included, Trump’s lead grew in Arizona and shrank slightly in Georgia[3].
  - By July 2024, Trump led Harris by 5 points in Arizona (49%-44%) and by 2 points in Georgia (48%-46%)[1].
  - In August 2024, Harris had pulled ahead in Arizona by 5 points, but Trump maintained a 4-point lead in Georgia[2].
  - In September 2024, Trump led Harris in Arizona by 5 points (50%-45%) and in Georgia by 4 points (49%-45%)[4].
  - An October 2024 Wall Street Journal poll found the race extremely close in battleground states, with little separation between Trump and Harris[5].

- **Voter Issues:**
  - The economy remains the top issue for voters in both states, with majorities preferring Trump to handle economic matters[3].
  - Abortion rights are also a significant factor, with most voters favoring legal access, but this issue appears to favor Democrats more broadly[3].

## Recent Announcements/Policies

- No major policy announcements or campaign events specific to Arizona or Georgia are cited in the search results that would fundamentally alter the race as of late October 2024.

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- New York Times/Siena College, Emerson College, and Wall Street Journal polls are cited as the main sources for recent polling data[1][2][3][4][5].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- **Polling Margins:** The margins in both states have narrowed over time, especially in Arizona, where some polls show Harris ahead as of August 2024[2]. Georgia appears to remain more favorable to Trump, but the lead is not insurmountable.
- **Volatility:** Swing state polling can be volatile, and late shifts are possible, especially with third-party candidates in the mix[3].
- **Turnout and Demographics:** Final outcomes will depend on turnout, demographic shifts, and any late-breaking events not captured in the polling as of October 2024.

## Summary

As of October 29, 2024, Donald Trump leads in most recent polls in both Arizona and Georgia, though the margins have narrowed, and some polls show Harris ahead in Arizona. Georgia appears more likely to go for Trump, while Arizona is a true toss-up. The race in both states is highly competitive, and while Trump is favored based on available polling, significant uncertainty remains.
