### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of October 23, 2024, Russian forces control the eastern Kanal neighborhood of Chasiv Yar, with the Siverskyi Donetsâ€“Donbas Canal now marking the front line. Ukrainian forces withdrew from this eastern sector in July 2024, but the remainder of the city remains under Ukrainian control and is heavily contested[5].
- Russian troops continue to outnumber Ukrainian defenders and maintain constant pressure through artillery, missile strikes, and air bombardments. However, Ukrainian sources report that the main defense line west of the canal has not been breached, and the city is not fully under Russian control[5].
- The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) reported on October 2 and October 4, 2024, that Russian forces were conducting offensive operations near Chasiv Yar but had not made any confirmed advances or changes to the frontline in this area[1][2].

### Recent Announcements and Policies

- There have been no major policy shifts or announcements indicating an imminent Ukrainian withdrawal or Russian breakthrough in Chasiv Yar as of late October 2024.
- Russian forces continue to prioritize the capture of Chasiv Yar due to its strategic importance, but progress has been incremental and costly[5].

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The ISW Ukraine Interactive War Map is the definitive source for control status at the specified coordinates and will be used for resolution on December 31, 2024.
- ISW daily campaign assessments and Ukrainian military statements provide the most up-to-date and reliable information on the frontline status[1][2][5].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- The frontline is fluid, and the situation could change rapidly due to ongoing Russian assaults and Ukrainian defensive operations.
- Russian numerical superiority and continued pressure could eventually lead to further advances, but as of October 24, 2024, there is no confirmed evidence of full Russian control of Chasiv Yar.
- All forecasts are subject to the availability and accuracy of open-source reporting and geolocated evidence.

**Summary:**  
As of October 24, 2024, Russia does not have full control of Chasiv Yar. The city is partially occupied (eastern Kanal neighborhood), but the main Ukrainian defense line west of the canal remains intact and contested. Russian forces continue to apply pressure, but no confirmed breakthrough has occurred. The outcome by December 31, 2024, will depend on the ability of Ukrainian forces to hold the line against ongoing Russian assaults and whether Russian forces can achieve a significant breakthrough in the coming months[1][2][5].
