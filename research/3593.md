# Forecasting Renewable Energy Contribution to Global Electricity in 2030

As of February 5, 2020, I'm analyzing whether renewable energy will contribute 25% or less to global electricity production in 2030. This analysis is based on historical trends and information available up to early 2020.

## Current Situation and Historical Trends

As of 2016, renewable energy contributed 22.66% to global electricity production according to World Bank data. This represents the most recent confirmed data point available as of early 2020 for this analysis. The historical progression of renewable energy in the global electricity mix has shown a gradual upward trend, though with varying growth rates across different regions.

The IPCC's P4 scenario (described as "resource- and energy-intensive") projects renewable energy contributing 25% or less to global electricity production by 2030. This scenario assumes widespread adoption of greenhouse-gas-intensive lifestyles and relies heavily on carbon dioxide removal technologies rather than renewable expansion.

## Factors Affecting the Forecast

Several key factors available as of early 2020 will influence whether renewables exceed the 25% threshold by 2030:

1. **Policy Environment**: Many countries had already established renewable energy targets as of 2020. However, implementation rates and policy strength varied significantly across regions.

2. **Economic Factors**: The continuing decline in renewable energy costs, particularly for solar and wind technologies, was already evident by early 2020. This economic trend favors increased renewable deployment.

3. **Regional Disparities**: As of 2020, China was already positioned as a major driver of renewable energy growth, with significant capacity additions planned.

4. **Technology Development**: Battery storage technology was improving as of 2020, which supports greater integration of variable renewable sources.

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on information available as of February 5, 2020, I assess that renewable energy will likely exceed 25% of global electricity production by 2030, making the answer to the forecasting question "No" with approximately 70% confidence.

This assessment is based on:

1. The relatively small gap between the 2016 level (22.66%) and the 25% threshold, requiring only modest growth over a 14-year period.

2. The accelerating deployment of renewable energy technologies observed in the years leading up to 2020, particularly solar and wind.

3. The declining cost curves for renewable technologies, which were already making renewables cost-competitive with fossil fuels in many markets by 2020.

However, several factors could still lead to the 25% threshold not being exceeded:

1. Insufficient policy support in key markets
2. Integration challenges for variable renewable energy sources
3. Continued heavy investment in fossil fuel infrastructure in developing economies
4. Economic downturns affecting clean energy investment

## Limitations and Uncertainties

This forecast faces several important limitations:

1. **Data Lag**: The most recent confirmed global data available as of early 2020 was from 2016, creating a significant information gap.

2. **Policy Uncertainty**: Future policy changes could significantly accelerate or hinder renewable deployment.

3. **Measurement Methodology**: Different organizations use varying methodologies to calculate renewable energy contribution, which creates comparison challenges.

4. **Global Events**: Unforeseen global events (such as major economic disruptions) could significantly impact energy investment patterns.
