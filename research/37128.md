## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The Diversity Visa (DV) program, which makes up to 50,000 immigrant visas available annually, remains operational and continues to process applications for the 2025 and 2026 cycles[1][2].
- President Trump has historically opposed the Diversity Visa program, seeking to restrict or eliminate it during his first term[3]. However, despite this opposition, no significant legislative or executive progress towards its cancellation was achieved previously[3].
- A significant Trump-era restriction—a “passport rule” requiring applicants to possess a valid passport at the lottery entry stage—was overturned by a federal court in 2022, reaffirming the program’s accessibility and legal standing[4].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- Upon returning to office in January 2025, President Trump issued executive orders focusing on “enhanced vetting” for visa applicants and suspending certain refugee programs[5]. These orders generally increase scrutiny for all visa categories but do not specifically mention or target the Diversity Visa program as of May 20, 2025[5].
- There is no evidence in authoritative legal or government sources of a new presidential action, order, or proclamation mentioning the “Diversity Visa” since Trump’s inauguration in January 2025.

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The White House’s official “Presidential Actions” page provides a comprehensive, real-time record of all executive orders and proclamations—this is the definitive source for resolving the question.
- The U.S. Department of State and USCIS websites confirm the ongoing operation of the DV program for 2025 and 2026[1][2].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- Presidential actions can be issued with little public forewarning.
- Trump’s well-established opposition to the Diversity Visa program introduces some baseline probability that he could take action, but the lack of any concrete movement or mention in current executive directives substantially lowers that likelihood in the next six weeks.
- Forecast is subject to change if new information emerges or if sudden political developments occur.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given:
- No current presidential action mentioning “Diversity Visa” as of May 20, 2025[5].
- No public reports or legal drafts suggesting imminent action.
- A continued pattern of general immigration restriction rather than targeted action against the Diversity Visa program.

**Assessment:**  
The probability that President Trump will issue a new presidential action mentioning the “Diversity Visa” before July 1, 2025, is **low (estimated <10%)** based on all currently available information.
