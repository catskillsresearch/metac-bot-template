### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- December in Chicago is typically cold, with average daily high temperatures decreasing from about 43°F at the start of the month to 34°F at the end[4].
- The average maximum temperature for December is approximately 36°F[5].
- Historically, it is rare for December high temperatures in Chicago to exceed 55°F[4].
- In December 2022, the highest high was 57°F, and in December 2023, it reached 60°F. These are outliers, as most years do not see highs near 60°F in December.

### Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The Iowa Environmental Mesonet (IEM) provides the official daily high temperature data for Chicago Midway Airport, which is the sole source for resolution[1].
- The National Weather Service and local climatological summaries also provide historical context and averages[2][4].

### Limitations or Uncertainties in Measurement

- The resolution depends exclusively on the IEM data calendar for Chicago Midway Airport; missing data coded as "MM" will not be considered.
- While climatological norms suggest it is unlikely for highs to reach or exceed 60°F, recent years (2022 and 2023) have shown that such warm spells, though rare, are possible.
- Weather is inherently variable, and long-range forecasts cannot rule out anomalous warm days.

### Summary

Based on historical data, it is uncommon for Chicago's December high temperatures to reach 60°F, with most years staying well below this threshold. However, recent years have seen isolated days approach or reach 60°F, introducing some uncertainty. The official resolution will rely on the IEM data for Chicago Midway Airport.
