# Will Noodles & Co. File for Bankruptcy Before April 1, 2025?

As of February 2025, Noodles & Company faces significant financial challenges that raise questions about its future viability. Below is an analysis of the available information that can help forecast whether the company will file for bankruptcy before April 1, 2025.

## Financial Performance and Current Status

Noodles & Company has been experiencing a concerning downward trend in its financial performance:

- The company reported a 3.3% drop in sales according to Q3 2024 earnings data[1]
- Net loss of $6.8 million in Q3 2024, compared to a net income of $0.7 million in Q3 2023[1]
- In Q1 2024, same-store sales declined 5.4% systemwide, with customer traffic down 7.3%[3]
- Q1 2024 revenues decreased by 3.7% to $121.4 million[3]
- Net loss deepened to $6.1 million in Q1 2024, compared with a loss of $3.1 million a year prior[3]

The company's stock performance has been particularly troubling:

- As of January 2025, Noodles & Company's stock price had dropped below $1 for 30 consecutive business days[5]
- This decline puts the company at risk of being delisted from the Nasdaq Global Select Market[5]
- The company has until June 23, 2025, to regain compliance by maintaining a stock price of at least $1 per share for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days[5]

## Bankruptcy Risk Indicators

Several factors suggest an elevated risk of bankruptcy:

- Based on financial disclosures available in 2023, Noodles & Company had a Probability of Bankruptcy of 39.0%[2]
- The company's debt position has fluctuated over the years, with net debt projected to decrease to $152.7M in 2024 from $297.4M in 2023[2]
- Total cash from operating activities has been inconsistent, with $27.5M in 2023 and a projected $21.0M in 2024[2]

## Recent Actions and Announcements

The company has taken several measures to address its financial challenges:

- Noodles & Company announced plans to close 15-20 restaurant locations in 2025[1]
- The company implemented layoffs in early 2024, particularly in "deprioritized" areas such as new unit openings[3]
- Management adjusted employee benefits to save money while attempting to remain competitive in the marketplace[3]
- These and other cuts were expected to save approximately $4 million, despite a $474,000 expense from severance and executive transition costs[3]
- The company is considering all options for regaining Nasdaq compliance, including potentially proposing a reverse stock split for stockholder approval[5]

## Strategic Direction

CEO Drew Madsen, who took the position in March 2024, has acknowledged challenges while expressing some optimism:

- He cited a "challenging consumer environment with a significant level of industry-wide promotional and discount activity" and "a marked and unexpected decline in third-party delivery sales"[1]
- Despite poor Q1 2024 results, Madsen indicated he saw "glimmers of hope"[3]
- The company is attempting to focus on new menu items and the Noodles app to turn things around[1]

## Analysis and Limitations

While the financial indicators show significant distress, several factors complicate the bankruptcy forecast:

1. The June 23, 2025 deadline for Nasdaq compliance falls after the April 1, 2025 date in question, giving the company some time to attempt recovery
2. The projected reduction in net debt for 2024 could provide some financial breathing room
3. The company still has options such as a reverse stock split, further store closures, or seeking additional financing
4. The fast-casual restaurant sector as a whole was projected to potentially have a strong 2025, which could provide industry tailwinds[4]

However, the consistent pattern of declining sales, deepening losses, and the stock price falling below the critical $1 threshold all point to serious financial distress that could lead to bankruptcy if not reversed quickly.
