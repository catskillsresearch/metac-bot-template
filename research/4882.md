### 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of July 2020, Reddit was ranked 20th globally by Alexa, reflecting its status as a mainstream social platform with millions of daily active users and broad global reach.
- The Reddit alternatives listed—Minds, Voat, Steemit, Papaly, Saidit, Notabug, Snapzu, and Ruqqus—were all niche platforms with much lower Alexa rankings, smaller communities, and less brand recognition.
- By 2025, Reddit remains the dominant site in its category. Saidit and Steemit (and its fork, Hive) continue to operate but have not achieved comparable scale or mainstream momentum[1][2][3][4][5].
- Voat, once considered a major "free speech" alternative, shut down in December 2020, further reducing the field of viable competitors.

### 2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- No major policy change or event has caused a large-scale user migration from Reddit to any single alternative. Some alternatives have attempted to differentiate with features like crypto rewards (Steemit, Hive) or decentralized moderation (Saidit), but these appeals have largely remained niche[3].
- Reddit has periodically updated its content moderation policies, but these have not resulted in a sustained, mass departure of users.

### 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Multiple technology and review sites in 2025 continue to list Reddit as the top platform, with alternatives far behind in both user numbers and engagement[1][2][3][4][5].
- Alexa Traffic Rank data (now discontinued) and other third-party analytics confirm this persistent gap.

### 4. Limitations or Uncertainties in Measurement

- Alexa Traffic Rank was discontinued in May 2022; thus, post-2022, precise Alexa-based comparisons are not possible. However, the overwhelming difference in scale as of 2020 and subsequent years, plus corroborating metrics from other sources, supports the forecast[1][2][3][4][5].
- Social media trends can change rapidly, but absent major disruptive events or innovations, the probability of a dramatic reversal is minimal.

### Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

**It is extremely unlikely (probability <1%) that any of the specified Reddit alternatives will be more popular than Reddit in January 2026, as measured by Alexa Traffic Rank (or equivalent web popularity metrics). The alternatives remain niche and have not demonstrated the growth, funding, or mainstream appeal necessary to surpass Reddit’s entrenched user base and brand.**
