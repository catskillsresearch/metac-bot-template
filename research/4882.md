### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- In July 2020, Reddit was ranked 20th in global internet traffic by Alexa, reflecting its vast user base and active communities.
- By 2025, Reddit continues to dominate the social news aggregation space. Its alternatives, such as SaidIt, Kbin, Minds, and others, are much smaller and cater to niche or specific ideological communities[1][2][5].
- SaidIt is noted for its free speech focus but remains a minor player, with a significantly smaller audience and content diversity compared to Reddit[2][5].
- Other alternatives like Minds, Steemit, Papaly, NotABug, Snapzu, and Ruqqus are either niche, have limited growth, or have not achieved mainstream traction[1][3][5].

### Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- There have been no major policy changes or platform collapses for Reddit or its alternatives that would cause a dramatic shift in traffic or user migration as of early 2025.
- Alexa Traffic Rank, the specified measurement tool, was discontinued in May 2022. However, other analytics consistently show Reddit far outpacing its alternatives in traffic and engagement.

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Reviews and rankings from 2025 consistently place Reddit far above its alternatives in terms of size, engagement, and diversity[1][2][3][5].
- SaidIt and Kbin, while notable, are explicitly described as having much smaller user bases and limited content compared to Reddit[2][5].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- The discontinuation of Alexa Traffic Rank in 2022 means direct measurement by this metric is no longer possible, though relative web traffic patterns are consistent across available analytics.
- Unknowns include potential shock events (e.g., major Reddit outages or scandals), but no evidence as of 2025 suggests such an event has occurred or is likely.

### Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the current trends, growth rates, and platform dynamics, the probability that any listed Reddit alternative will surpass Reddit in overall popularity by January 2026 (as measured by Alexa or any comparable traffic metric) is extremely low—well below 1%.
