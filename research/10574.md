## 1. Historical Trends and Current Status

- **Historical GWP Doubling Time**: As of 2018, global economic output doubled roughly every 16 years[1]. This reflects an average annual growth rate of about 4.5%.
- **Recent Growth Rates**: From 1980 to 2023, annual global GDP growth has generally fluctuated between 2% and 5%, with rare exceptions during crises like the 2009 recession and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic[2]. Current projections (as of 2024) expect global GDP growth rates to stabilize around 3% annually through 2029[2].
- **Recent Data**: In 2022, real global GDP grew by 2.1%, compared to 5.9% in 2021 (the latter rebounding from pandemic lows)[5].

## 2. Recent Announcements and Policies

- **No Announced Step Changes**: As of April 2022, there have been no policies or breakthroughs announced that credibly forecast a shift to the sustained 9% or 41% annual growth rates required for 8-year or 2-year doublings, respectively.
- **AI Acceleration Debate**: While transformative AI is widely discussed as a potential driver of explosive growth, concrete evidence of its imminent economic impact at such a scale remains lacking as of 2022. Paul Christiano and others have developed frameworks to assess AI-driven "takeoff" speeds, but these remain speculative[1].

## 3. Key Reference Case Comparison

| Scenario              | Required Annual Growth Rate | Historical Precedent     | Current Outlook (2022)  |
|-----------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------|
| 8-year doubling       | ~9%                        | No modern precedent      | Highly unlikely soon    |
| 2-year doubling       | ~41%                       | Unprecedented            | No evidence of onset    |

The world has never seen annual GDP growth rates near 41%—not even during postwar booms or major technological revolutions. An 8-year doubling would itself be unprecedented and likely require a radical technological disruption, but a 2-year doubling would demand a much more extreme and sudden transformation[2][3].

## 4. Factors Affecting the Forecast

- **Technological Acceleration**: The main wildcard is the speed and scale of AI deployment. If transformative AI emerges rapidly, it could drive growth much faster than historical norms. However, the likelihood of skipping directly from the current regime to a 2-year doubling without first passing through an 8-year doubling regime is extremely low, absent clear evidence of a singularity-like "hard takeoff."
- **Measurement and Data Limitations**: Gross world product is measured annually, which could slightly obscure fast transitions, but not enough to miss the difference between an 8-year and 2-year doubling[1].
- **Policy and Geopolitical Risks**: Global crises can disrupt growth, making sustained ultra-high rates even less likely.

## 5. Probabilistic Assessment

Given all available evidence as of 2022:
- The probability that GWP will first double in an 8-year period before any 2-year doubling is extremely high.
- The historical pattern and current expert consensus both support a "slow(er) takeoff" scenario, where economic acceleration—if it happens—would pass through intermediate doubling periods before reaching extreme growth rates.

## 6. Uncertainties

- **AI Development Timeline**: Predicting the pace of AI-driven acceleration remains speculative.
- **Potential for Black Swan Events**: Unforeseen technological or geopolitical shocks could disrupt the expected pattern, but these are by nature unpredictable.

> In summary: As of 2022, all available data and expert analysis point toward an 8-year GWP doubling (if it occurs) completing before a 2-year doubling, with the latter being unprecedented and extremely unlikely to occur first.
