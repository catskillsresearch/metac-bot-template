# Forecast Analysis: Donald Trump's Net Trade Approval by June 25, 2025

As of May 28, 2025, I've analyzed the available data to forecast President Trump's net approval rating on trade issues for the Silver Bulletin tracker by June 25, 2025.

## Current Status and Historical Trends

President Trump's approval ratings have shown significant fluctuation during his second term. As of late April 2025, his approval rating on tariffs (the primary trade policy measure) stood at 39% approval versus 59% disapproval, resulting in a net approval rating of -20% on trade-related issues[2]. This negative sentiment followed his April 2nd announcement of sweeping new tariffs on nearly all U.S. trading partners, which triggered several days of volatility in U.S. and global stock markets[2].

More recently, Trump's overall approval rating has shown improvement. According to a Rasmussen Reports poll released on May 27, 2025, 50% of likely voters now approve of President Trump's job performance overall, with disapproval at 45%[4]. This represents a significant improvement from his 40% overall approval rating reported in late April[2].

## Recent Policy Developments Affecting Trade Approval

Several recent developments may influence Trump's trade approval rating before the June 25 measurement:

1. **Selective Tariff Implementation**: On April 9, 2025, Trump paused tariffs on most countries but maintained and increased rates specifically on China[2]. This more targeted approach may have mitigated some of the initial negative reaction to the broader tariff announcement.

2. **UK Trade Deal**: The administration recently secured a trade deal with the United Kingdom that aims to create "a level playing field for American exporters"[4]. This positive trade development could improve public perception of Trump's trade policies.

3. **General Economic Sentiment**: Political and economic indicators remained steady throughout May 2025 according to Gallup polling[1], suggesting no major economic disruptions that would negatively impact trade sentiment.

## Forecast Assessment

Based on the available data, I project the following probabilities for Donald Trump's net trade approval by June 25, 2025:

- **<-20.0%**: 15% probability
- **≥-20.0% and ≤-14.0%**: 35% probability
- **>-14.0% and <-8.0%**: 40% probability
- **≥-8.0%**: 10% probability

### Rationale:

The recent UK trade deal represents a positive development that could improve Trump's trade approval ratings[4]. Additionally, his selective approach to tariffs (focusing primarily on China rather than global implementation) may have reduced some of the initial negative sentiment[2].

The overall improvement in Trump's general approval rating (from 40% in April to 50% in late May)[2][4] suggests a general positive trend that could extend to issue-specific ratings, including trade. However, trade policy has historically been a contentious issue, and the -20% net approval on tariffs reported in April represents a significant deficit to overcome in a relatively short timeframe.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors limit the precision of this forecast:

1. The search results do not provide specific information about the Silver Bulletin methodology or its historical tracking of Trump's trade approval.

2. There is limited data on how quickly public opinion on trade issues responds to policy changes like the UK trade deal.

3. The April tariff data is already over a month old, and no more recent trade-specific approval ratings are available in the search results.

4. External events between now and June 25 (such as trade disputes, market reactions, or international developments) could significantly impact public opinion.

Given the recent positive developments in Trump's overall approval and specific trade achievements like the UK deal, I expect his trade approval to improve from the April lows but likely remain in negative territory by June 25, 2025.
