## Key Factual Information for Forecasting

**1. Historical Trends and Current Status**
- As of November 8, 2024, the total US oil and gas rig count was 585, unchanged for three consecutive weeks[4][2].
- The oil rig count was 479, and the gas rig count was 102[4][2].
- The total rig count is 31 rigs (5%) lower than the same period in 2023, continuing a downward trend from the previous year[4].
- The rig count dropped about 20% in 2023, after rising by 33% in 2022 and 67% in 2021. The decline is attributed to lower oil and gas prices, higher operational costs, and a shift in company priorities toward debt reduction and shareholder returns[4].

**2. Recent Announcements and Policies**
- There have been no major policy changes or industry announcements as of early November 2024 that would likely reverse the current trend of flat or declining rig counts[4].
- US energy firms have maintained a steady rig count, with no increases for a record three weeks, indicating a cautious approach to new drilling activity[4].

**3. Authoritative Sources for Verification**
- The Baker Hughes North American Rotary Rig Count is the definitive source for active US drilling rigs, available directly from Baker Hughes and YCharts[1][2][3].

**4. Limitations and Uncertainties**
- The rig count is subject to weekly fluctuations due to operational, economic, or weather-related factors.
- The count includes oil, gas, and miscellaneous rigs, so changes in any category can affect the total.
- While the trend is flat to slightly downward, the proximity to the 585 threshold means even minor changes could determine the outcome.

## Summary Table: Recent US Rig Counts

| Date           | Total Rigs | Oil Rigs | Gas Rigs |
|----------------|------------|----------|----------|
| Nov 8, 2024    | 585        | 479      | 102      |
| Nov 1, 2024    | 585        | 479      | 102      |
| Oct 25, 2024   | 585        | 479      | 102      |

## Conclusion

- The number of active US oil drilling rigs as of November 8, 2024, is exactly 585, with a stable trend over the preceding weeks.
- The overall trajectory in 2024 has been flat to slightly downward, with no major drivers for a near-term increase.
- Given the recent pattern and industry context, there is a reasonable likelihood that the rig count could fall below 585 by November 29, 2024, but the outcome is sensitive to small week-to-week changes.
