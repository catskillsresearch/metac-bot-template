# Forecasting a Potential Attack on the Crimean Bridge Before January 1, 2025

Based on available information as of November 2024, here's an analysis of factors relevant to forecasting whether the Crimean Bridge will be hit with an attack before January 1, 2025.

## Historical Attack Pattern

The Crimean Bridge has been a high-priority target for Ukraine since Russia's invasion:

- The bridge was first successfully attacked in October 2022, causing sections to collapse before Russia restored it[3]
- A second successful attack occurred in July 2023 using naval drones, which caused "significant damage"[3]
- In August 2024, Russia claimed to have repelled an attack involving 12 US-made missiles targeting the bridge[2]

This pattern demonstrates Ukraine's persistent interest in targeting this strategic infrastructure despite increasing Russian defensive measures.

## Ukrainian Strategic Intent

Ukrainian military intelligence has explicitly stated intentions to attack the bridge:

- In April 2024, a high-ranking Ukrainian military intelligence official stated that Ukraine planned to blow up the bridge connecting Russia to Crimea by the first half of 2024[3]
- The official indicated that the Ukrainian military "already has most of the means needed to carry out the planned attack"[3]
- Ukrainian officials have described the destruction of the bridge as "inevitable" and symbolically important, calling it "the symbol of Russian occupation in Crimea"[3]

While the first half of 2024 has passed without a confirmed successful attack, Ukraine's strategic interest in targeting the bridge appears to remain.

## Russian Defensive Measures

Russia has significantly enhanced protection of the bridge:

- Russia has been rushing to complete "huge new defenses" of the Crimean bridge[1]
- Following previous attacks, Russian forces installed special underwater barriers to protect against aerial and underwater sabotage[3]
- The number of barges to protect the bridge from Ukrainian naval drones has increased[5]
- Russia has reportedly deployed more troops to defend what analysts call an "obvious target"[3]
- As of July 2024, Russia was observed reinforcing the bridge with additional construction, including floating construction cranes in the Kerch Strait[5]

These extensive defensive measures indicate Russia's assessment that the bridge remains a high-priority target requiring significant protection.

## Strategic Value Assessment

The current strategic value of the bridge may have evolved:

- According to Ukraine's Navy, destroying the Kerch Bridge now "would not have the same effect" because Russia "barely uses it for military purposes anymore"[5]
- Russia has developed alternative supply routes, including a railroad between Russia's port city Rostov-on-Don and occupied Crimea[5]
- However, the head of Ukraine's Security Service (SBU) did not rule out that Russia may try to use the structure for weapons supplies again after it is fully restored[5]

This suggests a potential shift in the strategic calculus regarding the bridge's military significance, though its symbolic importance remains.

## Legal and Diplomatic Dimensions

Beyond military actions, Ukraine is pursuing legal channels:

- In October 2024, Ukraine called for the dismantling of Russia's Crimean bridge in an international tribunal at The Hague[4]
- Ukraine urged the tribunal to order Russia to dismantle the Kerch bridge, restore free navigation in the Kerch Strait, and conduct an environmental impact assessment[4]

This parallel legal approach suggests Ukraine is pursuing multiple strategies regarding the bridge.

## Assessment Limitations

Several factors limit the ability to forecast with certainty:

- Ukraine's military operations are typically not announced in advance for operational security
- Previous Ukrainian statements about timeframes for attacking the bridge have not always aligned with actual attack timing
- Russian defensive capabilities continue to evolve, potentially affecting the feasibility of successful attacks
- The strategic priority of the bridge relative to other targets may shift based on battlefield developments

## Conclusion

While Ukraine has explicitly stated intentions to target the bridge and has demonstrated both capability and determination through previous attacks, Russia has significantly enhanced defensive measures. The strategic value of the bridge may have diminished somewhat, but its symbolic importance remains high. The combination of these factors suggests continued risk of attempted attacks, though successful strikes face increasing challenges due to Russian countermeasures.
