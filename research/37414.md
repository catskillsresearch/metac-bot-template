# Forecasting DOGE's Claimed Savings by July 1, 2025

As a forecasting analyst examining whether the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) will claim savings of $200 billion or more by July 1, 2025, I've analyzed the available data and identified several key indicators.

## Current Status and Historical Trends

As of May 26, 2025 (the most recent update), DOGE claims total estimated savings of $175 billion[1]. This represents significant growth from the $160 billion reported as of April 23, 2025[2][4]. The growth rate shows approximately $15 billion in additional claimed savings over a 33-day period.

The breakdown of current claimed savings includes:
- Contract terminations: ~$32 billion
- Grant terminations: ~$40 billion
- Lease terminations: ~$216 million
- Other categories including "asset sales, fraud and improper payment deletion, interest savings, programmatic changes, regulatory savings, and workforce reductions"[1]

DOGE calculates this as $1,086.96 in savings per taxpayer, based on an estimated 161 million individual federal taxpayers[1].

## Recent Developments Affecting Forecast

Several factors may influence whether DOGE reaches the $200 billion threshold:

1. **Update Frequency**: DOGE states that updates are currently weekly, with plans to eventually converge to real-time reporting[1]. This suggests regular additions to the savings total.

2. **Incomplete Reporting**: The website explicitly states that the displayed contract, grant, and lease cancellations represent only "~30% of total savings"[1], indicating substantial additional savings may be added before July 1.

3. **Counterbalancing Analysis**: A nonpartisan analysis by The Partnership for Public Service estimates that DOGE's actions will cost approximately $135 billion this fiscal year due to paid leave for tens of thousands of employees, rehiring costs, and lost productivity[4]. While this doesn't directly affect DOGE's claimed savings, it represents a significant critique of the net benefit.

4. **Implementation Timeline**: DOGE was established in February 2025 through presidential action[3], making it a relatively new initiative still building momentum.

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on the available data, I estimate:

- **Trend-based projection**: At the current growth rate (~$15B over 33 days), DOGE would add approximately $16-17B more by July 1, reaching $191-192B.

- **Acceleration factors**: The incomplete reporting (only 30% documented) and weekly updates suggest potential for accelerated reporting as more data is processed.

- **Deceleration factors**: Initial "easy wins" may have been captured already, potentially slowing the rate of new savings identified.

Given these considerations, I assess a **65-70% probability** that DOGE will claim $200 billion or more in savings by July 1, 2025. The primary driver of this assessment is the current trajectory combined with the explicit statement that 70% of savings remain to be fully documented on the website.

## Verification Sources and Measurement Limitations

The authoritative source for verification is the official DOGE website (doge.gov/savings), which is explicitly mentioned in the resolution criteria[1]. However, several limitations should be noted:

1. **Self-reported data**: The savings are self-reported by the agency without independent verification.

2. **Methodology questions**: The website notes there may be "discrepencies between FPDS/USAspending and the posted numbers"[1].

3. **Net vs. gross savings**: The claimed savings do not account for implementation costs or negative economic impacts, as highlighted by the Partnership for Public Service analysis[4].

4. **Reporting lag**: The website acknowledges a potential "1 month lag" in posting contract termination notices[1], which could affect the timing of when savings are claimed.
