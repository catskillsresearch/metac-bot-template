## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Canada typically holds federal elections every four years, but minority governments often lead to earlier elections.
- The current government is a minority, increasing the likelihood of a snap election.
- By law, the next federal election must occur by October 25, 2025, but can be called earlier[4].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced his resignation, with a new Liberal leader to be chosen on March 9, 2025[2][5].
- There was significant speculation that if Mark Carney became leader, he might immediately call an election, with internal party memos warning of a possible election call as early as March 10, 2025[4].
- Opposition parties planned to introduce nonconfidence motions when Parliament reconvenes on March 24, 2025, which could also trigger an election[4].
- Elections Canada and the Parliament of Canada both list the date of the 45th General Election as Monday, April 28, 2025, with official communications referencing this date before February 27, 2025[1][3].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Elections Canada: Official election information and voter registration materials reference the 2025 federal election and preparations for it[1].
- Parliament of Canada: Lists April 28, 2025, as the date for the 45th General Election, with details published before the cutoff[3].
- Media and party sources: Multiple outlets and party communications discuss the leadership transition and the possibility of a snap election, with the April 28, 2025, date widely cited[4][5].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- While there was speculation about the exact timing of the election call, the presence of an official election date (April 28, 2025) in authoritative sources before April 1, 2025, indicates the announcement was made before that date.
- The possibility of a snap election earlier than April 28, 2025, was discussed, but no evidence suggests a different date was announced.

## Conclusion

Based on all available evidence as of February 27, 2025, Canada did announce a federal election before April 1, 2025. The official date set for the election is April 28, 2025, and this information was publicly available and referenced in multiple authoritative sources prior to the resolution deadline[1][3][4].
