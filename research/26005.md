### Key Factual Information Relevant to the Forecast

- **Recent 538 National Polling Averages:**  
  As of July 5, 2024, Donald Trump led Joe Biden by 2.4 percentage points in FiveThirtyEight's national polling average, up from a 0.2-point lead on June 27, the day of the first debate[1]. This represents a significant post-debate increase in Trump's lead.

- **Trend Direction:**  
  The trend since the debate has been a widening Trump lead. The increase from +0.2 to +2.4 points in just over a week suggests momentum in Trump's favor, likely due to negative perceptions of Biden's debate performance[1].

- **Political Fallout and Campaign Response:**  
  Biden's debate performance was widely criticized, leading to calls for him to drop out from prominent media and some Democratic lawmakers. The Biden campaign has taken steps to address these concerns, but as of July 9, there is no evidence these efforts have reversed the polling trend[1].

- **Polling Average Volatility:**  
  While polling averages can shift quickly after major events, they tend to smooth out daily fluctuations. A further increase of 0.6 to 1.6 points in Trump's lead over the next week would be required for the lead to fall between 3 and 4 points by July 15. Such a shift is plausible but not guaranteed, given the current trajectory and absence of major countervailing events[1].

- **Limitations and Uncertainties:**  
  - Polling averages are subject to lag and may not immediately reflect rapid changes in public opinion.
  - New polls released between July 9 and July 15 could influence the average.
  - Unexpected political developments could alter the trajectory.
  - The Democratic National Convention is not until August, so major party realignment is unlikely to affect the July 15 average.

### Authoritative Source for Verification

- The definitive metric for this question is FiveThirtyEight's national polling average for the 2024 presidential election, as displayed on their official website for July 15, 2024[1].

### Summary Table

| Date         | 538 National Polling Lead (Trump over Biden) |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------|
| June 27, 2024| +0.2 points                                 |
| July 5, 2024 | +2.4 points                                 |
| July 9, 2024 | (Trend: increasing, but exact value not specified) |

### Conclusion

As of July 9, 2024, Trump's lead in the 538 national polling average is trending upward but has not yet reached the 3â€“4 point range. If the current trend continues, it is plausible that Trump's lead could fall within this range by July 15, but this is not certain and depends on the pace of polling shifts and any intervening events. The most authoritative and up-to-date figure will be available on FiveThirtyEight's website for July 15, 2024[1].
