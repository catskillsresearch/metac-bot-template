## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- China's CO2 emissions have grown rapidly over recent decades, making it the world's largest emitter. In 2019, emissions reached 9.44 billion tons, well above the US and EU[1].
- After a brief COVID-19 dip, emissions rebounded sharply, reaching record highs in 2023 (estimated 14.9 GtCO₂e, excl. LULUCF), primarily due to increased coal and oil use and weaker hydropower generation[1].
- However, by 2024–2025, emissions began to show a steady decline, with a 1% year-on-year drop in the first quarter of 2025[2][3].

## 2. Recent Announcements and Policies

- China has officially committed to peaking CO2 emissions before 2030 and achieving carbon neutrality before 2060[1].
- Rapid growth in renewable energy deployment and a slowdown in new coal plant approvals have shifted expert forecasts towards an earlier emissions peak[1][4].
- As of late 2023 and early 2024, expert surveys and scenario analyses suggest that emissions are likely to peak before 2025 and then decline slightly or plateau through the decade[1][4].

## 3. Authoritative Projections and Expert Assessments

- The Climate Action Tracker's conservative scenario expects China's emissions to peak before 2025, followed by a modest 0.5% annual decline through 2030[1].
- In 2024, 44% of surveyed experts believed China's emissions had already peaked or would peak by 2025, a significant increase from previous years[4].
- Independent analyses show emissions falling throughout 2024 and into early 2025[2][3].
- A peer-reviewed study from 2022 suggested a possible peak as early as 2023 under baseline scenarios, though industrial expansion could delay this to 2028[5].

## 4. Key Differences From Previous Reference Cases

- Previous forecasts centered on a peak "around 2030" with slower renewable adoption. The current situation features:
  - Accelerated renewable energy roll-out and electrification
  - A marked reduction in new coal projects
  - Shifts in expert and institutional expectations towards an earlier peak[1][4]
- Economic volatility, hydropower shortfalls, and the pace of coal retirement introduce some downside risk[1][4].
- Measurements focus on consumption-based emissions, in line with the Metaculus resolution criteria.

## 5. Limitations and Uncertainties

- The exact peak year is sensitive to short-term economic growth, industrial cycles, and energy demand fluctuations.
- Data reporting and revisions (especially for consumption-based emissions) may introduce lags or uncertainties.
- Unexpected policy reversals or large-scale economic stimulus relying on fossil fuels could slow the transition[1][4].

## 6. Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the weight of recent data and expert opinion as of 2022–2025, there is a strong likelihood that China's CO2 emissions will peak before 2030—most plausibly before 2025. The probability of a pre-2030 peak is now very high, likely in the range of 85–95%, barring major economic or policy reversals[1][3][4].
