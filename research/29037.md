### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of 2023 and 2024, quantum computing services—including IBM’s—remain expensive, with high per-minute costs for pay-as-you-go access. The industry is still in a research and development phase, and prices reflect the cost of maintaining and operating advanced quantum hardware[1].
- Industry experts predict that quantum computing costs will decrease over time as technology matures, competition increases, and hardware becomes more scalable and efficient. However, these reductions are expected to be gradual and are not guaranteed to occur on a specific timeline[1][3].

### Recent Announcements and Policies

- IBM’s September 26, 2024, press release announced the expansion of its quantum data center in Poughkeepsie, New York. The expansion aims to advance algorithm discovery and increase global access to quantum computing resources. While increased capacity could eventually lead to lower prices, the announcement does not specify any immediate changes to pricing for pay-as-you-go quantum computing[4].
- IBM’s 2024 and 2025 roadmaps focus on scaling quantum processors and integrating new technologies, such as multi-chip processors and quantum communication links. These advances are intended to improve performance and accessibility, which could influence pricing in the future, but no direct price reductions have been announced as of October 22, 2024[2][4].

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The only source that will be used for resolution is IBM’s official quantum pricing page: https://www.ibm.com/quantum/pricing. The question will resolve based on whether the posted “starting at” price for Pay-as-you-go quantum computing is less than $96 USD per minute as of January 1, 2025.

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- There is no public announcement or evidence as of October 22, 2024, that IBM will lower its Pay-as-you-go quantum computing prices before January 1, 2025.
- Industry trends suggest a long-term decrease in quantum computing costs, but the timing and magnitude of such reductions are uncertain and depend on technological, market, and competitive factors[1][3].
- The resolution is strictly tied to the price listed on IBM’s pricing page on the specified date, regardless of any other announcements or market trends.

> In summary, while IBM’s expansion and roadmap suggest a trajectory toward greater accessibility and potential cost reductions, there is no factual information available as of October 22, 2024, confirming that IBM will lower its Pay-as-you-go quantum computing prices before January 1, 2025.
