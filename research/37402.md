## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The pace of FDIC-insured bank failures has slowed markedly: 5 failures in 2023, 2 in 2024, and only 1 so far in 2025 (Pulaski Savings Bank, Chicago)[1][5].
- The rate of failures in Q2 2025 matches 2024, indicating stabilization in the sector[5].
- The FDICâ€™s Problem Bank List was updated to 63 institutions by Q1 2024, up from prior years, signaling underlying stress even if not immediately translating to failures[3].
- Q1 2025 financials for banks were robust, buoyed by cost-cutting and trading gains, not by broad credit deterioration[3][4].

## 2. Recent Announcements or Policies

- No major regulatory or macroeconomic shocks have been reported that would dramatically increase near-term failures.
- The FDIC and banking sector commentaries emphasize stabilization, even as branch closures remain high (336 in 2025 as of early May)[5].
- Ongoing economic uncertainties and some contradictory economic indicators (e.g., slowing manufacturing vs. expanding services) are noted but have not yet translated into higher failure rates[3].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The official FDIC Failed Bank List provides real-time updates on closures[2].
- Recent industry analyses from Bankrate, Luckbox Magazine, and FDIC Quarterly back up current trends and problem bank counts[3][4][5].

## 4. Limitations or Uncertainties

- While only one bank has failed in 2025 as of May 30, the elevated problem bank count (63) introduces some tail risk that a cluster of failures could occur if adverse events materialize in June[3].
- Economic conditions remain uncertain, and the high number of problem banks means the environment could change quickly, but no current data suggest an imminent wave of failures by end of Q2[3][5].
- Measurement is reliable, as the FDIC official list is updated promptly with each failure[2].

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given historical trends, improved sector stability, and no failures in Q2 2025 as of May 30, the most probable outcome is that the number of banks added to the FDIC Failed Bank List for Q2 2025 will be:

**Exactly 0 or Exactly 1.**

- "Exactly 0" is most likely if no failures occur in June.
- "Exactly 1" is possible if a new failure occurs before July 1, 2025, but with only one failure year-to-date and no new warnings, the probability of additional failures is low.
- "2-3" or higher is unlikely unless a sudden economic or sectoral shock emerges in the final month of Q2.

**Best estimate:** "Exactly 0" for Q2 2025, with "Exactly 1" as a secondary possibility if a failure occurs in June.
