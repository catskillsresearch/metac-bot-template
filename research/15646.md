## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- **1933 Gold Confiscation Reference Case**: Executive Order 6102, issued by President Roosevelt in 1933, forced private citizens to surrender most forms of gold to the government to address monetary constraints under the gold standard during the Great Depression. Non-compliance carried severe penalties. Some exemptions existed for rare collectible coins and small holdings[3][5].

- **Current Legal Status**: As of 2024, private ownership of gold is fully legal in the United States, and there are no federal laws or executive orders mandating gold confiscation. Executive Orders 6102 and 6260 were revoked in 1974 (Executive Order No. 11825), removing any standing legal basis for gold confiscation[1][5].

## 2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- **State-Level Trends**: Recent years have seen a movement in several U.S. states to reaffirm gold and silver as legal tender and to protect private precious metal holdings. For example, a 2023 Missouri bill proposed explicit prohibitions against state agencies seizing physical gold holdings, a direct response to historical fears of government confiscation[2].

- **No Federal Confiscation Proposals**: There have been no credible federal proposals or actions aimed at reintroducing gold confiscation. The trend at the federal level has been toward maintaining the legality of private gold ownership[1][5].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Multiple reputable sources confirm that all executive orders mandating gold confiscation have been repealed and that owning gold is legal[1][5].
- State-level legislative activity has been in the direction of protecting, not restricting, gold ownership[2].

## 4. Limitations or Uncertainties in Measurement

- **Government Power**: Legally, the U.S. government retains the authority to seize private property under specific conditions (e.g., eminent domain or wartime measures), provided "just compensation" is given[4][5]. However, such actions would require new legislation or executive orders targeting gold, which currently do not exist.

- **Extreme Scenarios**: In the event of extreme, unforeseen national emergencies or radical shifts in monetary policy, a change in stance cannot be entirely ruled out. Such scenarios, however, are not currently supported by any legislative or policy signals.

## Key Differences Affecting the Forecast

- The U.S. no longer operates under a gold standard, removing the original monetary rationale for confiscation.
- Political and public attitudes toward private property rights have shifted, and state legislatures are increasingly moving to protect gold ownership[2].
- Federal policy and legal frameworks currently support, rather than restrict, private gold ownership[1][5].

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the above evidence, the probability that the United States will enact a law or executive order confiscating privately owned gold collections before 2035 is **very low**. Barring an unprecedented national crisis or drastic policy shift, the legal, economic, and political climate as of April 2023 is not conducive to such an action.
