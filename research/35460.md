# Forecasting Milei's Impeachment Prospects: Analysis of Available Information

As of February 2025, Argentina is experiencing political turmoil following President Javier Milei's promotion of the $LIBRA cryptocurrency, which subsequently crashed dramatically. This analysis examines the factual information available to help forecast whether the Chamber of Deputies will impeach President Milei before April 1, 2025.

## The $LIBRA Scandal

In mid-February 2025, President Javier Milei promoted a cryptocurrency called $LIBRA on his social media accounts. Shortly after his endorsement, the token's value plummeted dramatically, causing significant financial losses to investors:

- The token crashed from a market capitalization of over $4.4 billion to less than $300 million in just three days[3]
- Approximately $100 million in profits were allegedly taken by insiders before the collapse[3]
- President Milei deleted his original post about $LIBRA, claiming he "was not aware of the details"[3]

The President's Office issued a statement asserting that Milei was not involved in developing the cryptocurrency and deleted his post only to avoid speculation and further attention[1]. The statement added that Milei decided to involve the Anti-Corruption Office and create a Research Task Unit to investigate the financial activities of $LIBRA[1].

## Impeachment Proceedings Initiated

In response to the scandal, opposition lawmakers have taken formal steps toward impeachment:

- Argentina's political opposition called for President Milei to face an impeachment trial in the Chamber of Deputies on February 16, 2025[1]
- Esteban Paul√≥n, a member of the Chamber of Deputies, along with two other lawmakers, submitted a written request alleging that Milei has "displayed poor performance and potential crimes committed in the exercise of his duties"[1]
- Initial impeachment proceedings had started in the Chamber of Deputies as of February 19, 2025[3]

## Constitutional Framework for Impeachment

Argentina's impeachment process follows specific constitutional guidelines:

- According to Article 53 of Argentina's Constitution, the Chamber of Deputies has the right to bring charges against the president in cases of "alleged poor performance, committing an offense in carrying out their duties, or for common crimes"[1]
- Two-thirds of the Chamber members must agree to bring charges against the president[1]
- The impeachment process requires successive voting in both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies[2]

## Procedural Challenges

There are significant procedural hurdles that could affect the timeline and outcome of any impeachment effort:

- The impeachment commission, which is responsible for handling impeachment requests, currently doesn't have a president (chair)[4]
- The commission has yet to meet in 2024 (and presumably early 2025)[4]
- When functioning normally, this commission deliberates on whether impeachment requests are valid, can start an investigation, summon witnesses, and issue a judgment[4]
- The last time the commission handled an impeachment request in-depth was in 2015, and they last ousted a public official in 2003[4]

## Political Context and Likelihood Assessment

Several factors will influence whether impeachment proceeds to a full vote before April 1, 2025:

- The commission's composition includes 13 UxP deputies, four LLA deputies, and five PRO deputies[4]
- Even if impeachment proceedings begin, they may ultimately stall due to the requirement for supermajority votes in both legislative houses[3]
- The political capital involved in handling impeachment requests has led to intense infighting within the ruling party earlier in the year[4]
- Charles Hoskinson, co-founder of Ethereum, alleged that organizers of a tech forum where Milei met KIP Protocol representatives had solicited payments in exchange for access to the president, potentially complicating the case[5]

## Historical Precedent

Impeachment in Argentina is rare:

- The last time the impeachment commission handled a request in-depth was in 2015[4]
- The last successful removal of a public official through impeachment occurred in 2003[4]

## Conclusion

While impeachment proceedings have been initiated against President Milei, several factors make it uncertain whether the Chamber of Deputies will complete the impeachment process with the required two-thirds majority vote before April 1, 2025. The current lack of leadership in the impeachment commission presents a procedural obstacle, and the historical rarity of successful impeachments in Argentina suggests that the process typically moves slowly. However, the severity of the allegations and the financial impact of the $LIBRA crash could potentially accelerate the process.
