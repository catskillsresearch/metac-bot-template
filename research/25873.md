### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The Sahm Rule Recession Indicator signals a recession when the three-month moving average of the national unemployment rate (U3) rises by 0.50 percentage points or more relative to its 12-month minimum[1][2].
- As of late 2023, the indicator was close to being triggered, with the unemployment rate about 0.3 percentage points below the threshold[5].
- Labor market data showed some softening: initial and continuing unemployment claims were rising year-over-year, but overall unemployment remained low and non-farm payrolls were holding up[5].
- The US economy in 2023 was resilient, with robust growth and moderating inflation, but headwinds such as exhausted household savings and tighter credit conditions were expected to slow growth in 2024[3].

### Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Metric

- Economic forecasts for 2024 were mixed. Some analysts expected below-trend growth or a mild recession in the second half of 2024, which could push the unemployment rate higher and potentially trigger the Sahm Rule[3][5].
- The Federal Reserve's stance in early 2024 was more dovish, with the possibility of pre-emptive easing if economic weakness appeared, which could mitigate a sharp rise in unemployment[3].
- No major policy changes directly affecting the unemployment rate were reported as of July 2024.

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The official value of the Real-time Sahm Rule Recession Indicator is published by the St. Louis Fed on FRED[1][2].
- Economic forecasts and labor market analysis are available from institutional research and financial analysts[3][5].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- The Sahm Rule is based on real-time, not revised, unemployment data; only the first published value for August 2024 will be used for resolution[1].
- Economic models predicting recession risk can be overconfident and may not fully account for sectoral differences or unexpected shocks[5].
- Some experts, including the rule's creator, have cautioned that the Sahm Rule could give a false signal if economic growth remains strong despite a modest rise in unemployment[5].

### Summary

As of July 8, 2024, the Real-time Sahm Rule Recession Indicator was close to being triggered but had not yet crossed the 0.5 percentage point threshold. Economic conditions were softening, and some forecasts anticipated a mild recession in the second half of 2024, which could cause the indicator to rise. However, the labor market remained resilient, and there was no definitive evidence that the indicator would increase year-over-year for August 2024. The outcome remains uncertain and will depend on labor market developments in the coming months.
