# Forecasting World Normality Through 2024: Analysis of Critical Metrics

Based on available information as of November 2024, I'll analyze the likelihood of the world remaining "normal" through the end of 2024 according to the specified criteria.

## Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) Development

The development of AGI represents one of the most actively discussed potential world-changing events. Current evidence suggests:

- As of late 2024, despite significant advancements in AI capabilities, true AGI has not yet been achieved or publicly announced[1][2].

- OpenAI announced in mid-2024 a plan to achieve AGI within five years, suggesting their internal timeline places AGI development around 2029, not before January 2025[3].

- The recently revealed OpenAI o1 model (September 2024) was classified as the first model to cross from "low risk" to "medium risk" for certain concerns, indicating advancement but not yet AGI[2].

- Expert predictions on AGI timelines vary dramatically. While some researchers estimate AGI could arrive within a few years, others like Rodney Brooks of MIT project it won't arrive until 2300[5].

- Metaculus prediction markets (as of October 2024) showed over 20% probability of AGI before 2027, but this still suggests a relatively low probability of AGI emerging in the remaining months of 2024[2].

- Organizations are actively investing in AI deployment and significantly increasing budgets, but are primarily focused on current AI applications rather than imminent AGI deployment[1].

## Other World-Changing Criteria

For the remaining criteria that would constitute a departure from "normality," limited specific information is available in recent reports:

- **Population Reduction**: No evidence suggests an imminent 10% reduction in human population before January 2025.

- **GDP Growth**: No indications of an imminent 30%+ increase in global GDP by January 2025.

- **Alien Technosignatures**: No credible reports of alien technosignature discovery as of late 2024.

- **UAP Explanations**: No worldview-shattering explanations for Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena have gained widespread acceptance.

- **World War III**: While geopolitical tensions exist, no evidence suggests World War III has begun or will begin before January 2025.

- **Nuclear Weapon Detonation**: No nuclear weapons have been detonated as acts of war as of late 2024.

## Analysis and Limitations

The most actively developing area among these criteria appears to be AGI research. While AI capabilities continue to advance rapidly, the consensus among experts and AI organizations suggests AGI is still years away rather than months[1][2][5]. The timeline estimates from leading organizations like OpenAI point to 2029 at the earliest[3].

A significant limitation in this analysis is the inherent unpredictability of technological breakthroughs. While current trajectories suggest AGI won't emerge before 2025, unexpected advances could potentially accelerate timelines.

Additionally, the search results provide limited information about several of the criteria, particularly those related to global catastrophic risks, extraterrestrial discoveries, or major geopolitical developments.

## Conclusion

Based on available information as of November 2024, there is no strong evidence suggesting any of the specified world-changing events will occur before January 1, 2025. The most actively developing area—AGI research—shows significant progress but appears unlikely to cross the AGI threshold within the next two months according to current expert assessments and organizational timelines.

Therefore, based on current evidence, the world is likely to remain "normal" through the end of 2024 according to the specified criteria.
