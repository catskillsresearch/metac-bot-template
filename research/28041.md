# Forecasting Major Atlantic Hurricanes in September 2024

The 2024 Atlantic hurricane season has been forecast to be above-normal, with various meteorological agencies and research institutions providing predictions about storm activity. Below is an analysis of available information that can help assess whether 4 or more major Atlantic hurricanes (Category 3 or higher) will occur specifically in September 2024.

## Current Season Forecasts and Status

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) predicted an above-normal 2024 Atlantic hurricane season in their May forecast, projecting 17 to 25 named storms, of which 8 to 13 were expected to become hurricanes[1]. While NOAA did not specify the exact number of major hurricanes in the search results, their forecast indicated significant tropical activity driven by La Niña conditions and warmer-than-average ocean temperatures[1].

As of early September 2024, AccuWeather had revised their seasonal forecast slightly downward, though still predicting an active season with:
- 16-20 named storms
- 6-10 hurricanes
- 3-6 major hurricanes for the entire season[5]

Notably, AccuWeather reported that the 2024 Labor Day weekend (early September) passed without a named storm[5], suggesting a potentially slower start to what is typically the peak month of hurricane season.

## Seasonal Outlook and Contributing Factors

The 2024 hurricane season has been influenced by several key meteorological factors:

1. **La Niña Development**: The climatological shift from El Niño to La Niña conditions was expected to be a major driver of increased hurricane activity. La Niña typically weakens wind shear, creating more favorable conditions for tropical storm and hurricane formation[4].

2. **Sea Surface Temperatures**: Abnormally warm ocean temperatures have been noted as a significant factor in the 2024 season forecasts[2]. Warmer waters provide more energy for developing storms, potentially increasing their intensity.

3. **Seasonal Timing**: September is historically one of the most active months for Atlantic hurricanes, with peak activity typically occurring between mid-August and mid-October.

Tropical Storm Risk (TSR) predicted in their long-range forecast that Atlantic tropical activity could be 30% above the near-term norm and 50% above the long-term norm, with a seasonal Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) index of 160[4]. Their forecast called for 4 intense or major hurricanes across the entire 2024 season[4].

## Historical Context and Limitations

Based on the available search results, as of early September 2024, Tropical Storm Alberto had formed, but there was no specific mention of any major hurricanes having occurred yet in the 2024 season[3]. The National Hurricane Center's Tropical Cyclone Reports would typically provide comprehensive information on each storm, including its intensity classification[3].

The search results do not provide historical data on the typical number of major hurricanes that occur specifically in September, which is a significant limitation for this assessment. Additionally, while seasonal forecasts provide overall expectations, they don't typically predict the specific timing of major hurricanes within the season.

## Assessment and Uncertainties

Given the available information, several factors are relevant to assessing whether 4 or more major hurricanes will occur in September 2024:

1. The overall seasonal forecasts suggest 3-6 major hurricanes for the entire 2024 season[5], making 4 or more in a single month (September) statistically unlikely but not impossible.

2. The reported absence of named storms during the Labor Day weekend[5] could indicate a slower-than-expected start to September's hurricane activity, potentially reducing the likelihood of seeing 4+ major hurricanes in the month.

3. La Niña conditions and warm sea surface temperatures create favorable conditions for hurricane development and intensification[1][4], which could support multiple major hurricanes forming if other atmospheric conditions align.

The primary uncertainties in this assessment include:
- The specific timing of hurricane formation and intensification within the season
- Short-term atmospheric conditions that can either inhibit or enhance hurricane development
- The status of storms that may have formed in late August and could potentially intensify to major hurricane status in early September
