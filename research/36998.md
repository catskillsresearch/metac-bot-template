## Key Trends and Current Status

- The next Serbian parliamentary election, by law, is due by December 31, 2027. President Aleksandar Vučić and former Prime Minister Miloš Vučević have stated the intention to hold regular elections in 2027, not earlier[1].
- Amid mass student protests and political pressure in early 2025, Prime Minister Vučević resigned. There was speculation about snap elections if a new government could not be formed by April 18, 2025, but Vučić nominated Đuro Macut as Prime Minister, who assumed office on April 16, 2025[1][3].
- The ruling SNS party has a history of calling snap elections for strategic reasons, but current statements from leadership emphasize completing the full term[1].

## Recent Announcements and Political Developments

- Students and some opposition parties have been protesting against the government but are not unified in demanding snap elections; some even oppose elections under current conditions due to alleged unfairness[2][3].
- As of May 15, 2025, there has been no official announcement from Serbian authorities regarding a general election before July 1, 2025[1][2][3].
- The main government narrative has shifted toward forming a new cabinet with the current parliamentary majority rather than dissolving parliament and calling early elections[1][3].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Announcements regarding Serbian elections are typically published by the government, the National Assembly, or reported by major media outlets and international organizations monitoring Serbian politics[1][2][3].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- Serbian politics are sometimes unpredictable, and snap election announcements can be made on short notice. The current stability of the ruling coalition and recent appointment of a new prime minister suggest continuity rather than imminent elections, but this could change if a new crisis emerges[1][3].
- The period until July 1, 2025, still leaves a window for unexpected developments, but the trend as of mid-May 2025 is against an early election announcement.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the current situation, historical patterns, and official statements, the probability that Serbia will announce a general election before July 1, 2025, appears low. There are no signs of an imminent announcement, and the government seems focused on maintaining its mandate until the scheduled term ends in 2027[1][3]. Unless a major political upheaval occurs, a "No" resolution is most likely.
