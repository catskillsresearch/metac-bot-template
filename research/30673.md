# Forecasting New Zealand's Whooping Cough Cases for Weeks 51-52, 2024

New Zealand is currently experiencing a whooping cough (pertussis) epidemic, with case numbers showing a clear upward trajectory. Below is an analysis of available data and trends that can help forecast whether New Zealand will report fewer than 275 whooping cough cases for weeks 51 and 52 combined.

## Current Epidemic Status

On November 22, 2024, health agencies officially declared that New Zealand is in the early stages of a whooping cough epidemic[1]. This declaration came after monitoring consistently increasing case numbers across the country for several weeks. As of November 29, 2024, the total number of whooping cough cases for 2024 had reached 1,009[5].

## Recent Case Trends

The epidemic shows a clear pattern of acceleration:

- In the four weeks from October 19 to November 15, 2024, there were 263 cases reported, which was the highest number over a four-week period for all of 2024[1]
- In the four weeks from October 12 to November 8, 2024, there were 215 cases (164 confirmed, 48 probable, and 3 suspect)[2]
- In the four weeks from August 31 to September 27, 2024, there were 179 cases (155 confirmed, 23 probable, and 1 suspect)[3]
- The most recent weekly data shows 77 cases reported in a single week (late November 2024)[5]

The weekly breakdown for October 12 to November 8 shows an increasing trend within that period: 48, 48, 47, and 72 cases respectively in weeks 42-45[2]. Similarly, the weekly breakdown for August 31 to September 27 shows: 28, 36, 56, and 59 cases respectively[3].

## Epidemic Trajectory and Seasonality

Health officials have indicated that New Zealand should be prepared to see high levels of cases over the next 12 months or more[1]. Dr. Nicholas Jones, Director of Public Health, noted that several countries are experiencing record levels of pertussis, possibly due to lower infection rates during the COVID-19 pandemic[1].

Pertussis epidemics historically occur every 3-5 years in New Zealand, with the last epidemic ending in 2019[2][3]. The current epidemic appears to be following this cyclical pattern, with pertussis activity in 2024 returning to pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels after four years of very low activity[2].

## Risk Factors and Vulnerable Populations

The highest notification rates have been observed among:
- Infants aged less than 1 year (21.0 per 100,000, 12 cases in the October-November period)[2]
- Children aged 1-4 years (13.9 per 100,000, 34 cases)[2]
- Children aged 5-9 years (14.2 per 100,000, 46 cases in the August-September period)[3]

By ethnic group, the highest notification rates were among:
- Middle Eastern/Latin American/African (11.8 per 100,000, 9 cases)[2]
- Māori (6.8 per 100,000, 59 cases)[2]
- European or Other (4.0 per 100,000, 125 cases)[2]

## Implications for Weeks 51-52

Based on the available data, several factors suggest that New Zealand is likely to exceed 275 cases for weeks 51 and 52 combined:

1. The epidemic is in its early stages with a clear upward trajectory
2. The most recent weekly count was 77 cases in a single week[5]
3. The weekly case counts have been increasing (from 48 to 72 within a four-week period)[2]
4. Health officials expect high levels of cases to continue for at least 12 months[1]

If the current trend continues, with weekly cases around 70-80 or higher, the combined total for weeks 51 and 52 would likely exceed 140-160 cases, approaching or exceeding the 275 threshold.

## Uncertainties and Limitations

Several factors could influence the actual case numbers:
- The effectiveness of public health interventions, including vaccination campaigns targeting pregnant women and infants[5]
- Potential seasonal variations in transmission
- Reporting delays or changes in testing practices
- The impact of holiday season on social mixing patterns
