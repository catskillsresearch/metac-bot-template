## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- In July 2024, China's youth unemployment rate (ages 16-24, excluding students) rose to 17.1%, the highest since the new calculation method was introduced in December 2023[1].
- The rate had previously been 14.9% in December 2023, after the methodology change, and was over 21% under the old method in June 2023[3].
- The labor market remains under pressure, with slow consumption growth and ongoing challenges in the property sector[2].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- The Chinese government has intensified support for the property sector and promoted new energy vehicle sales, but these measures have not yet translated into significant improvements in youth employment[2].
- No major new policy interventions specifically targeting youth unemployment were reported between July and August 2024.

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The National Bureau of Statistics of China (NBS) is the official source for the youth unemployment rate, with Trading Economics providing timely reporting based on NBS data.
- The Conference Board and Statista provide additional context on labor market trends[2][4].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- The new methodology excludes students, which lowers the reported rate compared to the previous approach but still leaves it much higher than the national average[3].
- Seasonal factors or reporting adjustments could cause minor fluctuations month-to-month.
- There is no evidence of a significant economic rebound or policy-driven improvement that would sharply reduce the rate in August 2024.

## Forecast Assessment

Given the July 2024 rate of 17.1% and the lack of evidence for a significant labor market improvement, it is most likely that the youth unemployment rate for August 2024 will remain above 16.0%. It could plausibly fall within the 16.1%â€“17.0% range if there is a minor improvement, but the risk of it remaining at or above 17.1% is also significant. Therefore, while a rate greater than 16.0% and less than or equal to 17.0% is possible, the available evidence suggests the rate is more likely to be at or just above 17.0% for August 2024.
