# Forecasting New Zealand's Whooping Cough Cases for Weeks 51-52, 2024

New Zealand is currently experiencing a whooping cough (pertussis) epidemic, with case numbers showing a consistent upward trend throughout 2024. This analysis examines the available data to help forecast whether New Zealand will report more than 375 combined cases for weeks 51-52 of 2024.

## Current Epidemic Status

On November 22, 2024, health authorities officially declared a whooping cough epidemic across Aotearoa New Zealand[1]. This declaration came after monitoring consistently increasing case numbers over several months, with officials noting that New Zealand is in the "early stages" of an epidemic[1].

By November 29, 2024, the total number of whooping cough cases for 2024 had reached 1,009, with 77 cases reported in the week prior to this date[5]. This represents a significant disease burden that continues to grow.

## Historical Trends and Recent Data

Pertussis epidemics historically occur every 3-5 years in New Zealand, with the previous epidemic ending in 2019[2][3]. After four years of very low activity during the COVID-19 pandemic, pertussis activity has returned to pre-pandemic levels in 2024[2].

The case numbers show a clear upward trajectory:

- April 2024: 22 cases
- June 2024: 83 cases (more than triple the April figure)[4]
- August 31-September 27, 2024 (weeks 36-39): 179 cases, with weekly breakdowns of 28, 36, 56, and 59 cases[3]
- October 12-November 8, 2024 (weeks 42-45): 215 cases, with weekly breakdowns of 48, 48, 47, and 72 cases[2]
- October 19-November 15, 2024: 263 cases (highest four-week period in 2024)[1]
- Week before November 29, 2024: 77 cases[5]

This data reveals not only an overall increase but an acceleration in the epidemic curve, with the most recent weekly figures approaching 80 cases.

## Risk Factors and Population Vulnerability

Several factors may contribute to continued case growth:

1. **Reduced Population Immunity**: Officials note that many countries are experiencing record levels of pertussis, possibly due to lower infection rates during the COVID-19 pandemic[1][3].

2. **Seasonal Factors**: Weeks 51-52 fall in December, during New Zealand's summer and holiday season, which could affect transmission patterns through increased social gatherings.

3. **Vulnerable Populations**: The data shows that infants under one year have the highest notification rates (21.0 per 100,000)[2], with Māori and Pacific populations identified as being at higher risk[1].

4. **Hospitalization Rates**: Recent data shows increasing hospitalizations, with 20 cases hospitalized during weeks 42-45 compared to 17 in the previous four-week period[2].

## Epidemic Trajectory Analysis

The epidemic is described as being in its "early stages" as of November 22, 2024[1], suggesting that case numbers may continue to rise before reaching their peak. Director of Public Health, Dr. Nicholas Jones, has warned that New Zealand should be prepared to see high levels of cases over the next 12 months or more[1].

The weekly case counts show an accelerating pattern:
- September weekly averages: ~45 cases per week
- October-early November weekly averages: ~54 cases per week
- Most recent weekly data: 77 cases

If this upward trend continues, the combined case count for weeks 51-52 could potentially exceed 375 cases (which would require an average of 187.5 cases per week).

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors create uncertainty in forecasting:

1. **Reporting Delays**: There may be lags in case reporting, especially during the holiday period.

2. **Intervention Effectiveness**: Public health responses, including vaccination campaigns targeting pregnant women and infants, may affect case numbers[1][5].

3. **Epidemic Pattern Variability**: While historical patterns suggest continued growth in the early phase of an epidemic, the exact trajectory can vary.

4. **Data Completeness**: The available data does not provide a complete week-by-week progression throughout 2024, making precise trend analysis challenging.
