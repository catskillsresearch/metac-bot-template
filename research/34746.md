## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- **2023 General Election Results**: The Popular Party (PP) won with 33.1%, while PSOE had 31.7%. Despite coming second, PSOE formed a government through coalition agreements.
- **Current Polling Averages**: As of late May 2025, Politico's Poll of Polls shows PP ahead with 34%, and PSOE at 28%, suggesting a 6-point gap in favor of PP[3].
- **Recent Poll Variability**: Polls from CIS (May 2025) report PSOE at 32% and PP at 29.3%, showing PSOE ahead by roughly 3 points[4]. However, 40dB’s poll (late April 2025) gives PP 33.9% and PSOE 29.3%, consistent with the broader average and showing PP ahead[2].
- **Trend Since 2023**: The PP’s lead has persisted, though the margin has varied. Some periods in 2025 have seen PSOE momentarily leading in individual polls, but not in the overall average[1][3].
- **Third-Party Dynamics**: Vox has recently gained ground, rising almost four points in the last month, while both PSOE and PP have slipped slightly, indicating voter volatility and a potential impact on the two main parties’ standings[5].

## Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- **Government Stability**: Pedro Sánchez’s coalition government remains in office but faces challenges, and the stability or popularity of the coalition could influence polling[2][4]. No major policy breakthrough or crisis has fundamentally altered the landscape in 2025.
- **External Influences**: Rising trade tensions and right-wing mobilization (notably Vox’s activities) may affect the relative strength of both PSOE and PP[5].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- **Politico Poll of Polls**: The key reference for resolution, providing the averaged polling data for Spain[3].
- **CIS and 40dB Polls**: Provide methodological context and show the range of polling outcomes[2][4].
- **Historical Context**: Wikipedia’s aggregation of Spanish opinion polling offers additional trend analysis[1].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- **Poll Variability**: Spanish polls can differ substantially due to sample, methodology, and regional weighting. CIS is known to rate PSOE higher than the average, while 40dB and Politico averages are more in line with election outcomes[2][4].
- **Volatility**: Recent months have shown increased volatility, with both major parties losing ground to Vox, and with individual polls occasionally showing PSOE ahead[5]. A political shock or scandal could quickly shift averages.
- **Forecasting Horizon**: With over half a year remaining in 2025, unforeseen events could still alter the trend, but absent a major shift, the current average favors the PP.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given:
- The current Politico average shows PP ahead by about 6 points[3].
- Individual polls occasionally show PSOE ahead, but these are not reflected in the aggregate[2][4].
- The trend has not consistently favored PSOE since the 2023 election.

**Adjusted probability that PSOE will be ahead of PP in the December 31, 2025, Politico Poll of Polls average:**
- **Low (estimated 10–25%)** that PSOE overtakes PP by end of 2025.
- **High probability (estimated 75–90%)** that PP retains its lead, barring a major political event.
