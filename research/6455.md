**Key Historical Trends and Current Status**

- As of February 2021, the only mandatory EU-wide animal welfare label applies to table eggs, distinguishing production methods (organic, free-range, indoor, cage)[4].
- For other products—meat and dairy—animal welfare labelling remains voluntary and fragmented, with at least 51 different schemes across member states, causing consumer confusion and inconsistent standards[3][4][5].
- National and retailer-led multi-tier labels (e.g., Germany’s Haltungsform, France’s Etiquette bien-être animal) have proven the feasibility of such systems, but they are not harmonized at the EU level[3].

**Recent Announcements and Policies**

- The 2020 Farm to Fork Strategy and subsequent Council of the EU position called for consideration of a transparent, tiered labelling scheme, and the European Commission started a study on animal welfare labelling in 2021[5].
- As of January 2025, major stakeholders like Eurogroup for Animals continue to push for a mandatory, multi-tiered scheme, but the European Commission has not enacted such a regulation[1].
- Recent policy momentum suggests a harmonized, multi-tier label is likely, but announcements and expert analysis indicate this will probably be a voluntary rather than a mandatory scheme in the near term[5].

**Key Differences Affecting the Forecast**

- Only a minority of EU member states (15 of 27 in 2020) supported a mandatory label through legislation, signaling limited political consensus for a binding measure[3].
- The legislative process for new EU-wide food labelling is typically slow, requiring broad agreement and implementation periods; as of May 2025, there are no credible reports of a mandatory, multi-tiered label being adopted or in force[2][5].
- The most recent community forecasts and stakeholder analyses assign a low probability (around 16%) that such a mandatory label will be in force by the end of 2025[2].

**Probabilistic Assessment**

Given the lack of legislative enactment, the ongoing preference for voluntary harmonization, and continued political division, the probability that the EU will have a mandatory multi-tiered animal welfare label in force for chicken, pig, and cow products by December 31, 2025, is estimated at around 15–20%[2]. The most likely outcome is the introduction of a harmonized, voluntary multi-tiered scheme, with mandatory measures remaining unlikely before the forecast deadline.

**Limitations and Uncertainties**

- Sudden political shifts or crises could accelerate legislation, but as of May 2025, there is no public evidence of an imminent mandatory regulation.
- Measurement is limited by the absence of credible media or Commission reports confirming passage and enforcement of such a scheme.
- Voluntary schemes may be confused with mandatory ones, but the resolution requires clear legal compulsion.
