### 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of 2021, the only compulsory EU-wide animal welfare labelling scheme covered table eggs, with all other animal products subject to voluntary or national schemes[3].
- Multiple member states and retailers have implemented their own multi-level animal welfare labels, creating a fragmented and confusing landscape for consumers and producers[4].
- By 2025, calls for harmonization have intensified, with Eurogroup for Animals and other stakeholders advocating a mandatory, multi-tiered label for all meat and dairy[1][4].
- The European Commission has undertaken a major revision of animal welfare legislation, signaled in its Farm to Fork Strategy and subsequent policy documents, and has established working groups and begun data collection on labelling[5].

### 2. Recent Announcements and Policies

- The Council of the EU in December 2020 called for the Commission to develop a transparent, tiered labelling scheme[1].
- The Commission has committed to consider targeted labelling as part of its broader animal welfare legislative revision, with further proposals expected in the coming months[5].
- As of early 2025, legislative proposals are under examination by the European Parliament and Council, and no mandatory EU-wide multi-tiered labelling scheme is yet in force[5].

### 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The European Commission’s Food Safety and Animal Welfare portal provides updates on legislative progress and labelling policies[3][5].
- Eurogroup for Animals and other advocacy organizations regularly publish reports and recommendations on the status of EU animal welfare labelling[1][4].
- Credible media coverage and the EC Press Corner will confirm the entry into force of any such scheme (per resolution criteria)[2].

### 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- EU legislative processes are complex and often slow, particularly where member states have divergent views or significant economic interests.
- While there is increasing political will, as of May 2025, there is no evidence that a mandatory, multi-tiered animal welfare label covering chickens, pigs, and cows (and all major products, with detailed method-of-production information) has been enacted and enforced.
- Stakeholder calls for urgency and transparency continue, but the fragmented nature of current schemes and slow legislative movement suggest a low probability of full implementation by end-2025[1][4].

### Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the above, the probability that the EU will have a mandatory, multi-tiered animal welfare labelling scheme in force for major livestock products by December 31, 2025, is **low**—likely well under 30%. While significant progress has been made in political and stakeholder alignment, no evidence indicates that such a scheme will be fully legislated, implemented, and enforced within the timeframe required.
