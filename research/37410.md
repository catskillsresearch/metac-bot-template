## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- On May 16, 2025, 10 inmates escaped from the Orleans Justice Center in New Orleans. The escape was facilitated by removing a toilet, crawling through a hole, and was not detected for several hours, allowing the escapees a significant head start[1][3].
- As of May 29, 2025, 8 of the 10 escapees have been recaptured. The remaining fugitives are Antoine Massey and Derrick Groves, both considered dangerous and possibly armed[3][4][5].
- Law enforcement has arrested 14 individuals suspected of aiding the escapees, including both inside and outside accomplices, showing the escape was well-organized with external support[1][3].
- Extensive manhunts—spanning multiple states—have resulted in the capture of escapees as far as Texas, indicating a broad and coordinated inter-agency response[1][5].

## Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Metric

- Louisiana’s Attorney General and local law enforcement have publicly expressed strong confidence in recapturing the two remaining fugitives, citing ongoing, methodical efforts and expanded rewards for information leading to their arrest[1][3].
- Arrests of accomplices continue, which may disrupt support networks and increase the likelihood of recapture[3].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Arrests and recaptures are being reported by major news outlets and local authorities, including ABC News, Fox News, and WWL-TV[1][3][4].
- Official statements from the Louisiana Attorney General’s office further confirm developments and intent[3].

## Limitations or Uncertainties in Measurement

- There is a possibility that fugitives may receive ongoing help, have access to resources, or leave the immediate region, complicating efforts to locate them quickly.
- The dangerous nature of the fugitives could lead to confrontations or fatal outcomes, which would count as resolution under the criteria.
- The measurement is reliable, as recapture or confirmed death will be reported by credible sources, but there may be slight delays in reporting or ambiguity if fugitives are not immediately identified.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the:
- Recapture of 8 out of 10 escapees within two weeks,
- Ongoing, high-profile, and well-resourced manhunt,
- Disruption of support networks through accomplice arrests,
- Stated confidence of authorities,

It is highly probable—but not certain—that both remaining fugitives will be recaptured or killed before July 1, 2025. Based on historical analogues and the current pace, a reasonable adjusted probability is in the 80–90% range for full resolution by the deadline. The primary risks to a "Yes" outcome are if the fugitives receive new, effective outside help or manage to leave the region undetected.
