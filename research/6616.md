## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Early US cryonics organizations (1960s–early 1970s) typically failed due to underfunding, dependence on relatives for payments, and lack of permanent endowments. All but one documented cryonic preservation before 1973 resulted in failure, with patients thawed and disposed after organizations went bankrupt[5].
- The Cryonics Institute, founded in 1976, has now operated for over four decades without bankruptcy, making it one of the two major US cryonics organizations along with Alcor[3]. As of late 2021, CI reported a strong financial position, zero debt, and ongoing facility improvements. Membership surpassed 2,000, with over 200 patients cryopreserved—both record highs for the organization[4].
- CI publicly releases annual financial reports. For 2022, CI reported total revenues of $1.21 million against expenses of $674,798. Despite a net asset decline in 2022 due to investment losses (likely reflecting broad market downturns), CI still held net assets of $7.77 million at year-end[2].

## Key Differences Affecting the Forecast

- **Financial Structure:** CI now relies on pre-paid contracts and membership dues, rather than recurring payments from relatives, reducing the risk of funding collapse that doomed earlier ventures[5].
- **Endowment and Assets:** With substantial net assets and no debt, CI is structurally more financially resilient than early organizations, which operated with minimal reserves[2][4].
- **Operational Track Record:** CI has demonstrated multi-decade stability compared to the short-lived operations of most 1960s and 1970s cryonics ventures[3][4].
- **Scale and Publicity:** CI’s membership and patient base are far larger than any failed predecessor, suggesting greater financial and reputational inertia[4].

## Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- As of late 2021, CI reported ongoing growth in membership and patients, completion of major facility renovations, and the hiring of new staff, all signaling operational stability[4].
- No material recent policy changes or announcements as of 2021-02-20 indicate increased bankruptcy risk.

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- CI’s audited financial statements and annual reports are available on their website[1][2][4].
- Third-party reviews and probability estimates (e.g., Metaculus, Jeff Kaufman) provide community perspectives but do not offer internal financial data[5].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- **Time Horizon:** The forecast fundamentally covers an indefinite period, since the timeline for revival (if possible) is unknown and could extend centuries.
- **Market and Operational Risks:** Investment losses, legal challenges, or systemic shocks could threaten CI’s solvency in the future, even if it appears stable now[2].
- **Technological Uncertainty:** There is currently no demonstrated pathway to revival, so the timeline for a resolution (if ever) is unknown.
- **Measurement:** Bankruptcy is well-defined for this question, but non-bankruptcy dissolution or other organizational changes could complicate resolution.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the historical failures of early, underfunded organizations and CI’s much stronger financial position, diversified income streams, no debt, and decades-long operational history, the probability of bankruptcy before patient revival is lower than for 1960s–70s cryonics ventures. However, the indefinite timeline, the absence of any demonstrated revival technology, and the inherent financial risks of maintaining operations for decades or centuries mean that bankruptcy risk cannot be discounted and likely dominates the probability in the medium-to-long term.

A reasonable probabilistic assessment as of 2021-02-20 is that the risk of CI going bankrupt before any patient is revived remains substantial (perhaps above 50%), primarily due to the extreme uncertainty about revival timelines, rather than immediate financial instability. This aligns with community estimates and the consensus view among external analysts[5].
