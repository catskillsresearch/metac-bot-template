### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Congressional approval ratings have been persistently low in recent years. As of early November 2024, Gallup reported congressional approval at approximately 16%[5].
- FiveThirtyEight's polling averages, which aggregate multiple sources, typically track closely with Gallup's numbers, rarely diverging by more than a few percentage points[4].
- There is no evidence from available data that the approval rating has approached or exceeded 22% in the months leading up to late November 2024.

### Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- No major bipartisan legislative achievements or widely popular actions by Congress have been reported in late 2024 that would plausibly drive a significant increase in approval ratings[1][2].
- News coverage has focused on partisan disputes, individual controversies, and routine legislative activity, none of which are associated with notable approval surges[1][2].

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- FiveThirtyEight's congressional approval tracker is the primary source for the metric in question, using a transparent methodology that weights and averages reputable polls[4].
- Gallup's long-term tracking provides an independent benchmark for congressional approval trends[5].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- Approval ratings can shift due to unexpected events, but such changes are typically modest unless driven by extraordinary circumstances.
- Polling averages are subject to sampling error and methodological nuances, but these are unlikely to account for the large gap between the current rating (~16%) and the 22% threshold.

### Conclusion

Based on the available data as of November 27, 2024, it is highly unlikely that the US Congress's 538 approval rating will be greater than or equal to 22.0% on December 30, 2024.
