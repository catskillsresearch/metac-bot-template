### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The "datascience" subreddit (r/datascience) is recognized as Reddit’s most popular data science community, serving as a hub for practitioners and professionals to discuss career questions and share resources[5].
- As of 2019, r/datascience had "more than 115,000 users," but this figure is significantly outdated for 2025 forecasting[5].
- The question’s open bounds ([2,627,333; 2,800,000]) indicate that the subreddit has experienced substantial growth since 2019, now likely exceeding 2.6 million subscribers.

### Recent Announcements or Policies Affecting the Metric

- No search results indicate any recent Reddit-wide policy changes or subreddit-specific events (such as bans, major controversies, or platform outages) that would have a material impact on r/datascience’s subscriber growth as of early 2025.
- There is no evidence of measurement anomalies or disruptions in subscriber tracking for this subreddit.

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The official resolution source for subscriber counts is Reddstats, which provides daily snapshots of subreddit growth and will be used to determine the exact count for March 30, 2025.
- No search results provide a direct link to a current (2024–2025) subscriber count, but Reddstats remains the authoritative tool for this metric.

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- The most recent publicly cited subscriber count is from 2019 and is not representative of the current scale of the subreddit[5].
- Without access to a recent time series or current snapshot, precise forecasting is limited to extrapolation based on the provided open bounds and the subreddit’s historical reputation for steady growth.
- Reddstats is considered reliable for daily subscriber counts, but if the exact date is unavailable, the closest preceding value will be used per the resolution criteria.
