### Key Historical Trends and Current Status (as of 2020-08-14)

- The Millennium Prize Problems are among the most difficult open questions in mathematics, with only the Poincar√© Conjecture solved (by a human, Grigori Perelman, in 2003)[4].
- As of August 2020, no AI system had independently solved any of the remaining Millennium Prize Problems, nor had any credible claims of such a breakthrough been made[1][3].
- AI systems at that time were primarily used as *assistive tools* in mathematical research, capable of generating conjectures, checking proofs, and automating parts of the discovery process, but not independently producing full, peer-validated solutions to problems of this magnitude.

### Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- No major announcements or policy changes indicated that AI was close to independently solving any Millennium Prize Problem as of August 2020.
- The prize value remained $1 million, though its real value had been eroded by inflation, potentially reducing incentives for human researchers but not directly impacting AI-driven efforts[4].
- The Clay Mathematics Institute maintained strict criteria for recognizing a solution, requiring rigorous proof and community validation.

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The Clay Mathematics Institute is the final arbiter for recognizing a solution to a Millennium Prize Problem.
- Major mathematics journals and peer-reviewed publications are essential for verifying the validity and originality of any claimed solution.
- Community forecasting platforms (e.g., Metaculus, Manifold) and reputable news sources track and discuss progress and predictions related to these problems[1][3].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- Solutions must be validated by the broader mathematical community, which can take years even after a credible claim is made.
- The strict resolution criteria require that the AI independently discovers the major novel elements of the solution; human involvement is strictly limited to setup and translation[1][3].
- There is always a possibility of undisclosed progress, but as of August 2020, there was no evidence to support this.

### Summary

As of 2020-08-14, all available evidence indicated that no AI system had independently solved a Millennium Prize Problem. The probability of the next such problem being solved by AI was extremely low, with all credible sources suggesting that this milestone remained well in the future.
