To forecast whether California's Proposition 12 will remain in effect on January 1, 2026, I'll analyze its current status, implementation effects, and ongoing challenges.

## Current Status of Proposition 12

California's Proposition 12, which establishes minimum space requirements for confining veal calves, breeding pigs, and egg-laying hens, officially took effect on January 1, 2024[4]. This followed a series of legal challenges that culminated in a 5-4 U.S. Supreme Court decision upholding the law[4]. The proposition prohibits the sale in California of certain cuts of pork and veal, as well as eggs, from livestock whose confinement does not meet specific minimum space requirements, even if those animals were raised outside of California[4].

Key requirements include:
- 24 square feet of space for breeding pigs (sows)[4]
- 43 square feet of floor space for veal calves[2]
- 1 to 1.5 square feet of cage-free space for laying hens[2]

## Market and Economic Impacts

Since implementation, significant economic impacts have been observed:

- According to USDA data, pork prices in California have increased dramatically: bacon by 16%, pork ribs by 17%, pork loin by 41%, and pork shoulder by 17%[2][5].
- California's consumption of fresh pork has decreased from 13% to approximately 10% of U.S. production in just one year[2].
- California produces only 0.06% of the nation's hogs (82,000 out of 133 million annually) while consuming about 10% of U.S. pork production[2].

These economic effects are creating pressure from multiple stakeholders to reconsider the law.

## Current Challenges to Proposition 12

Several significant challenges to Proposition 12 are currently in progress:

1. **Federal Legislative Efforts**: House Republicans are attempting to overturn Proposition 12 through the Farm, Food, and National Security Act of 2024 (Farm Bill). The proposed legislation would prevent states from imposing production standards on products not physically raised in that state[5].

2. **GOP-Sponsored Bill**: There is a GOP-sponsored bill explicitly aimed at undoing Proposition 12 that would affect the requirements for giving certain livestock animals specific amounts of space[3].

3. **Industry Concerns**: Pig farmers are uncertain about making massive infrastructure investments to comply with California's standards, which they fear could change with future ballot initiatives[5].

4. **Federal Administration Concerns**: USDA Secretary Tom Vilsack has warned Congress that "there's nothing preventing any state from doing what California did," and without action, "we're going to have chaos in the marketplace"[5].

## Factors Supporting Proposition 12's Continuation

1. **Voter Support**: Proposition 12 was approved by 63% of California voters in the 2018 election, indicating strong public support[4].

2. **Supreme Court Precedent**: The Supreme Court has already ruled on the constitutionality of the law, making further legal challenges on the same grounds unlikely to succeed[4].

3. **State Sovereignty**: California may resist federal attempts to override its state laws, potentially leading to further legal battles if federal legislation passes.

## Factors Supporting Proposition 12's Repeal

1. **Economic Pressure**: The significant price increases for pork products and resulting decrease in consumption create economic incentives for change[2][5].

2. **Bipartisan Concerns**: USDA Secretary Vilsack's concerns about market chaos suggest that opposition to Proposition 12 may not be strictly partisan[5].

3. **Industry Opposition**: Major agricultural organizations like American Farm Bureau Federation and National Pork Producers Council continue to oppose the law, citing concerns about arbitrary standards that don't align with veterinary science and industry practices[4][5].

4. **Federal Legislative Momentum**: The inclusion of provisions targeting Proposition 12 in the Farm Bill indicates significant federal legislative interest in overriding the state law[5].

## Forecast Considerations

The question of whether Proposition 12 will remain in effect on January 1, 2026, hinges on several key factors:

1. Whether federal legislation overriding state production standards will pass both houses of Congress and be signed into law before 2026.

2. The possibility of new legal challenges based on different grounds than those already addressed by the Supreme Court.

3. Whether California might modify the law in response to economic pressures and implementation challenges.

4. The outcome of the 2024 presidential and congressional elections, which could significantly affect federal policy priorities.

The significant economic impacts already observed, combined with active legislative efforts at the federal level and statements from the USDA Secretary, suggest substantial pressure against Proposition 12's continuation in its current form. However, the law has already survived significant legal challenges and has strong voter support in California.
