### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of November 20, 2024, the most recent post on Virgin Galactic's official News page is dated July 10, 2024[1].
- Since July 2024, Virgin Galactic has issued several business and financial updates (in August and November 2024), but these have been published on the Investor Relations site, not the News page[2][4].
- The News page appears to be updated less frequently than the Investor Relations section, suggesting it is reserved for select announcements rather than routine updates.

### Recent Announcements and Policies

- Virgin Galactic released its third quarter 2024 financial results and a business update on November 6, 2024, and its second quarter results on August 7, 2024, both on the Investor Relations site[2][4].
- There is no evidence of a policy or pattern indicating that every financial or business update is posted to the News page.
- No upcoming events or policy changes have been announced that would require a News page update before January 1, 2025.

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The official Virgin Galactic News page is the only source that counts for this question[1].
- The Investor Relations site provides more frequent updates but does not fulfill the resolution criteria unless mirrored on the News page[2][4].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- Virgin Galactic could post a year-end message or unexpected announcement at any time, which would resolve the question as "No."
- The News page could experience downtime, which would also resolve the question as "No" per the fine print.
- The infrequent posting pattern on the News page increases the likelihood of no new posts, but does not guarantee it.

### Summary

Based on available information as of November 22, 2024, Virgin Galactic's News page has not been updated since July 10, 2024, despite ongoing company activity. The historical trend suggests infrequent updates, and there are no announced events or policies indicating a new post is imminent. However, the possibility of an unexpected update or technical downtime remains.
