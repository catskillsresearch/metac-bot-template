### Key Factual Information

- As of January 29, 2025, the Just Security tracker listed 225 legal challenges to Trump Administration actions (including 7 closed cases)[1].
- The tracker is updated regularly and is considered authoritative for this metric[1][3].
- The methodology counts related lawsuits as a single case, does not count appeals separately, and excludes cases where the Trump administration is the plaintiff[1].
- The number of lawsuits has steadily increased over time, with no indication of a reversal or significant reduction as of early February 2025.

### Recent Announcements/Policies

- There are no recent announcements or policy changes reported that would significantly affect the total number of lawsuits counted by the tracker as of February 10, 2025[1][3][4].

### Authoritative Sources

- The primary source for verification is the Just Security litigation tracker, which is publicly accessible and regularly updated[1].
- Digest articles from Just Security confirm ongoing updates and coverage of legal challenges to Trump Administration actions[3][4].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- The tracker’s methodology may undercount lawsuits by grouping related cases and excluding appeals or cases where the administration is the plaintiff[1].
- The number is subject to change as new lawsuits are filed or consolidated, but the trend as of early February 2025 is well above the highest multiple-choice threshold.

### Conclusion

Based on the available data, the correct answer is:

**Greater than 80**

This is supported by the tracker’s count of 225 cases as of January 29, 2025, with no evidence of a significant decrease or methodological change before February 28, 2025[1].
