# Forecasting Assessment: Drone-Based Terrorist Attacks in the United States

## Current Threat Landscape

The United States faces an evolving threat environment where technological advancements in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) intersect with persistent domestic and international terrorism concerns. According to the Homeland Threat Assessment 2025, the threat of violence from US-based violent extremists will remain high throughout 2025, characterized primarily by lone offenders or small cells motivated by various ideologies including racial, religious, gender, or anti-government grievances[1].

Between September 2023 and July 2024, domestic violent extremists (DVEs) conducted at least four attacks in the United States, with one resulting in a fatality[1]. Additionally, US law enforcement disrupted at least seven additional DVE plots during this period, demonstrating both the persistence of the threat and the effectiveness of countermeasures[1].

## Drone Technology Proliferation and Capabilities

The accessibility and capabilities of drone technology have increased significantly in recent years:

- Weaponized unmanned aerial systems (UAS) are increasing in range and precision, with some drones capable of traveling up to 1,500 kilometers[5]
- Since 2020, drones have been used to target energy infrastructure, international shipping, airports, and capital cities globally[5]
- The technology encompasses not just the UAV itself but also ground control systems and supporting infrastructure[3]

Security experts have explicitly warned that "U.S. military personnel and infrastructure — both abroad and at home — are going to be exposed to drone attacks," with expectations that both the technology and tactics will increase in sophistication[4]. This assessment followed a January 28, 2024 drone attack that killed three American troops in Jordan, highlighting the lethal potential of these weapons[4].

## Factors Influencing the Forecast

Several key factors should be considered when assessing the probability of a drone-based terrorist attack in the United States before 2026:

**Heightened Domestic Extremism Environment**
- The 2024 election cycle and ongoing global conflicts like the Israel-Hamas situation are specifically identified as potential motivators for domestic violent extremist activity[1]
- Many violent extremists embrace multiple, sometimes competing motivations, making their potential targets difficult to predict in advance[1]

**Technical Challenges and Opportunities**
- The Pentagon is being urged to more rapidly deploy technologies that can detect and counter drone weapons, suggesting current defensive capabilities may have gaps[4]
- Experts note that unmanned aerial systems pose a threat "that is a significant departure from those that we've historically been concerned with"[4]

**Historical Precedent**
- While the search results don't indicate previous successful drone-based terrorist attacks within the United States, the attack in Jordan demonstrates the feasibility and lethality of such tactics[4]

## Assessment Limitations

This forecast faces several important limitations:

1. The rapid evolution of drone technology makes historical comparisons less reliable
2. The search results provide limited information on specific US defensive capabilities against small drone attacks in civilian settings
3. The unpredictable nature of lone-actor terrorism complicates probability assessments
4. The definition of "terrorist attack" requires official designation, which may lag behind actual events

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on the available information, the threat of drone-based terrorist attacks in the United States is credible and growing. The combination of increasingly capable technology, persistent domestic violent extremism, and demonstrated tactical usage in other regions suggests this represents a plausible attack vector. However, the search results do not provide sufficient information about specific plots targeting the US homeland using drones or comprehensive data on US defensive capabilities against such threats to make a precise probability estimate.

The most concerning factors include the assessment from security experts that US infrastructure "both abroad and at home" will face drone attacks[4], combined with the Homeland Threat Assessment's projection of a high threat level from domestic violent extremists through 2025[1]. The technical feasibility has been demonstrated, the motivation exists among various extremist groups, and the tactical advantages of drone attacks (standoff capability, precision, and potential for operator escape) align with terrorist objectives.
