## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- **Weaponization of FPV Drones:** The proliferation of FPV drones as attack platforms was demonstrated in the Russo-Ukrainian war, with Ukrainian forces attributing over 20% of strike missions to drone attacks by early 2024[5]. These drones are relatively cheap, easy to modify, and can carry significant payloads.
- **US Military Response:** The US military has begun fielding and training with armed FPV drones, reflecting concern about their utility and threat potential. For example, the US Army conducted its first armed FPV drone live-fire exercises in February 2025, and the Marine Corps established a dedicated attack drone team in May 2025[1][2][3].
- **Commercial Availability:** Drones such as the DJI Mavic 3 are widely available for around $2,000, and modifications for carrying explosives are well documented, making the technology accessible for non-state actors[5].
- **No Prior Domestic Incidents:** As of March 25, 2024, there have been no credible reports of a terrorist attack in the US involving a weaponized aerial drone resulting in injury or death, according to open-source and government reporting.

## 2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- **Military Modernization and Training:** The US Army and Marine Corps are actively developing capabilities and countermeasures for FPV drone threats, indicating institutional recognition of the risks[1][2][3].
- **Industry Developments:** The defense industry is scaling up production of attritable (disposable) drones for military and intelligence uses, further lowering the cost and raising awareness of drone-based threats[5].
- **Regulatory Environment:** While there are some restrictions on drone use (e.g., FAA rules), commercial drones remain less regulated than firearms and can be imported and purchased by civilians with minimal oversight.

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- **Military Press Releases and Defense News:** US Army and Marine Corps public statements[1][2][3].
- **Industry Analysis:** Reports from Drone Industry Insights and Shephard Media[4][5].
- **Government and Law Enforcement Bulletins:** No publicly available reports indicating a terrorist drone attack with casualties in the US as of March 2024.

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- **Evolving Tactics:** Terrorist groups are known to adapt quickly, especially following high-profile uses of new technologies in foreign conflicts.
- **Detection and Attribution:** Identifying an event as a "terrorist attack" (with explicit language) may be delayed by investigation or reporting standards.
- **Counter-UAS Measures:** US investments in counter-drone technology may mitigate the risk, but coverage is incomplete, especially in civilian areas.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

- **Reference Cases:** While military and combat zone incidents are rising, no comparable terrorist attack has occurred in the US as of the reference date.
- **Key Differences:** The US has more robust security and intelligence resources than conflict zones, but the commercial availability and demonstrated lethality of FPV drones lower the technical barrier for attackers.
- **Assessment:** Given the above, the probability of a terrorist aerial drone attack resulting in injury or death in the US before 2026 remains low but non-negligible—likely in the 5–15% range. The risk is rising due to increased awareness, availability, and demonstrated effectiveness of the technology, but no successful precedent or clear intent has been established domestically as of March 2024.
