## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The Black Death (1346–1353) is the principal reference case for a naturally occurring pandemic causing a global catastrophe, killing an estimated 25–200 million people, or 5–40% of the global population at the time[3].
- Other major pandemics, such as the Spanish Flu (1918–1919), killed tens of millions (estimates range from 17–100 million), but this represented less than 5% of the global population.
- The COVID-19 pandemic, as of late 2021, resulted in an estimated 17.3 million excess deaths worldwide, about 0.22% of the global population, far below the catastrophic threshold[5].
- Over the past century, the likelihood of pandemics has increased due to factors like global travel, urbanization, and ecological changes, but so has our ability to contain and treat infectious diseases[3].

## 2. Recent Announcements, Policies, and Key Differences

- Global pandemic preparedness was found lacking during COVID-19, with significant reductions in life expectancy in some regions, but sustained global progress in overall mortality reduction[5].
- National risk environment factors—including political instability, social unrest, and trust in government—were shown to affect pandemic outcomes, as seen during COVID-19[4].
- Ongoing investments in global surveillance, vaccine technology, and rapid response capability are expected to improve future pandemic outcomes[5].
- Technological and medical advancements, including fast diagnostics and vaccines, have reduced the lethality of recent pandemics compared to historical ones[5].
- The risk landscape is shifting: synthetic biology and engineered pathogens now present a serious alternative to naturally occurring pandemics as sources of global catastrophe.

## 3. Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

- While naturally occurring pandemics remain a credible global risk, only one historical pandemic (the Black Death) has caused a population decline of 10% or more within five years.
- Modern trends—rising population, urbanization, and travel—could increase the risk of large-scale pandemics[3]. However, advances in medicine and public health, as well as the rapid development of vaccines and treatments, make a repeat of a Black Death-scale event from a natural pathogen less likely.
- The COVID-19 experience demonstrated both the global impact a pandemic can have and the limits of that impact given current medical and organizational capabilities[5].
- Emerging risks from non-natural sources (bioengineering, AI, nuclear, and climate) are now considered at least as plausible, if not more so, than a natural pandemic causing a global catastrophe.
- Therefore, as of late 2021, the probability that the next global catastrophe (defined as a 10% population loss in 5 years) will be due to a naturally occurring pandemic is low, likely well below 10–20%, though not negligible. Most expert analyses suggest that if such a catastrophe were to occur, it is more likely to be driven by synthetic or engineered biological threats, or by non-biological risks.

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- Measurement of pandemic impact depends on accurate mortality and population data, which are often lacking or delayed, especially in lower-income regions.
- The probability assessment is sensitive to unpredictable developments: new pathogens, medical breakthroughs, or global sociopolitical changes could shift the risk landscape dramatically.
- Distinguishing between natural and engineered pandemics may become increasingly difficult as biotechnology advances.
