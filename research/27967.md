### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- In April 2024, Tesla announced a major layoff round, cutting more than 10% of its global workforce (about 14,000 employees), citing poor financial performance, narrowing profit margins, and lagging sales growth[1][2][3].
- In May 2024, Tesla unexpectedly gutted its charging team in another round of layoffs, further highlighting internal restructuring and cost-cutting efforts[4].
- These layoffs were widely covered by TechCrunch and are listed in their comprehensive 2024 tech layoffs tracker[5].

### Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- CEO Elon Musk communicated to staff that the layoffs were necessary to reduce costs and increase productivity in preparation for Tesla’s next phase of growth[2].
- The company has warned investors that sales growth in 2024 could be “notably lower” than its previous targets, and it is between major product cycles[2].
- No new layoff announcements or credible rumors have been reported by TechCrunch after the April-May 2024 events, as of September 5, 2024.

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- TechCrunch’s “A comprehensive list of 2024 tech layoffs” is the sole source for resolution, and it lists Tesla’s layoffs in April and May 2024 but does not report any new events after that period[5].
- Multiple TechCrunch articles provide detailed coverage of the April-May layoffs and the context behind them[1][2][3][4].

### Limitations or Uncertainties

- The possibility of sudden, unannounced layoffs at Tesla cannot be ruled out, but as of September 5, 2024, there is no evidence of such events.
- TechCrunch’s tracker is updated regularly, but if it ceases updates or delays reporting, this could affect resolution.
- Only layoffs specifically listed under “Tesla” in the TechCrunch tracker for August or September 2024 will count for resolution.
