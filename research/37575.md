## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- US Industrial Production has been growing modestly, with YoY growth of 1.5% reported for April 2025[2][5].
- The index values for recent months show stability: March 2025 (103.89), February 2025 (104.15), and April 2025 (103.88)[2][3].
- Manufacturing, mining, and utilities all contributed positively in April, with utilities showing the largest surge (+4.3% YoY)[5].

## 2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- The Federal Reserve’s May 2025 report shows little change in industrial production in April, following a stable trend with no dramatic economic policy shifts or shocks[1].
- The backdrop includes record-high production amid tariffs, but this appears to be a continuation of existing trends rather than a sudden change[1].
- US GDP and inflation are both moderate, supporting an environment of steady industrial output[3].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The Federal Reserve’s G.17 release and FRED’s INDPRO series are the official sources for industrial production figures[1][2].
- Trading Economics and Moody’s Analytics provide up-to-date summaries and consensus forecasts[4][5].
- The Financial Forecast Center provides specific monthly index forecasts with error margins[3].

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- The May 2025 figure will be preliminary and may be revised later, but the forecast resolves on the first-announced number.
- Forecast model error is ±0.25 index points, translating to small uncertainties in the YoY percent calculation[3].
- Monthly volatility could cause minor deviations in the reported value.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given:
- April 2025 YoY growth: 1.49% (rounded)[2][5]
- May 2025 index forecast: 103.78[3]
- May 2024 estimated index: 102.33[2]
- Projected YoY growth for May 2025: \(\frac{103.78 - 102.33}{102.33} \approx 1.42\%\)

**Forecast:**  
- The most likely YoY growth rate for US Industrial Production in May 2025 is **1.4%–1.5%**.
- Central estimate: **1.4% YoY**.
- 90% confidence interval: **[1.2%, 1.6%]**, reflecting forecast error and monthly volatility.
