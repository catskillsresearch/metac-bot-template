## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of October 2024, no commercially available vehicle in the US has achieved SAE Level 5 autonomy—defined as being capable of driving in all conditions and locations without any need for human intervention[1][5].
- Most autonomous vehicle (AV) deployments, such as those from Waymo and Cruise, are operating at SAE Level 4 in limited, geofenced urban areas and are not yet available for general consumer purchase[5].
- Regulatory oversight remains fragmented, with 35 states having their own AV laws, while the federal government is only just beginning to propose a voluntary, national oversight framework (AV STEP)[1][2][3][4].
- The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is easing restrictions and seeking to modernize safety standards to facilitate broader AV deployment, but no federal standards for Level 5 vehicles currently exist[3][5].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- In December 2024, NHTSA proposed a new voluntary national framework (AV STEP) for safety and performance reporting of automated driving systems, signaling growing federal support for AV deployment but stopping short of mandatory standards[3].
- In April 2025, NHTSA announced significant regulatory changes to make it easier for U.S.-built autonomous vehicles to be deployed on public roads and relaxed some crash reporting requirements[5].
- There is an explicit push by policymakers to accelerate AV innovation and establish a single national standard, but implementation and enforcement remain in early stages[5].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- NHTSA press releases and regulatory updates[3][5]
- Autonomous Vehicle Industry Association reports and AV law tracking[1][2][4]
- Public statements and deployments from major AV companies (e.g., Tesla, Waymo, GM Cruise)[5]

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- The technical leap from Level 4 (conditional autonomy) to Level 5 (universal, unconditional autonomy) remains a significant challenge. All-weather, all-location, and unstructured environment driving is not yet solved.
- Regulatory harmonization, public trust, liability, insurance, and infrastructure adaptation are all unresolved issues that could delay or fragment adoption.
- Consumer preference, legacy market demand for manual or lower-level vehicles, and potential regulatory carve-outs may keep a non-trivial minority of new vehicles below Level 5, even in 2075.
- Measurement in 2075 may be complicated by ambiguous definitions, incomplete sales data, or the emergence of new vehicle types.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the current trajectory:
- It is plausible that by 2075, most new vehicles will have SAE Level 5 autonomy, assuming continued technical progress and supportive regulation.
- However, due to the substantial technical and deployment hurdles, and possible outliers in niche use cases or consumer/regulatory demand, the probability that at least 95% of all new 4+ wheel road vehicles sold in the US in 2075 will have Level 5 autonomy is **estimated at 70–85%**.
