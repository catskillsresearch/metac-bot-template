# Forecasting FBI Firearms Background Checks for November 2024

To assess whether FBI firearms background checks will exceed 2.8 million in November 2024, we need to examine historical trends, recent patterns, and factors that might influence firearm purchases in the coming months.

## Historical Trends and Current Status

The FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) has seen significant growth since its inception. When NICS first launched in November 1998, it processed 892,840 firearm background checks in its first complete month of operation. By 2022, this number had grown dramatically to approximately 2.6 million checks per month, with a total of 31.6 million checks processed throughout the year[1].

Recent years have shown notable patterns:

- 2023 was the fourth highest year on record for firearm sales, trailing only behind 2020, 2021, and 2022[3]
- The total firearm sales for 2023 reached nearly 15.9 million, slightly lower than the 2022 total of 16.4 million[3]
- The fourth quarter of 2023 (October, November, and December) saw more than 4.7 million firearm sales, representing a 4.6% increase over Q4 2022[3]
- December 2023 showed a 1.6% increase compared to December 2022[3]
- Americans have purchased nearly 1.4 million firearms per month in 2024[4]

Particularly relevant is that the last three months of 2023 reversed a years-long downward trend in gun-related background checks[3]. This reversal, combined with the description that year-over-year monthly numbers have begun trending upward again starting in July 2024, suggests a potential continued increase heading into November 2024.

## Factors Potentially Affecting November 2024 Numbers

Several factors could influence the number of background checks in November 2024:

**Presidential Election Impact**: The November 2024 presidential election could significantly impact firearm sales. As noted in the search results, the two major presidential candidates have divergent stances on firearm rights, which matters to voters' sense of safety[4]. Historically, elections and potential policy changes have driven increases in firearm purchases.

**Seasonal Patterns**: November and December are typically among the busiest months for gun sales[5]. This seasonal pattern, combined with the already upward trend starting in July 2024, could push November numbers higher.

**Regulatory Environment**: As of January 1, 2024, 17 states and the District of Columbia have comprehensive background check laws that apply to all firearm sales[2]. Any changes to these regulations or federal policies could affect purchase patterns.

## Measurement Limitations and Uncertainties

Several limitations affect the accuracy of NICS data as a measure of actual firearm sales:

- The NICS database has well-known limitations and fails to correctly identify all people prohibited from having firearms[2]
- States and court staff struggle to keep NICS records up to date, leading to gaps in the underlying database[2]
- The FBI sometimes delays background checks to conduct additional research, and in some cases, these checks are never completed[5]
- The NICS numbers include checks for purposes other than purchases, such as permit renewals, though the data cited from NSSF adjusts for this by filtering out non-purchase checks[3]

## Conclusion

Based on the available data, several factors suggest that November 2024 could see background checks exceed 2.8 million:

1. The historical upward trend in firearm background checks
2. The recent reversal of the downward trend in late 2023
3. The reported increase in year-over-year numbers starting in July 2024
4. The typical seasonal increase in November and December
5. The potential impact of the November 2024 presidential election

However, actual numbers will depend on various factors including political developments, regulatory changes, and economic conditions in the weeks leading up to November 2024.
