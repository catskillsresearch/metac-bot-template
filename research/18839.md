## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- **AGI timelines**: Multiple surveys of AI experts, including Muller & Bostrom (2012/2013) and more recent industry leaders (e.g., Hinton, Hassabis, Huang, Aschenbrenner), forecast a 50% chance of AGI between 2040–2060, with plausible scenarios as early as 2027–2030. Progress in large language models and general AI capabilities has accelerated these expectations[1][2].
- **Mind uploading timelines**: Mind uploading, defined as high-fidelity whole brain emulation with preservation of psychological continuity, remains speculative. Authoritative roadmaps (e.g., Sandberg & Bostrom, 2008) and community forecasts (Metaculus, Manifold) consistently rate the probability of mind uploading before AGI as extremely low, citing lack of progress in essential technologies such as brain scanning, connectomics, and simulation at the necessary scale[3][4].

## 2. Recent Announcements/Policies

- **AGI**: Major AI labs have publicly committed to AGI development, and there is significant commercial and academic investment. Policy discussions focus on managing risks from advanced AI, not on pausing AGI in favor of alternative "transcendence" strategies[2].
- **Mind uploading**: There have been no significant announcements or breakthroughs in human brain emulation as of December 2023. Most public discussion remains theoretical[3][4].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- **Surveys of AI experts**: Provide rigorous forecasts for AGI timelines[1][2].
- **Community forecasting platforms (Metaculus, Manifold)**: Aggregate expert and crowd predictions on both AGI and mind uploading, showing consistently low probability for mind uploading first[3].
- **Academic roadmaps (Sandberg & Bostrom, 2008)**: Detail the technical barriers for mind uploading, which remain unresolved[3].

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- **Definitions**: Both "AGI" and "mind uploading" lack universally accepted operational definitions, complicating resolution criteria.
- **Forecasting uncertainty**: Timelines for transformative technologies are inherently uncertain; expert opinion can shift rapidly in response to new breakthroughs.
- **Conditional scenarios**: The only plausible path for mind uploading first involves unprecedented global coordination to pause AGI development—a scenario for which there is little precedent or current policy momentum.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the rapid acceleration in AI capabilities, ongoing massive investment in AGI, and the lack of substantive progress or investment in mind uploading, the probability that mind uploading will occur before AGI remains extremely low—likely well below 10% as of late 2023, and plausibly much lower[1][2][3]. The dominant view among both experts and forecasters is that AGI will arrive first, with mind uploading, if ever feasible, arriving later—potentially enabled by AGI itself.
