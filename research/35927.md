### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of late February and early March 2025, the Department of Education (ED) is ranked #1 in total savings on DOGE's Agency Efficiency Leaderboard, with the General Services Administration (GSA) consistently ranked #2[1][3][4][5].
- The leaderboard reflects savings from contract terminations, grant cancellations, and other efficiency measures, with DOGE claiming $65 billion in total estimated savings across agencies[1][3][5].
- ED's lead is attributed to aggressive cuts, particularly in grants and contracts related to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives[4].

### Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Metric

- DOGE launched the Agency Efficiency Leaderboard in February 2025, increasing transparency and competition among agencies to cut costs[1][3][4].
- The Department of Education has publicized its cost-cutting measures, including nearly $900 million in canceled contracts and grants[4].
- There have been no major announcements or policy changes reported between late February and early March 2025 that would suggest GSA is poised to overtake ED in total savings.

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The official DOGE Agency Efficiency Leaderboard is available at doge.gov/savings[2].
- Multiple news outlets, including CryptoRank, Fox Business, Campus Reform, and ABC News, have reported on the leaderboard standings and DOGE's methodology[1][3][4][5].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- Savings figures are based on DOGE's calculations, which may differ from final numbers posted by the Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS) due to reporting lags and methodological differences[3][5].
- The leaderboard is updated periodically, and there may be discrepancies or delays in reflecting the most current data[3][5].
- Unless there is a significant, unreported change in GSA's cost-cutting performance, it is unlikely GSA will surpass ED by April 1, 2025.

### Conclusion

Based on all available information as of March 13, 2025, the General Services Administration is not ranked #1 in Most Total Savings on DOGE's Agency Efficiency Leaderboard. The Department of Education holds the top spot, and there is no evidence suggesting this will change by April 1, 2025.
