## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The 48E Clean Electricity Investment Tax Credit (ITC) was enacted by the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act and is scheduled to phase out no earlier than 2032, or when U.S. power-sector greenhouse gas emissions fall below 25% of 2022 levels[1][5].
- The credit supports a wide range of zero-GHG generation and storage technologies and offers substantial bonus percentages for domestic content, energy communities, and wage/apprenticeship qualifications[1][5].
- Historically, Republican lawmakers have targeted the IRA’s clean energy tax credits for repeal or rollback, citing fiscal cost and "green corporate welfare" as major concerns[2].
- The 2024 election resulted in a Republican trifecta (White House, Senate, House), but the House majority is slim, with many GOP representatives from clean energy-benefiting districts facing competitive re-elections.

## Recent Announcements and Policy Developments

- On May 22, 2025, the House of Representatives passed the "One Big Beautiful Bill," a major package to scale back clean energy tax credits, including 48E, with all votes along party lines[2].
- Previous House bills, such as the Limit, Save, Grow Act of 2023, included provisions to repeal or sharply reduce funding for IRA-related clean energy incentives.
- There is ongoing internal GOP debate: some favor immediate repeal of credits like 48E, while others prefer a gradual phase-out or safe harbor for ongoing projects, in order to cushion the impact on district economies and project pipelines.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- The Senate’s position remains less clear: while unified government can facilitate reconciliation-driven repeal, internal GOP divisions and the presence of swing-district representatives could lead to amendments introducing safe harbors or setting a later sunset.
- Timing is critical: for an outcome to count as a sunset reduction, legislation must be enacted before January 1, 2026.
- The possibility remains that only bonus "adders" (for labor or domestic content) might be removed, not the entire 48E credit.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given:
- Active House passage of a rollback bill targeting 48E[2],
- The ability of the Senate to use budget reconciliation for simple-majority passage,
- Divisions among Republicans, especially in the House, regarding immediate repeal or phase-out strategies,
- The precedent of past House bills including both immediate repeals and sunset-with-safe-harbor approaches,

The most likely outcome before January 1, 2026, is:

| Sunset Option                                 | Probability | Rationale                                                                                 |
|-----------------------------------------------|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 2025-2026 sunset w/ safe harbor               | ~50%        | GOP likely to pass a rollback, but pressure from swing districts and industry to grandfather ongoing projects—making a safe harbor highly probable.                     |
| 2025-2026 sunset w/o safe harbor              | ~20%        | Immediate repeal is possible but less likely due to project disruption and political risks. |
| 2027-2028 or later sunsets, with/without safe harbor | ~20%        | Possible if compromise is reached, but the House bill signals a push for earlier action.     |
| No sunset reduction before 2026               | ~10%        | Only if Senate negotiations stall or GOP divisions block passage by the end of 2025.        |

**In summary:** The most probable outcome is a 2025-2026 sunset of 48E with a safe harbor for ongoing projects, as indicated by recent House action and the political need to avoid disrupting current clean energy investments. However, there is still a notable chance of a more abrupt sunset or a scenario where no change is passed before 2026[2].
