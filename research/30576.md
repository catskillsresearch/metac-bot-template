### Key Factual Information Relevant to the Forecast

**1. Historical Trends and Current Status**
- As of November 22, 2024, the latest post on SpaceX’s Updates page was dated September 10, 2024, indicating a gap of over two months without new content.
- This pattern suggests that SpaceX does not update its official Updates page frequently, even during periods of significant operational activity.

**2. Upcoming SpaceX Activities**
- SpaceX has major launches scheduled before the end of 2024, notably the SXM-9 mission set for December 5, 2024[1].
- While such events sometimes prompt updates, SpaceX has not consistently posted about every launch or milestone on its Updates page in recent years.

**3. Recent Announcements and Communication Practices**
- SpaceX frequently shares news and updates through alternative channels, including social media, press releases, and NASA blogs.
- For example, NASA’s coverage of the Crew-9 mission in September 2024 was primarily through NASA’s own website and blog, not the SpaceX Updates page[4].
- There is no public indication of a policy change that would increase the frequency of posts on the official Updates page.

**4. Authoritative Source for Verification**
- The only source that counts for resolution is the SpaceX Updates page itself, as specified in the question’s fine print.
- If the page is inaccessible when checked, the question resolves as "No" (i.e., as if a new post had appeared).

**5. Limitations and Uncertainties**
- SpaceX’s posting schedule is irregular and not strictly correlated with launch activity or major announcements.
- The possibility of the Updates page being down at the time of resolution introduces additional uncertainty, as this would automatically resolve the question as "No" regardless of actual posting activity.

### Summary Table: Key Factors

| Factor                         | Evidence as of 2024-11-29                  | Implication for Forecast                |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Last Updates page post        | September 10, 2024                         | >2 months gap, infrequent updates       |
| Major launches before 2025    | SXM-9 on December 5, 2024[1]               | May prompt update, but not guaranteed   |
| Communication channels        | Social media, NASA blogs, press releases   | Updates page not always prioritized     |
| Policy changes                | None known                                  | No reason to expect increased posting   |
| Resolution criteria           | Updates page only; page down = "No"        | Adds uncertainty                        |

### Conclusion

- The most relevant facts indicate that SpaceX’s Updates page is updated infrequently, with the last post over two months prior to the forecast window.
- Despite upcoming launches, there is no guarantee these will result in new posts on the Updates page.
- The possibility of the page being down at the time of resolution adds a small but non-negligible chance the question resolves as "No" even if no new post is made.

**In summary:** The available evidence as of November 29, 2024, points to a low but nonzero probability that SpaceX will make a new post on its Updates page before January 1, 2025, with the most likely scenario being continued infrequent updates unless a major event prompts a change in behavior.
