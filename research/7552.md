## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- After the 2017 Charlottesville rally and especially following the 2020 George Floyd protests, the removal and defacement of Confederate monuments accelerated across the United States[3]. Many such monuments have been removed, relocated, or vandalized in recent years[3].
- Stone Mountain, however, is unique: it is the largest Confederate memorial in the U.S., featuring a vast carving of Confederate leaders[5]. Efforts to remove or alter it have met strong legal and political resistance[1][4].
- As of 2021 and extending into 2024-2025, Georgia state law (SB 77, 2019) criminalizes removal, destruction, or alteration of public monuments, with additional penalties for any such actions[1][4].
- The Stone Mountain Memorial Association (SMMA) and state authorities remain opposed to physical changes, focusing instead on contextualizing the site and relocating Confederate flags away from central areas[2][4].
- Democratic efforts to change the law or remove Confederate references have consistently stalled in the Georgia legislature[1].

## 2. Recent Announcements and Policies

- In 2021, SMMA proposed reorienting the park’s focus away from the Confederacy and adding new educational context, without altering the carving itself[1][2].
- Georgia’s governor and legislature have repeatedly reaffirmed their commitment to protecting the Stone Mountain carving and have increased penalties for unauthorized alteration[1].
- Recent legislative attempts (e.g., HB 794) to remove Confederate references failed to advance beyond committee[1].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- State laws and legislative records (SB 77, 2019; subsequent statutes)[1][4]
- Official statements and actions by the Stone Mountain Memorial Association[2][4]
- Major reporting and documentation by the Southern Poverty Law Center and historic preservation organizations[1][4]
- News coverage from Georgia Public Broadcasting and reference articles[2][3]

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- Future political shifts could alter the legal landscape, but as of 2025, the state government remains firmly opposed to alteration or removal[1].
- While the technical difficulty of defacing or destroying such a large stone carving is high, unauthorized acts are possible but would require significant effort and risk severe penalties.
- Measurement of “defacement” for this question requires damage clearly visible from a distance or in a low-resolution photograph, which sets a high bar for what qualifies.

## 5. Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the:
- Strong and explicit state legal protections,
- Consistent political opposition to removal,
- Monument’s scale and technical resilience,
- Historical failure of reform efforts,

The probability that the Stone Mountain Confederate monument will be defaced or destroyed (per the resolution criteria) before 2035 is low—substantially lower than for most other Confederate monuments in the U.S. during the same period. An estimated probability, based on current trends and protections, would be in the range of 5-15%, barring significant unforeseen political or social upheaval.
