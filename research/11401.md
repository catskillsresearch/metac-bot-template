## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- **Military Balance and Build-up:** Historically, large-scale amphibious invasions—such as the Allied D-Day landings—have required overwhelming maritime superiority, extensive logistical planning, and the ability to sustain operations over time in the face of determined resistance. The 1944 Normandy campaign saw nearly half a million casualties in three months, underscoring the extreme complexity and cost of such operations, even when the attackers had air and naval superiority[5].
- **PLA Modernization:** As of 2025, China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has made significant advances in naval and amphibious capabilities. The Chinese navy is expected to reach 395 ships, including three aircraft carriers, and has invested in new amphibious assault ships and specialized landing craft to support large-scale landings on Taiwan[5].
- **Taiwan’s Defenses:** Taiwan’s geography (mountainous interior, heavily fortified beaches) and military investments focus on asymmetric warfare—anti-ship missiles, drones, and layered air defense—aimed at raising the costs of invasion.
- **US and Allied Involvement:** The US maintains a policy of “strategic ambiguity” but demonstrates ongoing commitment to Taiwan’s defense through arms sales and military exercises. US officials have described a potential Chinese *fait accompli* invasion as a primary risk scenario, with preparedness for rapid intervention[5].

## 2. Key Differences Affecting the Forecast

- **Quality vs. Quantity:** While China now matches or exceeds the US in certain naval metrics, questions remain about PLA command experience, joint operations, and the ability to sustain large-scale amphibious operations in a contested environment[5].
- **Potential for Escalation:** Experts note that China’s most likely near-term approach would be a blockade rather than direct assault, as blockades carry lower risk and can still pressure Taiwan politically and economically[1].
- **Internal and External Constraints:** China faces unresolved concerns over military readiness, economic vulnerabilities, and potential domestic instability—all of which could temper the willingness to risk a costly and uncertain campaign[5].
- **Allied Response:** US and Japanese intervention could significantly complicate China’s operational plans, raising the risk of failure or protracted conflict[2].

## 3. Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

- **Likelihood of Invasion:** As of early 2025, expert consensus places the likelihood of a full-scale Chinese invasion at roughly 35%, with a much higher probability of limited conflict (e.g., a blockade) or continued coercion short of all-out war[1].
- **Probability of Successful Control Within Three Years:** If a full-scale invasion occurs, China’s overwhelming advantage in numbers and firepower gives it a high probability of eventually prevailing militarily. However, the complexities of amphibious operations, Taiwan’s defenses, the potential for significant US/allied intervention, and the possibility of high casualties and protracted resistance introduce major risks.
- **Expert Views:** Analysts cited by CNN and other sources judge that while China "probably can" take the island if absolutely determined, any victory is likely to be “extremely bloody” and not guaranteed within a short timeline—especially if US and allied forces intervene[5][1].
- **Uncertainties:** There are major uncertainties around:
  - The effectiveness and speed of PLA joint operations.
  - The scale and rapidity of US/allied intervention.
  - The resilience of Taiwan’s defenses and population.
  - The willingness of Chinese leadership to accept enormous casualties and economic consequences.

Given these factors, the most authoritative open-source estimates as of mid-2025 suggest that if China launches a full-scale invasion of Taiwan before 2035, the probability that it would establish de facto control over the entire main island within three years is **less than 50% but higher than negligible—plausibly in the 30–45% range**, depending on the scale and effectiveness of external intervention[1][5][2].

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- Lack of access to classified intelligence on PLA readiness and allied contingency plans.
- Potential for technological surprise or rapid changes in local or global political dynamics.
- The definition of “de facto control” may be subject to interpretation, especially if insurgency or partial resistance continues.
