# Blue Ghost Mission 1: Lunar Landing Forecast

Based on information available as of February 28, 2025, here is an analysis of Blue Ghost Mission 1's prospects for a successful lunar landing before April 1, 2025.

## Current Mission Status

Firefly Aerospace's Blue Ghost lunar lander has successfully completed several critical mission milestones and appears to be on track for its planned March 2, 2025 landing date:

- On February 14, 2025, Blue Ghost successfully completed a four-minute lunar orbit insertion burn, described as "the longest and most challenging burn conducted to date by the lander's main engine and reaction control system thrusters"[2]
- During this lunar orbit insertion burn, Blue Ghost captured an image of the Moon's South Pole[2]
- As of February 26, 2025, Firefly Aerospace announced they were less than 4 days from landing on the Moon[5]
- On February 24, 2025, Blue Ghost completed its third lunar orbit maneuver that inserted the spacecraft into a near-circular low lunar orbit approximately 100 km above the lunar surface[5]

## Landing Plan and Timeline

The mission timeline indicates:

- Blue Ghost Mission 1 is specifically targeted to land on Sunday, March 2, 2025, at 3:45 a.m. EST[2]
- The final autonomous descent will take approximately one hour, beginning with a Descent Orbit Insertion - a 19-second burn at the 100-km perilune that will place Blue Ghost on its final descent trajectory[5]
- Firefly plans to start a joint livestream with NASA at 1:20 am CST on March 2, approximately 75 minutes before the expected touchdown[5]

## Mission Objectives and Operations

If the landing is successful:

- Upon touchdown, Blue Ghost will operate 10 NASA instruments for a complete lunar day (approximately 14 Earth days)[5]
- The lander will capture the lunar sunset on March 16 before continuing to operate several hours into the lunar night[5]
- The mission is part of NASA's Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) initiative and Artemis campaign[1]

## Assessment of Success Probability

Based on the information available before February 28, 2025:

- The mission has successfully completed critical navigation maneuvers including lunar orbit insertion and achieving the proper low lunar orbit
- All systems appear to be functioning nominally, with the radiator panels "moving nominally to protect Blue Ghost's subsystems from extreme temperatures"[5]
- The mission team has demonstrated precise execution of the flight plan thus far
- No technical issues or anomalies have been reported in the available information

The mission appears to be proceeding according to plan, with all major milestones achieved on schedule. While lunar landings are inherently challenging and carry risk, the available information suggests Blue Ghost is well-positioned for its landing attempt on March 2, 2025.
