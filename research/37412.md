## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- During his previous term, Donald Trump did not visit Russia, and U.S. presidential trips to Russia have historically been rare, especially amid adversarial relations.
- Since returning to office, Trump has taken unprecedented steps to engage directly with Russia, including a phone call with Putin and advancing a peace plan for Ukraine that involves significant concessions to Russia[1][2].
- As of May 16, 2025, Trump publicly stated he plans to meet with President Putin "as soon as we can set it up," reflecting an explicit intent to hold direct talks[3].

## 2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- Trump’s peace proposal for Ukraine demonstrates a willingness to break from past U.S. policy and directly negotiate with Russia[1][2].
- The Trump administration has aligned with Russia on certain United Nations votes and has publicly criticized Ukraine, signaling a shift in diplomatic posture[2].
- Despite public statements about meeting Putin soon, there are no reports as of May 30, 2025, confirming a scheduled Trump trip to Russia or finalized travel arrangements[3].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- National Review reports Trump’s explicit statement of intent to meet with Putin soon[3].
- Axios and Wikipedia provide context on Trump’s recent peace plan and diplomatic maneuvers related to Russia and Ukraine[1][2].
- Wikipedia maintains a list of Trump’s international trips for verification of any new visits.

## 4. Limitations or Uncertainties in Measurement

- No official announcement or scheduling of a Trump Russia visit as of May 30, 2025.
- Diplomatic and security considerations could delay or prevent a high-profile U.S.-Russia summit.
- Media reports may lag actual planning or last-minute changes.
- The situation could rapidly evolve, especially given the volatile state of Russia-Ukraine relations.

## Probabilistic Assessment

Given:
- The unprecedented openness to direct engagement with Russia,
- Trump’s explicit, recent statement of intent to meet Putin,
- The lack of a confirmed trip or public scheduling as of the current date,
- And the short timeframe until July 1, 2025,

**An adjusted probabilistic estimate would place the likelihood of Trump visiting Russia before July 1, 2025, as elevated compared to historical precedent but still below 50%.** The event is plausible and more likely than in previous years, but significant uncertainties and obstacles remain.
