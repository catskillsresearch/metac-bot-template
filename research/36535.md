## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The US Dollar Index (DXY) started in 1973 at 100; its all-time high was nearly 165 (1984), and its all-time low was about 70 (2007–2008). Since 2015, the DXY has generally ranged between 90 and 105, rarely dipping below 90 for any sustained period[3].
- As of late May 2025, the DXY is trading near 104. Recent turbulence—especially after President Trump's April 2025 tariff announcements—saw the DXY drop below key technical levels, but not below 99[4].
- Recent bearish signals are present: DXY fell below its 200-day simple moving average (104.63), with technical support at 99.01 (set in April 2025). However, even this short-term weakness is well above the 88 threshold[4].

## 2. Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the DXY

- The Trump administration's renewed tariffs (10% on all imports, 60% on Chinese goods) are inflationary but have tended to support the dollar by delaying expected Federal Reserve rate cuts, keeping US yields attractive[5].
- Despite expectations that tariffs might weaken the dollar, the reaction has been mixed: after the April 2025 Rose Garden announcement, the dollar fell to a 10-year low against the Swiss franc and a 3-year low against the euro, revealing the complexity and unpredictability of policy impacts[4].
- Uncertainty about the Federal Reserve's leadership (possible replacement of Jerome Powell) adds risk, as attacks on Fed independence could undermine confidence and accelerate dollar weakness, though such a move would be highly destabilizing and is not currently priced as a base case[4].

## 3. Authoritative Forecasts and Reference Cases

- Most reputable forecasts for 2025–2029 do not project a DXY average below 88 at any point. For example, Longforecast's projections for 2025–2027 show DXY remaining well above 90, with 2025 averages around 95–97[1].
- J.P. Morgan and other major institutions expect dollar strength to persist or at least stabilize into 2025, underpinned by US economic resilience and high relative interest rates[2].
- Even in technical and market commentary, the focus is on support at 99, with no suggestion of a move toward the 88 level barring a major crisis or policy error[4][5].

## 4. Key Differences and Uncertainties

- Unlike the 2007–2008 period (when DXY last dropped below 88), the current environment features higher US interest rates, relatively strong economic growth, and no global financial crisis. These factors provide significant support for the dollar[2][5].
- However, risks exist: escalation of trade wars, a shock to Fed credibility, or a coordinated global move away from the dollar could accelerate declines. Such scenarios are outlier risks as of May 2025.
- Measurement is straightforward—arithmetic mean of DXY close prices over any 90-calendar-day window, as reported by Yahoo Finance. However, should Yahoo data become unavailable or erroneous, the resolution source may change, introducing a minor uncertainty.

## 5. Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

**Given current data as of May 2025, the probability that the DXY will drop below an average of 88 for any 90-day period before January 20, 2029 is low—likely under 10%.** Historical context, current technical levels, and expert forecasts all point to continued support for the dollar. Only an extreme, unexpected policy or financial shock would plausibly push the DXY to a sustained sub-88 average within the forecast window[1][2][4][5].
