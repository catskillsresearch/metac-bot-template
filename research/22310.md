## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Lula has won three presidential elections (2002, 2006, 2022), always leading in the first round and winning the runoff[2].
- The PT has dominated presidential politics since 2002, only losing in 2018 when Lula was barred from running[2].
- Lula left office in 2011 with a record-high approval rating of 87%, after periods of strong economic growth and social progress[5].

## 2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- Lula’s approval rating has sharply declined to 24% as of February 2025, the lowest across his three terms[4][5]. This is driven by:
  - Economic stagnation and persistent inflation[4]
  - Discontent even among core supporters: approval among low-income voters dropped from 44% to 29%, and in the Northeast from 49% to 33%[4].
  - Social policies such as increased minimum wage and social benefit expansions have been announced but have not reversed the negative trend[4].
- Disapproval now exceeds 40%, a significant warning sign for an incumbent seeking reelection[5].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Statista and Datafolha for approval/disapproval ratings[1][4]
- Pew Research Center for comparative favorability with Bolsonaro[3]
- Le Monde and Wikipedia for historical and contextual narrative[2][5]

## 4. Limitations or Uncertainties in Measurement

- It remains unclear who Lula’s main opponents will be in 2026; Bolsonaro is ineligible, but the opposition could coalesce around a new figure[4][5].
- Public opinion can shift substantially over 18 months, depending on economic trends, social unrest, or political events.
- Approval ratings do not perfectly predict electoral outcomes, especially in a highly polarized context.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

- Lula’s current approval rating is historically low for a sitting president seeking reelection, and his disapproval is at record highs[4][5].
- The PT’s dominance and Lula’s past electoral strength are offset by the current economic malaise and loss of support in key demographics[4][5].
- With Bolsonaro out, the opposition is less consolidated, but Lula may still face difficulty reaching the >50% threshold in either round.
- As of early 2025, Lula’s chances of reelection in 2026 appear significantly reduced compared to his previous campaigns. While not out of contention, the probability is best described as below 50%, with current trends suggesting he is more likely to lose than win unless there is a notable recovery in approval or a fragmented opposition[4][5].
