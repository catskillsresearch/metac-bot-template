# Forecasting Federal Court Rulings on Clean Air Act Challenges

Recent Supreme Court decisions have significantly altered the legal landscape for environmental regulations, particularly those implemented under the Clean Air Act. This analysis examines relevant court decisions and legal developments that could impact whether a federal court might rule against a major Clean Air Act provision before October 1, 2024.

## Recent Court Decisions Affecting EPA Authority

The Supreme Court has recently demonstrated increasing skepticism toward federal regulatory agencies, including the EPA. In June 2024, the Court issued a string of decisions expressing remarkable hostility to federal regulatory agencies and public health protections[1]. These decisions have created a more challenging environment for agencies attempting to implement and enforce environmental regulations.

On June 27, 2024, the Supreme Court temporarily blocked the EPA's "Good Neighbor" air pollution rule by a 5-4 vote[3]. This rule was designed to reduce air pollution from power plants and other industrial facilities in 23 states under the Clean Air Act's "good neighbor provision," which requires upwind states to reduce emissions that affect air quality in downwind states[3]. Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote for the majority in this decision[3].

Not all recent court decisions have gone against the EPA. On March 4, 2024, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld key parts of a 2015 EPA rule that required over 30 states to close loopholes allowing companies to emit harmful air toxins during a facility's start-up, shut down, and malfunction periods[4]. The court found that the EPA had the authority to order states to bring their air regulations into compliance with the Clean Air Act and that it is illegal for polluters to evade civil penalties via an "affirmative defense" when claiming facility malfunctions[4].

Similarly, on April 9, 2024, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed a decision upholding the EPA's reinstatement of a California waiver under the Clean Air Act, which allows California to set stricter automobile emissions standards than federal requirements[5].

## Shifting Legal Landscape for Environmental Regulations

The recent Supreme Court decisions have created significant uncertainty and instability in environmental law. Justice Jackson warned of a coming "tsunami of lawsuits against agencies" that "has the potential to devastate the function of the Federal Government"[1]. These decisions make it harder for agencies to fulfill their regulatory missions, produce legal uncertainty, embolden opponents of environmental regulation, and give both individual lower court judges and the Supreme Court greater control over the fate of regulations[1].

The Court has abandoned longstanding norms, resulting in a tremendously shifted legal landscape for federal agencies tackling air pollution, public health, and energy issues[1]. Agencies now face a new array of hurdles that will make it more difficult to issue regulations necessary to address climate change and protect public health[1].

## Potential for Successful Challenges to Clean Air Act Provisions

With the Supreme Court's recent decisions, activist judges may be more emboldened to strike down environmental regulations based on "contrived reasoning and incomplete analysis"[1]. The Court's opinion in the Good Neighbor case suggests that the Justices are "just second-guessing EPA's approach to carrying out its duty under the Clean Air Act to reduce smog pollution"[2].

This judicial environment creates fertile ground for challenges to major Clean Air Act provisions. The Court's willingness to intervene in EPA rulemaking through its emergency appeals or "shadow docket," as demonstrated in the Good Neighbor case[3], suggests that challenges to other Clean Air Act provisions could receive similar treatment.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

While the legal landscape has shifted significantly, predicting specific court outcomes remains challenging. The full extent of the fallout from the Supreme Court's recent decisions remains to be seen[1]. Different federal courts may interpret these precedents differently, and the specific facts of each case will play a crucial role in determining outcomes.

Additionally, while the D.C. Circuit has upheld some EPA authorities under the Clean Air Act in recent months[4][5], these decisions preceded the Supreme Court's most recent rulings. Future challenges may be evaluated under the new precedents established by the Court.

## Conclusion

Based on the available information, there is a significant risk that a federal court could rule in favor of a challenge to a major Clean Air Act provision before October 1, 2024. The Supreme Court's recent decisions have created a judicial environment more hostile to agency interpretations and environmental regulations. However, the specific outcome will depend on which challenges reach the courts in this timeframe and how individual judges apply the Court's recent precedents to those cases.
