# Alta Ski Resort Opening Forecast for November 22, 2024

Based on available information prior to November 12, 2024, there is strong evidence that Alta ski resort is planning to open on November 22, 2024. Below is an analysis of relevant factors that would help forecast whether Alta will be listed as "Open" on On the Snow's Ski Report by this date.

## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

Alta Ski Area has a consistent pattern of opening in late November. For the 2023-24 season, Alta opened on Saturday, November 25th with 65.5 inches of season-to-date snowfall[3]. This historical data point provides context for typical opening timeframes at this resort.

The resort typically opens with limited terrain initially. For example, during previous openings, they have recommended "expert skiers only given the current conditions" with "limited groomed terrain available"[1].

## Recent Announcements Affecting Opening Date

The most definitive information comes from Alta's official communications and industry reports:

1. Alta Ski Area has officially announced that "Our 87th winter starts November 22nd" for the 2024-25 season[1]. This is explicitly stated as their opening weekend, running from Friday, November 22nd through Sunday, November 24th.

2. According to Ski Utah's compilation of 2024-25 Utah Ski Resort Opening Dates, Alta Ski Area's anticipated winter opening date is November 22, 2024[2]. This aligns with Alta's own announcement.

3. For the opening weekend, Alta has specified operational details including:
   - Collins lift operating from 9:15am–4:30pm
   - Wildcat lift operating from 9:15am–4pm
   - Transfer Tow operating from 8am–5pm
   - Access to the Albion Basin through the Sugarloaf corridor[1]

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

The most authoritative source for this information is Alta Ski Area's own website, which explicitly states their planned opening date of November 22, 2024[1]. This is corroborated by Ski Utah, an authoritative industry source that compiles opening dates for all Utah ski resorts[2].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors could potentially affect whether Alta opens as scheduled:

1. **Weather and snow conditions**: While Alta has announced November 22nd as their opening date, actual opening is contingent on sufficient snowfall. The resort has noted that initial conditions will be limited, recommending "expert skiers only given the current conditions"[1].

2. **Operational readiness**: The announced opening includes specific lifts (Collins, Wildcat, and Transfer Tow), but full resort access will be limited initially[1].

3. **Historical variability**: While Alta typically opens in late November, exact opening dates can shift based on conditions. For the previous 2023-24 season, they opened on November 25th[3].

Based on the available information, Alta Ski Area is officially planning to open on November 22, 2024, though actual opening will depend on snow conditions and operational readiness as that date approaches.
