## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- In the 2020 general election, Pennsylvania saw a significant partisan split in mail and absentee ballot returns. According to data from the U.S. Elections Project, as of late October 2020, over 66% of returned mail ballots in Pennsylvania were from registered Democrats, with Republicans making up a much smaller share. This was attributed to Democratic encouragement of mail voting during the COVID-19 pandemic, while Republicans were more likely to vote in person[2].
- Since 2020, there has been a trend toward narrowing the partisan gap in mail ballot usage, as Republican skepticism toward mail voting has lessened somewhat, but Democrats have continued to dominate mail ballot requests and returns in Pennsylvania.
- As of early 2024, there is no evidence of a dramatic shift in partisan mail ballot behavior in Pennsylvania. Democrats are still expected to make up a majority of mail and absentee ballot returns, though the exact proportion may fluctuate depending on turnout efforts and voter preferences[5].

## Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- No major changes to Pennsylvania's mail voting laws or procedures have been announced for 2024 that would significantly alter the partisan composition of mail ballot returns[5].
- Both parties continue to encourage their voters to utilize mail voting, but Democrats have maintained a stronger emphasis on this method since 2020.

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The VoteHub Early Voting Tracker is the only source that will be used for resolution, as specified in the question[1].
- Additional data on early voting and mail ballot returns by party in Pennsylvania can be found at the U.S. Elections Project and TargetSmart, which provide near real-time data and historical context[2][4].

## Limitations or Uncertainties in Measurement

- The exact proportion of mail and absentee ballot returns by party in Pennsylvania for 2024 is not available as of October 24, 2024, in the provided sources.
- VoteHub's methodology for categorizing party affiliation is not detailed in the search results, but it is likely based on voter registration data, which is generally reliable in Pennsylvania.
- There is always some uncertainty in real-time reporting, as data may lag or be updated after the fact.

## Summary

Based on historical trends, it is likely—but not certain—that Democrats will comprise a majority, and possibly two-thirds or more, of mail and absentee ballot returns in Pennsylvania as reported by VoteHub's tracker on October 31, 2024. However, without direct 2024 data, this cannot be confirmed with certainty. The most authoritative and up-to-date information will be available on the VoteHub Early Voting Tracker itself at the time of resolution.
