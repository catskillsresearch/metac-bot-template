# Forecasting UK PM Keir Starmer vs. Japanese PM Shiguru Ishiba Approval Ratings

To forecast whether UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer will have a higher approval rating than Japanese Prime Minister Shiguru Ishiba on April 1, 2025, I'll analyze the available data on Starmer's approval ratings and trends as of March 2025.

## Keir Starmer's Approval Rating Trends

### Current Status (March 2025)

According to YouGov polling from March 2025, Keir Starmer's favorability ratings have shown improvement:

- 32% of Britons now have a positive opinion of the prime minister, his best figure since September 2024[1]
- This represents a 6-point increase from mid-February 2025[1]
- However, 60% still hold a negative view of Starmer[1]
- Among Labour voters, 60% have a favorable view while 35% have an unfavorable one[1]

More in Common polling from early March 2025 shows:

- Starmer's net approval jumped from -39 to -28, his best score since November[2]
- Among 2024 Labour voters, his net approval rose from +20 to +35[2]
- When asked who would be the best Prime Minister among Starmer, Badenoch, or Farage, 28% of all voters backed Starmer, putting him ahead of Nigel Farage (22%)[2]

### Recent Trend (February to March 2025)

The data shows a clear upward trajectory in Starmer's approval ratings:

- In mid-February 2025, YouGov reported that 26% of Britons had a favorable view of Starmer, with 66% unfavorable (net rating of -40)[5]
- By early March, this improved to 31% favorable, according to YouGov[3]
- By mid-March, this further improved to 32% favorable[1]

## Factors Influencing Recent Approval Changes

The improvement in Starmer's ratings appears to be linked to specific events:

1. **International diplomacy**: His successful visit to Washington DC[1]
2. **Ukraine relations**: His handling of relations with Ukraine following tensions between Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy[1][3]
3. **Cross-party appeal**: YouGov noted that "Starmer's approval ratings have improved across voters from all four of the major political parties"[3]

## Limitations in Forecasting

Several important limitations affect this forecast:

1. **Lack of data on Ishiba**: The available information does not include current approval ratings for Japanese Prime Minister Shiguru Ishiba, making direct comparison impossible.

2. **Different polling methodologies**: The resolution criteria specify Morning Consult as the source for the April 1 comparison, but the available data comes from YouGov, Ipsos, and More in Common, which may use different methodologies.

3. **Volatility in approval ratings**: While Starmer's ratings show recent improvement, they remain negative overall and could fluctuate based on events occurring between mid-March and April 1.

4. **International context**: Without comparative data on international leaders' approval ratings, it's difficult to assess how Starmer's ratings compare globally.

## Conclusion

Based on available data, Keir Starmer's approval ratings show a positive trend from February to March 2025, improving from 26% to 32% favorable. However, his net approval remains negative at approximately -28. Without current data on Japanese Prime Minister Ishiba's approval ratings, it is not possible to make a direct forecast about whether Starmer will have higher ratings on April 1, 2025.

The resolution will depend on both the continuation of Starmer's positive trend and Ishiba's current and future approval levels, which are not available in the provided information.
