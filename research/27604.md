## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of August 2024, Mexico has reported a total of 49–53 confirmed mpox cases for the year, with no fatalities[3][4][5]. These cases have been distributed across several states, with Mexico City, Quintana Roo, and Jalisco reporting the highest numbers[5].
- According to Mexico’s National Epidemiological Surveillance System (SINAVE), none of the confirmed cases in 2024 are related to the new Clade 1b subvariant that is spreading in Africa and neighboring countries[4].
- Historically, Clade I mpox (including subclade 1b) has been restricted to Central Africa, with recent international spread noted only in August 2024, when Sweden confirmed the first Clade I case outside Africa[3].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- On August 14, 2024, the WHO declared mpox a public health emergency of international concern, citing the rapid spread of Clade I (notably 1b) in the Democratic Republic of Congo and neighboring countries[3][4].
- In response, Mexican health authorities issued an epidemiological alert, emphasizing increased risk due to global outbreaks and urging heightened surveillance and prompt reporting[4].
- Mexican health organizations are calling for expedited approval and distribution of mpox vaccines, and for strict adherence to surveillance protocols[3][4].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) and WHO situation reports confirm the absence of Clade I cases in Mexico as of mid-August 2024[1][2].
- National and regional news outlets, as well as official Mexican government health bulletins, consistently report that recent mpox cases in Mexico are not linked to Clade I or its subclades[3][4][5].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- Laboratory confirmation of Clade I requires genomic sequencing, which may not be performed on all suspected or probable cases, potentially delaying detection[4].
- The rapid spread of Clade I in Africa and its first detection in Europe (Sweden) increases the risk of importation, but as of August 26, 2024, no such case has been confirmed in Mexico[3][4].
- Surveillance and reporting protocols are in place, but underreporting or delays in sequencing could mean cases are missed or not promptly classified.

## Summary

As of August 26, 2024, there is no confirmed Clade I mpox infection in Mexico. While the risk is elevated and surveillance has increased following the WHO’s emergency declaration, all confirmed mpox cases in Mexico to date are unrelated to Clade I or its subclades. Confirmation before October 1, 2024, remains possible but has not occurred as of the latest available data.
