## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Dubai announced in February 2023 its intention to launch aerial taxis by 2026, using Joby Aviation eVTOL aircraft and a network of four vertiports at key locations, including Dubai International Airport, Downtown, Marina, and Palm Jumeirah[1][5].
- As of November 2024, construction began on the first vertiport (DXV), with technical design approval granted by UAE authorities in January 2025[1][2][3].
- Joby Aviation, the aircraft partner, has completed over 1,000 test flights and is advancing certification efforts for its piloted eVTOL, though no commercial passenger flights have yet been launched globally that meet the full criteria[1][5].
- Multiple sources indicate initial operations, including test and demonstration flights, could start as soon as late 2025, with full commercial launch targeted for Q1 2026[4][5].

## 2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- In February 2024, Joby, Skyports, and Dubai’s Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) signed a definitive agreement granting Joby exclusive access to Dubai’s air taxi market for six years, accelerating regulatory and infrastructure progress[1].
- The UAE’s General Civil Aviation Authority (GCAA) granted technical design approval to the first vertiport, clearing a critical regulatory hurdle[3].
- The Dubai air taxi project is a high-profile, government-backed initiative, with strong political and financial support, increasing the likelihood of timely execution[1][2].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Official announcements from Dubai’s RTA, Joby Aviation, and Skyports, as well as major news organizations covering aviation and regional developments, serve as primary verification channels[1][2][3][4][5].

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- The greatest uncertainty is the timeline for complete aircraft certification and operational approval—no eVTOL has yet achieved full commercial passenger service globally.
- Construction, infrastructure integration, and operational logistics could face unforeseen delays.
- Demonstration or test flights may begin before full commercial operations, but the question requires a ticketed passenger, successful multi-vertiport flight, and no harm/damage.
- While Dubai’s government support and regulatory environment mitigate some risks, unforeseen technical or regulatory obstacles could still arise.

## Probabilistic Assessment

Given:
- Vertiport construction is underway and on schedule for completion in 2025/2026[1][2].
- Aircraft certification and regulatory approvals are advancing, with strong government backing and exclusive market rights[1][3].
- Dubai’s history of delivering major transport innovations on or ahead of schedule.

It is highly probable (estimated 75–85%) that Dubai will achieve a successful, commercial eVTOL passenger flight meeting the specified criteria before 2027, barring major certification or operational setbacks.
