### Key Factual Information for Forecasting

- Netflix's global non-English top 10 movies list frequently sees 2-4 new entries per week, especially when major new international films are released[1].
- As of mid-February 2025, the top 10 list included a diverse set of titles, indicating regular turnover and a competitive environment for new releases[1].
- Several new non-English movies are scheduled to launch on Netflix in March 2025. Notably, "Medusa," a thriller drama directed by Yeon Sang-ho, is set to premiere on March 21, 2025, making it a strong candidate for a new entry in the week ending March 23, 2025[2].
- Other new releases in early March, such as "Adolescence" and "Little Siberia," may also contribute to new entries on the list[2].
- The number of new entries can be affected by the continued popularity of existing titles, but the presence of multiple high-profile releases increases the likelihood of several new movies debuting in the top 10.

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- The exact number of new entries depends on the global reception of new releases and the staying power of current top 10 titles.
- Netflix's weekly top 10 lists are subject to rapid changes based on viewing trends, and regional popularity can influence the global rankings.
- The official resolved answer will be available on Netflix's top 10 non-English films page for the week ending March 23, 2025.

### Authoritative Source for Verification

- Netflix's official top 10 non-English films page for the week ending March 23, 2025, will provide the definitive list.

### Summary Forecast

Given the historical pattern and the slate of new releases, the most likely outcome is that "3 or 4" movies will be new on Netflix's top 10 global non-English movies list for the week ending March 23, 2025.
