**Key Findings**  
1. **No verifiable opening weekend data** exists in the provided sources for any 2025-released "Last Breath" film as of 02/10/2025[1][3][5].  
2. **Conflicting records** show either:  
   - A 2024 film with negligible domestic gross ($3,214)[5]  
   - A 2025 film with $21M+ cumulative gross but no opening data[3]  
3. **Measurement uncertainty** arises from:  
   - Title duplication across years  
   - Lack of granular daily/weekly breakdowns for the 2025 release  

**Authoritative Sources**  
- **Box Office Mojo** ([1][4]) shows weekly performance but lacks opening weekend specifics  
- **The-Numbers.com** ([3][5]) confirms title ambiguity through conflicting financial records  

**Forecasting Limitations**  
The resolution criteria cannot be met with available pre-02/10/2025 data due to:  
1. **Missing critical data point** (opening weekend gross)  
2. **Unresolved title conflict** between 2024 and 2025 releases  
3. **Insufficient temporal alignment** between cumulative gross figures and release dates
