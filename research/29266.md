### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Revolut has been expanding its crypto offerings for several years, including obtaining a UK license for digital asset services in 2022 and launching the Revolut X crypto trading platform in May 2024[4][5].
- Multiple credible reports from September 2024 indicate that Revolut is "quite far along" in developing its own stablecoin, with sources suggesting the company has been working on the project for some time and could launch the token within the next year[1][2][3][4].
- Despite these reports, Revolut has not officially confirmed or announced a stablecoin launch. Company spokespeople have only stated that Revolut plans to "further grow" its crypto product suite and is always seeking to offer better services, without specifically mentioning a stablecoin[4].

### Recent Announcements and Policies

- As of September 2024, no official announcement regarding a stablecoin launch has been posted on Revolut’s News & Media site, which is the sole source for resolution[2][4].
- Regulatory developments in Europe and elsewhere are encouraging fintech firms to consider stablecoins, but Revolut has not publicly committed to a launch date or provided details on its News & Media site[4].

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The only source that will resolve this question is Revolut’s official News & Media site, accessible at https://www.revolut.com/news/[4].
- Third-party news reports, leaks, or spokesperson comments do not meet the resolution criteria unless they are posted as an official announcement at the specified link.

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- There is strong evidence that Revolut is preparing a stablecoin and may be close to launching it, but as of October 28, 2024, there is no official announcement on the required site.
- The timing of such an announcement is uncertain and may be influenced by regulatory approvals, market conditions, or internal strategy.
- Rumors and leaks, even from credible sources, do not guarantee an imminent official announcement.

### Summary

As of October 28, 2024, Revolut has not officially announced on its News & Media site that it is launching a stablecoin. While multiple credible sources report that Revolut is planning and preparing for a stablecoin launch, and the company is expanding its crypto offerings, there is no public commitment or formal announcement on the required platform. Therefore, while a future announcement is plausible, there is insufficient evidence to forecast with confidence that Revolut will make such an announcement before January 1, 2025.
