# Will Donald Trump Attend the Super Bowl in 2025?

Based on information available as of February 6, 2025, there is strong evidence suggesting that President Donald Trump will attend Super Bowl LIX on February 9, 2025, in New Orleans.

## Historical Context

No sitting U.S. president has ever attended a Super Bowl since the first game was played in January 1967[1]. Over the past 58 years spanning 11 presidencies, this tradition of presidential absence has remained consistent[1]. While presidents have typically avoided attending in person, there have been several instances of vice presidents attending the game:

- Mike Pence attended Super Bowl LI in February 2017
- George H.W. Bush (as VP) attended in January 1982
- Al Gore watched the Cowboys defeat the Bills in 1994[1][2]

## Current Status

Multiple credible sources have reported that President Donald Trump is expected to attend Super Bowl LIX in New Orleans on February 9, 2025:

- CBS News has reported that Trump is "set to be in attendance on Sunday for Super Bowl LIX in New Orleans"[1]
- The Associated Press confirmed Trump's attendance plans, citing a White House official[2][3]
- Punchbowl News was first to report Trump's likely attendance[3]
- A source familiar with the matter told Fox News Digital that Trump would be at the game[3]

If these reports are accurate, Trump would make history as the first sitting U.S. president to attend a Super Bowl[1][2][3].

## Additional Details

The game will feature the Kansas City Chiefs facing the Philadelphia Eagles in a rematch of Super Bowl 57[2]. Beyond simply attending, Trump is also scheduled to participate in a pre-taped interview with Fox that will air during the 3 p.m. ET hour on Super Bowl Sunday[1].

The Super Bowl will kick off at 6:30 p.m. ET at Caesars Superdome, with pregame coverage beginning at 1 p.m. ET on FOX[3].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

While multiple sources confirm Trump's planned attendance, it's worth noting:

1. Some of the confirmations come from anonymous White House officials[2][3]
2. Presidential schedules can change due to unforeseen circumstances or security concerns
3. The Times of India article mentions "an attack on New Year" that raised questions about the president's attendance, though details are limited[2]
4. There appears to be some controversy surrounding Trump's attendance, with at least one columnist criticizing the decision[3]

Given the information available as of February 6, 2025, it appears highly likely that President Trump will attend Super Bowl LIX, which would mark a historic first for a sitting U.S. president.
