# Forecasting State GDP Growth: California, Texas, or Illinois in Q3 2024

Based on available data as of December 2024, I'll analyze historical trends and current economic indicators to help forecast which state might lead in real GDP growth for Q3 2024.

## Historical Growth Patterns

In 2023, California's GDP grew at an impressive 3.7% compound annual rate, outpacing the national average. However, this growth was still behind Texas, which was one of only three states (along with Washington and Florida) that exceeded California's growth rate[5].

More recently, in Q2 2024, California's growth rate was 2.8% on an annual basis, which was 0.2 percentage points below the national growth rate[5]. This indicates a potential slowdown in California's economic momentum compared to its strong 2023 performance.

The national GDP grew by 2.8% in Q3 2024 compared to Q2 2024, providing context for overall economic conditions during the period in question[2].

## Regional Economic Indicators

### California

California has been experiencing some economic challenges in 2024:

- The UCLA Anderson Forecast projects that California will experience "a full year of sub-par growth in 2024" due to specific sectoral weaknesses[5].
- The state has been grappling with population outflows, particularly from expensive coastal areas, with a net loss of more than 900,000 residents moving to other states between 2020 and 2023[4].
- California's share of U.S. tech jobs fell from 21% at the end of 2019 to approximately 18% in Q2 2024, with tech firms continuing to shed jobs in the state[4].

### Texas

While specific Q3 2024 projections for Texas are not detailed in the available data, several factors suggest continued strong performance:

- Texas was among the top three states for GDP growth in 2023, outperforming California[5].
- The state has benefited from population inflows, including from California, which could contribute to economic growth[4].

### Illinois

The available data does not provide specific information about Illinois' recent economic performance or projections for Q3 2024.

## Q3 2024 Outlook

Preliminary data suggests that Q3 2024 was "yet another period of stellar GDP growth" nationally, with conservative estimates projecting around 2.5% growth on a seasonally adjusted annual rate (SAAR)[5]. However, state-specific projections vary:

- California is expected to continue experiencing sub-par growth throughout 2024 before rebounding in 2025-2026[5].
- The West region as a whole (including California) is expected to see economic growth decelerate through the second half of 2024[4].

## Factors Influencing State Performance

Several factors could influence Q3 2024 performance across these states:

- Interest rate changes: As the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates, this could stimulate investment, particularly in the tech sector, which is significant in California[4].
- Migration patterns: Population flows from expensive coastal states to more affordable regions benefit states like Texas while potentially constraining growth in California[4].
- Industry composition: Healthcare payroll growth has been a bright spot in the West region, while tech sector challenges have affected California more significantly[4].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

The available data has several limitations for making this forecast:

1. Specific Q3 2024 projections are not available for Texas and Illinois in the provided information.
2. The preliminary nature of Q3 2024 national data means state-specific breakdowns may vary from overall trends.
3. Economic shocks or policy changes occurring in late Q3 could significantly impact final figures.

Based on the available information, Texas appears to have momentum from its strong 2023 performance, while California is explicitly projected to have sub-par growth throughout 2024. Without specific data on Illinois, it's difficult to make a complete comparison across all three states.
