## Key Factual Information for Forecasting August 2024 Core CPI MoM

**Recent Trends and Current Status**
- The seasonally adjusted month-over-month increase in core CPI for July 2024 was 0.2%, following a 0.1% increase in June 2024[4].
- The year-over-year core CPI inflation rate has been gradually declining, with headline CPI at 2.9% YoY in July 2024, the lowest since March 2021[4].
- The main contributors to recent inflation have been shelter and motor vehicle insurance, with shelter accounting for much of the difference between current inflation and the Fed’s 2% target[4].

**Professional Forecasts and Nowcasts**
- The Philadelphia Fed’s Survey of Professional Forecasters (August 2024) projects an annualized core CPI inflation rate of 2.6% for Q3 2024[1].
- This annualized rate implies an average monthly increase of about 0.21%, which would round to 0.2% in BLS reporting.
- There is no explicit forecast from major sources as of August 22, 2024, predicting a 0.1% MoM increase for August; most projections suggest continued moderation but not a sharp drop[1][3].

**Recent Announcements and Policy Developments**
- The Federal Reserve has maintained a cautious stance, signaling potential policy easing if inflation continues to cool, as evidenced by softer July inflation data and a weaker labor market report[4].
- Private-sector forecasters expect inflation to fall below 2.5% in 2024, with core CPI moderating but still above the Fed’s 2% target for much of the year[5].

**Authoritative Sources for Verification**
- The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) will release the official August 2024 core CPI data on September 11, 2024[2].
- The Philadelphia Fed’s Survey of Professional Forecasters and the Cleveland Fed’s Inflation Nowcasting provide consensus and real-time estimates[1][3].

**Limitations and Uncertainties**
- Monthly core CPI readings are subject to volatility and rounding; a reported 0.1% could reflect an actual increase between 0.05% and 0.14%.
- Shelter costs, which are slow to adjust, remain a key source of upward pressure and could prevent a drop to 0.1% unless there is an unexpected deceleration.
- No forecast as of August 22, 2024, specifically predicts a 0.1% MoM increase for August; most consensus estimates suggest 0.2% is more likely, but a 0.1% reading is possible if disinflationary trends accelerate.
