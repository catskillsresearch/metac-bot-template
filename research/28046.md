# Will Lithium Carbonate Prices Fall Below 70,000 CNY/T Before October 1, 2024?

Lithium carbonate prices have experienced significant volatility in recent years, with a notable downward trend since late 2022. To assess whether prices will fall below 70,000 CNY/T before October 1, 2024, I'll analyze historical trends, current market conditions, and expert forecasts.

## Historical Price Trends

Lithium carbonate prices have been on a dramatic downward trajectory since reaching record highs in 2022:

- Prices peaked at approximately $81,360 per tonne in November 2022[4]
- By February 2024, prices had fallen to $20,782 per tonne, marking a 67% decrease year-on-year[4]
- As of June 2024, Chinese lithium prices were ranging between 80,000-90,000 yuan/mt ($11,022-$12,799)[1]

This decline represents one of the most significant price corrections in the lithium market in recent years, driven primarily by supply-demand imbalances.

## Current Market Conditions

Several factors are currently exerting downward pressure on lithium carbonate prices:

### Supply-Demand Imbalance

The lithium market is experiencing a persistent oversupply situation. Production capacity has expanded faster than demand growth, creating a supply glut that continues to pressure prices downward[1][2]. Despite better-than-expected EV sales in China in June 2024, the overall supply continues to outpace demand[1].

### Weak Downstream Demand

Demand from battery manufacturers and EV producers has not kept pace with earlier projections:

- EV market growth in China has slowed compared to earlier expectations[2]
- Battery inventories remain elevated as EV manufacturers show little urgency for new deals[2]
- Seasonal summer lull in Q3 2024 is further dampening demand[1]

### Trade Restrictions Impact

New tariffs are likely to affect Chinese EV exports, potentially further reducing lithium demand:

- US tariffs on Chinese EVs are set to rise from 25% to 100% in August 2024[1]
- The EU has imposed provisional countervailing duties of up to 47.6% on Chinese EV imports[1]

These trade restrictions could significantly impact Chinese EV exports to major markets, potentially reducing lithium demand and putting additional downward pressure on prices.

## Price Forecasts

Market analysts have provided several forecasts for lithium prices in 2024:

- Lithium prices in China are projected to remain in the range of 80,000-90,000 yuan/mt in early Q3 2024[1]
- A potential turnaround may occur in the latter half of Q3 2024, which is typically a peak season for lithium demand[1]
- For lithium hydroxide (a related product), prices are expected to average around 103,780 yuan per tonne in China for Q2 2024[3]

However, Chinese refining companies have begun taking measures such as cutting production or suspending operations in response to plummeting prices[4]. These supply adjustments could potentially help stabilize prices in the coming months.

## Factors That Could Drive Prices Below 70,000 CNY/T

Several factors could push lithium carbonate prices below the 70,000 CNY/T threshold before October 1, 2024:

1. **Continued oversupply**: Lithium miners are reluctant to close operations to retain market share and business relationships, suggesting supply will not decrease at market pace[2]

2. **Trade restrictions impact**: The implementation of new tariffs on Chinese EVs by both the US and EU could significantly dampen export demand[1]

3. **Seasonal factors**: The summer lull in Q3 typically sees reduced demand, which could exacerbate downward price pressure[1]

## Factors That Could Support Prices

Conversely, several factors could help maintain prices above the 70,000 CNY/T level:

1. **Production cuts**: Chinese refining companies cutting production or suspending operations could help balance the market[4]

2. **Seasonal demand increase**: The latter half of Q3 is typically a peak season for lithium demand, which could provide price support[1]

3. **Chinese EV subsidies**: Government subsidies for replacing polluting vehicles have helped boost EV sales in China, potentially supporting lithium demand[1]

## Conclusion

Based on the available information, lithium carbonate prices face significant downward pressure due to persistent oversupply, weak downstream demand, and potential impacts from trade restrictions. While prices were in the 80,000-90,000 yuan/mt range as of June 2024, the continued market imbalance suggests further declines are possible.

The combination of seasonal summer demand weakness, continued production despite low prices, and new trade barriers affecting Chinese EV exports creates substantial risk for prices to fall below 70,000 CNY/T before October 1, 2024. However, potential production cuts by Chinese refiners and seasonal demand improvements in late Q3 could provide some price support.

Given these factors, there appears to be a significant possibility that lithium carbonate prices could breach the 70,000 CNY/T threshold before October 1, 2024, though this is not certain.
