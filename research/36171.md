# Will Miami, FL Reach 90°F Before April 1, 2025?

Based on the available weather forecast data as of March 19, 2025, I can provide the following analysis regarding the likelihood of Miami, FL reaching 90 degrees Fahrenheit before April 1, 2025.

## Historical and Forecasted Temperature Trends

According to AccuWeather's forecast for Miami, FL, the highest temperatures expected for the remainder of March 2025 are:

- March 25: 86°F
- March 31: 86°F[1]

These temperatures approach but do not reach the 90°F threshold specified in the question.

However, it's worth noting that North Miami Beach (which is part of the Miami metropolitan area, approximately 10 miles from Miami International Airport) shows a more aggressive temperature forecast with:

- March 25: 88°F
- March 31: 91°F[3]

This suggests that there is potential for temperatures in the broader Miami area to reach or exceed 90°F before April 1, 2025.

## Regional Temperature Patterns

The general temperature pattern for Miami in March shows a warming trend toward the end of the month. Historical data indicates that Miami temperatures in March typically range between 69°F and 77°F on average[2], but daily highs can certainly exceed these averages.

The AccuWeather forecasts show several days in the mid-to-high 80s for Miami proper, with North Miami Beach expected to experience even warmer conditions[1][3].

## Measurement Considerations and Limitations

Several important factors should be considered when evaluating this forecast:

1. **Location Specificity**: The resolution criteria specifically reference Miami International Airport measurements, not broader Miami area temperatures.

2. **Forecast Uncertainty**: Weather forecasts become less reliable the further into the future they project. The data provided is a forecast rather than actual measurements.

3. **Microclimates**: The Miami metropolitan area has various microclimates, with coastal areas often experiencing different temperatures than inland locations like Miami International Airport.

4. **Verification Source**: The resolution will be determined using data from the Iowa Environmental Mesonet for Miami International Airport (station MIA), which may differ from AccuWeather's forecasts.

## Conclusion

Based on the available forecast data, there is a possibility that temperatures at Miami International Airport could reach 90°F before April 1, 2025, though the direct forecast for Miami proper shows a high of 86°F. The nearby North Miami Beach forecast of 91°F on March 31 suggests that temperatures in the region may exceed 90°F, but whether this will occur specifically at Miami International Airport remains uncertain.

For definitive resolution, measurements from the Iowa Environmental Mesonet for station MIA should be monitored through the end of March 2025.
