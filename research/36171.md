### Key Historical Trends and Current Status
- The average high temperature in Miami during March is typically between 77°F and 81°F[1][3][4].
- Historical records show that while Miami can occasionally reach the upper 80s in March, temperatures of 90°F or above are rare for this month[1][2].
- In some years, nearby locations have recorded highs above 90°F in late March, but these are exceptional cases rather than the norm[2].

### Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric
- There are no recent policy changes or announcements that would affect the measurement or reporting of high temperatures at Miami International Airport.

### Authoritative Sources for Verification
- The Iowa Environmental Mesonet provides archived ASOS data for Miami International Airport, which is the definitive source for verifying daily high temperatures for this question.

### Limitations and Uncertainties
- Weather forecasts beyond 7–10 days are subject to significant uncertainty, especially for extreme temperature events.
- While a 90°F day in March is possible, it is statistically unlikely based on historical averages and available forecasts as of March 19, 2025[1][3][4].
- The data referenced here is based on historical trends and forecasts available before March 19, 2025; actual observed temperatures after this date may differ.

In summary, based on historical data and available forecasts as of March 19, 2025, it is unlikely—but not impossible—that Miami International Airport will record a high temperature of 90°F or greater between the launch of this question and April 1, 2025. The event would be rare for March, and authoritative verification should be sought from the Iowa Environmental Mesonet's ASOS data[1][2][4].
