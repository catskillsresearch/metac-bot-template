# Norway's Frigate Replacement Program: Timeline and Prospects

Norway is in the process of selecting a replacement for its Fridtjof Nansen-class frigates, with a decision expected in 2025. Based on available information as of May 2025, here's an analysis of whether Norway will announce the replacement design before September 2025.

## Current Status and Timeline

The Norwegian Parliament passed a new Long-Term Plan for the Norwegian Armed Forces in June 2024, which calls for the acquisition of a minimum of five, potentially six new anti-submarine frigates with embarked anti-submarine helicopters[2]. This represents the largest planned acquisition for the Norwegian Armed Forces in the coming years[2].

In November 2024, the Norwegian Ministry of Defence announced its intention to invite the French, German, British, and US governments to begin discussions regarding potential strategic partnerships for the frigate program[2]. Critically, the Norwegian Government has stated its intention to "make its final decision on a future strategic partner during 2025"[2].

As recently as March 31, 2025, new partnerships were still forming to bid on the project, with Germany's thyssenkrupp Marine Systems and Norway's Ulstein Verft collaborating on a potential bid[1]. This suggests the selection process is still actively developing.

## Candidate Designs

Norway has downselected four potential designs for consideration:

1. British Type 26
2. German F127
3. American Constellation class
4. French FDI (Frégate de Défense et d'Intervention)[1]

Each design offers different capabilities, though all would need to focus on anti-submarine warfare to replace the current Fridtjof Nansen-class frigates, which feature eight Naval Strike Missiles and are specialized for anti-submarine operations[1][3].

## Domestic Production Considerations

An important factor in the selection process appears to be domestic production benefits. For example, if thyssenkrupp Marine Systems and Ulstein Verft were awarded the contract, "a significant portion of the construction will take place in Norway, benefiting the domestic economy"[1]. This economic consideration may influence both the selection timeline and the final decision.

## Forecast Analysis

While the Norwegian government has explicitly stated its intention to make a decision in 2025, there is no specific indication whether this will occur before or after September 2025. Several factors may influence the timeline:

1. **Complexity of negotiations**: Discussions with four different nations and their respective defense contractors involve complex technical, financial, and strategic considerations.

2. **Industrial partnerships**: As evidenced by the thyssenkrupp-Ulstein collaboration announced in March 2025, industrial partnerships are still forming[1], which could extend the decision-making process.

3. **Domestic production requirements**: Norway's emphasis on domestic production benefits suggests detailed negotiations about industrial participation, which could extend timelines.

4. **Budget considerations**: As the largest planned acquisition for the Norwegian Armed Forces, financial considerations will require careful evaluation.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

The available information does not provide a specific announcement date or month within 2025. The most recent information from April 2025 still refers to the general "2025" timeframe for the decision[5]. Additionally, defense procurement decisions of this magnitude are often subject to delays due to technical evaluations, budget considerations, or changing strategic priorities.

Given the Norwegian government's stated intention to make a decision in 2025, and the active ongoing developments in the program as recently as April 2025, it remains possible but not certain that an announcement will occur before September 2025.
