# Ethiopia-Somalia Port Dispute: Prospects for Resolution Before October 1, 2024

The dispute between Ethiopia and Somalia over the Somaliland port deal represents one of the most significant diplomatic tensions in the Horn of Africa in 2024. To assess the likelihood of a resolution before October 1, 2024, we need to examine the historical context, current negotiation status, and factors influencing potential outcomes.

## Background of the Dispute

On January 1, 2024, Ethiopia and Somaliland signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) that would grant landlocked Ethiopia access to the sea through Somaliland's territory[1][5]. Though the full content of the MoU has not been publicly released, it reportedly includes provisions for Ethiopia to lease territory in Somaliland for 20 years, establish Ethiopia-owned ports, and build naval bases near Luqhaye and Saylac in Somaliland's Awdal region[2].

In exchange for this access, Ethiopia would eventually recognize Somaliland's independence - which would make Ethiopia the first UN member state to formally recognize Somaliland[5]. This recognition component is particularly significant as Somaliland has been seeking international recognition since declaring independence from Somalia in 1991.

Somalia's response was swift and unequivocal. The Somali government:
- Rejected the MoU as a violation of Somalia's sovereignty and territorial integrity
- Accused Ethiopia of violating international norms
- Had President Mohamud sign legislation formally nullifying the agreement[2]

## Current Status of Negotiations

As of May 2025, there have been significant diplomatic efforts to resolve this dispute:

1. **Turkish-mediated talks**: Turkey has emerged as a key mediator in this conflict, hosting negotiations between Ethiopia and Somalia[4].

2. **Previous rounds of negotiations**: Two rounds of talks have already taken place:
   - The second round concluded on August 20, 2024, without a formal agreement
   - However, reports indicated that some progress was made during these discussions[4]

3. **Scheduled third round**: A third round of talks is scheduled to begin in Ankara, Turkey on September 17, 2024, providing another opportunity for resolution before the October 1 deadline.

4. **Signs of potential compromise**: As of August 12, 2024, there were indications that Ethiopia and Somalia might be approaching a "historic port deal" where Somalia would provide Ethiopia with access to a port, addressing Ethiopia's maritime needs while potentially preserving Somalia's territorial claims[4].

5. **Convergence on principles**: Turkish Foreign Affairs Minister Hakan Fidan stated after the August talks that there was "convergence on some major principles" between the parties, suggesting progress in the negotiations[4].

## Factors Influencing Potential Resolution

Several factors may influence whether an agreement can be reached before October 1:

### Factors Favoring Resolution

1. **Economic incentives**: Ethiopia, as the most populous landlocked country on Earth, has strong economic motivations to secure sea access, which may drive compromise[5].

2. **International pressure**: Multiple countries and organizations (including the US, UK, China, Turkey, EU, and Arab League) have urged Ethiopia to respect Somalia's territorial integrity, creating diplomatic pressure for resolution[2].

3. **Turkish mediation**: Turkey has significant influence with both nations through trade and defense ties, and appears to be actively working toward a resolution[4].

4. **Alternative port arrangements**: The August 12 reporting suggests Somalia may be willing to provide Ethiopia with port access through a direct agreement, potentially offering a face-saving compromise for both sides[4].

### Factors Hindering Resolution

1. **Sovereignty concerns**: Somalia views the Ethiopia-Somaliland deal as a fundamental challenge to its territorial integrity, making compromise difficult[2].

2. **Somaliland's aspirations**: Somaliland seeks international recognition, and Ethiopia's potential recognition would be a significant step forward - making Somaliland potentially resistant to any deal that removes this prospect[5].

3. **Regional security dynamics**: The Horn of Africa remains volatile, with ongoing conflicts in Somalia and Ethiopia facing multiple internal insurgencies, complicating diplomatic efforts[5].

4. **Domestic politics**: Leaders on all sides face internal political pressures that may limit flexibility in negotiations.

## Assessment of Timeline

With the third round of talks scheduled for September 17, 2024, there is a narrow window of approximately two weeks between these negotiations and the October 1 deadline. This timeline presents both opportunities and challenges:

- The scheduled talks provide a formal mechanism for potential agreement
- The proximity to the deadline may create pressure for resolution
- However, complex sovereignty issues typically require extended negotiations
- Implementation details of any agreement would need to be worked out quickly

## Conclusion

Based on the available information as of May 2025, there are both positive and negative indicators regarding the prospect of an Ethiopia-Somalia agreement before October 1, 2024. The scheduled talks, Turkish mediation, and reports of "convergence on some major principles" suggest movement toward resolution. However, the fundamental issues of sovereignty and territorial integrity present significant obstacles.

The August 12, 2024 reporting that Ethiopia and Somalia are "on the brink of a historic port deal" provides the strongest indication that an agreement might be possible within the timeframe[4]. However, the failure to reach agreement in the August 20 talks suggests that significant differences remain.

The outcome will likely depend on whether the third round of talks on September 17 can build sufficient momentum to overcome the remaining obstacles within the compressed timeframe before October 1.
