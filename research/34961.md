## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of early May 2025, Apple (AAPL) is trading around $205.32–$205.35, having recently experienced a significant decline following reports of struggles in China and with AI initiatives[1].
- Technical indicators are bearish: the 14-day RSI is 33.06 (oversold territory), and the stock is trading below its 50-day ($215.73) and 200-day ($227.08) simple moving averages[1].
- The Fear & Greed Index is at 39 (Fear), and recent volatility is 6.29% over the last 30 days[1].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- Apple reported its fiscal Q1 2025 results on January 30, 2025, but no major positive or negative surprises are noted in the available context[4].
- News of challenges in China and AI has contributed to recent downward pressure on the stock[1].

## Forecasts and Analyst Sentiment

- One forecast predicts AAPL will drop to $197.12 by June 2025, indicating a risk that the stock could fall below $200 before March 31, 2025[1].
- Another forecast gives a low estimate for 2025 of $220.02, with monthly lows for June and July 2025 above $200, but does not specify lows for February–March 2025[5].
- Expert commentary suggests upside potential (possibly up to $280 by June), but warns of downside risk if negative catalysts occur, such as missed earnings or further China-related issues[3].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Yahoo Finance's historical data for AAPL is the standard for verifying whether the stock remains above $200 at all times during the specified period.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- Forecasts are inherently uncertain, especially given the current bearish sentiment and recent volatility.
- The lowest forecasted price for the relevant period (February–March 2025) is not explicitly provided in all sources, and some models predict a dip below $200 while others do not.
- Negative catalysts (e.g., further bad news from China, missed earnings) could quickly push the stock below $200, while positive surprises could provide support above that level[1][3].

## Conclusion

Based on available data as of February 12, 2025, there is a significant risk that Apple stock could fall below $200 at some point before March 31, 2025. While some forecasts keep the price above $200, at least one reputable model predicts a dip to $197.12 by June, and the current technical and sentiment indicators are bearish. The outcome is uncertain and will depend on market developments, but the risk of breaching $200 is material and should be closely monitored using authoritative sources like Yahoo Finance[1][3][5].
