# US Consumer Price Index Forecast: November 2025

As of May 2025, I'll analyze whether the 12-month percentage change in the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) will be lower in November 2025 than the November 2024 baseline of 2.73258%.

## Current Inflation Trends

The most recent inflation data shows a moderating trend in early 2025. The CPI increased 2.4% for the 12 months ending March 2025, down from 2.8% for the 12 months ending February[1]. This represents a meaningful deceleration in price growth and places the current inflation rate already below the November 2024 baseline of 2.73258%.

On a month-to-month basis, the CPI-U decreased 0.1% on a seasonally adjusted basis in March 2025, after rising 0.2% in February[2]. This monthly decline was primarily driven by energy prices, which fell 2.4% in March, with gasoline prices specifically dropping by 6.3%[2]. Meanwhile, core inflation (excluding food and energy) rose by a modest 0.1% in March 2025, showing continued moderation in underlying price pressures[2].

## Key Factors Influencing the Forecast

Several factors will likely influence inflation through November 2025:

**Deflationary Pressures:**
- Energy prices showed significant decline in March 2025 (-2.4%), with gasoline falling 6.3%[2]
- Core inflation moderated to 0.1% monthly growth in March 2025, suggesting easing underlying pressures[2]
- Core CPI year-over-year growth fell to 1.8% in March 2025, down from 2.2% previously[5]

**Inflationary Pressures:**
- Food prices continue to rise, with the food index up 0.4% in March 2025[2]
- Some economists have predicted that U.S. inflation is likely to rise in 2025[4]
- Housing and utilities costs continue to increase, with this index rising to 343.51 in March 2025 from 342.40 previously[5]

## Forecast Assessment

Based on the available data, there are competing forces that will influence inflation through November 2025. The current trajectory shows inflation moderating, with the 12-month rate already below the November 2024 baseline. However, some economists anticipate inflation pressures increasing later in 2025.

The most recent data shows the inflation trend is downward, with March 2025's annual rate at 2.4%[1], significantly below the November 2024 baseline of 2.73258%. For inflation to exceed the November 2024 baseline by November 2025, there would need to be a reversal of the current disinflationary trend.

While some forecasts suggest inflation pressures could build through 2025, the current momentum shows continued moderation. Trading Economics' projection suggests a measured pace of price increases through 2026 and 2027[5], which would be consistent with inflation remaining below the November 2024 baseline.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several important uncertainties could affect this forecast:

1. Policy implementation timeline - The full impact of any new policies may not be felt until later in 2025
2. External shocks - Geopolitical events or supply chain disruptions could cause unexpected inflation spikes
3. Monetary policy response - The Federal Reserve's reaction to inflation trends will significantly influence the outcome
4. Seasonal factors - November's inflation figures often have unique seasonal patterns

## Conclusion

Based on the available data as of May 2025, the most likely outcome is that the 12-month percentage change in the US Consumer Price Index will be lower in November 2025 than it was in November 2024. The current inflation rate (2.4% as of March 2025) is already below the November 2024 baseline of 2.73258%, and while there are some factors that could push inflation higher, the overall trend appears to be one of moderation.

The probability that November 2025's inflation rate will be lower than November 2024's rate is approximately 60-65%, based on current trends and available forecasts.
