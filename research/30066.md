# Forecasting JD Vance's Senate Seat Successor

Following JD Vance's election as Vice President on the Trump-Vance ticket, his Ohio Senate seat will soon become vacant. This analysis examines the available information regarding potential successors, with specific focus on Matt Dolan and Jane Timken as possible appointees.

## Current Status and Process

JD Vance will need to resign from his Senate seat, which he has held since 2023, to assume the vice presidency[1]. Under Ohio state law, Governor Mike DeWine (Republican) has the authority to appoint Vance's replacement after his resignation[1][2]. This appointee will serve until a special election is held in 2026 to fill the remainder of Vance's six-year term[1][2].

DeWine has previously indicated that he would select a successor who could effectively compete in the 2026 special election[1]. This suggests he's looking for a candidate with electoral viability and name recognition within Ohio.

## Potential Candidates

### Jane Timken

Jane Timken, the former Ohio Republican Party chair who competed against Vance in the 2022 Senate primary, has publicly expressed interest in the appointment. According to available information, Timken has stated she would be "honored to be considered" for the position[1]. 

Timken has positioned herself as someone who would pursue the Trump-Vance agenda, specifically mentioning priorities such as border security, inflation reduction, community safety, and economic growth[1]. She has also noted that her appointment would be significant as a woman has never represented Ohio in the Senate[1].

It's worth noting that Timken was among the candidates who lost to Vance in the 2022 Republican primary after Trump endorsed Vance[1].

### Matt Dolan

The search results do not contain specific information about Matt Dolan's interest in or consideration for the Senate appointment. Without this information, it's not possible to assess his likelihood of being selected based on the available data.

## Historical Context

The process of replacing senators who become vice presidents has recent precedents:

- In 2021, when Kamala Harris became vice president, California Governor Gavin Newsom appointed Alex Padilla to fill her Senate seat[2].
- In 2009, Ted Kaufman was selected to fill Joe Biden's Delaware Senate seat when Biden became vice president[2].

## Factors That May Influence the Decision

Several factors could influence Governor DeWine's appointment decision:

1. **Electoral Viability**: DeWine has indicated he wants someone who can compete in the 2026 special election[1].

2. **Alignment with Trump-Vance Agenda**: Given Ohio's recent Republican voting pattern in presidential elections and Trump's influence in the state, DeWine may consider a candidate's alignment with the incoming administration[1].

3. **Representation Considerations**: The fact that a woman has never represented Ohio in the Senate could be a factor that works in Timken's favor[1].

4. **Republican Bench Strength**: Ohio has what's described as a "deep bench of federal and statewide officeholders and past Senate aspirants," giving DeWine numerous options to consider[1].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

The available information does not indicate when Governor DeWine plans to announce his decision. Additionally, while Jane Timken has expressed interest, there is no information about Matt Dolan's position or whether he's being considered for the appointment based on the search results provided.

The timing of Vance's resignation from the Senate will also affect when the appointment is made. Previous vice presidents like Kamala Harris resigned their Senate seats shortly before assuming office[4].

## Conclusion

Based on the available information, Jane Timken is a potential candidate for appointment to JD Vance's Senate seat, having publicly expressed interest. However, there is insufficient information to assess Matt Dolan's candidacy or to determine the likelihood of either being selected by Governor DeWine. The governor has multiple options to consider and has emphasized the importance of selecting someone who can compete effectively in the 2026 special election.
