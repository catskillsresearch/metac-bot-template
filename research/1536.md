## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The original LIGO detectors (Hanford and Livingston, USA) took years from conception to operational status, but their designs and technology now serve as the baseline for LIGO-India, reducing technical uncertainty[1].
- LIGO-India received formal approval from the Indian government in February 2016, and by late 2018, site selection was completed and land acquisition was underway. Detailed technical plans and vacuum system designs had been adapted for Indian conditions and transferred to the responsible institutes[4][5].
- Public statements from project leaders in late 2017 and 2018 indicated a target operational date of 2025, with construction and equipment delivery timelines coordinated with US partners[2][5].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- In December 2017, Indian scientific authorities reiterated the target of completing the facility by 2025, with IUCAA set to operate the observatory[5].
- The project is funded through a partnership between Indian research agencies and international collaborators, primarily leveraging the established LIGO blueprint and US-supplied key components[5].
- As of 2018, concrete steps—such as land acquisition and detailed engineering—were underway, indicating that LIGO-India had moved beyond the speculative or planning phase into tangible progress[4][5].

## Authoritative Sources

- LIGO Laboratory (Caltech) maintains an official project status page for LIGO-India, documenting milestones and technical transfers[1].
- Project announcements and updates from the Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics (IUCAA) and the Raja Ramanna Centre for Advanced Technology (RRCAT) corroborate progress on the Indian side[5].
- Peer-reviewed literature and presentations from the Gravitational Wave International Committee (GWIC) outline the technical and logistical timeline as of 2018[2][3].

## Limitations or Uncertainties

- Large science infrastructure projects historically face delays owing to site preparation, procurement, and integration challenges. Examples include the James Webb Space Telescope and even the original LIGO construction.
- LIGO-India's timeline is ambitious but benefits from the reuse of established designs and existing international collaboration structures. However, delays in land acquisition, government funding disbursement, or international shipment of key components could push first operations beyond 2025[4][5].
- The resolution criterion requires not just construction, but that the observatory take test data demonstrating a sensitivity within a factor of 10 of the instrument's specification before January 1, 2028—a technical milestone that could face unexpected hurdles.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the above, as of November 8, 2018, the probability that LIGO-India would become operational before 2028 is high—estimated at **80–90%**. The main risk is a multi-year delay pushing commissioning beyond the original 2025 target, but achieving operational status by 2028 remains very likely based on the project's progress, government commitment, and the precedent set by the original LIGO facilities.
