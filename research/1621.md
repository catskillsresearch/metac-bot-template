## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of late 2018, senolytic therapies—drugs designed to selectively eliminate senescent cells—had just entered human clinical trials. Unity Biotechnology's UBX0101 began Phase 1 trials in 2018, targeting osteoarthritis of the knee as its initial indication[1].
- Senolytic compounds, such as dasatinib (already FDA approved for leukemia), are being repurposed and studied for aging-related indications, but none had been approved by the FDA as a senolytic therapy as of 2018[2].
- The field is moving from promising preclinical (animal) data to early human studies, with hopes that targeting senescent cells could significantly impact healthspan and age-related diseases[1].

## Recent Announcements and Regulatory Hurdles

- Regulatory agencies, especially the FDA, have imposed significant barriers to the rapid progression of senolytic compounds. For example, even for fisetin, a compound long present in the human diet, researchers were required to submit extensive Investigational New Drug applications and conduct additional preclinical studies, resulting in delays of 2.5 years before human studies could commence[4].
- The FDA's approach to novel anti-aging therapies is conservative, often requiring large safety datasets and robust, disease-specific evidence of efficacy, rather than acceptance of aging as a primary indication[4].
- As of 2023, several senolytic agents remain in clinical testing, but none have received approval specifically for senolytic use[1][3].

## Key Differences Affecting the Forecast

- Unlike traditional drugs developed for single, well-defined diseases, senolytic therapies target a process—cellular senescence—implicated in a broad range of age-related conditions. This novel target may complicate both clinical trial design and regulatory approval, as suitable surrogate endpoints and long-term safety must be established[1].
- Previous drug approvals for entirely new therapeutic classes (e.g., monoclonal antibodies, gene therapies) have often taken over a decade from first Phase 1 trials to approval. Senolytic therapies starting human trials in 2018 face a regulatory environment that is, in some ways, even more challenging—especially for indications related to aging, rather than specific diseases.
- Regulatory delays and requirements for extensive preclinical and clinical data, even for compounds with established safety in other contexts, slow the development timeline[4].

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given:
- The typical 8–15 year timeline for new drug classes from first-in-human trials to FDA approval.
- Significant regulatory hurdles and the need for long-term safety and efficacy data, especially for therapies targeting aging.
- The fact that, as of 2018, the first senolytic trials in humans had only just begun.

It is reasonable to estimate a moderate probability of at least one senolytic therapy being approved by the FDA before January 1, 2030, but with considerable uncertainty. The probability is likely in the 25–45% range, reflecting both the scientific promise and the substantial regulatory and clinical challenges ahead.

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- The development timeline could be shortened if a senolytic therapy shows dramatic efficacy in a high-burden disease with clear endpoints (e.g., osteoarthritis, certain fibrotic diseases), but could also be delayed by adverse trial outcomes or changing regulatory standards.
- There is uncertainty over whether the FDA will accept surrogate markers (e.g., clearance of senescent cells) or require hard clinical endpoints (e.g., reduction in disease incidence/mortality).
- The question's resolution depends on both scientific success and regulatory adaptation to the emerging field of anti-aging therapies.
