## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Open defiance of Supreme Court orders by the executive branch is extremely rare in US history. The most prominent historical reference is the 1950s Southern state resistance to Brown v. Board of Education, which ended with federal intervention by President Eisenhower to enforce desegregation[5].
- Traditionally, even presidents who disagreed with Supreme Court rulings have enforced them, maintaining the legitimacy of the judiciary[5].
- In recent years, however, this tradition has weakened. In 2025, the Trump Administration has publicly questioned judicial legitimacy and, in several cases, has failed to comply promptly with federal court orders[5][1].

## 2. Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Metric

- **Contempt Threats:** In 2025, federal district courts have come close to holding executive officials in contempt for non-compliance with court orders. One district judge found probable cause to do so regarding deportations to El Salvador, explicitly warning the administration and moving toward identifying individuals responsible for noncompliance[5][1].
- **Budget Bill and Legislative Developments:** Legislation introduced in 2025 could make it more difficult for courts to impose contempt findings or penalties on government officials, potentially by restricting judicial enforcement mechanisms[2][4].
- **Ongoing Litigation:** As of June 2025, high-profile cases involving alleged non-compliance by the Trump Administration are active and being appealed. No court has yet formally found the executive branch in contempt for violating a Supreme Court order, but lower court orders have been openly resisted[1].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Congressional Research Service and legal analysis have documented ongoing executive resistance and the judiciary's limited enforcement options, especially when higher courts (including the Supreme Court) are involved[1][5].
- News coverage and legal trackers confirm 250+ lawsuits challenging Trump Administration policies, with at least one case where the administration was found to have ignored a federal court order, prompting emergency motions and judicial warnings[1][5].
- The Brennan Center and legal scholars have highlighted the erosion of traditional compliance norms and the increasing risk of a constitutional crisis should the executive branch openly defy the Supreme Court[5].

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- **Appeals and Reversals:** Many cases are ongoing, and contempt findings could be reversed or rendered moot if higher courts overturn the underlying orders.
- **Legislative Uncertainty:** Pending bills may restrict courts’ contempt powers, reducing the probability of such findings[2][4].
- **Political Unpredictability:** The executive branch’s willingness to comply with future Supreme Court orders remains uncertain and may depend on the political climate and specific issues at stake.
- **Measurement:** The question requires a formal contempt finding explicitly citing a Supreme Court mandate. So far, courts have stopped short of this threshold, even amid executive resistance[1][5].

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

- **Baseline Probability (historical):** Very low (<1%) based on US historical precedent.
- **Current Context Adjustment:** Given recent near-contempt findings, open defiance in some cases, and ongoing court battles, the probability is now higher, perhaps in the range of 10–20% over the period to January 20, 2029.
- **Downward Adjustment:** New legislative efforts to limit contempt powers and the courts’ traditional reticence to escalate conflicts with the executive branch may reduce the odds somewhat, possibly to the 7–15% range.
- **Final Assessment:** The probability that a US federal court will formally hold any part of the executive branch in contempt for not obeying a Supreme Court ruling before January 20, 2029, is **elevated compared to historical norms but remains modest—best estimated at 10–15%**.
