### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Of the seven Millennium Prize Problems established by the Clay Mathematics Institute in 2000, only the Poincaré Conjecture has been solved (by a human, Grigori Perelman, in 2003)[1][2].
- The remaining six problems—Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture, Hodge Conjecture, Navier–Stokes Existence and Smoothness, Riemann Hypothesis, Yang–Mills Existence and Mass Gap, and P vs NP—remain unsolved, with no credible claims of solutions (by AI or humans) as of June 2023[1][2][4].
- AI has made progress in assisting mathematical research: systems have contributed to conjectures and proofs in specific, often more accessible domains (e.g., combinatorics, knot theory), but have not autonomously solved major open problems in pure mathematics[5].

### Recent Announcements and Policies

- No announcements from the Clay Mathematics Institute indicate any changes to the prize conditions or procedures to specifically accommodate AI-generated solutions[1].
- There are no credible reports as of June 2023 of an AI system being credited with the independent solution of any of the six remaining Millennium Prize Problems[2][3].

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The Clay Mathematics Institute's official Millennium Problems webpage serves as the definitive authority for problem status and solution announcements[1].
- Reputable mathematical journals and preprint servers (e.g., arXiv) are required for public verification of any claimed solution, with independent expert consensus as a prerequisite for acceptance.

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- The requirement that the AI be primarily responsible for the "core of the solution" sets a high bar and excludes routine computational assistance.
- While rapid progress in AI capabilities is ongoing, the leap from contributing to mathematical research to autonomously solving a Millennium Prize Problem remains unprecedented and highly uncertain.
- Measurement is straightforward: a resolution occurs only if the Clay Mathematics Institute or two reputable independent sources affirm a peer-reviewed or broadly accepted solution, with clear attribution to AI.

### Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the lack of precedent, the formidable difficulty of the problems, the high standards for what counts as an AI-derived solution, and the absence of any credible indicators of imminent success, the probability that an AI system will solve any of the remaining Millennium Prize Problems before July 2025 is extremely low—likely less than 1%.
