# Will astronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore still be in space on December 30, 2024?

Based on the available information as of November 2024, astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams are highly likely to still be in space on December 30, 2024.

## Current Status and Timeline

Astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams flew to the International Space Station (ISS) in June 2024 aboard NASA's Boeing Crew Flight Test[1]. They were originally scheduled to return to Earth shortly after their arrival, but due to numerous technical issues with the Boeing Starliner spacecraft, their stay was extended[2].

On August 24, 2024, NASA announced a significant change in plans: the Starliner spacecraft would return to Earth without Wilmore and Williams aboard[1]. This decision was made to prioritize crew safety while still gathering testing data on the Starliner during its return flight.

## Return Plans

The most critical piece of information for this forecast comes from NASA's official statement that Wilmore and Williams "will continue their work formally as part of the Expedition 71/72 crew through February 2025"[1]. This timeline clearly extends beyond December 30, 2024.

NASA has specified that the astronauts will eventually return home aboard a SpaceX Dragon spacecraft with two other crew members assigned to the SpaceX Crew-9 mission[1]. Meanwhile, the uncrewed Starliner was expected to depart from the space station and make an autonomous re-entry and landing in early September 2024[1].

## Uncertainties and Limitations

While the February 2025 timeline appears firm based on NASA's announcement, space missions can be subject to changes due to:

1. Technical considerations with the SpaceX Dragon spacecraft
2. Weather conditions at splashdown sites
3. ISS operational requirements
4. Health considerations for the astronauts

As of mid-August 2024, there were discussions about potential equipment limitations, including the possibility that the astronauts might have to return without spacesuits[3]. However, this does not appear to affect the overall timeline for their return.

## Conclusion

Based on NASA's official statement that Wilmore and Williams will remain on the ISS as part of Expedition 71/72 through February 2025, it is highly probable that both astronauts will still be in space on December 30, 2024. Their return is planned aboard a SpaceX Dragon spacecraft rather than the Boeing Starliner they arrived on, but this return mission is not scheduled to occur before the December 30 date in question.
