### 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Historically, most investigated UFO/UAP sightings have been explained by conventional means: weather phenomena, atmospheric effects, aircraft, satellites, birds, or human technology. Only a small fraction remain unexplained, usually due to insufficient data rather than compelling evidence of something extraordinary[3][4].
- The term UAP (Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena) was adopted to move away from the alien-centric connotations of "UFO" and now includes anomalies seen in the air, sea, and space[4][5].

- In 2023, NASA commissioned an independent study team to assess UAPs scientifically. The resulting report (September 2023) concluded there was *no evidence that extraterrestrial life or other ontologically-shocking causes* were responsible for unexplained UAP reports. Focus remains on collecting better data and improving analysis rather than supporting extraordinary claims[4][1].

- The Department of Defense, through the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), is also investigating UAPs. As of late 2024, their director confirmed the office continues to examine reports, but no paradigm-shifting evidence has emerged[2].

### 2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- Congressional hearings, such as the July 2023 session, have increased public and governmental attention but have not resulted in new scientific consensus or credible evidence supporting ontologically-shocking explanations[4].
- The UAP Disclosure Act of 2023 aims to increase transparency, but as of August 2023, no disclosures or findings have prompted leading rationalist figures (e.g., Eliezer Yudkowsky) to concede their bets in favor of a paradigm shift[4][5].

### 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- NASA’s UAP Independent Study Team report (September 2023)[4]
- Department of Defense/AARO statements and ongoing investigations[2]
- ODNI’s 2021 preliminary assessment[4]
- Recent peer-reviewed and preprint research on UAPs[5]

### 4. Limitations or Uncertainties

- Many UAP reports remain unresolved due to poor-quality data, lack of corroboration, or classified information, not because of compelling evidence for extraordinary explanations[3][4].
- Mainstream scientific bodies (NASA, AARO) and expert panels have repeatedly emphasized the importance of better data collection rather than supporting extraordinary claims[4][5].

### Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the history of overwhelmingly prosaic explanations, the lack of new paradigm-shifting evidence in recent high-profile investigations, and the high threshold for ontological shock required by the bet’s criteria, the probability that UAPs will have an ontologically-shocking explanation (as of August 2023) remains quite low—likely well below 10%.

No leading rationalist figures or three LessWrong bettors have conceded that UAPs are likely ontologically-shocking, and no major government or scientific body has endorsed such a view[3][4][5].
