# Forecasting December 2024 Arctic Temperatures at Barrow/Port Rogers

The question of whether December 2024 temperatures at Barrow/Port Rogers (now officially known as Utqiagvik) will exceed historical averages by ≥4°F requires analysis of Arctic climate trends, recent observations, and climate forecasting models.

## Historical Trends and Current Status

Barrow/Utqiagvik, located on Alaska's Arctic coast, has experienced significant warming over recent decades, consistent with the broader Arctic amplification phenomenon. The Arctic region has been warming at approximately three times the global average rate, with particularly pronounced warming in winter months.

Key historical observations include:

- Arctic temperatures have increased at approximately three times the global average rate over recent decades
- Winter warming in the Arctic has been more pronounced than summer warming
- Barrow/Utqiagvik has experienced some of the most dramatic warming in Alaska
- Sea ice decline around Barrow has been substantial, contributing to local temperature increases through reduced albedo and increased heat absorption

The loss of sea ice has been particularly significant for Barrow's climate, as open water in late autumn and early winter releases heat into the atmosphere, contributing to higher local temperatures.

## Recent Climate Patterns Affecting Arctic Temperatures

Several factors may influence December 2024 temperatures:

1. **Sea Ice Conditions**: Declining Arctic sea ice extent and thickness has been a consistent trend. Lower sea ice coverage in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas near Barrow typically correlates with higher winter temperatures.

2. **Ocean Temperature Anomalies**: Warmer than average sea surface temperatures in the Arctic Ocean can influence air temperatures in coastal locations like Barrow.

3. **Atmospheric Circulation Patterns**: The Arctic Oscillation (AO) and North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) significantly influence winter temperatures in the Arctic. Positive phases of these oscillations typically bring warmer conditions to parts of the Arctic.

4. **El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)**: ENSO conditions can influence Arctic temperatures through teleconnections, though the relationship is complex and varies by region.

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

For monitoring and forecasting Arctic temperatures, the following sources provide reliable data:

1. National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) - Tracks sea ice extent and Arctic climate indicators
2. NOAA Arctic Report Card - Annual assessment of Arctic conditions
3. Iowa Environmental Mesonet - Provides the specific temperature data that will be used for resolution
4. National Weather Service Alaska Region - Regional forecasts and historical data
5. NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies - Global temperature analysis

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors create uncertainty in forecasting December 2024 temperatures:

1. **Natural Variability**: Arctic weather is highly variable, and short-term weather patterns can temporarily override long-term climate trends.

2. **Measurement Challenges**: Arctic weather stations like Barrow face harsh conditions that can occasionally affect instrumentation and data quality.

3. **Forecast Limitations**: Seasonal forecasts beyond a few months have limited skill, particularly for specific locations rather than regional averages.

4. **Changing Baseline**: As the Arctic warms, the difference between current temperatures and historical averages naturally increases, making exceedance of historical averages more likely.

5. **Data Consistency**: Changes in measurement methods or station location over the 1945-2023 period could affect the calculated historical average.

## Conclusion

While specific December 2024 temperatures cannot be predicted with high confidence this far in advance, the strong warming trend in the Arctic, particularly in winter months, suggests an increased probability of above-average temperatures. The 4°F threshold represents a significant anomaly, but such departures from historical averages have become increasingly common in the rapidly warming Arctic region.

The resolution of this question will ultimately depend on both the long-term warming trend and shorter-term climate variability factors that will develop throughout 2024.
