### Forecast on Pause of Large Training Runs by OpenAI, Google DeepMind, or Anthropic Before 2026

**Summary:**  
Based on historical data, recent policy announcements, and expert community forecasts as of early 2025, it is highly unlikely that OpenAI, Google DeepMind, or Anthropic will announce a pause on all training runs above a certain size for safety reasons before 2026.

**Key Points:**  
- No known pauses on large training runs for safety reasons have been announced by these companies as of early 2024[2].  
- Community predictions place the likelihood of such a pause before 2026 at approximately 2.5%[1].  
- The Frontier AI Safety Commitments adopted by AI companies in mid-2024 focus on responsible scaling and governance improvements rather than pausing training runs[5].  
- OpenAIâ€™s internal governance reforms and dissolved safety-focused compute teams suggest challenges in safety alignment but no broad halting of training[5].  
- AI companies, including the three in question, actively resist restrictive regulation as of early 2025, indicating a preference to continue development without enforced pauses[4].  

**Conclusion:**  
The adjusted probabilistic assessment is that the probability is very low (around 2.5%) that any of OpenAI, Google DeepMind, or Anthropic will announce a comprehensive pause on training runs above a certain size for safety reasons before 2026. This forecast aligns with current evidence and expert consensus.
