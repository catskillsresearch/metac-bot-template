### Key Historical Trends and Current Status
- In April 2025, polling from Marist and Pew Research indicated Donald Trump’s net approval on immigration was negative, with most Americans disapproving of his handling of the issue[1][2].
- The trend showed Trump’s overall job approval and issue-specific ratings were “upside down,” meaning more disapproved than approved[1][2].
- By May 2025, the Marquette Law School Poll found a significant shift: Trump’s net approval on immigration was exactly zero, based on a 50%-50% approval-disapproval split[5].

### Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric
- There have been no major new immigration policy announcements or widely reported events between May and late June 2025 that would reasonably be expected to drastically alter public opinion on the issue.
- The most recent national polling data (May 2025) is likely to be what the Silver Bulletin references for its tracker, barring any major new developments[5].

### Authoritative Sources for Verification
- The Marquette Law School Poll provides the latest public, issue-specific net approval data on Trump’s handling of immigration as of May 2025[5].
- The Silver Bulletin tracker, as cited by Newsweek and available on Nate Silver’s site, aggregates such polling data for net approval on specific issues, including immigration[5].

### Limitations and Uncertainties
- Polls have inherent margins of error (typically ±2-4 percentage points).
- The Silver Bulletin may update at irregular intervals; if no data is posted precisely for June 25, 2025, the most recent prior value (e.g., from May 2025) will be used per the resolution criteria.
- Rapid, unanticipated events could shift public opinion, but no evidence of such events exists as of May 28, 2025.

### Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment
Given:
- The most recent net approval is 0% (May 2025)[5].
- The trend has been from negative toward neutral but not positive[1][2][5].
- No major intervening events suggest a sharp positive or negative swing.

**Forecast:**  
The most likely range for Donald Trump’s net approval on immigration, according to the Silver Bulletin on June 25, 2025, is:

**‘≥-2.0% and ≤0.0%’**

This means the net approval will be at or slightly below zero, but not positive[5].
