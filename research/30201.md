# Forecasting Biden's Executive Orders for December 2024

To assess whether President Biden will issue three or more executive orders in December 2024, I'll analyze historical patterns, current trends, and relevant contextual factors.

## Historical Trends

President Biden has demonstrated varying rates of executive order issuance throughout his presidency:

- In 2021, President Biden signed 77 executive orders (EO 13985 through EO 14061)[1]
- In 2023, he signed 24 executive orders (EO 14091 through EO 14114)[2]

This shows a significant decrease in the rate of executive orders from his first year in office compared to 2023. This pattern is consistent with previous administrations, which typically issue more executive orders during their first year.

For 2024, we have evidence of continued executive order activity, including:
- Executive Order 14130 signed on January 9, 2024[4]
- An executive order from March 1, 2024, focused on "Preventing Access to Americans' Bulk Sensitive Personal Data and United States Government-Related Data"[3]

## End-of-Term Considerations

December 2024 represents the final full month of President Biden's current term, which could influence executive order activity in several ways:

1. **Lame Duck Period**: Presidents often use their final months in office to cement policy priorities through executive action
2. **Legacy Considerations**: There may be increased motivation to address outstanding policy goals before the end of the term

However, the specific number of executive orders in December will likely depend on several factors, including:
- Ongoing policy priorities
- Legislative developments
- International events
- Political considerations

## Measurement and Verification

The Federal Register serves as the official source for presidential executive orders. The question specifically references the Federal Register page for Biden's 2024 executive orders as the resolution source.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors create uncertainty in this forecast:

1. **Irregular Pattern**: Executive orders are not issued on a regular schedule but rather in response to specific needs and circumstances
2. **Limited 2024 Data**: The search results provide limited information about the total number of executive orders issued so far in 2024
3. **Political Context**: The post-election period in December 2024 will have unique political dynamics that could either accelerate or decelerate executive action

## Conclusion

Based on the available information, it's difficult to make a definitive forecast about whether President Biden will issue three or more executive orders in December 2024. His historical pattern shows a decreasing rate of executive orders since 2021, but the end-of-term context could potentially drive increased activity. The Federal Register will be the authoritative source to monitor as December 2024 approaches.
