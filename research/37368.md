# Rail Freight Intermodal Traffic Forecast: April 2025

Based on the available data as of May 27, 2025, I'll analyze the current rail freight intermodal traffic trends and provide a forecast for April 2025.

## Current Status and Recent Trends

The U.S. rail intermodal traffic has shown consistent growth in early 2025 compared to 2024 levels. Weekly data from April shows:

- Week ending April 5, 2025: 273,794 containers and trailers, up 13.6% year-over-year[3]
- Week ending April 12, 2025: 274,342 containers and trailers, up 6.3% year-over-year[1]
- Week ending April 19, 2025: Specific volume not available, but showed a 2.9% year-over-year increase[4]

The year-to-date intermodal volume through mid-April 2025 was up 8.7% compared to the same period in 2024[3]. This indicates strong performance in the first quarter extending into April.

## Market Factors Affecting April 2025 Traffic

Several factors are influencing intermodal traffic in this period:

1. **Pre-tariff inventory movements**: Many importers pulled orders forward to avoid new tariffs, but most of this pre-tariff inventory has already entered the market by April[2].

2. **Growth trajectory**: Industry analysts project that the pace of growth seen in early 2025 will not continue throughout the year, with expectations that Q4 growth will flatten or decline, resulting in an overall annual growth of 2-3%[2].

3. **Weather and seasonal factors**: Early 2025 intermodal volumes were affected by weather conditions, yet still managed an 8.4% year-over-year increase on domestic freight through February[2].

4. **Pricing environment**: Intermodal pricing for committed, long-term contracts has increased an average of 3.5% year-over-year, suggesting sustained demand[2].

## April 2025 Forecast

Considering the weekly data available and the overall trends, I estimate the April 2025 Rail Freight Intermodal Traffic to be approximately **1,195,000 containers and trailers**.

This forecast is based on:
- The known weekly volumes for early April
- The decelerating growth rate observed throughout April (from 13.6% to 6.3% to 2.9%)
- Comparison to March 2025's volume of 1,211,436 containers and trailers
- The typical seasonal patterns between March and April

This represents a modest decrease from March 2025, which aligns with industry projections of gradually slowing growth throughout 2025. However, it still represents approximately a 5-7% increase compared to April 2024, consistent with the year-to-date growth rate of 8.7% reported in mid-April.

## Uncertainties and Limitations

Several factors could affect the accuracy of this forecast:

1. **Tariff impacts**: The full effects of new tariffs remain uncertain and could cause fluctuations in import volumes and subsequently intermodal traffic[2].

2. **Inventory levels**: Potential inventory buildups could lead to a downturn in imports later in 2025 or even into 2026[2].

3. **Data completeness**: The forecast is based on partial data for April, with complete information for only the first half of the month.

4. **Reporting methodology**: The final FRED Rail Freight Intermodal Traffic figure may use a different methodology or include adjustments not accounted for in the weekly AAR reports.
