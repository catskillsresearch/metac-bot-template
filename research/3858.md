## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of Q3 2019, the USD comprised 61.8% of allocated global foreign exchange reserves, according to the IMF COFER database[3].
- By Q2 2024, the USD’s share had fallen to 58.9%. This represents a decline of roughly 10 percentage points over two decades[2][3].
- The euro’s share in reserves is about 19.9% as of 2024, with the Chinese renminbi at just over 2%[2][3].
- The USD remains central to international finance: nearly 90% of all FX transactions, about 50% of trade invoicing, 40% of SWIFT payments, and the majority of cross-border loans and international debt securities are USD-denominated[3].

## 2. Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Metric

- Global trends show a gradual diversification of reserves, with some countries promoting non-dollar alternatives in response to US fiscal policy, sanctions, and geopolitical tensions[2].
- Persistent US budget and current account deficits are noted as risk factors that could accelerate the decline in the USD’s share[2].
- There is little indication from current US political leadership (as of 2024) of policy changes that would reverse these trends[2].
- The rise of private cryptocurrencies and potential adoption of digital central bank currencies are viewed as alternatives, but they are not yet significant competitors to the USD’s reserve role[3].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- IMF COFER Database for official reserve composition data[3].
- OMFIF analysis of reserve currency trends and projections to 2050[2].
- Fitch Solutions and other financial analysts assessing medium- and long-term currency dominance[3].
- Metaculus and other forecasting platforms for probabilistic assessments[4].

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties in Measurement

- Projections assume the IMF will continue publishing COFER or equivalent data through 2050.
- Uncertainties include possible abrupt systemic changes, such as large-scale adoption of digital currencies, geopolitical realignment, or structural crises in US or global financial systems.
- The threshold for “dominance” is set at >50% of allocated global reserves, not mere plurality[4].

## 5. Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the steady but gradual decline in the USD’s share of global reserves, absence of a clear alternative with comparable liquidity and scale, and expert consensus on the persistence of USD dominance, the most probable scenario is that the USD will still comprise more than 50% of global allocated foreign exchange reserves in 2050. The decline may continue toward or just above that threshold, with a non-negligible but still minority probability of falling below 50% if diversification accelerates sharply or a major systemic shift occurs[2][3][1].
