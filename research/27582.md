# Will the US Confirm Clade I Mpox Infections Before October 1, 2024?

As of August 2024, the United States has not yet confirmed any cases of Clade I mpox within its borders. However, several factors suggest an increasing possibility of imported cases in the near future.

## Current Status of Clade I Mpox

Clade I mpox, particularly the newly identified Clade Ib variant, has been causing significant concern globally. This variant has surged in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and has spread to several neighboring countries that had not previously reported mpox[2]. On August 14, 2024, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the current outbreaks of multiple clades of mpox in the DRC and nearby African countries to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC)[1][3].

The likelihood of Clade I cases being imported to the United States has increased in recent weeks as cases have begun to be detected in countries outside the Africa region[3]. This global spread represents a significant shift in the epidemiology of the virus.

## US Preparedness and Risk Assessment

The Biden-Harris Administration has been closely monitoring the spread of Clade I mpox since December 2023 and has established incident response structures across federal departments and agencies to ensure domestic preparedness[1]. As of the latest available information, there are "no known cases in the United States at this time"[1].

The US has implemented several measures to prepare for potential Clade I cases:

1. Increased capacity to detect cases through existing surveillance systems, including wastewater testing
2. Expanded robust diagnostic testing capabilities
3. Expedited testing procedures, particularly for those with recent travel to DRC or neighboring countries[1]

US health officials have stated that the country is "well prepared to rapidly detect, contain, and manage clade I cases should they occur domestically"[1].

## Characteristics and Concerns About Clade I

Clade I mpox presents several concerning characteristics that differentiate it from the Clade II variant that has been circulating in the US since 2022:

- Clade I causes a higher number of severe infections and has a higher mortality rate than Clade IIb[1]
- Historical case fatality rates for Clade I range from 1.4% to approximately 10%, compared to Clade II's 0.1% to 3.6%[3]
- The new Clade Ib variant appears to be spreading mainly through sexual networks, similar to the pattern seen with Clade IIb in 2022
- Clade I is affecting a wider range of age groups than previous outbreaks, including children[4]

However, health officials expect that Clade I would cause lower morbidity and mortality in the United States than in endemic countries due to differences in healthcare access and resources[1].

## Current Mpox Situation in the US

While the US has not yet detected Clade I, it continues to manage ongoing transmission of Clade IIb:

- As of August 6, 2024, the US has reported 33,435 mpox cases and 60 deaths since the beginning of the 2022 outbreak[3]
- These cases account for approximately one-third of all reported cases and deaths worldwide[3]
- The US outbreak has continued to grow at a low but steady pace in 2024, with 1,700 new cases recorded between January and August 10, 2024[3]

## Assessment of Likelihood

Several factors suggest an increased risk of Clade I being detected in the US before October 1, 2024:

1. The global spread of Clade I beyond its historical geographic boundaries
2. Increased international travel connecting affected regions with the US
3. The pattern of spread through sexual networks, which facilitated the rapid global spread of Clade IIb in 2022
4. The declaration of a PHEIC, indicating significant international concern about containment

However, enhanced surveillance, testing capabilities, and preparedness measures in the US may help quickly identify and contain any imported cases.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several uncertainties affect the assessment:

1. Limited data on the transmissibility of Clade I in non-endemic settings
2. Unclear effectiveness of current control measures in countries experiencing outbreaks
3. Potential for undetected cases due to similarities in symptoms with other conditions
4. Evolving understanding of the new Clade Ib variant's characteristics
