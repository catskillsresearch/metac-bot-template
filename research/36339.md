# Forecasting Donald Trump's Net Approval Rating for November 2, 2026

As of May 29, 2025, I'm analyzing available data to forecast President Trump's net approval rating for November 2, 2026. This forecast integrates historical patterns, current trends, and potential influencing factors.

## Current Situation and Historical Context

As of May 2025, Donald Trump's approval ratings have remained relatively steady throughout the month according to Gallup polling data[1]. Trump's current approval metrics are being tracked through various data portals that compare his performance to previous presidents[2].

The initial "honeymoon period" for Trump's second term appears to have been somewhat stronger than his first term, reflecting his more successful electoral performance in 2024. However, the query indicates his net approval has been declining since inauguration at approximately 0.2 percentage points per day (as measured through mid-April 2025).

### Historical Presidential Approval Patterns

Second-term presidents typically follow certain patterns:

1. **Post-honeymoon decline**: Modern presidents experience shorter honeymoon periods with public approval, often seeing initial support wane within months.

2. **Mid-term slump**: Presidents frequently experience declining approval ratings during the middle of their terms, particularly approaching mid-term elections.

3. **Partisan polarization**: Trump's first term was characterized by unusually stable but polarized approval ratings, with his approval averaging slightly above 40% and disapproval slightly above 50%.

Trump's current approval trajectory can be compared with other 21st-century presidents at similar points in their presidencies through available tracking data[2].

## Key Differences Affecting the Forecast

Several factors distinguish the current situation from historical references:

1. **Second-term dynamics**: Unlike his first term where Trump had positive approval for only about two weeks, his second term began with stronger support following a more successful election. However, the decline rate of 0.2 percentage points per day suggests this advantage may be eroding.

2. **Polarization effects**: The political environment remains highly polarized, which tends to create more stable approval ratings with less dramatic swings than presidents experienced in earlier eras.

3. **Time horizon**: The forecast target date (November 2, 2026) falls near the midterm elections, a period when presidential approval typically reaches lower points in the electoral cycle.

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on the available data and historical patterns, I can generate a forecast for Trump's net approval rating on November 2, 2026:

If we assume:
- Trump's net approval was marginally positive in January 2025 following inauguration
- The decline rate of 0.2 percentage points per day continued through May 2025
- This rate typically moderates over time as the base of support stabilizes

**Base Projection Calculation:**
- January 20, 2025 (inauguration) to November 2, 2026 spans approximately 650 days
- At 0.2 percentage points decline per day, this would represent a 130 percentage point decline
- However, this linear decline is unsustainable and unrealistic

**Adjusted Projection:**
The most likely scenario is that Trump's approval ratings will stabilize around or somewhat below his first-term averages, with a 90% confidence interval for his November 2, 2026 net approval rating of:

- **Median forecast: -12 points** (approval approximately 42%, disapproval approximately 54%)
- **Optimistic scenario (5th percentile): -5 points**
- **Pessimistic scenario (95th percentile): -18 points**

This forecast accounts for:
1. The historical tendency for presidential approval to decline into midterm elections
2. Trump's established floor of support from his base
3. The moderating effect of partisan polarization on approval volatility
4. Typical second-term approval patterns

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors introduce uncertainty into this forecast:

1. **Economic conditions**: Major economic shifts between now and November 2026 could significantly impact approval ratings.

2. **International events**: Foreign policy crises or achievements could cause substantial deviations from the projected trajectory.

3. **Domestic developments**: Major legislative accomplishments or controversies could alter public perception.

4. **Methodological changes**: Changes in how the Silver Bulletin calculates approval ratings could affect comparability over time.

5. **Data limitations**: The current search results provide limited precise numerical data about Trump's exact May 2025 approval ratings, introducing baseline uncertainty.

This forecast should be updated as new polling data becomes available and as major events unfold that might influence public opinion of the president.
