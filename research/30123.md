# US Export Controls on Generative AI Software: Current Status and Forecast

As of mid-2024, the United States has been increasingly focused on regulating AI technologies through export controls, though comprehensive controls specifically targeting generative AI software have not yet been fully implemented. Below is an analysis of the current landscape and recent developments that could indicate whether such controls might be enacted before 2025.

## Current Status of AI Export Controls

As of early-to-mid 2024, US export controls did not specifically "control" AI as a broad category. Instead, the regulatory framework addressed different components that contribute to AI development in various ways, with many still falling under lightly controlled categories of the Export Administration Regulations (EAR99)[3]. The existing controls have primarily focused on hardware rather than software, with significant restrictions placed on advanced computing semiconductor chips since October 2022[1].

While generative AI software itself has not been directly subject to comprehensive export controls, there are indications that the regulatory landscape is evolving:

- Model developers and deployers may already face substantial liability under current export control rules if their AI models materially assist in the development or deployment of biological weapons or other restricted activities[4].
- Export control agencies likely possess the statutory and regulatory authority to restrict model developers from making the weights of frontier models freely available for download and from allowing their models to convey certain forms of dangerous expertise[4].

## Recent Legislative and Regulatory Developments

Several significant developments in 2024 suggest potential movement toward implementing export controls on generative AI software:

### The ENFORCE Act (May 2024)

On May 5, 2024, a bipartisan group of US lawmakers introduced the "Enhancing National Frameworks for Overseas Restriction of Critical Exports Act" (ENFORCE Act), which would impose export controls specifically on AI systems to prevent exploitation of US AI models and other enabling technologies by foreign adversaries[2]. This bill proposes amendments to the Export Control Reform Act of 2018 and explicitly includes definitions for:

- Artificial intelligence
- AI systems (defined as "any software or hardware implementation of artificial intelligence, including artificial intelligence model weights and any numerical parameters associated with the artificial intelligence implementation")[2]
- Covered AI systems

This represents the most direct legislative effort to date aimed at controlling exports of AI software, including generative AI.

### Executive Actions and Regulatory Evolution

The Biden administration has taken several steps that indicate increasing attention to AI export controls:

- In summer 2023, President Biden issued Executive Order 14105, directing the US Department of the Treasury to establish new regulations restricting certain outbound investments to "countries of concern" in sensitive technology areas, explicitly including AI[3].
- The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) has been actively adjusting its approach to AI-related export controls, as evidenced by its October 2023 broadening of controls on advanced computing chips and its subsequent modifications to facilitate "international AI development while mitigating risks to U.S. and global security"[1].

## Analysis of Likelihood

Several factors suggest that export controls on generative AI software before 2025 are increasingly possible:

1. **Legislative Momentum**: The introduction of the ENFORCE Act in May 2024 demonstrates concrete legislative interest in controlling AI software exports[2].

2. **Existing Regulatory Framework**: Current export control authorities likely already have the legal basis to impose restrictions on AI models and software, particularly those that could pose national security risks[4].

3. **Evolving Approach**: The US government has shown willingness to adjust its export control strategy for AI-related technologies, as seen in the modifications to semiconductor export controls[1][5].

4. **National Security Focus**: Officials have explicitly framed AI as "the quintessential dual-use technology" and emphasized the need to "mitigate risks to U.S. national security"[1], providing justification for potential controls.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors complicate forecasting whether such controls will be implemented before 2025:

1. **First Amendment Challenges**: Any regulations restricting AI model availability could face substantial First Amendment challenges, though courts are likely to uphold narrowly targeted regulations justified on national security grounds[4].

2. **International Coordination**: The effectiveness of unilateral export controls is limited, and the US may prefer to coordinate with allies before implementing comprehensive controls.

3. **Industry Pushback**: Major AI companies may resist restrictions that limit their global market access.

4. **Implementation Timeline**: Even if legislation like the ENFORCE Act passes in 2024, the development and implementation of specific regulations could extend beyond January 1, 2025.

## Conclusion

Based on available information as of mid-2024, there are clear indications that the US government is moving toward implementing some form of export controls on generative AI software. The introduction of the ENFORCE Act in May 2024 represents the most direct legislative effort to date, explicitly targeting AI systems including their software implementations. While the exact timeline remains uncertain, the momentum of legislative and regulatory developments suggests that such controls before 2025 are increasingly plausible.
