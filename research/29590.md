## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The 2023–2024 US influenza season was "moderately severe," with activity increasing in early November, peaking in late December, and declining to inter-seasonal levels by May[1].
- From October 2023 to August 2024, 25,390 laboratory-confirmed influenza hospitalizations were reported by FluSurv-NET sites[1]. National CDC estimates for the 2023–2024 season were at least 390,000 hospitalizations[4].
- In the past decade (excluding the 2020 pandemic outlier), the CDC estimates annual flu hospitalizations in the range of 140,000 to 710,000[4].
- Weekly hospitalizations typically rise through November and December, often exceeding 2,000 per week during the main flu wave. For example, in the 2023–2024 season, the peak occurred in late December, with early December representing the ramp-up phase[1].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- No major changes in CDC surveillance or reporting have been announced for the 2024–25 season as of the knowledge cutoff.
- The CDC and AMA continue to recommend annual flu vaccination for everyone 6 months and older[4].
- The CDC had not yet begun updating the FluSight Forecast Hub dataset with 2024–25 numbers as of early November 2024.

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The CDC's FluSight Forecast Hub and the associated target-hospital-admissions.csv file are the primary sources for weekly hospitalization counts.
- CDC seasonal summaries and FluSurv-NET reports provide context and historical data[1][4].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- The 2024–25 season's real-time data was not yet available as of the knowledge cutoff.
- There is inherent uncertainty due to reporting delays, data revisions, and the unpredictable nature of influenza transmission.
- The CDC's hospitalization estimates are based on both laboratory-confirmed cases and modeling, which may differ from direct counts.

## Conclusion

Based on historical patterns and the most recent season's trajectory, it is highly likely that the weekly total number of influenza hospitalizations in the US for the week ending Dec 7, 2024, will exceed 2,000. Early December typically falls within the period of rising hospitalizations, and recent seasons have shown weekly counts above this threshold during this phase[1][4].
