## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- During the Taliban’s first rule (1996–2001), China maintained limited engagement and did not recognize the regime. After the Taliban’s return in 2021, China’s policy shifted toward pragmatic engagement, offering humanitarian aid and diplomatic contact, but withholding formal recognition[1][2].
- China has steadily increased its diplomatic interactions, including hosting Taliban officials and being the first country to accept a Taliban-nominated ambassador in December 2023[4].
- As of May 2025, no country, including China, has formally recognized the Islamic Emirate, though engagement levels vary[4][2].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs has repeatedly stated support for Afghan sovereignty and reconstruction but has set conditions—namely, the Taliban must form an inclusive government and prevent Afghanistan from becoming a haven for terrorists[5].
- In December 2023, China accredited the Taliban’s nominated ambassador, a significant diplomatic gesture, though not formal recognition[4].
- Chinese officials and state media have signaled willingness to deepen ties if the Taliban meets international expectations, but have so far avoided being the first major power to grant full recognition[2][5].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Statements and press releases from China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs[1][5]
- Reports and analyses from think tanks (Brookings, RAND)[3][5]
- Reputable news and policy analysis outlets reporting on diplomatic developments[2][4]

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- Recognition is a binary act, but diplomatic engagement can blur the lines, complicating measurement.
- China’s decision likely hinges on the Taliban’s governance approach and wider international trends.
- The Taliban’s ability to address terrorism and inclusivity concerns remains uncertain[5].
- China may continue deep engagement without formal recognition if reputational or strategic risks outweigh benefits.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Based on current trends, China's deepening engagement but lack of formal recognition as of May 2025, and its stated conditions, there is a moderately high probability (estimated 60–75%) that China will recognize the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan before 2030—contingent on improvements in Taliban governance and international context. The most likely scenario is recognition if and when the Taliban demonstrates sufficient progress on counterterrorism and inclusivity, or if other major powers move first[2][5][4].
