## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of 2017, US civilians owned an estimated 393 million firearms, equivalent to 1.205 firearms per capita (120.5 firearms per 100 residents), according to the Small Arms Survey[4].
- From 2006 to 2017, global civilian-held firearms increased from 650 million to 857 million, a 32% rise, with the US accounting for nearly half of the global civilian total[3][4].
- The US population in 2017 was approximately 326 million. By 2029, it is projected to reach about 350 million (US Census projections, not cited in search results).

## 2. Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Metric

- There have been no major federal gun control laws passed between 2017 and 2024 that would significantly restrict total civilian gun ownership[5].
- Gun sales surged in 2020, with about 22 million guns sold through licensed dealers—a 64% increase over 2019. This suggests that the accumulation of firearms may have accelerated in the early 2020s[5].
- State-level variations exist, but national-level data suggest continued robust civilian firearm acquisition.

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Small Arms Survey is the main reference for global and US-specific civilian firearm holdings and per capita rates[1][2][3][4].
- Federal background check data (NICS) and reporting by organizations such as security.org provide insight into annual sales, which inform trends[5].

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- Small Arms Survey data are estimates and subject to methodological challenges, including underreporting, unregistered firearms, and potential double-counting or omissions[4].
- Changes in methodology or definition of “small firearm” by the Survey before 2029 could affect direct comparability.
- Future political, social, or legal developments (e.g., significant new legislation, mass buybacks, or societal shifts) could meaningfully alter the trend.
- The question will only resolve if the Small Arms Survey maintains its methodology and publishes a 2029 estimate.

## 5. Comparative and Probabilistic Assessment

Historical per capita ownership increased from approximately 0.93 in 2006 (using global and US estimates) to 1.205 in 2017, a growth rate of about 2.4% per year. If we conservatively assume the annual growth rate slows to about 1.5% due to market saturation, but account for the spike in 2020 and steady sales, a reasonable projection for 2029 is:

\[
2029\ \text{firearms per capita} = 1.205 \times (1 + 0.015)^{12} \approx 1.43
\]

Given uncertainties, the most probable range is **1.35–1.5 firearms per person** in the United States in 2029, assuming continued growth and no major restrictive interventions. The central estimate is about **1.43 firearms per capita**.

### Key Differences from Reference Case (2017)
- Continued increase in firearms sales, with notable spikes (e.g., 2020).
- US population growth dilutes per capita rate slightly if gun growth slows.
- No significant federal policy changes to restrict ownership.
- Potential for estimation uncertainty and reporting lag.

### Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

- **Central estimate for 2029:** 1.43 firearms per capita
- **80% probability range:** 1.35–1.5 firearms per capita
- **Key risks:** Policy changes, major social shifts, or methodological changes in reporting.
