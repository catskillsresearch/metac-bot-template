## Federal Workforce Forecast for November 2026

**1. Historical Trends and Current Status**

- As of December 2024, the US federal workforce stood at approximately 3,012,000 employees, according to FRED's "All Employees, Federal" series (measured in thousands, seasonally adjusted).
- From January 2023 to January 2025, the workforce expanded by about 140,000, reflecting stability and modest growth before recent policy changes[3].

**2. Recent Announcements and Policy Changes**

- The Trump administration, inaugurated in January 2025, has initiated substantial reductions in the federal workforce, targeting up to 700,000 positions—focusing on roles not legally protected.
- Notable planned or announced layoffs include:
  - 82,000 at the Veterans Administration (~17% of VA staff)
  - Nearly 2,000 at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (~20%)
  - Nearly half of the Department of Education (cutting ~1,950 jobs)
  - Up to 65% of the EPA, with a target of 11,000 jobs eliminated
- Across the federal workforce, about 75,000 employees have accepted buyouts, and layoffs among those on probation have begun.
- A hiring freeze is in effect, and future hiring is expected to only partially replace attrition[3].
- Some reduction plans face legal challenges, which may delay or reduce the scale of cuts[3].

**3. Authoritative Forecasts and Verification**

- University of Michigan economic forecasts (Feb 2025) project the federal workforce will "flatline" after the recent reductions, following a contraction of up to 240,000 civilian non-postal jobs. The overall government sector may see modest growth as local agencies expand to offset federal cuts[3].
- There is no indication of a full rebound in federal hiring before late 2026[3][4].

**4. Limitations and Uncertainties**

- The pace and total scope of reductions depend on legal outcomes, agency-specific decisions, and possible future policy changes.
- The FRED "All Employees, Federal" data is seasonally adjusted and authoritative but may be subject to reporting lag or revision.
- Some layoff numbers are announced but not fully implemented yet, and political developments could affect future hiring or cuts[3].

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Based on:
- A starting point of 3,012,000 employees (Dec 2024)
- Up to 700,000 planned cuts, but with implementation delays and partial reversals likely
- Expert projections suggesting a net reduction of 240,000 to 700,000, with stabilization thereafter

**Median forecast:**  
- The number of US federal employees in November 2026 will likely be around 2,400,000 (2,400 thousand), with a plausible range of 2,350,000 to 2,500,000.

This forecast assumes most major announced reductions are executed, but recognizes legal, logistical, and political constraints could lead to a higher actual number.
