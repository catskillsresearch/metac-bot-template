## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The CANZUK Free Movement proposal aims to replicate the Trans-Tasman Travel Arrangement (TTTA) between Australia and New Zealand, allowing citizens to move, reside, and work freely between Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the UK[5].
- Proposals for such an agreement have existed for decades, gaining renewed attention post-Brexit as the UK sought alternative international arrangements[5].
- Multiple advocacy organizations (notably CANZUK International) campaign for free movement, trade, and closer cooperation among these nations, emphasizing shared values and historical ties[1][3].
- However, as of December 2020, the UK government explicitly stated "no plans to seek equivalent arrangements with CANZUK" after ending free movement with the EU[4].

## 2. Recent Announcements and Policies

- As of late 2020, there was no official movement by any CANZUK government to begin negotiations or adopt a free movement treaty[4].
- The main activity comes from advocacy and lobbying groups, not from governmental channels[1][3].
- The UK has prioritized other trade and migration deals post-Brexit, with no indication of revisiting the CANZUK free movement idea in formal policy[4].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- UK Government official response to petition on free movement with CANZUK nations (December 2020)[4].
- Wikipedia articles on CANZUK and CANZUK International[1][5].
- Official website of CANZUK International[3].

## 4. Limitations or Uncertainties

- Public opinion in CANZUK countries may fluctuate, but formal adoption requires government initiation, which has not occurred.
- Political changes or unforeseen global events (such as shifts in immigration pressure, trade needs, or leadership) could alter priorities before 2029, but no such changes were evident as of May 2021.
- Advocacy group activity remains strong, but this has not translated into official negotiation frameworks or legislative proposals[1][3].

## Key Differences from Reference Cases

- Unlike the EU or TTTA, where treaties were driven by clear mutual economic or political imperatives and had strong government backing, CANZUK lacks coordinated governmental effort and faces more complex immigration and political environments.
- The explicit UK government statement rejecting new free movement arrangements is a significant negative signal, contrasting with the proactive stances taken in reference cases[4].

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the absence of government-initiated negotiations, explicit rejection by the UK government as of late 2020, and lack of concrete movement toward a treaty despite advocacy efforts, the probability of a CANZUK Free Movement Treaty being adopted before 2029 is low. A reasonable forecast as of May 2021 would place the probability below 20%, barring major political or geopolitical shifts.
