# Forecasting Milei vs. Sheinbaum Approval Ratings for March 30, 2025

Based on available data as of March 10, 2025, I'll analyze the key factors that could help forecast whether Javier Milei will have a higher approval rating than Claudia Sheinbaum by March 30, 2025.

## Current Status and Historical Trends

As of early February 2025, Morning Consult data showed Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum with a 66% approval rating, while Argentine President Javier Milei stood at 65%[1][2]. This represented a very narrow gap between the two leaders, with Sheinbaum holding a slight 1% advantage.

However, more recent data from late February to early March 2025 indicates a diverging trend:

- Claudia Sheinbaum's approval rating increased to 69% by early March 2025[4]
- Javier Milei's positive image decreased to 62% during the same period[4]

This represents a widening gap, with Sheinbaum now holding a 7% lead over Milei as of the most recent available data. The trend shows Sheinbaum gaining momentum while Milei has lost some support in the weeks leading up to March 10, 2025.

## Factors Affecting Milei's Approval

Javier Milei's governance approach and recent challenges may impact his approval trajectory:

1. **Economic Policies**: Milei is known for his libertarian economic policies focused on:
   - Reducing inflation and economic stabilization
   - Implementing market-friendly reforms
   - Strengthening Argentina's role in international trade[3]

2. **Political Opposition**: Milei faces significant political challenges:
   - "High political tension" in Argentina
   - Intensified criticism from "Kirchnerist and leftist sectors"
   - Controversy surrounding the cryptocurrency "$LIBRA" case, which opponents have used to criticize his administration[4]

Despite these challenges, Milei maintained "solid support" from Argentines according to the Morning Consult survey conducted between February 27 and March 5, 2025[4].

## Factors Affecting Sheinbaum's Approval

The search results provide limited specific information about factors driving Sheinbaum's approval ratings. However, her consistent high ratings (66% in February rising to 69% by early March) suggest her policies and governance approach are resonating with Mexican citizens[2][4].

## Comparative Standing

In the global leadership landscape as of early March 2025:

1. Narendra Modi (India): 77% positive image
2. Claudia Sheinbaum (Mexico): 69% positive image
3. Javier Milei (Argentina): 62% positive image
4. Anthony Albanese (Australia): 54% positive image
5. Donald Trump (United States): 49% positive image[4]

This positioning shows both Sheinbaum and Milei among the world's most popular leaders, though Sheinbaum has established a clear lead over Milei in recent measurements.

## Forecast Considerations

For Milei to overtake Sheinbaum by March 30, 2025, several factors would need to align:

1. **Reversal of Recent Trends**: The current trajectory shows Sheinbaum gaining and Milei declining. This trend would need to reverse significantly.

2. **Resolution of Political Tensions**: The political opposition and controversies facing Milei would likely need to subside.

3. **Economic Performance**: Positive results from Milei's economic policies could potentially boost his approval ratings.

4. **Potential Setbacks for Sheinbaum**: Any political missteps or challenges in Mexico could potentially reduce Sheinbaum's current advantage.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several limitations should be noted:

1. **Measurement Methodology**: Morning Consult's methodology may vary between countries, potentially affecting comparability.

2. **Recency of Data**: The most recent data available is from early March 2025, leaving approximately three weeks of potential changes before the March 30 target date.

3. **External Events**: Unforeseen political, economic, or social events could significantly impact either leader's approval ratings.

4. **Limited Information on Sheinbaum**: The available data provides fewer details about factors affecting Sheinbaum's approval ratings compared to Milei.

Based on the current trajectory and available information, Claudia Sheinbaum appears positioned to maintain her approval rating advantage over Javier Milei through March 30, 2025, unless significant changes occur in either country's political landscape.
