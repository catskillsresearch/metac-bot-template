## 1. Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of March 2019, only 62 Starlink satellites had been launched, with 57 operational. SpaceX planned to launch 12,000 satellites by the end of 2027[2].
- By April 2025, over 6,000 Starlink satellites had been launched, with approximately 4,800 operational and about 5,200 remaining in orbit[5].
- The company has regularly launched batches of 20–60 satellites per Falcon 9 mission, with plans to switch to Starship for larger, more frequent deployments[2][5].
- As of January 2025, analysts estimate about 6,700 operational satellites in orbit[3].

## 2. Recent Announcements and Policies

- SpaceX’s long-term ambition is to deploy over 40,000 satellites, with a near-term plan for up to 17,000 satellites by the end of 2028[4][2].
- The launch rate has accelerated, especially with the development of the Starship rocket, which is expected to enable much larger batches of satellites to be deployed at once[2].
- No major regulatory or policy obstacles as of 2025 have significantly impeded deployment, but ongoing satellite attrition and deorbiting are non-trivial factors[5].

## 3. Authoritative Forecasts

- The Metaculus community median forecast for operational Starlink satellites on January 1, 2028 is 11,100, with a 25th–75th percentile range of about 7,100–17,100[1].
- Independent analyses and media reports corroborate the likelihood of SpaceX reaching 11,000–17,000 operational satellites by early 2028, assuming continued launch cadence and attrition rates[3][4].

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- The exact operational count depends on satellite longevity and attrition—satellites deorbit or become non-functional over time, requiring replacement[5].
- The transition to Starship for launches could dramatically increase deployment rate, but is subject to technical and regulatory risks[2].
- Potential interference, regulatory changes, or global political shifts could impact deployment or operational status.
- The difference between "launched," "in orbit," and "operational" satellites must be noted; only operational satellites count for this forecast.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given current trends, plans, and expert/community forecasts, the most likely range for the number of operational Starlink satellites on January 1, 2028 is **11,000–17,000**, with a median estimate around **11,100**. The main source of uncertainty is the reliability of future launch cadence and satellite attrition rates.
