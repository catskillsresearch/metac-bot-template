## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The Energy Star program, managed by the EPA for over 30 years, remains highly recognized and is currently operational, with EnergyStar.gov confirmed as up and reachable as of May 7, 2025[2].
- The website continues to provide updates for 2025 product criteria, tax credit changes, and guidance for manufacturers and consumers, though some services (e.g., ProductFinder) are experiencing ongoing maintenance[2][3][4].

## 2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- The EPA announced a plan to eliminate the Energy Star program as part of broader agency restructuring, aiming to reallocate resources and reduce costs[1].
- Senior EPA officials have communicated that both the program and the overseeing office are slated for elimination, though public statements have stopped short of providing a definitive end date or explicit website shutdown notice[1].
- The agency has reiterated its commitment to “statutory obligations,” and certain Energy Star-related functions (notably those tied to federal tax credits) remain active and are being updated for 2025[4].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The operational status of EnergyStar.gov can be independently confirmed via Is It Down Right Now? (www.isitdownrightnow.com/energystar.gov.html), which verifies site availability and accessibility, and is the designated resolution source for this question.
- The EPA’s own website and official press releases provide authoritative updates on program changes[2][3][4].
- Media reporting, such as The New York Times and Utility Dive, provides context on the policy environment and administrative intent[1].

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- There is no public timeline for the website’s decommissioning, and it is unclear how swiftly the elimination directive will be executed.
- Statutory obligations (such as ongoing tax credits and product labeling) may legally require some Energy Star web resources to remain accessible beyond the program’s nominal end.
- Partial service disruptions (as seen with ProductFinder) suggest heightened risk of degradation or phased shutdown prior to full decommissioning[2].
- Political, legal, or administrative interventions could further delay or alter the shutdown process.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

- Given the explicit elimination policy, partial service disruptions, but ongoing statutory activities and lack of an announced shutdown date, the likelihood that EnergyStar.gov will remain online on July 1, 2025, is lower than in a typical year but not negligible.
- A reasonable probabilistic assessment would place the chance of EnergyStar.gov being online on July 1, 2025, at approximately 60%–75%, with the principal risk factors being unannounced rapid decommissioning or sudden administrative action in the intervening weeks.
