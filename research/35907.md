### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Jumaane Williams is the current New York City Public Advocate and has previously run for statewide office, including governor and lieutenant governor[3].
- As of March 2025, Williams is not listed as a declared candidate for mayor in the 2025 New York City mayoral race according to major candidate trackers and reporting[1].
- Williams is instead focused on his re-election campaign for Public Advocate, facing a challenge from State Assemblymember Jenifer Rajkumar[3].

### Recent Announcements and Policies

- There have been no public announcements or campaign launches by Williams indicating a run for mayor as of March 11, 2025.
- Reporting suggests that Williams would likely run for mayor only if he were to become acting mayor due to Eric Adams resigning or being removed from office. This scenario has not occurred as of the latest available information[2].

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The New York Times "Whoâ€™s Running for Mayor of New York City?" tracker is the definitive source for candidate status. As of the cutoff date, Williams is not listed as running[1].
- City & State New York and Politico provide additional reporting on Williams' current political activities and potential future plans[2][3].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- The situation could change if Mayor Adams were to resign or be removed, at which point Williams would become acting mayor and would likely run in a special election[2]. However, this is a hypothetical scenario and not the current reality as of March 11, 2025.
- Candidate filings and public announcements can occur after the cutoff date, but only information available before March 11, 2025, is considered.

### Conclusion

As of March 11, 2025, there is no factual basis to state that Jumaane Williams is running for mayor of New York City. He is not listed as a candidate on the New York Times tracker, and all available reporting indicates he is focused on his Public Advocate re-election campaign unless a vacancy in the mayor's office arises[1][2][3].
