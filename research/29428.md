## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- South Dakota voters have considered recreational marijuana legalization in the last three consecutive election cycles. In 2020, voters approved a constitutional amendment legalizing marijuana, but the measure was later struck down by the courts on procedural grounds[1][3][5].
- In 2022, Initiated Measure 27, which also sought to legalize recreational marijuana, was rejected by voters with 47.08% in favor and 52.92% opposed[3].
- As of October 2024, recreational marijuana remains illegal in South Dakota[3].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- Initiated Measure 29 would legalize recreational marijuana for adults 21 and older, allowing possession of up to two ounces of marijuana, 16 grams of concentrates, and cultivation of up to six plants per person (12 per household)[1][3][4].
- The South Dakota Republican Party formally opposes IM 29 and has urged members to support efforts to defeat the measure[1].
- The measure does not establish a tax or fee structure for marijuana sales[1].

## Recent Polling and Voter Sentiment

- An Emerson College Polling survey conducted October 19-22, 2024, found that 50% of likely voters plan to oppose IM 29, 45% plan to support it, and 5% are undecided[4].
- This poll suggests that, as of late October 2024, opposition to the measure slightly outweighs support, with a small but potentially decisive group of undecided voters remaining[4].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Ballotpedia provides comprehensive background and updates on Initiated Measure 29[3].
- South Dakota Public Broadcasting and Reason Foundation offer additional context and analysis[1][5].
- Emerson College Polling, in partnership with KELO-TV and The Hill, conducted the most recent and relevant public opinion survey[4].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- Polling data is subject to margins of error and may not fully capture late shifts in voter sentiment or turnout dynamics.
- The undecided voter segment (5% as of late October 2024) could influence the final outcome, especially given the close polling margins[4].
- South Dakota has a history of close and sometimes unpredictable outcomes on marijuana measures, as seen in the 2020 approval (later overturned) and the 2022 narrow defeat[3][5].

## Summary Table: Recent South Dakota Marijuana Legalization Ballot Measures

| Year | Measure                | Result         | Yes (%) | No (%)  |
|------|------------------------|---------------|---------|---------|

| 2024 | Initiated Measure 29   | TBD (Polling: 45% Yes, 50% No, 5% Undecided) | 45      | 50      |

## Conclusion

As of October 31, 2024, the most recent polling indicates that Initiated Measure 29 is likely to be defeated, with 50% of likely voters opposed and 45% in support, and 5% undecided[4]. While a late shift among undecided voters could affect the outcome, historical trends and current polling suggest that approval is unlikely unless there is a significant change in voter sentiment before Election Day.
