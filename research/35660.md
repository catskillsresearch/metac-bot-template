## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Capital Bikeshare recorded over 6.1 million rides in 2024, representing a 36.9% increase over 2023, the largest annual ridership jump among US systems[2].
- The system has seen uninterrupted year-over-year monthly ridership growth for at least 32 consecutive months as of August 2024[5].
- August 2024 set a new monthly record with 614,639 rides, a 31.1% increase over August 2023[5].
- The network has expanded to over 700 stations and 6,000 bikes as of July 2024, with continued growth in both infrastructure and ridership[4].
- E-bikes now account for a majority of trips, and members make up about 63% of all rides[5].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- The system continues to expand, with new stations being added in Virginia and ongoing infrastructure improvements[4][5].
- No significant service reductions or negative policy changes have been reported; rather, the focus is on expansion and increased accessibility[4][5].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The US Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) provides official monthly trip counts for Capital Bikeshare, which will ultimately verify the February 2025 total[1].
- Capital Bikeshare's own system data and annual reports offer detailed historical and operational information[1][4].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- Exact trip numbers for February 2024 are not included in the search results, so the forecast must extrapolate from annual and monthly growth rates.
- February is typically a lower-ridership month due to winter weather, but the strong upward trend suggests a higher number than previous years.
- Unpredictable factors such as severe weather or operational disruptions could impact the actual total.

## Forecast Summary

Given the 36.9% year-over-year growth in 2024 and the consistent monthly increases, it is reasonable to forecast that Capital Bikeshare will record a February 2025 trip count significantly higher than February 2024. While the exact number for February 2024 is not provided, the open bounds [280,000.0, 370,000.0] for February 2025 are consistent with recent monthly ridership figures and the system's growth trajectory[2][5]. The final, authoritative number will be published by the US Bureau of Transportation Statistics[1].
