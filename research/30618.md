# Forecasting Nancy Pelosi's Stock Portfolio vs. Berkshire Hathaway in 2024

Based on available information prior to December 2024, here's an analysis to help forecast whether Nancy Pelosi's stock portfolio will outperform Berkshire Hathaway in 2024.

## Nancy Pelosi's Portfolio Performance

### Historical and Current Performance

Nancy Pelosi's stock portfolio has demonstrated remarkable performance in recent years. Her portfolio gained an impressive 65% in January 2024, significantly outpacing the S&P 500's 24% return during the same period[1]. This follows a strong 2023 performance where she earned approximately $43 million[2].

As of October 2024, Pelosi had made over $23 million through what sources describe as "strategic investments"[4]. In just over a month prior to mid-October, her stock market moves generated approximately $12 million, with an additional rise of $1.2 million on October 15 alone[4]. Her overall net worth was reported to be close to $257 million[4].

Looking at longer-term performance, Pelosi's portfolio has returned over 700% over a decade, consistently outperforming the broader market[3].

### Portfolio Composition

Pelosi's 2024 portfolio shows a strong focus on technology stocks, particularly those related to artificial intelligence:

- **Nvidia (NVDA)**: Her largest holding at 21% of her portfolio, gained 95.75% since the start of 2024[2]
- **Microsoft (MSFT)**: 18% of portfolio, gained 15.60%[2]
- **Apple (AAPL)**: 19% of portfolio, recorded losses of -7% in the first three months[2]
- **Alphabet (GOOGL)**: 12% of portfolio, gained 9.12%[2]
- **Amazon (AMZN)**: 4% of portfolio, gained 19.30%[2]

### Recent Strategic Moves

In 2024, Pelosi made several notable trades:

1. A well-timed purchase of Palo Alto Networks (PANW) in late February[4]
2. A "massive Broadcom (AVGO) options buy" in late June, just before the company's 10-for-1 stock split[3][4]
3. Liquidation of her Tesla (TSLA) holdings during summer 2024, cutting losses on positions built during 2021-2022 market highs[4]

Her Broadcom investment appears particularly strategic, as the company had recently acquired VMware and was experiencing high demand for networking chips in AI data centers. For the quarter ending February 4, Broadcom's revenue increased 34% year-over-year to $12 billion[3].

## Factors Affecting Performance Comparison

### Technology Sector Performance

Pelosi's portfolio is heavily weighted toward technology stocks, particularly those involved in artificial intelligence. Her success in 2024 has been attributed to both "impeccable timing" and her focus on the technology sector, which has been a major driver behind broader market strength in 2024[4].

### Limitations in Forecast

Several factors limit our ability to make a definitive forecast:

1. **Incomplete Year Data**: As of this analysis, 2024 is not complete, and market conditions could change significantly.
2. **Berkshire Hathaway Performance**: The available information does not provide specific data on Berkshire Hathaway's performance in 2024 for direct comparison.
3. **Portfolio Changes**: Both Pelosi and Berkshire Hathaway may make significant portfolio changes before year-end that could impact relative performance.

## Conclusion

Based on available information, Nancy Pelosi's portfolio has shown strong performance in 2024, with significant gains driven by strategic investments in technology stocks, particularly those related to artificial intelligence. Her portfolio has historically outperformed the market, returning over 700% in a decade[3].

While her 2024 performance appears strong, a definitive forecast of whether her portfolio will outperform Berkshire Hathaway by year-end would require additional data on Berkshire's performance and potential market movements in the remaining months of 2024.
