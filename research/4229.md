# Forecasting Foreign Nationals in Mainland China: 2010-2030

The question asks whether the number of foreign nationals in Mainland China will decrease from the 2010 level of 593,832 (as reported in the 6th national census) by the time of the expected 8th national census in 2030. Based on data available as of July 6, 2020, I'll analyze relevant trends and factors to provide a probabilistic assessment.

## Current Status and Historical Trends

According to the 2010 census (6th national census), China had a foreign population of approximately 593,832 residents[2]. However, it's worth noting that the actual number of foreigners working in China as of 2010 was estimated to be much smallerâ€”approximately 200,000[4]. This suggests that many foreign nationals in China were not there primarily for employment purposes.

Foreign nationals, while relatively small in number compared to China's total population, have exerted economic influence beyond their proportional representation because most hold managerial and professional positions in key industries such as information technology and telecommunications[4].

## Key Factors Affecting the Forecast

### 1. Migration Patterns and Population Trends

China has experienced significant changes in migration patterns in recent decades. After the 1990s, China went through an "emigration craze" with millions of Chinese citizens moving abroad[1]. By 2020, an estimated 10.5 million Chinese citizens lived overseas[1]. This outward migration trend reflects the country's increasing global engagement until recent developments.

Internal migration within China has also accelerated dramatically, with the number of internal migrants growing from 30 million in 1990 to 376 million in 2020[5]. This represents approximately one-fourth of China's entire population and reflects rapid economic development driving population movement.

### 2. Recent Policy Shifts

Several significant policy developments as of mid-2020 suggest a potential decrease in foreign nationals by 2030:

- Under Xi Jinping's leadership, China has shown signs of slowing or reversing its previous trend of increasing openness and economic integration with the outside world.
- The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated economic "decoupling" between China and the United States, potentially reducing business ties that would bring foreigners to China.
- As part of its pandemic response, China implemented strict border controls, including temporarily banning the entry of foreign nationals.
- Reports indicate increasing suspicion toward foreigners within China during the pandemic period.

### 3. Demographic Projections

China's overall population dynamics are projected to change significantly between 2010 and 2030. According to United Nations population prospects, China will see the fastest population increases in the age ranges of 35 to 44 and 55 to 64 from 2020 to 2030[5]. These demographic shifts may influence economic policies and immigration patterns.

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on the information available as of July 6, 2020, I assess a **65-70% probability** that the number of foreign nationals in Mainland China will decrease from the 2010 level by 2030.

This assessment is based on several factors:

1. **Policy Direction**: China's shift toward more nationalistic policies under Xi Jinping's leadership appears to be a long-term strategic direction rather than a temporary adjustment.

2. **COVID-19 Impact**: The pandemic has provided justification for tighter border controls and increased scrutiny of foreigners. Even if pandemic-specific restrictions eventually ease, the infrastructure and precedent for stricter immigration control have been established.

3. **Economic Decoupling**: The trend toward economic separation between China and Western economies, particularly the United States, was already underway before the pandemic and appears likely to continue, potentially reducing business-related immigration.

4. **Technological Self-Sufficiency**: China's push for technological independence may reduce the need for foreign expertise in key sectors where foreigners previously held influential positions.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several significant uncertainties affect this forecast:

1. The long-term economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic remains unclear as of mid-2020.

2. China might strategically adjust its policies toward foreigners in specific sectors or regions to meet economic objectives.

3. Geopolitical developments between 2020 and 2030 could significantly alter China's approach to foreign nationals.

4. The methodology for counting foreign nationals might change between censuses, affecting comparability.

5. The search results provide limited information about the actual trajectory of foreign population in China between 2010 and 2020, making it difficult to establish the direction of the trend before the pandemic.
