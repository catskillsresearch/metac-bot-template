### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Gold prices reached a historic high of $2,790 per ounce in October 2024, driven by strong central bank buying, persistent inflation concerns, and expectations of Federal Reserve rate cuts[1].
- As of late 2024, gold has demonstrated a strong upward trajectory, with investors seeing significant returns earlier in the year[1].

### Recent Announcements and Analyst Forecasts

- **Goldman Sachs** raised its year-end 2024 gold price forecast to $2,700 per ounce, citing continued central bank accumulation and macroeconomic uncertainty[1].
- **Morgan Stanley** expects gold prices to potentially exceed $2,600 per ounce by the end of 2024, highlighting gold's role as a safe-haven asset amid global turmoil[1].
- **Commerzbank** projects gold to reach $2,600 in early 2025[1].
- **ING** revised its Q4 2024 forecast to an average of $2,150 per ounce, with a 2024 average of $2,084 per ounce[4].
- **Sprott Money** anticipates gold finishing 2024 near $2,248 per ounce, aligning with the long-term average annual gain[2].
- Other analysts suggest that while gold may set new all-time highs, the price is likely to remain volatile and influenced by inflation, interest rates, and geopolitical risks[3].

### Authoritative Source for Verification

- The definitive source for determining whether gold closes below $2,800 per ounce on each trading day through December 27, 2024, is Yahoo Finance's historical data for Comex Gold Spot prices[1].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- Gold prices are highly sensitive to macroeconomic developments, including unexpected shifts in Federal Reserve policy, inflation data, and geopolitical events.
- While forecasts from major financial institutions suggest prices will remain below $2,800, the October 2024 high of $2,790 demonstrates that the threshold is within reach, and further volatility cannot be ruled out[1].
- Forecasts are subject to change, and actual market outcomes may differ from current projections.

|--------------------|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Goldman Sachs      | $2,700                | Upgraded due to central bank buying         |

| Sprott Money       | ~$2,248               | Based on long-term average gains            |

### Conclusion

Based on available forecasts and the current trajectory, most major analysts expect Comex Gold Spot prices to remain below $2,800 per ounce through December 27, 2024. However, the proximity of the October 2024 high ($2,790) to the $2,800 threshold and ongoing market volatility mean that a breach cannot be entirely ruled out. The final resolution depends on daily closing prices as recorded by Yahoo Finance.
