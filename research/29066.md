### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- In 2016, the RCP national polling average underestimated Trump's performance by 1.8 percentage points; in 2020, the underestimation was 2.7 points[1].
- In the 2022 midterms, the pattern reversed: polls overestimated Republican performance by 3.7 points in key Senate races, but the national generic congressional ballot was highly accurate, with RCP's average only 0.3 points off the final result[1].
- As of October 17, 2024, the RCP national polling average shows Trump trailing Harris by -1.583 percentage points[4].

### Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Metric

- There have been no major methodological changes or announcements from RCP or major pollsters that would systematically alter the expected bias for 2024.
- The "shy Trump voter" hypothesis, which posits that Trump supporters are less likely to respond honestly to pollsters, remains debated and unproven as a consistent source of bias[1].

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- RealClearPolling's own analysis and averages provide the primary data for both historical and current polling bias[1][4].
- Expert commentary from polling analysts highlights the unpredictability of polling bias from one cycle to the next[5].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- Polling bias is not stable or reliably predictive across election cycles. As noted by polling analysts, the direction and magnitude of bias can and does invert from one election to the next[5].
- The 2022 midterms demonstrated that polling bias can shift, with Republicans being overestimated rather than underestimated[1].
- The calculation for 2024 will depend on the actual popular vote margin between Trump and Harris, which is unknown as of October 22, 2024.

### Conclusion

Based on available data as of October 22, 2024:
- The historical trend suggests RCP's polling bias for Trump has been less than -1.0 percentage points (i.e., polls have underestimated Trump by more than 1 point).
- The most recent RCP national average (-1.583 points for Trump) is within the range in question.
- However, the 2022 midterms and expert analysis indicate that polling bias is not reliably consistent or predictable, and could fall anywhere within or outside the specified range.

**Forecast:** There is a plausible historical basis for expecting RCP's polling bias for Trump to be less than -1.0 percentage points, but significant uncertainty remains due to the lack of a consistent pattern and recent reversals in polling bias direction. The outcome will depend on the final vote margin, which cannot be known before the election.
