## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Throughout 2024, Alabama has experienced persistent and worsening drought conditions. By early September, 100% of the state was classified as dry, with every county experiencing some level of drought. October, historically Alabama's driest month, saw continued lack of rainfall, further intensifying drought impacts on agriculture, water supply, and ecological systems[4].
- As of November 1, 2024, moderate drought (D1) and worse was primarily affecting Alabama, with many areas experiencing over 30 days without measurable rainfall. Some locations were on track to tie for their driest month on record since the late 1800s[1].
- Streamflows in Alabama were below normal in drought-affected areas, and agricultural agents reported quickly deteriorating conditions, including poor pastures and delays in planting[1][5].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- The Alabama Office of Water Resources (OWR) issues drought declarations based on current and forecasted conditions, but these are primarily for awareness and resource management rather than direct intervention[2].
- Several burn bans and restrictions were in place as of late 2024 due to increased fire risk, but no major new policies were announced that would materially affect drought status before year-end[1].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The U.S. Drought Monitor and Drought.gov are the official sources for drought status and population estimates in drought-affected areas. The specific resolution source for this forecast is the Drought.gov Alabama page[3].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- Population in drought is estimated by overlaying census data with drought-affected areas, which can introduce some uncertainty, especially if drought boundaries shift rapidly near the end of the year[3].
- While forecasts indicate a weak La Niña pattern will likely bring below-normal precipitation to Alabama through December, there is always some uncertainty in seasonal weather predictions[1][5].
- The resolution depends strictly on the Drought.gov Alabama page as accessed by Metaculus admins on or after December 31, 2024.

## Forecast Assessment

Given that:
- Drought conditions have expanded and intensified through late 2024, with the entire state affected at times[4].
- Forecasts call for continued below-normal precipitation through December due to a weak La Niña[1][5].
- No major policy or weather pattern changes are expected to alleviate drought before year-end.

It is likely that a significant portion of Alabama's population—potentially 2.0 million or more—will remain in areas classified as drought on December 31, 2024. However, the precise number will depend on the final drought boundaries and population overlays on the Drought.gov Alabama page at the resolution date.
