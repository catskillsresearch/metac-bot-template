### Key Historical Trends

- The announcement of Cabinet department heads by a President-elect typically begins within two to three weeks after Election Day and continues through December and into January.
- For President Biden in 2020, the first major round of Cabinet announcements occurred on November 23, about three weeks after Election Day[3].
- By mid-December 2020, Biden had announced nominees for several key departments, but not all 15. Some positions were announced later, with the final three announced in early January 2021[3].
- Historically, the number of department heads announced between Election Day and mid-December generally falls within the 8-9 range, but there is variation. For example, the Senate had confirmed only five Cabinet secretaries 15 days into Biden’s administration, though more had been announced by that point[4].

### Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- There have been no significant changes to the transition process or Cabinet announcement procedures as of November 8, 2024.
- The pace and order of announcements remain at the discretion of the incoming administration and are influenced by political, logistical, and vetting considerations.

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Official announcements from the President-elect’s transition team, major news outlets, and government websites (such as the U.S. Senate’s nomination tracker) are considered authoritative for verifying the timing and number of department head announcements[2][3][4].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- The exact number of department heads announced by December 16 depends on the transition strategy of the incoming administration, which can vary widely.
- Only official announcements count; media speculation or reports of pending announcements do not.
- Retention of incumbents, if officially announced, counts toward the total.
- Senate confirmation is not required for this metric; only the official announcement matters.

### Summary Table: Historical Cabinet Announcement Timing

| Administration | Election Year | Approx. Number of Department Heads Announced by Mid-December |
|----------------|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Biden          | 2020         | 7-9 (est.)[3][4]                                             |
| Trump          | 2016         | 8-10 (est.)                                                  |
| Obama          | 2008         | 8-9 (est.)                                                   |

Based on historical precedent, it is plausible that 8 or 9 federal executive department heads will be announced by the incoming administration between the election and December 16, 2024, but the exact number will depend on the specific transition timeline chosen.
