### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of February 12, 2025, Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin have not met in person since Trump took office. Their first publicly disclosed call occurred on February 12, 2025, during which they discussed Ukraine, bilateral relations, and the possibility of future in-person meetings[1][2].
- Both leaders have expressed openness to meeting, with Trump suggesting Saudi Arabia as a possible venue and Putin inviting Trump to Moscow. However, neither side has committed to a specific date or month for such a meeting[1][2].

### Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- Trump stated he "might meet" Putin in Saudi Arabia but did not provide a timeline, emphasizing continued phone contact for the time being[1].
- The Kremlin confirmed the intention to maintain personal contact, including in-person meetings, but did not specify when this would occur[2].
- No official announcements or scheduled dates for an in-person meeting have been made as of February 12, 2025.

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Axios report on Trump's comments regarding a possible meeting with Putin in Saudi Arabia[1].
- Official Kremlin readout of the February 12, 2025, Trump-Putin phone call, confirming openness to future in-person meetings[2].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- No concrete date or month has been set for a Trump-Putin meeting as of February 12, 2025.
- Diplomatic developments can change rapidly, and new information could emerge after the cutoff date.
- The forecast is based solely on information available up to February 12, 2025.

### Forecast

Given the lack of a scheduled date and the explicit statements that further contact will be by phone for now, the most supportable answer is:

**Not before April 2025**
