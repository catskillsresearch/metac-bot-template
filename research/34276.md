Based on information available as of January 30, 2025, there are several key factors that help forecast whether Israel or Hamas will accuse each other of violating the January 15, 2025 ceasefire before March 31, 2025.

## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

The ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas was announced on January 15, 2025, after more than 15 months of intense conflict that resulted in approximately 47,000 Gazans killed and 110,000 injured[4]. The implementation of this agreement began on January 19, 2025[3][4]. The ceasefire is structured as a multi-phased, gradual process with three distinct stages, with the first stage currently underway as of January 29, 2025[3].

Notably, the ceasefire implementation faced immediate challenges. On the intended start date (January 19, 2025), there was a delay when Israel accused Hamas of failing to provide the names of the first hostages to be released[2]. Israel Defense Forces spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari stated, "According to the Prime Minister [Benjamin Netanyahu], the ceasefire will not come into effect as long as Hamas does not fulfill its commitment to the agreement"[2]. This early tension demonstrates the fragility of the agreement from its inception.

## Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

According to reports as of January 29, 2025, Israel has already been accused of violating the ceasefire agreement by killing at least 110 Palestinians, some of whom were displaced people attempting to return to northern Gaza[5]. Additionally, on January 26, 2025, Israel reportedly violated its separate ceasefire with Hezbollah in Lebanon, resulting in 24 deaths and 134 injuries[5].

The first stage of the ceasefire includes several key components:
- A pause in hostilities
- Phased release of captives
- Increased humanitarian aid to Gaza
- Gradual withdrawal of Israeli forces from densely populated areas
- Return of displaced Palestinians to their homes[3][5]

Analysts have noted that there is a "clear risk that attacks in Gaza will provoke a response from Hamas," which some suggest "may be Israel's intentionâ€”to derail the ceasefire and allow Israel to reignite its violent assault on Gaza"[5].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

The implementation and status of the ceasefire can be verified through:
1. Official statements from the Israeli government and Hamas leadership
2. Reports from the three mediating parties: the United States, Qatar, and Egypt, who confirmed the deal in a joint statement[4]
3. Assessments from international organizations monitoring the situation, including the United Nations
4. Academic analysis, such as that provided by American University's School of International Service[3]

## Limitations or Uncertainties in Measurement

Several factors complicate the assessment of ceasefire violations:
1. The agreement is described as "shaky at best"[5], indicating inherent instability
2. There are competing narratives about what constitutes a violation, with each side potentially interpreting the terms differently
3. The multi-phased nature of the agreement means that certain actions may be permitted during some phases but not others
4. Attribution of violence can be disputed, particularly in complex conflict zones
5. The ceasefire deal has been characterized by some analysts as "incoherent" and "guaranteed to fail"[4], suggesting structural weaknesses in the agreement itself

Given that accusations of violations have already occurred within the first ten days of the ceasefire's implementation, and considering the historical pattern of mutual accusations between Israel and Hamas, there is substantial evidence suggesting that further accusations of violations are likely to occur before March 31, 2025.
