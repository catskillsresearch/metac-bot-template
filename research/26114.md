## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- In 2024, President Macron called a snap legislative election after the National Rally’s record success in the EU Parliament elections and his own party’s poor showing, aiming to reframe the political situation and potentially diminish the far right’s momentum ahead of the 2027 presidential race[5].
- The resulting National Assembly is highly fragmented: the New Popular Front (left) holds 180 seats, Macron’s centrist Ensemble has 159, and the National Rally has 142, with none commanding a majority in the 577-seat chamber. This has created a situation of legislative gridlock and raised concerns about the viability of any future government[5].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- Macron is constitutionally prohibited from dissolving the National Assembly and calling another snap election for at least one year after the last dissolution, meaning no new snap election could be called until at least July 2025[3][5].
- In public statements, Macron has strongly denied rumors or reports that he is planning to call another snap election, describing such claims as “complete nonsense” and emphasizing that he has neither said nor considered such action[1].
- Instead, Macron has indicated he will ask the French public to decide on certain “crucial issues” via referendums in 2025, not via another legislative election[3].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Macron’s statements to the press on not planning another dissolution[1].
- Le Monde’s coverage of Macron’s intent to use referendums for major decisions in 2025[3].
- Analysis of the underlying rationale and risks behind the 2024 snap election and the current political landscape[5].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- While the risk of government deadlock is high, the French Constitution’s one-year restriction on dissolutions makes another snap election legally impossible until at least July 2025.
- After July 2025, a further snap election would depend on the severity of the deadlock, government collapse, and the political calculation of whether another dissolution would actually resolve the crisis or further empower rivals.
- Macron’s continued public opposition to another snap election reduces the probability, though sudden political crises could change his calculus.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the constitutional limitations, Macron’s public denials, and the high political cost of repeated snap elections, the probability that he will call another snap legislative election before January 1, 2026, is low but not zero. Only a severe and unresolvable parliamentary crisis after July 2025 would make such a move plausible.
