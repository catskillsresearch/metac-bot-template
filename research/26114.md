## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Following the 2024 snap legislative elections, France’s National Assembly is split three ways: New Popular Front (180 seats), Ensemble (159), and National Rally (142), with no party holding a majority in the 577-seat chamber[5].
- Macron previously called early elections in response to his coalition's poor performance and the surge of the National Rally in the 2024 EU vote, aiming to force opposition parties into responsibility and possibly recalibrate the political landscape[5].
- The French constitution allows the president to dissolve the National Assembly only once per year, so the earliest possible date for another snap election would be after July 2025.

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- In his 2025 New Year’s address, Macron admitted that the 2024 snap election “caused more divisions than solutions” and called for “stability” and “the right compromises” in the new year, signaling strong reluctance to repeat the process[4].
- Reports in April 2025 suggested Macron was considering another snap election, but Macron’s office officially denied these rumors, labeling them “complete nonsense” and affirming no such plans exist[2][3].
- Macron has emphasized a focus on collective action and useful reforms for 2025, further underscoring his current disinterest in further electoral disruption[4].

## Key Differences Affecting the Forecast

- The unprecedented three-way split in parliament raises the risk of legislative deadlock or government collapse, which could in theory pressure Macron into considering another dissolution.
- Macron’s political capital is diminished after consecutive electoral setbacks, making another snap election a high-risk move with unpredictable outcomes[4][5].
- Constitutional restrictions prevent any dissolution before July 2025, narrowing the window for action and providing time for potential compromise or stabilization.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

- Macron and his office have explicitly denied any intent to call another snap election before 2026, and his public messaging has shifted toward stability and compromise[2][3][4].
- The constitutional one-year limit and the lessons from the 2024 snap election both act as strong deterrents against further dissolutions in the near term.
- However, the significant risk of government paralysis or collapse due to the fractured parliament leaves a non-zero chance that a snap election could be called if no workable coalition or government emerges.

**On current evidence, the probability that Macron will call another snap legislative election before January 1, 2026, appears low—likely below 20%—but cannot be ruled out entirely if a major crisis occurs.**

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- The situation remains fluid; unexpected events, such as a failed government, public unrest, or a major economic crisis, could force Macron’s hand.
- Probabilities may change as the political climate evolves, especially after July 2025 when another dissolution becomes legally permissible.
- The forecast is based on public statements and current political incentives, which could shift rapidly in response to unforeseen developments.
