### Key Factual Information Relevant to Forecasting SMCI's 10-K Filing

**1. Historical Trends and Current Status**
- Super Micro Computer, Inc. (SMCI) has a history of timely financial reporting, but for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, the company announced on August 28, 2024, that it would not file its Form 10-K on time and would submit a Notification of Late Filing (Form 12b-25)[1].
- On August 30, 2024, SMCI filed the 12b-25 with the SEC, formally stating it was unable to file its 10-K by the original deadline. This filing typically grants a 15-day extension, moving the deadline to approximately September 13â€“14, 2024[2].
- As of the latest available data, the SEC EDGAR system does not show a 10-K filing for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024[3].

**2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric**
- The August 28, 2024, press release and the August 30, 2024, 12b-25 filing are the most recent official communications regarding the 10-K. Both confirm the delay but do not provide a specific new filing date[1][2].
- The company released its Q4 and full-year 2024 financial results on August 6, 2024, indicating that the underlying financial data is available, but this does not guarantee the 10-K will be filed by the extended deadline[4].

**3. Authoritative Sources for Verification**
- The only resolution source for this question is the SEC EDGAR filings page for SMCI, as specified in the question[3].

**4. Limitations and Uncertainties**
- The 12b-25 extension is not a guarantee that the 10-K will be filed within the extension period; companies sometimes miss even the extended deadline.
- There is no public information as of the cutoff date confirming when the 10-K will be filed.
- The absence of the 10-K on EDGAR as of September 2, 2024, is the strongest factual indicator, but does not preclude a filing before October 1, 2024.

**Summary Table**

| Factor                                    | Status as of 2024-09-02          |
|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| 10-K for FY ended June 30, 2024 filed?     | No                               |
| 12b-25 (extension) filed?                  | Yes (Aug 30, 2024)               |
| New expected filing date announced?        | No                               |
| Financial results for FY 2024 released?    | Yes (Aug 6, 2024)                |
| Authoritative resolution source?           | SEC EDGAR link specified         |

**Conclusion:**  
As of September 2, 2024, SMCI has not filed its 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024. The company has formally notified of a delay and received a standard extension, but there is no guarantee or public commitment that the filing will occur before October 1, 2024. The absence of the 10-K on EDGAR as of the cutoff date is the most significant factual indicator for forecasting.
