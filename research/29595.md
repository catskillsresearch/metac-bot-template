# Forecasting Nvidia's Q3 2024 Earnings

To assess whether Nvidia's earnings for Q3 2024 will exceed $0.74 per share, I'll analyze historical performance, recent trends, and relevant factors that could impact their upcoming earnings.

## Historical Performance

Nvidia has demonstrated exceptional financial performance in recent quarters. For context, in Q3 fiscal 2024 (which ended October 29, 2023):

- GAAP earnings per diluted share were $3.71, representing a 12x increase year-over-year and a 50% increase from the previous quarter[1][2]
- Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were $4.02, nearly 6x higher than the previous year and 49% higher than the previous quarter[1][2]
- Total revenue reached $18.12 billion, up 206% year-over-year and 34% quarter-over-quarter[1]
- Data Center revenue was $14.51 billion, up 279% year-over-year and 41% quarter-over-quarter[1]

It's important to note that Nvidia's fiscal year differs from the calendar year. The Q3 2024 referenced in the question likely refers to Nvidia's fiscal Q3 2025, which would end around October 2024 with results announced in November 2024.

## Growth Drivers

Several factors have been driving Nvidia's strong performance:

1. **AI and Accelerated Computing**: CEO Jensen Huang attributed their growth to "the broad industry platform transition from general-purpose to accelerated computing and generative AI"[2]

2. **Data Center Segment**: This has been Nvidia's primary growth engine, with Q3 fiscal 2024 showing a non-GAAP gross margin increase from 76% in Q2 to 78% in Q3[5]

3. **Expanding Customer Base**: Beyond initial adoption by "large language model startups, consumer internet companies and global cloud service providers," Nvidia has seen growth from "nations and regional CSPs... enterprise software companies... and enterprises creating custom AI"[2]

## Analyst Projections

Following Nvidia's Q3 fiscal 2024 earnings release in November 2023, analysts increased their estimates for both FY 2025 and FY 2026:

- Data Center business estimates were raised by approximately $8 billion for both fiscal years[5]
- Non-GAAP diluted EPS for FY 2026 was projected to be $24 per share, representing a 13.6% increase from earlier projections[5]

## Assessment

Based on historical data and growth trends, Nvidia has consistently exceeded earnings expectations, with Q3 fiscal 2024 EPS of $3.71 (GAAP) and $4.02 (non-GAAP) far surpassing the $0.74 threshold mentioned in the question. The company's continued leadership in AI and data center markets suggests strong potential for maintaining high earnings performance.

However, several factors could impact future performance:

1. **Market Competition**: Increased competition in the AI chip market could affect Nvidia's market share and margins
2. **Supply Chain Considerations**: Any constraints in manufacturing or component availability could limit growth
3. **Macroeconomic Factors**: Changes in global economic conditions or tech sector performance could influence results

## Limitations

This analysis is based on historical data through early 2024, and market conditions may change significantly by the time of the Q3 2024 earnings release. Additionally, while historical performance shows strong growth, past performance doesn't guarantee future results.
