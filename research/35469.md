## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams launched to the International Space Station (ISS) in June 2024 aboard Boeing’s Starliner for what was intended to be a short mission. Due to technical issues with Starliner’s propulsion and helium systems, their return was repeatedly delayed, and the Starliner capsule was ultimately returned to Earth without crew in September 2024[1][2][4].
- NASA decided that Wilmore and Williams would return to Earth aboard a SpaceX Dragon capsule instead of Starliner, citing ongoing safety concerns and the need for further testing of Starliner[1][2][4].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- In December 2024, NASA announced that the astronauts would return "in late March 2025 at the earliest" on a SpaceX Dragon capsule, following the arrival of the Crew-10 mission and a brief handover period[2][4].
- As of February 2025, NASA reaffirmed that Wilmore and Williams are scheduled to return with the Crew-9 mission after Crew-10 arrives, with the earliest possible return date being late March 2025[2].
- Some sources note that the return could slip into early April 2025, depending on operational factors and the timing of Crew-10’s arrival and handover[5].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- NASA’s official news releases and statements[1][2][4]
- Major science and news outlets, including Live Science, CBS News, and Discover Magazine[2][4][5]

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- The return date is contingent on the successful launch and docking of Crew-10, as well as the completion of a handover period on the ISS. Any delays in Crew-10’s schedule could push Wilmore and Williams’ return into April 2025[2][4][5].
- The history of multiple delays and technical issues with both Starliner and scheduling logistics introduces uncertainty to the forecast.
- As of February 27, 2025, the official plan is for a return in late March 2025, but there is no absolute guarantee against further delays.

## Conclusion

Based on all available information as of February 27, 2025, Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams are scheduled to return to Earth before April 1, 2025, with the earliest feasible date being late March 2025. However, the possibility of additional delays means there is some risk their return could slip into early April. The most authoritative and recent sources indicate a late March return remains the official plan[2][4][5].
