## Confirmed Wins

As of January 24, 2025, Sabrina Carpenter has already won **Best Pop Vocal Album** for "Short n' Sweet"[2]. This confirms she has secured at least one Grammy award at the 2025 ceremony.

## Relevant Context for Forecasting

The 67th Grammy Awards ceremony is scheduled for February 2, 2025, at Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles[1]. The Recording Academy announced on January 24, 2025, that Sabrina Carpenter would be among the performers at the ceremony, alongside other nominees including Billie Eilish, Chappell Roan, and Shakira[2].

Billie Eilish, who has previously won nine Grammy Awards, is nominated for seven awards this year, making her a strong competitor in several categories where Carpenter is also nominated[2].

First-time nominee Chappell Roan received six nominations, including several in the same categories as Carpenter (Record of the Year, Album of the Year, Best Pop Vocal Album, Song of the Year, Best New Artist, and Best Pop Solo Performance)[2].

## Analysis for Forecasting

Based on the information available as of January 27, 2025:

1. Sabrina Carpenter has already secured one Grammy win (Best Pop Vocal Album)[2]
2. She still has five other personal nominations with results pending
3. She faces strong competition from established artists like Billie Eilish and fellow breakthrough artist Chappell Roan

For the multiple-choice forecast options ('0 or 1', '2', '3', 'Greater than 3'), we can confirm she will win at least 1 award, placing her minimally in the '0 or 1' category. However, with 5 additional nominations still pending results, there remains potential for her to reach the higher categories.

The 67th Grammy Awards ceremony on February 2, 2025, will determine the final outcome of her remaining nominations.
