- As of May 14, 2025, The New York Times Daily is ranked #4 and The Tucker Carlson Show is ranked #7 on the Spotify US Top Podcasts chart[2].
- The Daily has maintained a position in the top tier of news podcasts for years, with broad mainstream appeal and daily episodes produced by The New York Times[1][3][4].
- The Tucker Carlson Show is a popular show but typically serves a more niche, politically-oriented audience and has not overtaken The Daily in major mainstream podcast rankings over the past year[2][5].

## 2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Additional confirmation can be found via Apple Podcasts and Podchaser, which regularly track podcast performance[3][5].

## 4. Limitations or Uncertainties in Measurement

- The Spotify chart ranking algorithm is not public; it is influenced by listenership, engagement, and potentially other factors.
- Rapid changes in rankings can occur if a show goes viral or is affected by unexpected news, but such shifts are rare for top-10 podcasts absent major events.
- Measurement will be based strictly on the chart position as observed on or after June 28, 2025, per the resolution criteria.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the sustained higher ranking and broader appeal of The Daily, combined with the absence of disruptive events, it is more likely that The Daily will be ranked higher than The Tucker Carlson Show on June 28, 2025.

**Most Likely Outcome:**  
- The New York Times Daily will be ranked higher than The Tucker Carlson Show on the Spotify US Top Podcasts chart on June 28, 2025.
