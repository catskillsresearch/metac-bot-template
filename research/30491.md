To forecast whether exactly 4 US states will have Waymo's rider-only ride-hailing service available to the general public by December 31, 2024, I'll analyze the current status and announced expansion plans for Waymo's autonomous vehicle service.

## Current Operational Status

As of mid-2024, Waymo One (Waymo's fully autonomous ride-hailing service) is operational in the following locations:

- **Phoenix, Arizona**: Waymo's longest-running service area covers 315 square miles across the Valley of the Sun, with recent expansions adding 90 square miles in June 2024[1][3]. The service is available 24/7 to all members of the public.

- **San Francisco, California**: The service is fully available to the general public, allowing anyone to "download, request, and ride today in the City by the Bay and Daly City"[3].

- **Los Angeles, California**: Waymo One is available to all riders "from Santa Monica to Downtown"[3]. The service began accepting select members of the public in March 2024[4].

- **Austin, Texas**: Waymo has partnered with Uber to offer autonomous rides in Austin, available exclusively through the Uber app[3][5]. This integration allows riders who request UberX, Uber Green, Uber Comfort, or Uber Comfort Electric to potentially be matched with a Waymo vehicle for qualifying trips.

## Announced Expansion Plans

Waymo and Uber have announced plans to expand their partnership to additional cities:

- **Atlanta, Georgia**: According to an announcement from September 13, 2024, Waymo and Uber plan to bring autonomous ride-hailing to Atlanta "beginning in early 2025"[5]. This expansion will follow the same model as Austin, with service available only through the Uber app.

## Analysis for December 31, 2024 Forecast

Based on the available information, by December 31, 2024, Waymo's rider-only ride-hailing service that meets the criteria of being "available to the general public" will be operational in:

1. **Arizona** (Phoenix metropolitan area)
2. **California** (San Francisco and Los Angeles)
3. **Texas** (Austin, through Uber partnership)

The planned expansion to Atlanta, Georgia is explicitly scheduled for "early 2025"[5], which falls after the December 31, 2024 cutoff date for this forecast.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors could affect this forecast:

1. **Accelerated Timelines**: Waymo could potentially accelerate its expansion plans for Atlanta or announce and launch in a fourth state before the end of 2024.

2. **Regulatory Hurdles**: Autonomous vehicle deployments are subject to regulatory approval, which could delay planned expansions or accelerate them if approvals come earlier than expected.

3. **Definition Considerations**: The resolution criteria specify that the service must be "available to the general public" without waitlists or limited testing phases. While the current services in Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Austin appear to meet this criterion, any new deployments would need to satisfy this requirement to be counted.

## Conclusion

Based on the current operational status and announced expansion plans, as of the available information, Waymo's rider-only ride-hailing service will be available to the general public in exactly 3 US states (Arizona, California, and Texas) by December 31, 2024, not 4 states as the question asks. The expansion to Georgia is explicitly planned for early 2025, after the forecast date.
