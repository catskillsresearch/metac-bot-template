As of February 6, 2025, OpenAI has publicly released the o3-mini model on January 31, 2025, which is a smaller, cost-efficient variant of the o3 model with strong reasoning and coding capabilities available via ChatGPT and API. However, the full o3 model has not yet been publicly released via web interface. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman indicated in December 2024 that the full o3 would launch shortly after o3-mini, but no official release or public availability of the full o3 model has been confirmed or documented before March 28, 2025.

Thus, based on all factual information available before February 6, 2025, OpenAI has not publicly released the full o3 model before March 28, 2025. The only publicly accessible version is o3-mini, and the full o3 remains unreleased as of that date[1][2][4][5].

### Summary:
- o3-mini released January 31, 2025, publicly accessible.
- Full o3 model announced but not yet released publicly.
- No evidence or announcement of full o3 release before March 28, 2025.
