### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of November 18, 2024, Marco Rubio has been nominated for Secretary of State by President-elect Donald Trump but remains a sitting U.S. Senator. His resignation is expected to coincide with the new administration's start on January 20, 2025[1][3].
- Governor Ron DeSantis has the authority to appoint a temporary replacement for Rubio's Senate seat, who would serve until a special election in 2026[2][5].

### Recent Announcements and Policies

- DeSantis has stated publicly that he is still considering candidates and conducting preliminary vetting, with more extensive interviews planned in the coming weeks. He has indicated that a selection will "likely [be] made by the beginning of January" 2025[1][3][4].
- No official shortlist has been released, but several names are being discussed in the media and among political circles, including Lt. Gov. Jeanette Nu√±ez, Attorney General Ashley Moody, and DeSantis's chief of staff James Uthmeier[1][2][3][5].
- The appointment process is being closely watched, with some pressure from Trump allies to appoint Lara Trump, but DeSantis has not committed to any candidate or timeline earlier than January[3][5].

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- NBC Miami, NY1, and Politico all report that DeSantis's timeline for the appointment is "by the beginning of January," with no indication of an earlier decision[1][3][4].
- CBS News Miami and Axios provide background on the political implications and confirm that the process is ongoing, with no appointment made as of late November 2024[2][5].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- The exact date of Rubio's resignation is not confirmed but is expected to be around January 20, 2025, aligning with the new administration's start. DeSantis cannot officially appoint a replacement until the seat is vacant.
- While DeSantis has stated his intention to decide by early January, unforeseen political developments or changes in Rubio's resignation timeline could alter the schedule.
- There is always a possibility of a last-minute acceleration, but as of the latest available information, all public statements and reporting point to a decision timeline at or after the start of January 2025.

### Conclusion

Based on all available factual information as of November 25, 2024, Governor Ron DeSantis is unlikely to name Marco Rubio's Senate replacement before January 1, 2025. All credible reports and DeSantis's own statements indicate the selection will occur "by the beginning of January," with vetting and interviews ongoing through late November and December[1][3][4].
