# Will US offer India a nuclear submarine before Sept 30, 2024?

Based on available information as of July 2024, there is no evidence indicating that the United States has made or will make a formal offer to India regarding nuclear submarines before September 30, 2024.

## Current Status of India's Nuclear Submarine Program

India has established a clear commitment to developing its indigenous nuclear submarine capabilities:

- The INS Arihant, India's first indigenous nuclear submarine, was commissioned in August 2016[1]
- India has planned a total of four Arihant-class ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs)[1]
- The second submarine of the class, INS Arighat, was scheduled to be commissioned by the end of 2023[1]
- The third submarine is scheduled for completion around 2024[1]
- After completing the four Arihant-class submarines, India plans to shift to a new design referred to as the Arihant Follow-On, or S5 class[1]

India has previously leased nuclear submarines from Russia, specifically a Project 971 Akula class nuclear-powered submarine, and there have been negotiations for leasing a second submarine of this type[1].

## Recent Submarine Acquisition Developments

Rather than pursuing nuclear submarines from the United States, India appears to be focused on:

1. **Indigenous nuclear submarine development**: Continuing with its Arihant-class program and planning for future designs[1]

2. **Conventional submarine acquisition**: India is currently evaluating proposals for Project-75I, which involves acquiring six conventional submarines:
   - Germany and Spain are the final contenders for this deal, estimated to be worth over $5 billion[5]
   - Thyssenkrupp Marine Systems (TKMS) of Germany has partnered with Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Limited (MDL)[5]
   - Navantia, Spain's state-owned firm, has partnered with Larsen & Toubro (L&T)[5]
   - Germany has proposed a government-to-government deal to sell six submarines to India[5]
   - The project was re-approved in January 2019 at a cost of over â‚¹40,000 crore (US$5.8 billion in 2023)[2]

3. **Defense cooperation with the US**: While India and the US have established the India-US Defence Accelerator Ecosystem (INDUS-X)[3], there is no indication of nuclear submarine technology transfer or sales being part of this cooperation.

## Analysis and Forecast

Several factors make a US offer of nuclear submarines to India before September 30, 2024, unlikely:

1. **Historical precedent**: The US has traditionally been reluctant to share nuclear propulsion technology, as noted in the query background information.

2. **Current acquisition focus**: India is actively pursuing deals with European manufacturers for conventional submarines, with Germany and Spain as the final contenders[5].

3. **Indigenous development**: India has invested significantly in developing its own nuclear submarine capabilities with the Arihant class[1].

4. **Timeframe constraints**: With less than three months remaining until the September 30, 2024 deadline, and no public indications of negotiations in this direction, a formal agreement seems improbable.

5. **Geopolitical considerations**: While the US made an exception for Australia with the AUKUS agreement, there is no evidence of similar considerations for India.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- The search results do not provide comprehensive information about all aspects of US-India defense negotiations
- Classified discussions between the US and India might not be reflected in public sources
- Rapid geopolitical developments could potentially change the situation, though the short timeframe makes this unlikely

Based on all available evidence, it appears highly unlikely that the US will offer India a nuclear submarine before September 30, 2024.
