# Will Geico, State Farm, or Progressive Run an Ad at the Super Bowl in 2025?

Based on the information available as of February 6, 2025, it appears that none of the three major insurance companies—Geico, State Farm, or Progressive—will run television commercials during Super Bowl LIX on February 9, 2025.

## Current Status and Recent Announcements

State Farm has explicitly announced the cancellation of its planned Super Bowl advertisement. In January 2025, the company stated it would not run a Super Bowl ad as it focused on supporting policyholders impacted by Southern California wildfires[1][2]. This decision represents a significant shift for the company, which has maintained a strong advertising presence in previous years.

Industry reporting indicates that viewers "won't see ads with Jake from State Farm, Flo from Progressive, or the GEICO Gecko during the game"[1]. This absence is part of a broader trend of declining advertising expenditure among major insurance companies in the United States.

## Historical Trends in Insurance Advertising

The decision by these insurance giants to skip Super Bowl LIX commercials aligns with recent trends in the industry's advertising strategies:

- GEICO reduced its advertising budget by 35% in 2023
- Allstate decreased ad spending by 30% in 2023
- Progressive cut its advertising expenses by 29% in 2023
- State Farm reduced ad spending by 2% in 2023[1]

This pattern of reduced advertising investment suggests a strategic shift across the property and casualty insurance sector, with companies potentially reallocating resources to other priorities.

## Broader Super Bowl Advertising Context

The insurance companies aren't alone in their decision to skip Super Bowl LIX. Multiple automakers have also opted out of advertising during the 2025 game, including Kia, BMW, Volkswagen, Toyota, General Motors, Audi, Ford, Honda, Hyundai, Mercedes, and Lexus[1]. This suggests broader economic or strategic factors may be influencing advertising decisions across multiple industries.

## Potential Caveats and Uncertainties

While direct game-time commercials appear unlikely, it's worth noting that insurance companies may still maintain visibility around the Super Bowl through other means. As Sportico notes, "When factoring in the numerous title/presenting sponsorships (pregame shows, halftime promotions, etc.) along with paid airtime, overall sports investment in the insurance category remains largely unchanged"[1]. State Farm, for example, has multi-year agreements with NFL vendors that continue regardless of game-specific advertising decisions.

Additionally, while a Progressive Super Bowl 2025 TV spot titled "Dr. Rick: Firepit" has been produced[5], the available information doesn't confirm whether this advertisement will air during the actual game broadcast or is intended for pre/post-game programming or other Super Bowl-adjacent content.

## Conclusion

Based on the available information as of February 6, 2025, it appears highly likely that Geico, State Farm, and Progressive will not run television commercials during the official broadcast of Super Bowl LIX on February 9, 2025. State Farm has explicitly announced its withdrawal, while industry reporting strongly suggests that neither Geico nor Progressive will participate with in-game advertisements.
