## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The Warren Buffett Indicator (Wilshire 5000 to GDP Ratio) measures the total US stock market value relative to US GDP.
- As of December 31, 2024, the indicator was at 211%[2].
- By early March 2025, the ratio had dropped significantly to 154.6%[3].
- The Wilshire 5000’s market value was reported at 1.89x GDP as of August 2024, near historical highs[5].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- No major policy changes or economic shocks between December 2024 and March 2025 are reported in the available sources that would significantly alter the ratio.
- The drop from 211% to 154.6% suggests a substantial market correction or GDP revision in early 2025, but no specific events are cited in the search results.

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The [Longtermtrends website](https://www.longtermtrends.net/market-cap-to-gdp-the-buffett-indicator/) is the reference for the official value on March 28, 2025, as per the question’s resolution criteria.
- Other reputable sources include Advisor Perspectives, Current Market Valuation, and GuruFocus, all of which track and update the Buffett Indicator regularly[1][2][3].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- The Buffett Indicator can change daily with stock market fluctuations, but GDP is updated quarterly, so the ratio may not reflect real-time economic changes.
- The precise value on March 28, 2025, will depend on market performance in the days immediately prior.
- The indicator is a broad valuation metric and does not account for changes in the composition of the Wilshire 5000 or adjustments to GDP calculations.

## Forecast

Based on the most recent available data (154.6% as of March 2025)[3], and absent evidence of major intervening events, the Warren Buffett Indicator on March 28, 2025, is likely to be in the range of 150% to 160%. The exact figure will be published on the Longtermtrends website and may vary slightly depending on market movements up to that date.
