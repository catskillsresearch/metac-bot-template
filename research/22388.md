## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of May 2025, **no country worldwide has implemented a full national universal basic income (UBI) system** that meets the criteria specified (universal, unconditional, regular cash payments of at least $1,000/month to adults) in the US, UK, China, or any EU country[2][4].
- Some countries, notably **Mongolia and Iran**, have implemented partial UBI programs in the past, but these did not persist as universal, unconditional, and national in scope[4].
- Numerous **UBI pilot programs** have been conducted globally, including in England (UK), Germany, Finland, and several US cities. However, these pilots are often limited in scale, duration, and geography, and none have resulted in national adoption[5].

## 2. Recent Announcements and Policies

- In **England**, a small-scale UBI experiment launched in June 2023 provides 30 residents with about $2,013 per month for two years, but this is not government-sponsored and does not represent national policy[5].
- In the **US**, several legislative proposals for UBI or related programs have been introduced in Congress over the past decades (e.g., Economic Security Act of 1974, Basic Income Guarantee Act of 2006, Emergency Money for the People Act in 2020), but none have passed into law[3]. The most recent proposals have not advanced beyond committee or pilot discussion stages.
- **Political candidates** in the US, such as Marianne Williamson, have proposed UBI schemes, but these are campaign platforms, not enacted policy[1].
- In the **EU**, there is ongoing debate, and scattered pilots, but no country is close to national enactment. The same is true for **China**, where the policy debate is even less active.

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Wikipedia and academic sources confirm that **a full UBI does not exist in any target country as of 2025**[2][4].
- Recent reporting and think-tank analysis note that while **pilot programs are ongoing**, they are not indicative of imminent national adoption[5].
- Legislative records in the US and EU show **no active legislation nearing passage for national UBI**[3].

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- **Public perception** of UBI is evolving, especially in response to concerns about AI and automation, but there is no clear path from experimental pilots to national policy in any of the specified countries.
- **Economic feasibility** and political polarization remain major barriers. Even with rising debate about automation and job loss, the legislative and fiscal commitment required for a national UBI is substantial and controversial[3].
- There is always the possibility of a **political shock or crisis** (e.g., a major recession or technological disruption) that could accelerate UBI adoption, but there is no concrete evidence of such a shift as of mid-2025.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

- Given current trends, **the probability that the US, UK, China, or any EU country will enact a national UBI by 2030 is low**. The lack of significant legislative momentum, the results of pilot programs not translating into policy, and persistent economic and political challenges suggest that **enactment before 2030 remains unlikely**.
- An estimated probability (based on current evidence and expert consensus in the field): **Less than 10%** chance that any of the specified countries will enact a national UBI meeting the described criteria by 2030.
