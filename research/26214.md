## Key Factual Information Relevant to Forecasting H5N1 Spread in Dairy Herds

**Historical Trends and Current Status**
- The H5N1 outbreak in U.S. dairy cows was first confirmed on March 25, 2024, in Texas[3][4].
- By June 4, 2024, more than 80 dairy farms in nine states had confirmed infections[1].
- By June 13, 2024, Michigan alone reported at least 94 affected herds, indicating the national total likely exceeded 100 herds by mid-June[5].
- The number of affected herds increased rapidly: from 16 herds in six states in early April to over 80 herds in nine states by early June[1][2].
- The CDC and USDA continue to report new cases, and the outbreak has not shown signs of abating as of July 2024[1][5].

**Recent Announcements and Policies**
- USDA and CDC have identified shared equipment, personnel, and animal movements as key risk factors for ongoing spread[5].
- Enhanced biosecurity measures have been recommended, but no major policy interventions have been reported that would be expected to halt the spread entirely as of July 2024[5].
- The CDC and USDA are the primary authorities for outbreak tracking, with confirmed case counts as the standard metric[1][5].

**Authoritative Sources for Verification**
- CDC's "Current H5N1 Bird Flu Situation in Dairy Cows" page is the primary reference for herd counts and outbreak status[1].
- USDA APHIS provides detailed epidemiological reports and herd-level data[3][5].

**Limitations and Uncertainties**
- There may be delays in detection, confirmation, and reporting of new cases, leading to underestimation of the true number of affected herds at any given time[5].
- The rate of spread could change due to unforeseen interventions, changes in farm practices, or natural dynamics of the outbreak.
- The methodology for counting herds is based on confirmed cases, which may lag behind actual infections[1][5].

## Summary Table: Key Data Points

| Date         | Confirmed Herds (US) | States Affected |
|--------------|----------------------|-----------------|
| Early April  | 16                   | 6               |
| May 15, 2024 | 46                   | 9               |
| June 4, 2024 | >80                  | 9               |
| June 13, 2024| ≥94 (Michigan only)  | Multiple        |

Given the rapid increase in affected herds and ongoing risk factors, it is plausible—based on data available as of July 17, 2024—that the number of H5N1-affected dairy herds could reach between 200 and 300 by September 30, 2024, unless there is a significant change in outbreak dynamics or reporting.
