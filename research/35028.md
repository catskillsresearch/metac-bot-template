## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The UBS Global Wealth Report 2024 documents a return to global wealth growth, with a 4.2% increase offsetting the losses recorded in 2022. EMEA and APAC regions lead in wealth per adult, with EMEA averaging just over $166,000 and APAC over $155,000[1][2].
- CEOWORLD magazine reports the global average wealth per adult at $95,384 in 2024, an increase from previous years, and a median wealth per adult of $252,879, highlighting the persistent gap due to wealth inequality[5].
- After a slump in 2022, global economic conditions stabilized and improved through 2023 and 2024, with no major crises reported that would negatively impact overall wealth.

## 2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- There are no major reported global financial crises or disruptive policy changes in 2024 that would significantly reduce wealth per adult worldwide.
- The resumption of global GDP growth and stabilization in financial markets contributed positively to both average and, likely, median wealth metrics during this period[2].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- UBS Global Wealth Report 2024[1][2][4]
- CEOWORLD magazine report on average and median wealth per person[5]
- World Inequality Database (WID) is the reference source for resolution, though its specific 2024 data is not yet cited in these summaries.

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- The question relies on WID's reporting of *median* wealth per adult, but most available data references *average* wealth. The two metrics can diverge if wealth inequality changes.
- Without WID's final 2024 release, direct confirmation is unavailable; current assessment is based on global trends and proxy data from other reputable sources.
- If WID does not publish 2024 data by the resolution date, the forecast will be void per question rules.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the broad-based increase in global wealth, the return to economic growth, and the lack of major negative shocks in 2024, it is highly probable that the World Inequality Database will report an increase in median national wealth at market value per adult for 2024 compared to 2023.

> **Probabilistic assessment:** There is a high likelihood (approximately 80-90%) that global median wealth per adult increased in 2024 over 2023, as inferred from reputable global wealth reports and macroeconomic indicators[2][5].
