## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- MEPs may resign or have their mandate terminated for reasons including criminal conviction, disciplinary proceedings, or loss of eligibility. Parliamentary immunity can slow or block criminal proceedings, but is not absolute and can be waived[1][2].
- Historically, major scandals—like those involving lobbying or corruption—have sometimes resulted in MEP resignations, though the process can be delayed by the need to waive immunity and complete investigations.
- The current Parliament began its term in July 2024, with no recent mass resignations documented up to June 5, 2025[3][5].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- A recent lobbying scandal involving Huawei emerged in May 2025. While such scandals have previously resulted in resignations, as of June 5, there is no public record of any MEP having resigned over this issue.
- The May 2025 Europarliament minutes indicate that requests to waive immunity for certain MEPs are ongoing, but do not report any recent resignations[5].
- Committee and group changes are occurring, but these do not equate to resignations—they are routine parliamentary adjustments[5].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Official Parliament minutes and records (e.g., Europarliament's official website) provide definitive documentation of resignations, waivers of immunity, and disciplinary proceedings[1][2][5].
- Wikipedia's list of current MEPs is regularly updated to reflect changes in membership[3].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- Parliamentary immunity can delay or prevent resignations even in the face of scandal or investigation, with procedures varying widely by member state[1][2].
- Investigations into the Huawei lobbying scandal are ongoing; resignations could be announced at any time, but none are confirmed as of June 5, 2025.
- Media coverage may precede official records, but for resolution purposes, only formal announcements or resignations count.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given:
- The heightened risk due to the ongoing Huawei lobbying scandal,
- Historical precedent for resignations in such contexts,
- Active legal proceedings regarding MEP immunity,
- No confirmed resignations as of June 5, 2025, but a plausible window for developments before July 1, especially if investigations progress rapidly,

**There is a moderate probability (estimated 40–60%) that at least one MEP will announce their resignation between June 9 and July 1, 2025. The probability is elevated relative to a typical period due to the scandal, but procedural delays and immunity protections temper the likelihood of immediate resignations within this window.**
