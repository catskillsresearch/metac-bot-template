## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- US-Denmark trade relations have generally been stable, with Denmark exporting a variety of goods to the US, including pharmaceuticals, machinery, and medical devices[1].
- President Trump has publicly threatened tariffs on Denmark, especially in connection with disputes over Greenland, but these threats have not translated into official policy or implemented tariffs as of early 2025[1][3].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- On January 24, 2025, President Trump issued Executive Order 14245, which allows for the imposition of a 25% tariff on all goods imported into the US, effective April 2, 2025, or later. There is no explicit mention of Denmark in the available summaries, and the effective date is after April 1, 2025[2].
- Recent US tariff actions in February 2025 have targeted Canada, Mexico, and China, but Denmark is not included among the affected countries[4].
- While Denmark has been mentioned in the context of possible future tariffs, particularly related to Greenland, there is no record of an official US government announcement or implementation of new tariffs on Denmark as of February 13, 2025[1][3].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The Peterson Institute for International Economics and Politico both report on the threats and context but confirm no implemented tariffs on Denmark as of the latest updates[1][3].
- PwC and legal trackers confirm recent tariff actions but do not list Denmark among the countries affected by new tariffs in early 2025[4][2].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- The US administration has broad authority to impose tariffs with little notice, and threats have been made. However, under the resolution criteria, only officially announced and implemented tariffs count.
- The situation could change rapidly, but as of February 13, 2025, there is no evidence of any new US tariffs on Denmark before April 1, 2025.

## Conclusion

Based on all available information as of February 13, 2025, there is no factual basis to forecast that the United States will impose any new tariffs on Denmark before April 1, 2025. No official announcements or implementations have been made targeting Denmark within the relevant timeframe[1][2][3][4].
