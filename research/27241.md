### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Keir Starmer's approval rating saw a modest "honeymoon" bump immediately after Labour's landslide victory in July 2024, but this was short-lived. By early August, his favourability had dropped back to pre-election levels, with only 40% of Britons viewing him favourably and 49% unfavourably[1][2].
- Ipsos polling in mid-July 2024 found that 36% of Britons thought Starmer was doing a good job as Prime Minister, the highest such rating since early 2021, but still far below the 60% threshold[5].
- No major poll has recorded Starmer's approval rating approaching or exceeding 60% since he became Prime Minister.

### Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- Starmer's government has promised "national renewal" and a return to public service, but the low popular vote share and record-low turnout in the 2024 election indicate a fragmented and dissatisfied electorate, limiting the potential for high approval ratings[1][2].
- The emergence of Reform UK and other opposition parties has further complicated the political landscape, likely constraining Starmer's ability to achieve broad-based approval[1][2].

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The Politico Poll of Polls aggregates approval ratings from major UK polling organizations and is the reference source for this forecast.
- YouGov and Ipsos are leading pollsters whose recent data show Starmer's approval well below 60%[1][2][5].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- Polling data can fluctuate due to unforeseen events, policy announcements, or shifts in public sentiment.
- Differences in polling methodology and question wording can affect reported approval ratings.
- The "Smooth" version of the Politico Poll of Polls should be used for resolution, as specified.

### Conclusion

Based on all available data as of August 16, 2024, it is highly likely that Keir Starmer's approval rating as Prime Minister will be less than 60 on September 18, 2024, according to the Politico Poll of Polls[1][2][5].
