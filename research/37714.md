## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of June 23, 2025, US wildfires have burned approximately 1.64 million acres in 33,013 fires—very close to the 10-year average acreage for this date, but with a higher-than-average number of fires[5][1].
- In California, January 2025 was especially destructive, with over 76,000 acres burned and several record-setting fires, including the Palisades, Eaton, and Hughes fires[3].
- Compared to recent years:
  - 2025 acreage is **lower than 2022** (3.36 million acres by late June) but **higher than 2023** (643,708 acres by late June)[5].
  - The number of wildfires is significantly elevated, yet the average fire size is lower than in some previous years, suggesting effective suppression or less conducive conditions for large fire growth so far in 2025[1][5].
- The National Interagency Fire Center's June outlook notes that May precipitation was above normal in much of the South and East but below normal in parts of the West and Northwest, with drought persisting in key areas[1].

## Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- No major new national policies or fire management changes for 2025 have been identified in the cited sources.
- Wildfire preparedness and response efforts remain consistent with previous years, with the National Preparedness Level having increased to Level 2 on May 14, 2025, in response to rising fire activity in the Southwest and East[1].
- Some regional efforts to improve mitigation and response remain ongoing, but no game-changing policy shifts have been reported as of June 2025.

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC) provides the official statistics for wildfire acreage and fire count[5].
- NIFC's monthly and seasonal outlooks summarize risk factors and forecasted fire potential[1].
- The Center for Disaster Philanthropy and NOAA/NCEI supplement with regional and climate-related reporting[3][2].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- Most wildfire acreage in the US typically burns during July and August, making late-summer weather a critical variable.
- Drought, heatwaves, and wind events could cause rapid escalation in burned acreage, while wetter conditions could suppress fire growth.
- Reporting lags and post-August fire reconciliation may slightly adjust totals.
- The relatively high number of fires but average acreage so far in 2025 introduces uncertainty: if larger fires break out later in the season, totals could exceed the 10-year average.

## Probabilistic Assessment for January–August 2025

- Considering the current pace (1.64 million acres burned by June 23), the 10-year average, and fire potential outlooks, and assuming a typical seasonal distribution:
  - **Median estimate:** 3.5–4.2 million acres burned by end of August 2025.
  - **80% confidence interval:** 2.8–5.5 million acres, with lower values if suppression remains effective and weather is mild, and upper values if late summer brings major fire outbreaks[1][5][4].
  - Years with comparable early-season patterns (e.g., 2021, 2023) ended August with 2.5–4 million acres burned, while severe years (e.g., 2022) were well above 5 million by August[5].
- The forecast should be updated in July as new data and weather trends emerge.
