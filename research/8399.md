## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of October 2021, nine states possess nuclear weapons: Russia, United States, China, France, United Kingdom, Pakistan, India, Israel, and North Korea[3].
- The last new state to acquire nuclear weapons was North Korea in 2006[3].
- The number of nuclear-armed states has remained stable since then, with some states (e.g., South Africa, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Ukraine) having previously disarmed[3].
- Several states, notably Iran and Japan, have significant nuclear breakout capabilities but have not developed or deployed nuclear weapons[3].

## Recent Developments Affecting the Forecast

- China is rapidly expanding its nuclear arsenal, potentially reaching 1,500 warheads by 2035, but this does not change the number of nuclear-armed states[2][5].
- Strategic instability and multipolarity are increasing, with concerns about deterrence and nuclear use, especially regarding Russia and North Korea[1][4].
- The nuclear taboo and global nonproliferation regime remain robust, and there is no authoritative evidence that additional states are on the brink of nuclear weaponization as of 2025[4][5].
- No major policy shifts or technological breakthroughs have been reported that would make it significantly easier for additional states to acquire nuclear weapons[4][5].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Federation of American Scientists for nuclear inventories and status[2].
- Atlantic Council and Perry World House for strategic trends and nuclear stability analysis[1][4][5].
- Metaculus for historical data and public expert consensus on proliferation[3].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- Breakout capability remains a latent risk, particularly for states like Iran, but current diplomacy and monitoring have been effective.
- Geopolitical crises or regime changes could trigger rapid proliferation, though there is no current evidence of such risk materializing[4][5].
- Verification depends on credible reporting and may lag behind clandestine developments.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the stability in the number of nuclear-armed states since 2006, the continued strength of the nonproliferation regime, and the lack of evidence for imminent new entrants as of 2025, the probability that 10 or more states will possess deployable nuclear weapons before 2035 appears low. While rising great power competition and regional tensions elevate general risk levels, no concrete indicators suggest a significant break from historical trends.

**Estimated probability: 10â€“20% that there will be 10 or more nuclear-armed states at any time before 2035, barring an unforeseen geopolitical crisis.**
