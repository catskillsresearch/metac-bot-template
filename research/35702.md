## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The filibuster has been a core Senate procedure for over a century, with the 60-vote cloture threshold for legislation in place since 1975. The "nuclear option" was invoked in 2013 (for executive and lower-court judicial nominations) and in 2017 (for Supreme Court nominees), allowing those to proceed with a simple majority[4].
- As of 2025, the legislative filibuster remains intact; a three-fifths majority (60 votes) is still required for cloture on most legislative matters[1][4].

## 2. Recent Announcements and Policy Shifts

- In May 2025, credible reports from the Senate indicate that Republicans are planning to overrule the Parliamentarian to bypass the 60-vote threshold on legislation involving California's clean air waivers—potentially triggering the "nuclear option" and ending the filibuster for that category (or more broadly)[2][3].
- Senate Democrats have confirmed on the record that such a move would constitute the elimination of the legislative filibuster, warning that it would "break the Senate" and set a wide-reaching precedent[3].
- No successful cloture motion with fewer than 60 votes on ordinary legislation has yet occurred in the 119th Congress[1].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Official Senate cloture records confirm no rules change as of late May 2025[1].
- News outlets and Senate press releases document the current Republican plans and Democratic responses[2][3].
- Senate history and rules are detailed in nonpartisan references[4].

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- It is uncertain whether Republicans will limit the "nuclear" move to a single issue or if the precedent will rapidly expand to other legislative matters.
- Some GOP senators may resist breaking the filibuster, particularly given the party's recent benefit from it when in the minority.
- Election outcomes before 2029 could shift Senate control, influencing the incentives and likelihood of further rule changes.
- The question resolves only if cloture is actually invoked under the new, lower threshold, not merely if the rules are changed or threatened.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given:
- Active Republican planning to overrule the Parliamentarian and "go nuclear" on a legislative matter[2][3].
- Recent historical precedent of the nuclear option being used and then expanded[4].
- Deep partisan polarization and incentives for the majority party to secure legislative wins.
- The filibuster's demonstrated value to both parties, likely prompting some resistance.

**It is now significantly more likely than at any time since 2017 that the Senate will weaken the legislative filibuster before January 3, 2029.**  
A **partial weakening** (e.g., for specific policy areas) appears plausible in the next 1–2 years, with an estimated probability in the range of **40–55%** that some such weakening occurs and is actually used to invoke cloture with fewer than 60 votes on a legislative matter before 2029.  
The probability of **complete elimination** remains lower (perhaps 20–30%), but future escalation is possible if a precedent is set.
