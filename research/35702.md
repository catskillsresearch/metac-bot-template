# Will the NFL Ban the "Tush-Push" Before April 1, 2025?

As of early March 2025, the NFL is actively considering a proposal to ban the controversial "Tush Push" play. This analysis examines the current status of this proposal and factors that may influence whether it will be implemented before April 1, 2025.

## Current Status of the Proposal

In February 2025, the Green Bay Packers formally submitted a proposal to ban the "Tush Push" quarterback sneak play that has been popularized by the Philadelphia Eagles[1][5]. This proposal was confirmed by Troy Vincent, the NFL's executive vice president of football operations, on February 24, 2025[2]. The proposal specifically aims to prohibit the practice of teammates pushing the quarterback forward in short-yardage situations.

NFL owners could vote on this proposal at the upcoming spring owners' meeting in Palm Beach, Florida, which is expected to take place in March 2025[2]. For the proposal to pass and become an official rule change, it would require approval from at least 24 of the NFL's 32 team owners[2].

## Historical Context and Previous Considerations

The "Tush Push" play has been a topic of debate in previous NFL offseasons:

- The play has been examined by the NFL and the competition committee in past years, but no ban has been implemented[2]
- Last offseason, instead of banning the play outright, the NFL created a rule requiring "pushers" to start at least 1 yard behind the quarterback[5]
- The Eagles have perfected this play over several seasons, making it a significant part of their offensive strategy[3]

## Arguments For and Against the Ban

**Arguments supporting the ban:**

- Packers president Mark Murphy has publicly criticized the play, stating: "There is no skill involved and it is almost an automatic first down on plays of a yard or less"[5]
- Murphy further argued that "The play is bad for the game, and we should go back to prohibiting the push of the runner"[5]
- Some teams may view the play as providing an unfair advantage to teams that have mastered it

**Arguments against the ban:**

- Eagles head coach Nick Sirianni has defended the play, particularly challenging the injury concern: "I think that's a little made up, to be honest. Now, the numbers will tell the truth, but I don't think there (were) many injuries with it this year"[3]
- The Eagles and Buffalo Bills have combined to run 163 "tush pushes" in the last three seasonsâ€”more than the rest of the NFL combined[2]
- It would be unprecedented for the NFL to ban a play simply because one team executes it better than others[3]

## Likelihood of Ban Implementation Before April 1, 2025

The timeline for this decision is tight but feasible:

1. The proposal has been formally submitted as of February 24, 2025[1][2]
2. The spring owners' meeting in Palm Beach is scheduled for March 2025[2]
3. If the proposal is voted on at this meeting and receives the required 24 votes, it could be implemented before April 1, 2025

However, several factors create uncertainty:

- The Packers could potentially withdraw their proposal before it goes to a vote[2]
- There is no clear indication of how the majority of NFL owners view this proposal
- The NFL has previously examined this play without taking action to ban it[2]
- As noted by Sirianni, it would be a "slippery slope" for the NFL to ban a play simply because one team excels at it[3]

## Conclusion

While a formal proposal to ban the "Tush Push" has been submitted by the Green Bay Packers and will likely be considered at the March 2025 owners' meeting, there remains significant uncertainty about whether it will receive the necessary 24 votes for approval. The Eagles' success with the play and the lack of clear injury data may work against the ban, while concerns about competitive balance and game aesthetics could support it. The decision will likely come down to the owners' vote in March, making it possible but not certain that a ban could be implemented before April 1, 2025.
