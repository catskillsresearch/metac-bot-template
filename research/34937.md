# Will the Gulf of Mexico be Renamed to Gulf of America on the National Map by March 1, 2025?

Based on available information as of February 9, 2025, there are strong indications that the body of water currently labeled as the "Gulf of Mexico" on the National Map will be renamed to the "Gulf of America" before March 1, 2025.

## Executive Order and Timeline

On January 20, 2025, President Donald Trump signed Executive Order 14172, titled "Restoring Names That Honor American Greatness," which explicitly directs the Secretary of the Interior to rename the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America[1]. The executive order specifies that this change should occur "within 30 days of the date of this order," which would place the deadline on February 19, 2025[1].

The order specifically instructs the Secretary to:

1. "Take all appropriate actions to rename as the 'Gulf of America' the U.S. Continental Shelf area bounded on the northeast, north, and northwest by the States of Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida and extending to the seaward boundary with Mexico and Cuba"[1]

2. "Update the GNIS to reflect the renaming of the Gulf and remove all references to the Gulf of Mexico from the GNIS, consistent with applicable law"[1]

The Geographic Names Information System (GNIS) is the federal database that provides the foundation for the National Map, meaning this directive would directly affect how the body of water is labeled on the National Map.

## Implementation Progress

There are clear signs that the administration is actively implementing this name change:

- On February 9, 2025, President Trump issued a proclamation recognizing that date as the first "Gulf of America Day"[2]
- In this proclamation, Trump stated he was "making my first visit to the Gulf of America since its renaming"[2]
- The proclamation references Executive Order 14172 and reiterates the rationale for the name change, stating that "the area formerly known as the Gulf of Mexico has long been an integral asset to our once burgeoning Nation"[2]

## Jurisdictional Considerations

It's important to note that while the U.S. federal government has moved to rename this body of water, this authority is limited to U.S. federal usage. According to the Associated Press on January 23, 2025:

- "Trump's order only carries authority within the United States"[4]
- "Mexico, as well as other countries and international bodies, do not have to recognize the name change"[4]
- The AP itself stated it "will refer to it by its original name while acknowledging the new name Trump has chosen"[4]

## Forecast Analysis

Given the explicit timeline in the executive order (30 days from January 20, 2025, which is February 19, 2025) and the evidence of active implementation (as demonstrated by the February 9 proclamation), there is a high likelihood that the National Map will display "Gulf of America" before March 1, 2025.

The executive order specifically directs the Secretary of the Interior to update the GNIS and "ensure all federal references to the Gulf of America, including on agency maps, contracts, and other documents and communications shall reflect its renaming"[1]. The National Map, being a federal resource maintained by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), would fall under this directive.

While there may be international disagreement about the name change, with Mexico and other nations likely continuing to use "Gulf of Mexico," the question specifically asks about the National Map, which is under U.S. federal jurisdiction and subject to the executive order's requirements.
