## 1. Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of December 7, 2022, there were 8 toilets in space, distributed across the ISS, Chinese station modules, and crewed spacecraft visiting the stations[1].
- By 2025, the number has increased to 10, reflecting both the expansion of the Chinese space station (Tiangong) and continued traffic of crewed spacecraft like Crew Dragon and Soyuz[3].
- The trend is upward as more countries and companies launch and maintain longer-duration or more frequent crewed missions.

## 2. Key Differences and Developments Affecting the Forecast

**Station Expansion and New Infrastructure**
- The International Space Station (ISS) is expected to remain operational until at least 2030, though with some uncertainty about its exact retirement date.
- China's Tiangong station may expand further, potentially adding additional modules and toilets.
- Private space stations (e.g., Axiom, Starlab, Orbital Reef) are projected to become operational before or around 2030, each likely requiring at least one toilet.
- Increased commercial and international crewed spacecraft traffic (SpaceX, Boeing Starliner, potentially other national vehicles) will increase the number of short-duration toilets "in space" at any given time.

**Technological and Policy Changes**
- NASA has developed new, more compact space toilets suitable for Artemis and commercial spaceflight, indicating continued investment and likely proliferation of such hardware[4].
- The design of next-generation spacecraft and stations includes considerations for mixed-gender crews and longer missions, increasing the likelihood of more toilets per module[4].

## 3. Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

- The median community forecast as of late 2022 was around 12.6 toilets, with a reasonable range (8.7 to 18.3)[1].
- Since 2022, the number has already increased to 10, supporting the trend toward modest growth[3].
- By 2030, the continuation of current stations, addition of new commercial stations, and higher traffic of crewed vehicles make it likely the number will be at least 12–15, possibly higher if multiple private stations and regular crewed launches are operational.

**Most Likely Range:**  
- 12 to 18 toilets in space at 5:00 PM UTC, January 1, 2030.

- Who Is In Space is specified as the primary reference, with Metaculus and Wikipedia as secondary information sources[1][2][3].

## 5. Limitations and Uncertainties

- The count is sensitive to the timing of crewed vehicle dockings or departures; the number may fluctuate day to day.
- Delays or failures in commercial station projects could result in a lower-than-expected count.
- The retirement or loss of current stations (e.g., ISS deorbiting before 2030) could decrease the number.
- New, unanticipated developments (e.g., additional national stations, lunar bases with orbiting support vehicles) could push the count higher.
