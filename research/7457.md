## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Since 1945, there have been only two offensive nuclear detonations: Hiroshima and Nagasaki, both in 1945. No offensive use has occurred since then, despite numerous international crises.
- As of early 2025, nine countries possess approximately 12,331 nuclear warheads, with the US and Russia accounting for 88% of the global total[1].
- The total global inventory is slowly declining, primarily due to dismantlement of retired US and Russian warheads. However, operational stockpiles are now increasing, particularly in China, India, Pakistan, North Korea, and the UK[1].
- Nuclear doctrine among all current nuclear states continues to emphasize deterrence, not offensive use.

## 2. Recent Announcements and Policies

- The US and Russia are focused on modernizing their arsenals rather than significant expansion[2][3][4].
- China, India, North Korea, Pakistan, and the UK are assessed to be increasing their stockpiles modestly[1].
- There is no credible public evidence of policies or military doctrines in any nuclear state that lower the threshold for first (offensive) use.
- The risk of accidental or unauthorized use persists but is mitigated by robust command and control and crisis communication mechanisms[5].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Federation of American Scientists: Regularly updated global nuclear stockpile data[1]
- Congressional Budget Office: US nuclear force projections[2]
- Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists: Nuclear Notebook series for warhead estimates[3]
- Arms Control Association: Policy analysis and updates[4]

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- Forecasting relies on the assumption that past restraint continues, but the risk of regional nuclear conflict (e.g., India-Pakistan, Korean Peninsula) cannot be ruled out.
- "Black swan" events such as major geopolitical upheaval, system failures, or unforeseen crisis escalation could alter the outlook unexpectedly.
- Verification of offensive use, as opposed to test or peaceful explosion, depends on government declarations and independent media or international reporting, which may be ambiguous in a crisis.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

- The most likely outcome by 2050 is zero offensive nuclear detonations, given the 75-year trend and strong deterrence framework.
- There is a low but nonzero probability (estimated <10%) of one or a small number of offensive detonations, most plausibly in the context of a regional conflict or catastrophic escalation.
- A reasonable forecast is a median of <1 offensive detonations, with a 90% credible interval of 0â€“3.
