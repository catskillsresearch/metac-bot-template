# Yield Curve Inversion Status Forecast for December 27, 2024

The yield curve, specifically the spread between 10-Year and 2-Year Treasury yields, is a closely watched economic indicator. As of November 20, 2024, this spread stood at 0.10, indicating a non-inverted (positive) yield curve. To forecast whether it will remain non-inverted by December 27, 2024, we need to examine recent trends and expert projections.

## Current Status and Recent History

After experiencing the longest yield curve inversion in U.S. history—lasting 783 consecutive days—the curve finally uninverted in September 2024[2]. This marked a significant shift in the Treasury market, with two-year Treasury yields consistently closing below 10-year yields during September, averaging a positive spread for the first time since the curve initially inverted in July 2022[4].

The recent uninversion represents a major change in market dynamics, as the yield curve had been sending recession signals for an unprecedented period. Historically, yield curve inversions have been reliable recession predictors, preceding every U.S. recession since the 1970s[2].

## Expert Projections

Forecasts regarding the yield curve's trajectory through the end of 2024 show some variation:

- Earlier projections from June 2024 suggested that "the curve is likely to remain inverted at least through the end of this year," despite potentially becoming positively sloped by the end of 2025[5]. However, these projections were made before the actual uninversion occurred in September.

- The probability of an inverted yield curve for the 91-day period ending in December was estimated at 73.4% as of June 14, 2024[3]. Again, this forecast preceded the actual uninversion.

- More recent market developments suggest that the September uninversion may be sustainable, as it reflects changing market expectations about Federal Reserve policy and economic conditions.

## Factors Influencing the Yield Curve

Several factors will influence whether the yield curve remains non-inverted through December 27, 2024:

1. **Federal Reserve Policy**: The Fed's interest rate decisions directly impact short-term yields. Any unexpected policy shifts could affect the curve's slope.

2. **Economic Data**: Indicators of economic growth, inflation, and employment will influence market expectations and, consequently, Treasury yields.

3. **Market Sentiment**: Investor perception of economic risks and future monetary policy will continue to shape the yield curve.

## Analysis and Forecast

Given that the yield curve has already uninverted as of September 2024 and maintained a positive spread through November 20 (at 0.10), there is reasonable evidence to suggest it may remain non-inverted on December 27, 2024. Historically, once yield curves uninvert, they typically don't quickly reinvert without significant economic developments or policy changes[4].

However, it's important to note that earlier forecasts from mid-2024 had projected continued inversion through year-end[5]. The actual uninversion in September represents a deviation from these earlier projections, suggesting either a change in economic conditions or a reassessment of monetary policy expectations.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several uncertainties could affect this forecast:

1. **Economic Volatility**: Unexpected economic developments could trigger rapid changes in market expectations.

2. **Federal Reserve Actions**: Any surprise policy announcements could significantly impact the yield curve.

3. **Global Factors**: International economic conditions and geopolitical events could influence U.S. Treasury yields.

4. **Measurement Timing**: The specific time of measurement on December 27 could affect the reading, especially in volatile market conditions.

The yield curve's recent transition from a prolonged inversion to a positive slope represents a significant shift in market dynamics, but whether this positive spread will persist through the end of December 2024 remains subject to evolving economic conditions and policy developments.
