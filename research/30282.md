### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of the latest available data before November 19, 2024, the US oil rig count stands at 479, down from 483 the previous week and from 506 a year prior, indicating a steady decline over the past year[4].
- The highest US oil rig count reported in 2024 was 506 in early March, with no subsequent increases approaching the 585–590 range[5].
- Forecasts for the near term (October 2024) place the rig count at 485, further supporting the ongoing trend of counts well below 585[2].

### Recent Announcements and Policies

- There have been no significant policy announcements or market events reported as of November 19, 2024, that would suggest a rapid increase in drilling activity or rig deployment before the end of the year.
- The rig count has shown week-to-week fluctuations but no sustained upward momentum sufficient to reach the 585–590 range[5].

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The Baker Hughes North American Rotary Rig Count is the primary and authoritative source for this metric[1][3].
- YCharts provides a regularly updated and accessible summary of the US oil rig count, as specified in the resolution criteria[4].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- The rig count is subject to short-term market dynamics, including oil price volatility, supply disruptions, and policy changes, but as of the cutoff date, no such factors are present that would likely drive a dramatic increase.
- Data is updated weekly, so there is a small window for unexpected changes, but historical trends and current status make a sudden surge highly improbable.

### Conclusion

Based on all available data and trends as of November 19, 2024, the number of active US oil drilling rigs is highly unlikely to be greater than or equal to 585 and less than or equal to 590 on December 27, 2024.
