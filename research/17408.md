**Key Historical Trends and Current Status**

- The most relevant US case as of June 2023 is the class-action lawsuit against Microsoft, GitHub, and OpenAI regarding GitHub Copilot’s use of public code for AI training without explicit permission under open-source licenses[2][3][4]. 
- This lawsuit is notable as the first major US class-action targeting the training and output of generative AI systems[2][3].
- As of mid-2023, the court had dismissed most of the claims (including those under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and various tort theories), but the key claim for breach of license survived dismissal[2][5]. Plaintiffs are seeking $1 billion in damages—well above the $100 million threshold established in the resolution criteria[2].

**Recent Announcements/Policies**

- The Copilot litigation survived initial dismissal attempts. The remaining claim (breach of license relating to open-source terms) could, in theory, result in significant damages if the court finds for the plaintiffs and certifies a large class[2][5]. 
- The legal process is slow: as of 2024, only two claims remain, and parties have proposed trial dates for late 2025 or early 2026, with possible settlement negotiations ongoing[5].
- No US court had, as of June 2023, issued a fine or damages award over $100 million specifically for AI model training data issues, but the Copilot case is designed to test this boundary[2][3][4].

**Authoritative Sources for Verification**

- Primary source documents from the Northern District of California (e.g., court orders and case management statements)
- Legal news summaries on the Copilot litigation and related AI copyright lawsuits[2][3][4]
- The official Copilot lawsuit update page[1]

**Limitations and Uncertainties**

- The legal theory surviving in the Copilot case is contract-based (breach of open-source license), not copyright infringement. This could limit damages, depending on how the class is defined and court interpretations[2][5].
- The pace of litigation is slow; as of the most recent filings, trial dates could extend into 2026, possibly after the question’s resolution period[5].
- Settlements are possible at any stage, which might or might not result in a payout at or above the $100M threshold.
- There are no direct precedents for such large penalties for AI training data use in US courts as of June 2023, making large awards speculative.
- Future legislative or regulatory changes could alter the legal landscape, but none were imminent as of June 2023.

**Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment**

- The possibility of a US court ordering a company to pay ≥$100M due to AI training data use by end of 2025 is nonzero but low.
    - The Copilot case is the most likely vector, but as of June 2023, the surviving claims and court pace make a final resolution awarding such damages before 2026 unlikely.
    - Settlement for this amount is possible but not guaranteed, and most class-action settlements are for less than the full damages sought.
    - No other known US cases as of June 2023 had reached a stage likely to produce such an award.

**Summary Table: Key Reference Case**

| Case                       | Status (as of 2023-06-10)         | Surviving Claims                | Damages Sought | Trial Timeline                |
|----------------------------|------------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------|-------------------------------|
| GitHub Copilot Litigation  | Survived partial dismissal         | Breach of open-source license    | $1B            | Proposed late 2025-early 2026 |

**Conclusion**
As of June 2023, the only plausible path for a ≥$100M court-ordered payment or fine for AI training data use before 2026 is the Copilot litigation, but timing and legal hurdles make such an outcome before the deadline unlikely, though not impossible[2][5].
