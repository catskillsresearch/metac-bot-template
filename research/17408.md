# Forecasting Analysis: AI Training Data Litigation

As of June 10, 2023, the GitHub Copilot litigation represents the most significant test case for potential large-scale financial penalties related to AI training data usage. This analysis examines the current landscape and forecasts the likelihood of a US court ordering payments ≥$100M for AI training data usage before 2026.

## Current Status of Key Litigation

The GitHub Copilot lawsuit, filed in November 2022 by Matthew Butterick and other plaintiffs against Microsoft, GitHub, and OpenAI, represents the first class-action case in the U.S. challenging AI training practices[2]. The plaintiffs are seeking $1 billion in damages, alleging that GitHub Copilot reproduces copyright-protected code that was scraped from the GitHub platform without proper licensing[2].

As of May 11, 2023, the court has issued a ruling on the initial motion to dismiss, with significant implications:

- Several claims were dismissed with leave to amend, including violations of DMCA Sections 1202(a) and 1202(b)(2), tortious interference, fraud, false designation of origin, and others[5]
- Importantly, the key claim regarding **breach of license** survived the dismissal attempt[5]
- Plaintiffs submitted an amended complaint on June 8, 2023[5]

The case timeline suggests that if settlement negotiations fail, a trial might not occur until late 2025, with defendants proposing a trial date deadline of February 2026[5].

## Factors Affecting Probability of Large Penalties

### Factors Increasing Probability

1. **Scale of Damages Sought**: The plaintiffs are seeking $1 billion in damages, indicating the potential magnitude of claims in this space[2]

2. **Class Action Status**: The lawsuit is structured as a class action on behalf of "possibly millions of GitHub users," which could amplify the total damages if successful[5]

3. **Survival of Key Claim**: The breach of license claim remains intact after the initial dismissal attempt, suggesting the court sees potential merit in this core argument[5]

### Factors Decreasing Probability

1. **Extensive Dismissals**: Many of the initial claims have been dismissed, potentially weakening the overall case[5]

2. **Legal Novelty**: The case represents novel legal territory, making it difficult to predict how courts will interpret existing copyright law in the AI context

3. **Timeline Challenges**: Given the proposed trial dates extending into late 2025 or early 2026, there's a significant chance that final resolution (including appeals) would extend beyond the December 31, 2025 resolution date

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on the available information as of June 10, 2023, I estimate the probability of a US court ordering payments ≥$100M for AI training data usage before the end of 2025 at approximately 15-25%.

This assessment reflects:

- The GitHub Copilot case is progressing but at a pace that may push resolution beyond 2025
- The survival of the breach of license claim represents a significant legal foothold
- The class action structure creates potential for large damages if successful
- Courts have shown initial skepticism toward many of the claims

## Key Uncertainties

Several factors could significantly alter this forecast:

1. **Settlement Possibility**: The parties are considering settlement according to the joint case management statement[5]. A settlement could potentially exceed the $100M threshold given the $1B initially sought.

2. **Additional Lawsuits**: New lawsuits against other AI companies might emerge and progress faster than the GitHub Copilot case.

3. **Judicial Interpretation**: How courts interpret existing copyright law in the novel context of AI training data represents a substantial unknown.

4. **Legislative Action**: Congress could potentially pass legislation clarifying the legal status of AI training data usage, which might influence court decisions.

The GitHub Copilot litigation represents an important first test case, but its timeline and the early dismissal of many claims suggest that reaching a $100M+ judgment specifically before the end of 2025 faces significant hurdles.
