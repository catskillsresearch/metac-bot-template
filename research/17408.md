# Forecasting Analysis: AI Training Data Litigation Outcomes

As of May 2025, the landscape of AI training data litigation shows important developments that inform our forecast of whether a US court will order a company to pay ≥$100M related to AI training data usage before 2026.

## Current Status of Relevant Litigation

The GitHub Copilot litigation represents the most prominent case addressing AI training data usage. Filed in November 2022, this class-action lawsuit challenged the legality of GitHub Copilot and OpenAI Codex, claiming these tools violated copyright laws by training on public GitHub repositories[1][5]. The plaintiffs sought $1 billion in damages, making this case particularly relevant to our forecast question[2].

As of July 2024, Judge Jon S. Tigar of the California Northern District Court dismissed the majority of claims in this lawsuit, including those related to violations of section 1202(b) of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA)[2]. However, two claims out of the original 22 remain active, with a key claim regarding whether training requires a license still standing[5].

## Legal Questions and Timeline

The central legal question in the GitHub Copilot case involves whether AI systems that train on publicly available code (or other content) violate copyright laws or open-source licensing agreements. The plaintiffs argue that GitHub Copilot reproduces "line-by-line copyright protected code" without proper attribution or compliance with licensing terms[2][4].

According to court documents, if the case proceeds to trial, the proposed trial dates are:
- September 29, 2025 (plaintiffs' proposal)
- February 4, 2026 (defendants' proposal)[5]

This timeline suggests that a potential verdict could occur near the end of 2025, making the resolution date of December 31, 2025, particularly relevant.

## Factors Affecting Likelihood

Several factors influence the probability of a ≥$100M judgment before the end of 2025:

**Factors decreasing likelihood:**
1. Most claims in the GitHub Copilot case have already been dismissed, weakening the plaintiffs' position
2. Judge Tigar ruled that code snippets provided by GitHub Copilot are not similar enough to copyright-protected codes created by the plaintiffs[2]
3. The court process is moving relatively slowly, with trial dates potentially pushing into 2026
4. Settlement discussions have been mentioned in court filings, which could result in lower payments[5]

**Factors increasing likelihood:**
1. The plaintiffs are seeking $1 billion in damages, far exceeding the $100M threshold[2]
2. This is a class action potentially representing "millions of GitHub users," which could justify large damages if successful[1]
3. The key claim about whether training requires a license remains active[5]
4. The case represents the first major legal test of AI training data usage, creating potential for precedent-setting judgments

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on the available information, I assess the probability of a US court ordering a company to pay ≥$100M for AI training data usage before December 31, 2025 at approximately 15-20%.

This assessment considers that:

1. The GitHub Copilot case is proceeding but with significantly reduced claims, lowering the likelihood of a large judgment.
2. The timeline suggests a verdict could potentially come just before or after the December 31, 2025 deadline, creating timing uncertainty.
3. Settlement remains a possibility, which would likely result in a lower payment than a full trial verdict.
4. The legal questions around AI training data remain largely untested in courts, creating uncertainty about how judges will rule.

If the GitHub Copilot case does proceed to trial in late 2025 as proposed by the plaintiffs, and if the remaining claims are successful, there is a path to a judgment exceeding $100M. However, the dismissal of most claims suggests the court has already found significant weaknesses in the plaintiffs' legal arguments.

## Conclusion

While the GitHub Copilot litigation represents a significant test case for AI training data legal questions, the dismissal of most claims indicates challenges for plaintiffs seeking large judgments. The timeline for resolution is tight relative to the December 31, 2025 deadline, and there remains significant uncertainty about how courts will ultimately rule on these novel legal questions. The probability of a ≥$100M judgment or fine before the end of 2025 appears relatively low but not negligible.
