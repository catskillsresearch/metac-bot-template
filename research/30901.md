## Forecast: Who Will Win the Marcus–Brundage AI Bet?

### 1. Historical Trends and Current Status

- **AI Performance vs. Bet Criteria:** As of the end of 2024, no AI system can reliably perform most of the hardest tasks in the list—especially those requiring creative excellence at the level of Pulitzer/Oscar/Nobel awards or deep, generalist comprehension and reasoning across media[1][2].
- **Recent AI Capabilities:** Modern large language models can summarize text, answer factual questions, generate code, and play some games, but:
  - They still hallucinate facts, struggle with long-term context, and cannot autonomously produce elite-level creative works with little or no human involvement[1][2].
  - Code generation at the >10,000 line scale from ambiguous specifications remains unreliable and often requires expert human intervention.
  - AI systems do not autonomously generate paradigm-shifting scientific discoveries or robust, symbolic mathematical proofs from arbitrary literature.
- **Community and Expert Consensus:** Even optimistic AI researchers and commentators suggest that achieving 8 out of 10 bet tasks by 2027 would require not just AGI but "superintelligence"—capabilities far beyond what most expect in the next few years[2][5].

### 2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- No major policy or technical announcement in 2024 fundamentally alters the slow, incremental progress seen in hard tasks like creative writing, high-level scientific discovery, or robust legal reasoning.
- Miles Brundage's departure from OpenAI in October 2024 was for reasons unrelated to technical progress and does not affect the likelihood of the bet's outcome[1].

### 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The official bet terms and ongoing commentary are publicly available on Gary Marcus's Substack and social media, with regular discussion in expert forums and prediction markets[1][3][5].
- Market-based forecasts (e.g., Manifold Markets) price the probability of Brundage winning (AI completing 8/10 tasks) at 27% as of late 2024, implying a roughly 73% probability of Marcus winning[5].

### 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- **Resolution Mechanism:** The bet will only resolve if both Marcus and Brundage agree publicly on the outcome; otherwise, it is annulled[1].
- **Subjectivity:** Some tasks (e.g., "Pulitzer-caliber writing") require subjective human judgment and may be contentious even among experts.
- **Potential for Sudden Breakthroughs:** While unlikely, an unforeseen leap in AI capabilities before the end of 2027 could change the outcome.
- **Bet Design:** The high bar set for 8 out of 10 tasks (with several requiring superhuman creativity and scientific reasoning) makes it less likely AI will satisfy the criteria in the given timeframe[2][5].

### **Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment**

- **Gary Marcus win (fewer than 8/10 tasks):** ~70–80% probability
- **Miles Brundage win (8 or more tasks):** ~20–30% probability

This assessment aligns with expert and market consensus as of late 2024 and reflects the high difficulty of the bet's criteria.
