## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Turkey’s application to join the EU’s predecessor dates back to 1987, and it was recognized as a candidate in 1999[5].
- Accession negotiations started in 2005 but have been effectively stalled since 2016 due to persistent concerns about democratic backsliding, rule of law, and human rights issues[5].
- The EU Parliament voted to suspend accession negotiations in 2016 and reaffirmed the suspension in subsequent years, citing lack of progress on the Copenhagen Criteria (democracy, rule of law, respect for minorities, alignment with EU policy)[2][3][5].
- As of May 2025, the European Parliament and the European Commission state the accession process “must remain frozen,” highlighting Turkey’s failure to address fundamental democratic shortcomings[3].

## 2. Recent Announcements and Policies

- In July 2023, the EU explicitly decided not to restart full membership negotiations with Turkey[5].
- President Erdoğan linked Sweden’s NATO membership to Turkey’s EU accession process at the 2023 NATO summit, but the EU responded that strategic/geopolitical considerations cannot override the absolute accession criteria[3][4].
- The European Parliament cites continued “democratic backsliding” and non-alignment with EU foreign and security policy as major barriers[3].
- While cooperation on strategic issues (migration, trade, security) continues, this is explicitly separated from progress toward full membership[3][4].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- European Commission: Enlargement policy status and criteria for Turkey[1].
- European Parliament: 2025 statement on the “frozen” status of the accession process, emphasizing the democratic and rule-of-law conditions[3].
- Updated analyses of EU–Turkey relations in 2024 confirming lack of movement on accession and highlighting persistent disputes[4].
- Wikipedia summary of EU–Turkey relations, with a timeline of key events and references to official EU documents[5].

## 4. Limitations or Uncertainties

- No evidence of imminent reforms in Turkey that would address the EU’s concerns on democracy, rule of law, or human rights[3][4].
- EU institutions and member states remain publicly committed to the Copenhagen Criteria as non-negotiable for accession[2][3].
- A major, unexpected political transformation in Turkey or a redefinition of EU accession standards could alter the trajectory, but no such shifts are presently visible[3][4].
- The EU’s existence, membership, and policies could change by 2040, but this is speculative and not supported by current trends.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Based on historical inertia, current “frozen” status, and the structural nature of the obstacles, the probability that Turkey will become a full EU member by December 31, 2039, is extremely low—likely well below 5% barring transformative political changes in either Turkey or the EU.
