To forecast how many movies will be new on Netflix's top 10 global English movies list for the week ending March 23, 2025, I'll analyze the available information about upcoming Netflix releases and relevant patterns.

## Relevance to the Week Ending March 23, 2025

For the specific week of March 17-23, 2025, these factors are particularly relevant:

1. **Release Timing**: "Little Siberia" is scheduled for release on March 21, 2025, which falls within the week in question. This timing makes it a strong candidate to appear on the top 10 list for that week[1].

2. **Earlier March Releases**: "Plankton The Movie" (March 7) and "Hot Wheels Let's Race" (March 3) will have been available for approximately two weeks before the measurement period. Depending on their popularity and staying power, they might still appear in the top 10 during the week ending March 23[2][4].

3. **Additional Content**: Netflix has announced other titles for March 2025, including "The Residence" and "The Life List," though specific release dates for these aren't confirmed in the available information[4].

## Historical Context and Patterns

While specific historical data on Netflix's top 10 movie retention isn't available in the search results, we can note:

- Netflix is investing heavily in original content for 2025, with sources describing March 2025 as "entertainment-packed" and "jam-packed with must-see blockbusters"[1][4].

- The platform is releasing a diverse range of content, from animated features to crime dramas and thrillers, potentially appealing to different audience segments[5].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors could affect the accuracy of any forecast:

- Netflix sometimes changes release dates for content
- Viewer reception is unpredictable and heavily influences top 10 rankings
- Competition from other streaming platforms may affect viewership
- The search results don't provide historical data on how long new releases typically remain in the top 10

## Conclusion

Based on the available information, at least one new movie ("Little Siberia") has a high probability of appearing in the top 10 global English movies list for the week ending March 23, 2025, due to its release date falling within that week. Additionally, earlier March releases like "Plankton The Movie" could potentially still be in the top 10 depending on their popularity and staying power.
