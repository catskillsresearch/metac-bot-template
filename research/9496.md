# Forecasting France's Nuclear Electricity Supply in 2035

As of January 22, 2022, France's nuclear electricity future appears to be at a policy crossroads, with competing signals about the direction of nuclear power's role in the French electricity mix by 2035.

## Current Status and Historical Context

France has historically maintained the world's highest share of nuclear power in its electricity mix. As of 2019, nuclear power provided approximately 67% of France's electricity generation, significantly higher than the next closest country (Slovakia at 54%). This dominant position reflects decades of strategic investment in nuclear technology following the 1970s oil crisis.

## Policy Evolution

The trajectory of French nuclear policy has seen significant shifts:

- In 2014, President Fran√ßois Hollande committed to reducing nuclear's share to 50% by 2025
- President Emmanuel Macron, upon taking office in 2017, delayed this target to 2035 while maintaining the 50% reduction goal
- As of early 2022, France's Multi-Year Energy Program (PPE) still formally targets nuclear providing 50% of baseload electricity by 2035, which would require closing 12 reactors by 2035 (not including the already-planned Fessenheim closure)[5]

## Recent Policy Shift

A significant development occurred in November 2021 when President Macron announced plans to build new nuclear reactors, marking an apparent shift from the previous downscaling strategy. This announcement followed the COP26 climate conference and came as Macron prepared for his 2022 re-election campaign.

This policy reversal appears to reflect several factors:
- Growing concerns about energy security
- Recognition of nuclear power's role in decarbonization
- Rising electricity demands that may be difficult to meet with renewables alone

## Forecast Considerations

Based on information available as of January 2022, several factors will influence the 2035 nuclear share:

1. **Policy implementation timeline**: The formal policy still targets 50% by 2035, but Macron's new reactor announcement suggests this may change

2. **Aging reactor fleet**: Many of France's reactors will be approaching 50-60 years of operation by 2035, requiring decisions about life extensions

3. **Electricity demand growth**: Future electricity consumption patterns will determine the denominator in the nuclear percentage calculation

4. **New reactor construction**: Any new reactors announced in 2021 would likely not be operational until the early 2030s at the earliest, given typical construction timeframes

5. **Political continuity**: The 2022 presidential election and subsequent elections will determine whether the current policy direction is maintained

## Probabilistic Assessment

Given the information available as of January 22, 2022, the most likely range for France's nuclear electricity share in 2035 appears to be 50-60%. The formal 50% target remains in place, but Macron's pivot toward new nuclear construction suggests the actual percentage may be higher if this policy shift is sustained.

The probability distribution would likely be skewed toward the higher end of this range if Macron wins re-election in 2022 and continues his pro-nuclear stance, while a different election outcome could reinforce the downward trajectory toward 50% or lower.
