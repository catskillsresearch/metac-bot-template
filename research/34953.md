## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of early 2025, Bluesky had surpassed 27 million users but did not reach 30 million by January 1, 2025[1]. This indicates continued growth, though at a slower pace than during its initial surge.
- Engagement metrics, including daily likers, are tracked by analytics tools such as Metricool and Jaz's Bluesky index. These tools provide breakdowns of daily likes, reposts, and other interactions, allowing for day-by-day tracking of engagement[3][4].
- Reports from social media managers and brands in January 2025 suggest that while Bluesky experienced initial growth, engagement rates—including likes—have slowed, with some brands noting minimal interaction[2].

## Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Metric

- There are no major announcements or policy changes specifically referenced in the available sources that would significantly alter the trajectory of daily likers as of early 2025.
- The general trend is a deceleration in engagement growth, likely reflecting a maturing user base and less novelty-driven activity[2].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The primary source for resolving this metric is [Jaz's Bluesky index](https://bsky.jazco.dev/stats), which provides daily statistics on Bluesky engagement, including the number of daily likers[4].
- Additional analytics and reporting platforms, such as Metricool, offer real-time and historical engagement data for Bluesky accounts[3].
- Sprinklr and other social analytics tools define and track "likes" and related engagement metrics, though their focus is often on post-level rather than platform-wide statistics[5].

## Limitations and Uncertainties in Measurement

- The exact number of daily likers for March 15, 2025, cannot be determined in advance; it will be resolved based on the figure reported by Jaz's Bluesky index on that date.
- Engagement metrics can fluctuate due to platform events, viral posts, or external news, introducing short-term volatility.
- The definition of "daily likers" is consistent across analytics platforms: it refers to the number of unique users who liked at least one post on a given day[4][5].
- There is some anecdotal evidence that engagement is not keeping pace with user growth, which may result in a lower proportion of daily likers relative to total users as the platform matures[2].
