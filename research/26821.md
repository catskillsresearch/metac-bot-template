# Will There Be a Vice Presidential Debate Before October 1, 2024?

As of July 2024, there are strong indications that a vice presidential debate will occur before October 1, 2024, though some uncertainty remains. The available evidence points to at least two potential debate opportunities between the Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance and the Democratic vice presidential nominee.

## Officially Scheduled Debate

The Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD) has officially scheduled a vice presidential debate for **Wednesday, September 25, 2024**, to be hosted at Lafayette College in Easton, Pennsylvania[1][3]. This date falls before the October 1 deadline specified in the question. The CPD announced this debate schedule on November 20, 2023, as part of their general election debate lineup[1].

According to the CPD's guidelines, "Invitations to participate in the vice-presidential debate will be extended to the running mate of each of the presidential candidates qualifying for participation in the CPD's first presidential debate"[1]. The determination regarding participation in the first presidential debate will be made after Labor Day 2024[1].

## Additional Debate Possibility

Beyond the CPD-sanctioned debate, there is another potential debate opportunity. On May 16, 2024, the Biden campaign accepted an invitation from CBS News for a vice presidential debate[5]. This invitation proposed two possible dates:

- July 23, 2024
- August 13, 2024

Both of these dates would occur well before the October 1 deadline. According to reporting, Vice President Kamala Harris acknowledged CBS News' invitation to debate against the Republican vice presidential nominee[5]. The Biden campaign indicated that the same regulations governing the presidential debates would apply to the vice presidential contest[5].

## Uncertainty Factors

Despite these scheduled debates, there are factors creating uncertainty:

1. **Republican Participation**: The Republican National Committee had been considering rule changes that would require presidential candidates seeking the party's nomination to pledge not to participate in CPD-sponsored debates[2]. As of the available information, it's unclear whether this would affect the vice presidential debate.

2. **Trump Campaign Response**: Regarding the CBS News debate invitation, a Trump campaign insider confirmed receipt of the invitation but indicated they had not yet made a definitive decision about participation[5].

3. **Political Developments**: The search results mention President Biden dropping out of the 2024 election, which creates additional uncertainty about debate arrangements, though the CPD schedule was set prior to this development.

## Conclusion

Based on the available information, there is a strong possibility of a vice presidential debate before October 1, 2024. The officially scheduled CPD debate on September 25, 2024, provides the most concrete opportunity, while the potential CBS News debate in July or August offers an earlier possibility. However, final confirmation depends on both campaigns formally agreeing to participate in one of these debates.

For this question to resolve as "Yes," one of these debates would need to occur with both candidates participating live and responding to each other in real time, either in person or virtually, in a structured and moderated format specifically billed as a vice presidential debate.
