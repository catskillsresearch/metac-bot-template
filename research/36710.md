## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Historically, federal criminal indictments of former senior administration officials are rare and typically follow established investigative processes, not direct presidential order.
- Both Christopher Krebs and Miles Taylor have previously been subject to significant public and government scrutiny, with no criminal conduct identified to date.
- As of May 1, 2025, the DOJ is conducting investigations of both men at President Trump’s explicit direction, following his April 9, 2025, executive memoranda revoking their security clearances and ordering probes into their government service[1][2][3][5].

## 2. Recent Announcements and Policies

- The April 2025 presidential memoranda represent an extraordinary use of executive power to target specific former officials for investigation, widely perceived as part of a broader campaign against political opponents[1][2].
- DOJ investigations are underway, with public statements emphasizing a broad review of both officials’ actions, particularly Krebs’ time at CISA and Taylor’s role at DHS and later public criticism of Trump[2][3].
- The moves have drawn condemnation from civil society organizations and raised concerns among election officials, underscoring the controversy and heightened scrutiny surrounding these investigations[4][5].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Major news outlets (e.g., Politico, Axios, Channel Futures) have reported on the memoranda, the revocation of clearances, and the initiation of DOJ investigations[1][2][3].
- Civil society and professional organizations (e.g., League of Women Voters) have issued statements on the chilling effect of the probes[4].
- Election and cybersecurity reporting platforms have covered the impact and concerns from the professional community[5].

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- No credible public evidence has yet been presented that would support a federal indictment of either Krebs or Taylor.
- The DOJ’s willingness to pursue charges in the absence of clear evidence is uncertain, especially in the face of legal norms and likely public backlash.
- The possibility remains that new information could emerge, but as of May 2025, none is known.
- The politicized nature of the investigation introduces unusual uncertainty, but institutional resistance remains a significant barrier.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given these factors, the probability that the DOJ will file a federal criminal indictment against Christopher Krebs or Miles Taylor before January 1, 2026, is:
- **Low, but not negligible**—significantly below 20%, but above historical baseline due to unprecedented presidential pressure and ongoing investigations.
- Barring the emergence of new, credible evidence of criminal conduct, the most likely outcome is **No indictment by January 1, 2026**.
