# Forecasting Individual Neutral Athletes' Gold Medal Prospects at Paris 2024

Based on information available prior to July 12, 2024, here's an analysis to help forecast whether Individual Neutral Athletes (AINs) will win 15 or more gold medals at the Paris 2024 Olympics.

## Current Status and Participation Limits

Individual Neutral Athletes (AINs) are competitors with Russian or Belarusian passports who are barred from representing their nations at the 2024 Paris Olympics due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine and Belarus's support of this action[4]. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has implemented strict eligibility conditions for these athletes.

A key factor affecting the forecast is the severely limited participation of Russian and Belarusian athletes:

- Only a "very limited number" of qualifying athletes with Russian and Belarusian passports will be permitted to compete as AINs[4]
- Specifically, there are only four quota places (2 Male / 2 Female) for AINs with Russian passports and one quota place (1 Male) for other AINs[1]
- A total of 32 Olympic Athletes from Belarus and Russia will compete as Individual Neutral Athletes[3]

## Historical Performance Context

The query notes that:
- The Russian Federation/Russian Olympic Committee has averaged 19 gold medals in the last 3 Olympic Games
- Belarus has averaged 1.7 gold medals in the same period

However, these historical averages are unlikely to be relevant predictors given the drastically reduced number of participants from these countries in 2024.

## Policy Restrictions

The IOC's Executive Board ruling from December 2023 established that:

- AINs must adhere to strict guidelines to participate in the Games[4]
- Athletes must sign declarations confirming they are "non-combatants and non-supporters of the Russian War with Ukraine"[5]
- AINs will compete without national flags, anthems, or other national symbols[4]

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors create significant uncertainty in forecasting AIN medal performance:

1. The dramatically reduced number of participants (32 total athletes) compared to full national delegations[3]
2. Uncertainty about which specific athletes qualified and in which sports they will compete
3. Potential psychological impact of competing without national representation
4. Limited information about the competitive strength of the specific athletes who qualified as AINs

## Forecast Considerations

Given the available information, reaching 15 gold medals appears highly challenging for AINs because:

1. The total contingent of 32 athletes is approximately 10% of what Russia and Belarus would typically send to the Olympics
2. To achieve 15 gold medals, nearly half of all AIN participants would need to win gold in their events
3. The quota places mentioned (4 for Russians, 1 for others) suggest even tighter restrictions in certain categories[1]

The Paris 2024 Olympics are scheduled to take place between July 26 and August 11, 2024[4], so final results were not available at the knowledge cutoff date of July 12, 2024.
