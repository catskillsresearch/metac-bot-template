### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Guatemala City has a mild, spring-like climate year-round, with average daytime highs ranging from 75°F (24°C) in November–January to 81.5°F (27.5°C) in April[5].
- It is not unusual for daily highs to reach or exceed 80°F from March to May, but occasional cold fronts from the north between late November and March can cause daily highs to fall below 80°F[5].
- Historical daily weather records show that while highs in January and February can sometimes stay in the mid- to upper-70s°F, most days in late March typically reach or exceed 80°F[1][2][3].

### Recent Announcements or Policies

- There are no recent announcements or policy changes that would directly impact the temperature in Guatemala City during this period.

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The Iowa Environmental Mesonet provides daily high temperature records for Guatemala City's La Aurora Airport (MGGT), which is the resolution source for this question.

### Limitations or Uncertainties

- While the climatological base rate suggests most days will reach 80°F or higher, occasional cold fronts can cause temporary dips below this threshold, especially before April.
- Measurement uncertainty is low, as airport weather stations are considered reliable for daily high temperature reporting.

### Conclusion

Based on historical climate data and recent weather records, it is possible—but not highly likely—that Guatemala City will fail to reach 80°F on at least one day between the launch of this question and April 1, 2025. The most probable window for such an event would be during a cold front in late March, but the overall trend is for highs to reach or exceed 80°F as the region approaches April[5][1][2].
