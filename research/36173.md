To forecast whether Guatemala City will fail to reach 80°F (26.7°C) on any day between the question launch and April 1, 2025, I'll analyze historical temperature patterns and climate data available as of March 19, 2025.

## Historical Temperature Patterns

Guatemala City typically experiences a temperate climate due to its elevation of approximately 1,500 meters above sea level. Historical temperature data shows:

- The average high temperature in Guatemala City ranges from 22.37°C (72.27°F) to 24.7°C (76.46°F) depending on the season[5]
- Historical maximum temperatures have reached as high as 38.12°C (100.62°F), with an average maximum of 31.1°C (87.98°F)[5]
- The daily mean temperature typically ranges from 18.46°C (65.23°F) to 20.24°C (68.43°F)[5]

Looking at specific historical data points:
- On January 8, 2019, Guatemala City recorded a high temperature of 75°F, which is below the 80°F threshold in question[2]

## Seasonal Considerations

Guatemala experiences distinct dry and rainy seasons that affect temperature patterns:

- The dry season typically runs from November to April
- March and April tend to be the warmest months of the year
- Even during these warmer months, daily temperature fluctuations can be significant due to the city's elevation

Based on historical climate data, Guatemala City's temperatures during March (the month in question) typically range between 72°F and 88°F, with average highs around 78-79°F[5]. This suggests that while temperatures often approach 80°F, there are likely to be days when the maximum temperature falls below this threshold.

## Factors Affecting Temperature Forecasts

Several factors could influence whether Guatemala City fails to reach 80°F on any given day:

- Cloud cover and precipitation can significantly reduce daytime high temperatures
- Cold fronts or weather systems moving through Central America during this period
- El Niño or La Niña conditions, which can affect regional temperature patterns
- Local microclimates within Guatemala City due to urban heat island effects or elevation differences

## Verification Sources

For accurate temperature verification, the following sources would be authoritative:

- Iowa Environmental Mesonet (specified in the resolution criteria)
- Guatemala's National Institute of Seismology, Volcanology, Meteorology and Hydrology (INSIVUMEH)
- Weather Underground historical data for Guatemala City[1][2]
- World Bank Climate Knowledge Portal for Guatemala[4]

## Limitations and Uncertainties

When forecasting temperatures, several limitations should be considered:

- Historical averages provide guidance but cannot predict specific daily temperatures with certainty
- Weather station location and measurement methodology can affect recorded temperatures
- Short-term weather patterns can deviate significantly from historical averages
- Climate change may be altering historical temperature patterns in the region

Based on the historical data available, it appears reasonably likely that Guatemala City would experience at least some days with maximum temperatures below 80°F during the period in question, particularly if there are cloudy or rainy days, or if cold fronts move through the region.
