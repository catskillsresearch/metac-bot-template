## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The global human population is estimated at over 8 billion as of 2025 and, despite regional declines, is projected to remain well above extinction levels through 2100. For example, major UN projections foresee world population peaking and then gradually declining, but not approaching anything close to 5,000 individuals[3][5].
- Many countries now have fertility rates below replacement levels, leading to population aging and eventual declines, but even the most rapidly declining populations (e.g., South Korea, Japan) are projected to number in the millions by century’s end[4].

## 2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- The rapid advance of AI has prompted global policy responses and safety initiatives; governments and organizations are increasingly focused on AI risk mitigation, including potential existential threats.
- AI is widely seen as a tool to offset economic challenges from demographic decline, rather than a direct existential risk, though concerns about autonomous weapons and misuse persist[2][4].
- There is no current evidence of credible, imminent large-scale AI-driven population threats; most policy concerns focus on economic disruption, labor markets, and civil liberties[1][2].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- *UN World Population Prospects 2024* provides authoritative demographic projections[5].
- Recent studies on global birth rates and their impacts (e.g., Lancet, Eurostat, CDC data) confirm declining but substantial future populations[4].
- Multiple think tanks and research organizations (e.g., Forecasting Research Institute, populationmatters.org) monitor both AI risk and demographic trends[1].

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- AI risk is a rapidly evolving domain with high epistemic uncertainty: unprecedented autonomy or misuse scenarios could, in theory, change risk profiles abruptly.
- Measuring “proximate cause” in a complex future catastrophe would be challenging and subject to post hoc analysis and debate.
- Black swan events—rare, high-impact, and unpredictable—cannot be categorically ruled out, especially with transformative technologies.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given current demographics, historical precedent, and the state of AI risk, the probability that AI will cause the global human population to fall below 5,000 before 2100 is extremely low—likely well below 0.1%. While not strictly impossible, such an outcome would require a convergence of catastrophic technological failure, social collapse, and ineffective global mitigation, none of which are currently evident or forecasted in authoritative sources[3][4][5].
