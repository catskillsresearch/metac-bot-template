**Key Historical Trends and Current Status**
- Rockstar Games has a history of launching Grand Theft Auto titles simultaneously worldwide, including Europe, reflecting the region's significance as a market[2][5].
- As of early 2025, the company had signaled a 2025 release window, with extensive community and media anticipation[4].

**Recent Announcements/Policies**
- On May 2, 2025, Rockstar Games officially announced that Grand Theft Auto VI is delayed until May 26, 2026, and will not be released in 2025[1][3][5].
- This new release date applies globally, affecting all regions and main platforms (PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S)[1][2][5].

**Authoritative Sources for Verification**
- Rockstar Games' official press releases and newswire[1]
- Major news outlets and video game press (France24, Playasia, Wikipedia)[2][3][5]

**Limitations or Uncertainties**
- There is no evidence of any plan for regional exceptions or early access in Europe prior to the new global release date.
- Unofficial leaks or unauthorized releases do not meet the resolution criteria.

**Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment**
