# Will Grand Theft Auto VI be Released in Europe in 2025?

As of May 24, 2025, the evidence strongly indicates that Grand Theft Auto VI will **not** be released in Europe in 2025, based on recent official announcements and industry developments.

## Current Status and Recent Announcements

On May 2, 2025, Rockstar Games officially announced that "Grand Theft Auto VI is now set to release on May 26, 2026," explicitly stating that this is "later than you expected."[1] This represents a significant delay from the previously anticipated 2025 release window that had been speculated about in gaming circles.[2]

Following this announcement, countdown websites and other tracking platforms have updated their information to reflect the new May 26, 2026 release date.[5] The official statement from Rockstar Games included an apology for the delay, noting: "We are very sorry that this is later than you expected. The interest and excitement surrounding a new Grand Theft Auto has been truly humbling for our entire team."[1]

Just recently, on May 6, 2025, Rockstar released a second trailer for GTA VI, further building anticipation for the 2026 release.[4] This marketing activity aligns with their revised timeline rather than suggesting an earlier release.

## Historical Context and Industry Analysis

Rockstar Games has a history of occasionally delaying major titles to ensure quality. The official statement emphasizes this commitment to quality as the reason for the postponement: "With every game we have released, the goal has always been to try and exceed your expectations, and Grand Theft Auto VI is no exception. We hope you understand that we need this extra time to deliver at the level of quality you expect and deserve."[1]

Prior to this announcement, there had been skepticism even within Rockstar about the feasibility of a 2025 release date. Sources had indicated that "Rockstar employees 'didn't believe 2025 Grand Theft Auto 6 release date'"[2], suggesting internal awareness of development challenges that have now manifested in this official delay.

## Probabilistic Assessment

Given the official announcement from Rockstar Games delaying the release to May 2026, the probability of GTA VI being released in Europe in 2025 is extremely low, approaching 0%. While gaming companies occasionally move release dates forward, this would be highly unusual for a title of this magnitude, especially given:

1. The recency of the delay announcement (May 2, 2025)
2. The explicit new release date provided (May 26, 2026)
3. The apologetic tone of the announcement suggesting genuine development needs
4. The release of new marketing materials aligned with the 2026 timeline

The only scenario in which a 2025 European release might occur would be if Rockstar made an unprecedented decision to reverse their very recent delay announcement, which would be extraordinarily unlikely given their development history and communication patterns.

## Conclusion

Based on the official announcement from Rockstar Games on May 2, 2025, Grand Theft Auto VI has been delayed to May 26, 2026. This authoritative statement from the developer, along with supporting evidence from industry sources and their recent marketing activities, provides strong confirmation that GTA VI will not be released in Europe or any other region in 2025. The question should therefore be resolved as "No" with high confidence.
