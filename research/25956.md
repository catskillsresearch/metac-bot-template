# Will Democrats Have a Brokered Convention in 2024?

Based on available information as of July 2024, a brokered convention for the Democratic Party in 2024 appears highly unlikely, though recent events have introduced some uncertainty into what was previously considered a foregone conclusion.

## Historical Context and Current Status

Brokered conventions, where no candidate secures a majority of delegates on the first ballot, have become increasingly rare in modern American politics. The Democratic Party has experienced only 5 brokered conventions since 1900, with the most recent occurring in 1952. The current delegate allocation strongly favors President Biden, who has secured approximately 99% of pledged delegates through the primary process[2].

For a brokered convention to occur in 2024, thousands of delegates who are pledged to Biden would need to simultaneously revolt against the sitting president—a scenario that election law experts consider extremely improbable[2]. Derek Muller, an election law professor at Notre Dame, stated: "I don't anticipate there being a real groundswell of opposition at the convention. I mean, he has 99% of the pledged delegates. It would take, you know, thousands of delegates all converging and opposing him at once, against the sitting president of the United States"[2].

## Recent Developments

The Democratic National Committee has decided to hold its presidential roll call vote virtually, ahead of the in-person convention scheduled to begin on August 19, 2024[2]. This procedural decision further diminishes the possibility of a dramatic floor fight or last-minute change, as the nomination process will be completed earlier and in a more controlled environment.

However, following President Biden's debate performance in late June 2024, some voices within the Democratic Party have raised concerns about his candidacy. Some political operatives have suggested the possibility of an "open convention" as an alternative[4]. Despite these concerns, the structural and procedural barriers to replacing Biden remain substantial.

## Potential Scenarios

There are essentially two pathways that could lead to a brokered convention:

1. **Voluntary Withdrawal**: If Biden voluntarily steps down before the nomination, many delegates who were assigned to him would likely enter the convention uncommitted[2]. This scenario would create uncertainty about who would emerge as the nominee.

2. **Delegate Revolt**: For this to occur, thousands of Biden-pledged delegates would need to break from their commitment simultaneously—a scenario considered highly unlikely by experts[2].

As Muller noted: "To the extent they're doing that even earlier and continue to adhere to that process, I think it's just deeply unlikely that it would result in anyone except Biden. Again, I think it really would take him voluntarily stepping down, for most—for any of these serious scenarios to play out realistically"[2].

## Implications of a Late Change

If Democrats were to pursue a brokered convention strategy, they would face significant logistical challenges. A new nominee would not be officially selected until the third week in August, leaving minimal time to organize a presidential campaign against an opponent who has had months to prepare[1]. This compressed timeline would create substantial disadvantages in terms of campaign infrastructure, fundraising, and messaging.

Additionally, a brokered convention would likely generate extensive media coverage focused on party division and conflict rather than policy messaging. As one analysis notes, such a scenario would create "chaos, conflict, and controversy" that would dominate news cycles at the expense of substantive campaign messaging[1].

## Conclusion

Based on the current delegate count, procedural timeline, and expert analysis, a brokered convention for the Democrats in 2024 remains highly improbable. While recent events have prompted some discussion about alternative scenarios, the structural barriers to replacing Biden as the nominee through a brokered convention are formidable. Unless Biden voluntarily withdraws from the race—which he has given no indication of doing—the likelihood of a brokered convention remains extremely low.

The most probable outcome is that Biden will secure the nomination through a single ballot at the virtual roll call, well before the in-person convention begins in August 2024.
