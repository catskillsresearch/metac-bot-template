## Historical Trends and Current Status

- Puerto Rico has held multiple referendums on statehood, with support fluctuating but recently increasing: the November 2024 referendum saw 57% vote for statehood, with a 57% turnout rate[1][3].
- Political parties in Puerto Rico are structured around status preference: the New Progressive Party (NPP) supports statehood, and the Popular Democratic Party (PPD) supports maintaining or enhancing commonwealth status. Neither maps cleanly to U.S. national parties[1][3].
- In recent elections, the pro-statehood NPP has won the governorship, but Puerto Rico's politics remain competitive and divided, often resulting in split government[1].
- U.S. national parties have expressed conditional support for statehood; Democrats generally support it if Puerto Ricans choose it through a fair process, while Republicans have expressed both support and skepticism depending on political context[1][3].

## Key Differences Affecting the Forecast

- Unlike DC, where an overwhelmingly Democratic electorate would almost certainly elect two Democratic Senators, Puerto Rico's local parties and political divisions do not correspond directly to the U.S. two-party system, making outcomes less predictable[1][3].
- Both major Puerto Rican parties contain factions with U.S. national party preferences, and political identities are shaped more by status issues than by U.S. party ideology.
- Puerto Rican general elections are competitive, and voters may not elect two Senators from the same party, especially in an environment of closely contested races and coalition-building.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the above, if Puerto Rico becomes a U.S. state by 2035, the probability that both of its first two elected Senators will be Democrats is notably lower than the analogous scenario for DC. The most likely outcome is a split delegation or a mix of party affiliations, due to:

- The competitive, non-binary nature of Puerto Rican politics.
- The likelihood that at least one Senator will be from the pro-statehood NPP, which has members aligned with both U.S. parties.
- The lack of overwhelming Democratic dominance in recent Puerto Rican elections.

**Adjusted Probability Estimate:**  
A reasonable forecast (as of 2021-05-26) would assign roughly a 30-40% chance that both first two Senators will be Democrats, with a higher likelihood for a split delegation or for at least one Senator to be from another party or have ambiguous U.S. party alignment.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- Puerto Rican parties may realign or affiliate more closely with U.S. parties upon statehood, affecting outcomes.
- Candidate-specific factors and local issues could override national party trends.
- Voter turnout and engagement in a first Senate election could differ from recent gubernatorial or status referendums.
