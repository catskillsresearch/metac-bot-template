# Forecasting Analysis: US-Denmark Negotiations over Greenland

As of January 31, 2025, the prospect of formal negotiations between the United States and Denmark regarding the transfer of Greenland's sovereignty appears to be a contentious and developing situation with significant diplomatic implications.

## Current Situation

Following his election victory in November 2024, President Donald Trump has revived and intensified his interest in acquiring Greenland. By January 2025, Trump has explicitly declared Greenland a "must-have" for US security and indicated willingness to use various forms of pressure to achieve this goal[1]. This represents a significant escalation from his previous interest expressed during his first term.

The Trump administration has already taken several concrete actions:
- Trump has threatened to impose high tariffs on Denmark if it blocks US attempts to take over Greenland[2]
- Donald Trump Jr. made a publicized private visit to Nuuk (Greenland's capital), attempting to win over locals with MAGA hats and promises[1]
- A US delegation including Usha Vance (wife of Vice President JD Vance) planned a visit to Greenland in late March 2025[2]
- Trump used his first address to Congress to directly invite all 57,000 Greenlanders to join the United States[1]

## Key Resistance Factors

Several significant factors stand in opposition to formal negotiations:

**Greenlandic Opposition**: A January 2025 poll revealed that approximately 85% of Greenlanders oppose becoming part of the United States[1][2]. This overwhelming public sentiment makes it politically difficult for Greenlandic leaders to entertain formal negotiations.

**Unified Greenlandic Political Response**: The leaders of all five parties in Greenland's parliament issued a joint statement following the March 2025 election describing the US statements about annexation as "unacceptable to friends and allies in a defense alliance"[2]. Prime Minister Múte B Egede has firmly stated that "Greenland is not for sale" and characterized the planned US delegation visit as "highly aggressive"[2].

**Danish Government Position**: Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen has emphasized that only Greenlanders can decide their future while maintaining that the US remains Denmark's "closest ally"[2]. She described the planned US delegation visit as "not respectful" and accused the US of placing "unacceptable pressure" on Greenland and Denmark[2].

**European Support for Denmark**: The European Union has shown support for Denmark, with European Council President António Costa emphasizing in February 2025 the importance of preserving Denmark's territorial integrity and sovereignty to the EU's member states[2].

## Alternative Scenarios

While direct sovereignty transfer appears unlikely given current resistance, there are alternative arrangements being discussed:

1. **Associated Statehood**: Greenland could potentially pursue associated statehood either with Denmark (in a modified form) or with the US, which would provide economic benefits and security guarantees while preserving some autonomy[4].

2. **Co-Sovereignty Model**: Similar to Andorra's arrangement, this would involve shared sovereignty between multiple powers, balancing Greenland's desire for autonomy with the strategic interests of other Arctic nations[4].

3. **Increased Autonomy**: Greenland could maintain its current status within the Kingdom of Denmark but negotiate for increased autonomy in specific areas like foreign policy[4].

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on the information available as of January 31, 2025, formal negotiations between the US and Denmark over Greenland's sovereignty before 2026 appear unlikely for several reasons:

1. The overwhelming opposition from Greenlanders themselves (85% against) creates a significant political barrier.

2. The unified stance of Greenland's political leadership against becoming part of the US presents a formidable obstacle.

3. Denmark's position that only Greenlanders can decide their future, coupled with EU support for Denmark's territorial integrity, creates substantial diplomatic resistance.

4. The aggressive approach by the Trump administration, including threats of tariffs and what Danish leaders have called "unacceptable pressure," has created a confrontational rather than cooperative diplomatic environment.

However, several factors could increase the probability of formal negotiations:

1. The Trump administration has demonstrated a willingness to use economic leverage (tariff threats) and appears highly motivated to pursue this goal.

2. There are indications of potential US withdrawal from NATO, which could alter the strategic relationship between the US and Denmark regarding Greenland[3].

3. Greenland's own independence movement might see strategic value in using US interest as leverage in negotiations with Denmark for greater autonomy or financial support.

Given these countervailing forces, I assess the probability of formal negotiations being announced before January 1, 2026, at approximately 25-30%. This reflects the significant obstacles present while acknowledging the unpredictable nature of the Trump administration's foreign policy approach and the potential for rapid changes in the geopolitical landscape.

## Key Uncertainties

Several important uncertainties could significantly affect this forecast:

1. The possibility of internal political changes in Greenland or Denmark that might alter their current unified opposition.

2. The extent to which the US might escalate pressure tactics beyond rhetorical threats.

3. The potential impact of US-NATO relations on this specific issue.

4. The role of other international actors, particularly EU members and Arctic nations, in mediating or influencing the situation.
