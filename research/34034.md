### 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The United States has had a long-standing interest in Greenland, dating back to at least the mid-20th century, motivated by its strategic Arctic location and natural resources[3][5].
- The most prominent recent episode occurred in 2019, when then-President Trump publicly expressed a desire to purchase Greenland, but Denmark and Greenland promptly and firmly rejected the idea[3][5].
- As of early 2025, US interest has intensified: President Trump has not ruled out acquiring Greenland and has made statements about using tariffs or even military force, citing national security concerns[1][2][4].
- Greenland is a semi-autonomous territory within the Kingdom of Denmark; its government controls domestic affairs, but Denmark retains authority over foreign and defense policy[5].

### 2. Recent Announcements and Policies

- In January 2025, President Trump threatened to impose high tariffs on Denmark if it blocked US efforts to acquire Greenland[2].
- Greenland’s leaders, representing all major parties, issued a joint statement after the March 2025 election, declaring US attempts at annexation “unacceptable,” and reaffirming that Greenland is “not for sale”[2].
- Denmark’s Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen has reiterated that Greenland is not for sale, emphasizing cooperation with the US on Arctic security but rejecting any negotiations about sovereignty[1][2].
- The European Union has publicly supported Denmark’s territorial integrity, with the European Council President in February 2025 underscoring the importance of Danish sovereignty[2].
- An opinion poll in January 2025 found that 85% of Greenlanders oppose becoming part of the United States[2].
- Greenland’s outgoing Prime Minister and Denmark’s PM have both characterized recent US actions (including planned visits) as “highly aggressive” and “not respectful”[2].
- The US administration is reportedly calculating the cost of taking over Greenland, but expert analysis suggests actions are more likely to involve economic offers than any formal negotiation on sovereignty[4].

### 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Official government statements from Denmark, Greenland, and the United States.
- Reports and polling data from January–April 2025, as cited above.
- Parliamentary briefings and analysis from think tanks specializing in Arctic security[2][4].

### 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- All available evidence as of January 31, 2025, indicates no movement toward formal negotiations. The positions of Denmark, Greenland, and the EU are unified against any sovereignty transfer[1][2][4].
- There is no precedent for such a transfer between Western democracies in recent history, and public opposition in Greenland is overwhelming[2].
- While the US is applying pressure and exploring options, back channel discussions or economic engagement are not sufficient to meet the resolution criteria, which require a formal, public announcement by both governments.

### Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Based on the above, the probability that the United States and Denmark will publicly announce formal negotiations over the transfer of Greenland’s sovereignty before 2026 is extremely low (well below 5%). The unified opposition of both Denmark and Greenland, bolstered by EU support and public sentiment in Greenland, are decisive obstacles. No evidence as of January 31, 2025, suggests a reversal or softening of these positions.
