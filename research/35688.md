# Fort Knox Gold Holdings Forecast Analysis

As of March 5, 2025, several key developments and historical data points can help forecast whether the US Mint will list Fort Knox gold holdings at 147.3 million ounces on April 1, 2025.

## Current Status and Historical Trends

According to the Treasury Department's Bureau of the Fiscal Service, as of November 30, 2024, the Fort Knox vaults held 147,341,858.382 troy ounces of gold with a minimum fineness of .9995[5]. This figure (approximately 147.3 million ounces) represents the most recent officially reported quantity before March 2025.

The gold in Fort Knox is held as an asset of the United States at a statutory book value of $42.2222 per troy ounce, a figure that has remained constant since 1973 and does not fluctuate with market prices[5]. Based on this valuation method, the total book value of Fort Knox gold was reported as $6,221,097,412.78 as of November 2024[5].

Historically, comprehensive verification of Fort Knox gold reserves has been rare. The last complete audit reportedly occurred in the early 1950s, with only a partial audit conducted in 1974[2]. This long period without full verification has contributed to ongoing public speculation about the actual quantity of gold stored at the facility.

## Recent Developments Affecting Fort Knox Gold Reporting

In February 2025, President Trump announced plans to conduct an audit of the US gold reserves at Fort Knox[2]. This announcement represented a significant development, as Trump stated, "We're going to go into Fort Knox to make sure the gold is there," adding that "if the gold isn't there, we're going to be very upset"[2].

As of March 4, 2025, the Trump Administration was actively preparing to conduct this audit of U.S. gold reserves at Fort Knox[4]. This planned audit follows public discourse on the topic, including a social media exchange between Elon Musk and Senator Rand Paul regarding Fort Knox auditing, which generated considerable public interest[2].

The timing of this audit is particularly significant as it coincides with reports of unprecedented movements of gold into US vaults, with industry experts suggesting these transfers could be preparation for a larger strategic shift in US monetary policy[2].

## Verification Sources and Authority

The primary authoritative source for official gold holdings data is the Treasury Department's Bureau of the Fiscal Service, which provides periodic reconciliation reports of government-held gold[5]. These reports detail the quantity and book value of gold stored at various facilities, including Fort Knox.

The US Mint, which operates under the Treasury Department, maintains the webpage specified in the resolution criteria (usmint.gov/learn/tours-and-locations/fort-knox) where the official figure would be published.

## Uncertainties and Limitations

Several factors create uncertainty in forecasting whether the reported figure will remain at 147.3 million ounces on April 1, 2025:

1. **Audit Timing and Results**: The announced audit could potentially be completed before April 1, 2025, and might result in an updated figure if discrepancies are found[2][4].

2. **Transparency Initiatives**: Trump's announcement represents a potential shift "from decades of opacity around America's gold reserves to a new era of transparency"[2], which could affect how and when updated figures are published.

3. **Speculation and Public Discourse**: There has been significant public debate about Fort Knox gold holdings, with some questioning the authenticity and quantity of these reserves[3]. Former President Trump himself had previously questioned these holdings, suggesting much lower amounts might remain[3].

4. **Global Financial Implications**: Any significant change in reported gold holdings could have far-reaching implications for international finance and gold markets[2][3], potentially influencing the timing and manner of any official updates.

Given that the most recent official figure (as of November 30, 2024) already stands at approximately 147.3 million ounces, and absent any completed audit results showing different figures, there is a reasonable basis to expect this number to remain unchanged on April 1, 2025. However, the ongoing audit process introduces a significant element of uncertainty.
