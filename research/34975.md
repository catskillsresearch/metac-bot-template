## Key Factual Information

- On February 1, 2025, President Trump issued an executive order imposing new tariffs on imports from Canada. The tariffs consist of a 25% ad valorem rate on most Canadian imports, with Canadian energy resources subject to a 10% tariff instead[1][5].
- These tariffs were scheduled to take effect on February 4, 2025[5].
- The White House and multiple legal advisories confirm that these tariffs were officially announced and implemented, not merely threatened or intended[1][5].
- The tariffs apply broadly to Canadian imports, with the exception of energy resources, which face a lower rate[5].
- In response, Canada announced retaliatory tariffs on US imports, also effective February 4, 2025, confirming the US tariffs were indeed implemented[2][3][4].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- The US government, under President Trump, officially announced and implemented new tariffs on Canadian imports effective February 4, 2025[1][5].
- Canada responded with its own tariff measures, further confirming the US action was not delayed or revoked[2][3][4].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Official White House fact sheets and executive orders[1][5].
- Legal and trade advisories from major law firms[2][3].
- Official announcements from the Canadian government[4].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- There is no evidence in the available sources that the tariffs were suspended, delayed, or revoked before their effective date.
- The information is current as of February 13, 2025, and covers all relevant developments up to that point.

## Conclusion

Based on the available evidence, the United States did impose new tariffs on Canada before April 1, 2025. The tariffs were officially announced and implemented, meeting the resolution criteria for a "Yes" answer.
