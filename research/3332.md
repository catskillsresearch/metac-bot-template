## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- **James Bedford’s Cryopreservation**: Bedford was cryopreserved in 1967, becoming the first person ever to undergo such a procedure. His preservation was primitive by modern standards: his body was frozen several hours after death due to cancer, and the cryoprotectant used was a basic solution of 15% dimethyl sulfoxide and 85% Ringer’s solution. There was no evidence of modern vitrification or rapid cooling to minimize ice damage[1][4].
- **Storage History**: Bedford’s body has experienced multiple facility transfers, including periods where storage equipment malfunctioned. He was maintained by his family in liquid nitrogen until 1982, after which he was transferred to the Alcor Life Extension Foundation, where he remains[1][5]. 
- **Condition Assessment**: In 1991, an evaluation concluded that Bedford’s external temperature had likely remained low throughout storage, but the internal condition—especially neurological integrity—remains highly questionable given initial procedures and subsequent handling[4].
- **Status of Cryonics and Revival**: No human or large mammal has ever been revived from cryopreservation as of 2019. Modern cases use improved methods (e.g., vitrification), but the field remains unproven for whole-body or brain revival.

## 2. Recent Announcements/Policies

- There have been no recent policy shifts or announcements (as of 2019-11-23) suggesting imminent breakthroughs in biological revival from cryopreservation or in whole-brain emulation sufficient to meet the strict criteria for “revival” as defined.
- Cryonics organizations continue to preserve patients, but no case has approached the threshold of verified revival or emulation.

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- **Wikipedia – James Bedford**: Provides a summary of Bedford’s life, preservation history, and current status at Alcor[1].
- **Alcor Records**: Lists Bedford as a current patient and documents his transfers and preservation history[2][3].
- **Detailed Condition Report**: The 1991 evaluation of Bedford’s condition offers the most specific assessment of his preservation state[4].
- **Recent Commentary**: Coverage in 2024 reiterates Bedford’s unique status and the lack of revival progress[5].

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- **Measurement Uncertainty**: The true state of Bedford’s neural structures is unknown and likely severely compromised due to both primitive preservation and handling.
- **Scientific Hurdles**: Repairing extensive freezing damage or inferring/replicating a conscious mind from such a compromised substrate remains speculative.
- **Unknown Breakthroughs**: The future pace of advances in nanotechnology, neuroscience, and artificial intelligence could—though unlikely—alter the probability, but no current trends support optimism for such breakthroughs before 2200.
- **Strict Resolution Criteria**: The requirement for expert-verified, prolonged consciousness excludes borderline or ambiguous cases, raising the bar significantly.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the primitive and delayed nature of Bedford’s preservation, combined with the absence of successful revival cases and the strict criteria for “revival,” the probability that James Bedford will be revived or emulated before 2200 remains extremely low—well under 1%. His prospects are significantly lower than for more recently preserved individuals, whose procedures offer better theoretical chances should future technologies emerge.
