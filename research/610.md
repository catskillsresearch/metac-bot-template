## Historical Trends and Current Status

- The post-World War II era has been marked by an unprecedented absence of direct great-power conflict—sometimes called the "Long Peace." As of 2017, this period spanned about 72 years, roughly 35% as long as the Pax Romana, which lasted 206 years[5].
- Despite this, numerous regional wars (Korea, Vietnam, Middle East conflicts, etc.) and proxy wars have occurred, indicating that "peace" is relative.
- The world has seen significant nuclear proliferation, with deterrence as a stabilizing factor at the great-power level but adding catastrophic risk should deterrence fail.
- Economic globalization has increased interdependence between major economies, which may decrease incentives for large-scale war but also creates new vulnerabilities.

## Key Differences Affecting the Forecast

- **Nuclear Weapons:** The existence of large nuclear arsenals raises the stakes, making direct world war less likely but potentially more devastating if it happens.
- **International Institutions:** The UN and other multilateral bodies provide forums for dispute resolution not present in ancient times.
- **Non-state Actors and Asymmetric Warfare:** The character of conflict is increasingly decentralized, making traditional world wars harder to define or initiate.
- **Technology and New Domains:** New forms of warfare (cyber, AI) could create destabilizing dynamics or new triggers for escalation[5].
- **Rising Tensions:** As of the late 2010s, major tensions existed between the US and China (Asia-Pacific), Russia and NATO (Eastern Europe), and persistent conflict in the Middle East and the Korean Peninsula[5].
- **Public and Expert Opinion:** While some surveys in the 2020s indicated rising pessimism—with 40% of surveyed experts expecting a world war by 2035 and 20-30% probability estimates from historians—these are short-term assessments, not projections over more than a century[3].

## Recent Announcements/Policies

- Ongoing military buildups and arms races, especially in Asia and Eastern Europe[5].
- Modernization of nuclear arsenals by the US, Russia, and China.
- Continued instability and conflict in regions such as the Middle East and the Korean Peninsula[5].
- Increasing concern over the destabilizing potential of new technologies (AI, cyber warfare)[5].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Atlantic Council Strategy Paper Series, which tracks expert sentiment and risk assessment on global conflict[3].
- Analysis of historical periods of peace and war (e.g., Pax Romana, post-WW2 era).
- Current geopolitical analysis from think tanks, academic sources, and official government reports.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- **Long-Term Projection Challenge:** Predicting over a >130 year timeframe incurs extreme uncertainty due to unpredictable technological, environmental, and sociopolitical changes.
- **Data and Measurement:** Accurately measuring participation and fatalities—especially given the provided criteria—may be difficult, especially for future conflicts.
- **Definition and Thresholds:** The specific criteria for a "world war" are stringent and may not be met even in significant future conflicts.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given:
- The history of major wars following long periods of relative peace,
- The scale of risk factors (nuclear, technological, environmental, political),
- The stringent criteria for what counts as a "world war" in this context,

It is reasonable to assign a **non-trivial cumulative probability**—potentially in the range of 30-60%—that a world war as defined could occur before 2151, though the probability in any given decade remains moderate to low. This estimate is highly uncertain, and actual risk could be higher or lower depending on unforeseen developments.
