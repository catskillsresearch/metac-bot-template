# Forecasting China vs. US Moon Landing Prospects (As of December 2020)

As of December 18, 2020, both China and the United States have announced ambitions to return humans to the Moon. This analysis examines the available information to assess whether China will land the next person on the lunar surface.

## Historical Context and Current Status

The United States remains the only nation to have successfully landed humans on the Moon, with six Apollo missions between 1969 and 1972. China, meanwhile, has been steadily advancing its lunar exploration program with unmanned missions, particularly through its Chang'e program, which has successfully deployed multiple probes to the lunar surface.

China's space program has been characterized by methodical, incremental progress operating under its five-year planning system. This provides consistency in funding and objectives that contrasts with the more politically variable nature of US space policy.

## Program Timelines and Capabilities

### Chinese Lunar Program

China has been developing its lunar capabilities through the Chang'e series of unmanned missions. By late 2020, China had already demonstrated the ability to land probes on the lunar surface and return samples to Earth. The country appears to be following a step-by-step approach toward eventual human landings.

China has been developing the heavy-lift Long March (Changzheng) rocket series, though the super-heavy Changzheng-9 needed for crewed lunar missions was still in early development stages as of 2020.

### US Lunar Program

The United States, through NASA's Artemis program, has publicly announced intentions to return humans to the Moon by 2024. This timeline was set during the Trump administration, representing an acceleration of previous plans.

The US has more extensive experience with human spaceflight beyond Earth orbit, but has faced challenges with program consistency across different administrations and funding cycles.

## Comparative Analysis

Several factors may influence which nation lands the next person on the Moon:

1. **Political Consistency**: China's space program benefits from centralized planning and consistent political direction, while US space priorities have shifted with changing administrations.

2. **Technological Readiness**: As of 2020, the US has more experience with human spaceflight beyond Earth orbit, but China has demonstrated rapid technological advancement.

3. **Funding Commitment**: Both nations have committed resources to their lunar programs, though exact figures for China's space budget are less transparent.

4. **Program Approach**: China typically follows a more methodical, step-by-step approach with realistic timelines, while the US 2024 target represented an ambitious acceleration of previous plans.

## Forecast Limitations

This forecast is limited by several factors:

- Limited public information about China's specific timeline for human lunar missions as of December 2020
- Uncertainty about the sustainability of the accelerated 2024 US timeline
- Potential for political or funding changes in either country
- Technical challenges that could emerge in either program

## Conclusion

Based on information available as of December 2020, the US has announced a more aggressive timeline (2024) for returning humans to the Moon through the Artemis program. However, China's methodical approach and political consistency provide advantages that could potentially allow it to achieve a lunar landing on a timeline competitive with the US, particularly if the US experiences delays due to funding, political, or technical challenges.

The 2024 target for both nations appears ambitious given the development status of key systems as of late 2020. A more realistic assessment would suggest human lunar landings by either nation would likely occur in the latter half of the 2020s, with the specific order dependent on each program's ability to overcome technical challenges and maintain political and funding support.
