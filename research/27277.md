### Key Factual Information

- As of July 15, 2024, the CDC reported 167 measles cases in the United States, with updates provided biweekly[1].
- The CDC's official year-end total for 2024 is 285 measles cases reported by 33 jurisdictions[1].
- The number of outbreaks in 2024 (16) and the proportion of outbreak-associated cases (69%) are both significantly higher than in 2023, but the total case count remains below 400[1].
- For comparison, only 59 cases were reported in all of 2023[1].
- As of March 28, 2024, 97 cases had been reported, indicating a rapid increase early in the year, but the rate of new cases did not continue at a pace that would surpass 400 by September 30[2].
- No major policy changes or announcements between July and December 2024 indicate a sudden spike in cases[1][2][4].

### Authoritative Sources

- The CDC's Measles Cases and Outbreaks page is the primary source for official case counts and is updated biweekly[1].
- CDC surveillance and MMWR reports provide detailed breakdowns and context for measles trends[2].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- There may be minor reporting delays or adjustments, but these are unlikely to account for a difference of over 100 cases.
- The CDC's data is considered the gold standard for U.S. measles surveillance.

### Conclusion

Based on the CDC's official data, it is highly unlikely that more than 400 measles cases were reported in the United States by September 30, 2024. The year-end total was 285 cases, well below the 400-case threshold.
