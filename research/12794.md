## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Since 1979, the US has not formally recognized Taiwan as a sovereign state, instead maintaining unofficial relations through the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT)[1].
- Taiwan operates as a de facto independent country, but its ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) maintains there is “no need to declare independence again,” emphasizing the status quo of substantive independence[5].
- China insists on diplomatic exclusivity, demanding that countries must choose between formal relations with the PRC or Taiwan, and has threatened military action if Taiwan formally declares independence[2][4].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- As of October 2022, there is no public US policy shift indicating readiness to establish formal diplomatic relations or appoint an ambassador to Taiwan in the event of a formal independence declaration[1][5].
- Chinese leaders have reiterated that a Taiwanese declaration of independence is a "red line" and have increased military preparations with 2027 and 2035 cited as potential milestones for reunification efforts[2][4].
- Taiwan’s leadership asserts that its current status is already that of a sovereign state, reducing pressure for a formal declaration, but the scenario assumes such a declaration occurs[5].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Official US government statements, Congressional records, and the US Department of State.
- Announcements from the American Institute in Taiwan.
- Major international news agencies and government press releases.
- Credible policy analysis from think tanks such as CSIS and academic sources.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- The situation is highly dynamic: a formal declaration may trigger unprecedented US and international responses, especially if accompanied by Chinese military action.
- US policy could change rapidly in response to broader geopolitical shifts or domestic political considerations.
- Reliable measurement depends on unambiguous public announcements and formal credentialing of an ambassador, as required by the resolution criteria.

## Probabilistic Assessment

Given the historical reluctance of the US to formally recognize Taiwan, the high cost of a diplomatic rupture with China, and the absence of any publicly signaled intent to change this posture as of October 2022, the probability that the US would appoint an ambassador to Taiwan within a year of a formal independence declaration—barring a major war or collapse in US-China relations—remains low.
