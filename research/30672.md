### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- New Zealand entered a whooping cough epidemic in November 2024, with cases rising sharply through the spring and early summer[1].
- Four-week case totals have increased: 179 cases (late August–September)[3], 215 cases (mid-October–early November)[2], and 263 cases (mid-October–mid-November)[1].
- The most recent available weekly figure is 77 cases for the week ending late November 2024[5].
- The cumulative total for 2024 surpassed 1,000 cases by the end of November[5].

### Recent Announcements and Policies

- On November 22, 2024, the Ministry of Health declared a national epidemic, triggering a coordinated response and renewed vaccination campaigns targeting infants and pregnant women[1][5].
- Public health messaging has intensified, urging timely immunization for babies and pregnant women to protect the most vulnerable[5].

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The Institute of Environmental Science and Research (ESR) Pertussis Dashboard and weekly/monthly reports are the primary sources for case counts[2][3][5].
- The Ministry of Health provides official announcements and epidemic declarations[1].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- The most recent weekly data is for late November 2024; no public data is available yet for weeks 51 and 52.
- Case numbers may be affected by reporting delays, changes in surveillance, or intensified case-finding during the epidemic.
- The impact of public health interventions post-epidemic declaration is not yet clear, and could either slow or accelerate case detection.

### Forecast Assessment

- If the weekly case count remains at or near 77, the two-week total for weeks 51 and 52 would be approximately 154, well below the 275–375 range.
- However, if the upward trend continues or accelerates (e.g., weekly cases rising to 140–190), the two-week total could fall within the target range.
- Based on available data, the most likely scenario is that the total for weeks 51 and 52 will be below 275, unless there is a significant and rapid increase in weekly cases in December.

### Conclusion

As of December 3, 2024, the best available evidence suggests that New Zealand is experiencing a significant whooping cough epidemic, with weekly cases rising but not yet at a level that would make 275–375 cases over two weeks the most probable outcome. However, continued acceleration could bring totals into this range, so close monitoring of ESR updates is warranted.
