## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Starlink has rapidly expanded its African footprint since 2023, launching in Nigeria, Mozambique, Zambia, Kenya, Botswana, Malawi, and most recently, Niger in March 2025[4].
- For countries like Niger, Starlink’s progression from regulatory approval to listed website availability has usually taken between one and four months[1][4].
- Chad approved Starlink’s license in November 2024, following prolonged negotiations which concluded with the formal signing in March 2025[1][3][5].

## 2. Recent Announcements and Policies

- Chad’s Ministry of Telecommunications announced the signing of Starlink’s operating license in March 2025, stating that the agreement had been in the works since 2021 and had required “extensive discussions” to secure compliance with national requirements[1][3][5].
- Starlink’s expansion strategy in Africa is characterized by swift operational rollouts post-approval—Niger, for example, saw live service and website listing within roughly four months of agreement[1][4].
- No recent public reports indicate further regulatory delays in Chad since the March 2025 announcement.

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The most authoritative source for resolution is the [Starlink Availability Map](https://www.starlink.com/us/map), which must show any part of Chad as "Available" before July 1, 2025.
- Official statements from Chad’s Ministry of Telecommunications, SpaceX/Starlink press releases, and reputable industry news (e.g., Developing Telecoms, Statista, TechCabal) confirm the licensing timeline and expansion pace[1][2][4][5].

## 4. Limitations or Uncertainties

- Website listing may lag behind regulatory approval or even initial hardware shipments, depending on backend technical or regulatory finalizations.
- While the historical pattern suggests a launch window within a few months post-license, there is always a risk of unforeseen delays—such as infrastructure, customs, or last-minute compliance issues.
- Chad’s unique regulatory environment, while now apparently resolved, could still pose practical hurdles to a full operational launch and website update[1][5].

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given:
- License finalization in March 2025
- Starlink’s demonstrated pace of rollout in similar African markets (1–4 months)
- No public indication of new regulatory obstacles

It is **highly probable** (estimated at 80–90%) that the Starlink website will show Chad as "Available" before July 1, 2025. However, a small risk remains due to potential operational or technical delays between regulatory approval and the update of the online availability map.
