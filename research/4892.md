**Key Historical Trends and Current Status**  
The transformer architecture, introduced in 2017, quickly became the foundation for nearly all state-of-the-art language models, replacing prior RNN and LSTM approaches[5]. By 2020, transformer-based models like BERT and GPT-3 dominated NLP benchmarks, and this dominance has continued through 2025. As of early 2025, virtually all leading large language models—including those considered at the forefront of generative AI—are built on transformer-derived architectures[1][2][3][5]. These models excel at a wide range of language tasks, and continued enhancements (such as scaling, efficiency improvements, and hybridization) remain rooted in the transformer paradigm[1][5].

**Recent Announcements and Trends**  
Recent overviews and industry analyses in 2025 confirm that transformer models remain fundamental in both research and production-level NLP applications[1][2][3][5]. There is ongoing innovation—such as efficiency improvements and the introduction of hybrid models—but these advances still cite the transformer as a core component or principal inspiration. No radically new architecture has overtaken transformers for language modeling in terms of performance or adoption as of May 2025[1][2][5].

**Authoritative Sources for Verification**  
To formally resolve the forecast in December 2025 per the provided criteria, two possible avenues exist:
- A Google Scholar search for "language model 'state of the art'" among 2025 papers: if at least two of the top five papers describe a transformer-derived model achieving state-of-the-art performance, the answer is "yes."
- The top entry for the WikiText-2 benchmark on the referenced NLP progress tracking page must list a transformer-derived model.

**Limitations and Uncertainties**  
- The forecast is constrained by information available as of May 2025; disruptive advances occurring after this date are not captured.
- Community consensus and benchmark leadership could change rapidly if a breakthrough occurs, but as of the latest data, no such shift is apparent.

**Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment**  
Given the dominance and continued advancement of transformer-derived architectures as of early 2025—with no major displacement evident—it is highly probable (estimated at >90%) that transformer-derived architectures will still be considered state-of-the-art for language modeling in December 2025, according to both the scholarly and benchmark-based resolution criteria.
