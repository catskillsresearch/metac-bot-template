I notice that this query specifically requests information available as of July 27, 2020, to help forecast whether transformer-derived architectures will still be state-of-the-art for language modeling in December 2025. However, the search results provided contain information from 2024-2025, not from 2020.

Based on the current information available (as of May 26, 2025), transformer architectures appear to still be dominant in language modeling. Recent sources from early 2025 indicate that transformer architecture has remained remarkably consistent over nearly a decade since its introduction in 2017[5]. The most cutting-edge models from companies like OpenAI and DeepSeek would still look familiar to NLP engineers from 2017[5].

Current research continues to focus on transformer-based language models[4], with refinements to the architecture proving significant in improving model quality, stability, and efficiency[5]. As of January 2025, large language models based on transformer architecture are described as "the most relevant" in the field[3].

However, I cannot provide a forecast based on information available as of July 27, 2020, as requested in the query, since the search results do not contain historical information from that time period. To properly answer this forecasting question as specified, I would need access to research papers, trend analyses, and expert opinions from mid-2020 regarding the trajectory of transformer architecture development.

For a complete forecasting analysis as requested, I would need historical context from 2020 that would allow comparison to reference cases, identification of key differences affecting the forecast, and generation of an adjusted probabilistic assessment.
