**Key Historical Trends and Current Status**

- In 2015, 29.9% of American 18-24 year-olds were enrolled in four-year colleges, continuing a decades-long trend of increasing enrollment rates[3].
- Since 2015, overall college enrollment for 18-24 year-olds has modestly declined. For example, the overall college enrollment rate for this age group was 39% in 2022, down from 41% in 2012[3]. (Note: This figure includes both two-year and four-year colleges.)
- Recent years have seen a notable rebound in overall college enrollment, but much of this recovery is concentrated in community colleges (two-year programs), not four-year institutions[5]. In Spring 2025, undergraduate enrollment grew 3.5%, but total numbers remain below pre-pandemic levels[1].
- Total undergraduate enrollment is projected to increase by 9% between 2021 and 2031, but again, this includes all types of undergraduate institutions[2].

**Key Differences Affecting the Forecast**

- Growth in enrollment since the pandemic is driven primarily by community colleges, with a 4.7% rise noted in 2025, compared to less robust growth for four-year colleges[5].
- The proportion of 18-24 year-olds specifically attending four-year colleges may thus be stagnant or declining, even if total undergraduate numbers improve.
- Demographic shifts (e.g., declining birth rates), rising college costs, and increased interest in alternative education or workforce entry could further suppress four-year college enrollment rates among young adults.

**Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment**

Given:
- The 2015 benchmark (29.9%),
- The 10% reduction threshold (26.91%),
- Recent data showing only modest overall declines in enrollment rates for 18-24 year-olds,
- And the specific trend of faster growth in two-year college enrollment versus four-year colleges,

It is plausible that the fraction of 18-24 year-olds enrolled in four-year colleges in 2025 is lower than in 2015, but a drop of 10% or more (i.e., to 26.91% or less) is unlikely based on current trends. The overall decline has not been rapid or steep enough to suggest such a sharp drop unless there is a dramatic, unanticipated shift in the next data release.

**Assessment**: The probability that the 2025 rate is at least 10% lower than the 2015 rate (i.e., ≤26.91%) is low—likely less than 20%—given available data as of May 2025.

**Limitations and Uncertainties**

- The most current and granular data (specifically for 18-24 year-olds enrolled in four-year institutions) for 2025 may not yet be fully available.
- Some sources report aggregate undergraduate or total college enrollment, not broken down by age or institution type.
- Future policy or economic shocks could still influence the final 2025 numbers.
