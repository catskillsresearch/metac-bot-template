# Forecasting Analysis: College Enrollment Rates for 18-24 Year-Olds

As of May 2025, I'll analyze the likelihood that the fraction of American 18-24 year-olds enrolled in traditional four-year colleges in 2025 will be ≥10% less than the 2015 rate of 29.9% (which would mean 26.91% or lower).

## Current Enrollment Trends

The overall college enrollment rate for 18- to 24-year-olds was lower in 2022 than a decade earlier in 2012, standing at 39% compared to 41%[2]. This indicates a slight downward trend in the percentage of young adults attending college over that period.

However, more recent data shows positive momentum in college enrollment:

- Total postsecondary enrollment increased by 4.5% in fall 2023[4]
- Undergraduate enrollment specifically saw a 2.5% increase in spring 2024[5]
- The number of college students in the United States is estimated to reach 19.25 million in 2025[5]

## Projections and Analysis

The National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) projects that total undergraduate enrollment will increase by 9% between 2021 and 2031[1]. This suggests a reversal of the previous downward trend and indicates growth in the college-going population.

Freshman enrollment has been growing at a faster rate than overall undergraduate enrollment, with community colleges reporting a 6.2% increase and predominantly Black institutions seeing an 11.0% jump in freshman enrollment[5].

Looking specifically at institutional distribution:
- 13.14 million students were enrolled in public institutions
- 4.87 million were enrolled in private institutions[5]

Additionally, there has been a significant shift toward online education, with approximately 30% of students enrolled exclusively in online courses[5].

## Assessment of Likelihood

Based on the available data, it appears unlikely that the fraction of American 18-24 year-olds enrolled in traditional four-year colleges in 2025 will be ≥10% less than the 2015 rate. While there was a slight decline between 2012 and 2022, more recent trends show enrollment increases across various metrics.

The projected growth in undergraduate enrollment (9% between 2021 and 2031)[1] and the current estimated total of 19.25 million college students in 2025[5] suggest that enrollment rates are rebounding rather than continuing to decline.

However, there are limitations to this assessment:
1. The search results don't provide the specific percentage of 18-24 year-olds enrolled specifically in traditional four-year colleges in 2025
2. The growth in online education may be shifting enrollment patterns away from traditional four-year programs
3. The data includes all types of postsecondary institutions, not just four-year colleges

In conclusion, while we cannot provide an exact percentage for 2025, the available data suggests that college enrollment among 18-24 year-olds is increasing rather than decreasing significantly, making it unlikely that the rate would fall below 26.91% (which would represent a ≥10% decrease from the 2015 rate of 29.9%).
