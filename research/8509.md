As a forecasting analyst examining Meta's trajectory toward 1 billion daily active users on "screenless" platforms by December 31, 2031, I'll analyze current data, growth trends, and market factors to generate a probabilistic assessment.

## Current User Base Analysis

Meta continues to dominate the social media landscape with substantial user numbers across its family of apps. As of May 2025, Meta's family of products (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger) reaches approximately 3.43 billion daily active users (DAUs)[1]. Facebook alone maintains 2.11 billion DAUs[3], showing consistent growth from the 1.93 billion reported in Q3 2021.

This represents:
- 68.85% of monthly users logging in daily[3]
- 39.07% of global active internet users accessing Facebook daily[3]
- 26.31% of the world's total population using Facebook daily[3]

Between Q4 2023 and early 2025, Facebook's DAUs grew from 2.1 billion to 2.11 billion, indicating a slowing but still positive growth trajectory for the traditional platform[2][3].

## AR/VR Market Evolution

The resolution criteria specifically focuses on "screenless" platformsâ€”primarily AR and VR technologies. As of November 2021, Mark Zuckerberg projected reaching 1 billion people within a decade through Meta's AR/VR initiatives. Let's examine the progression:

**Historical Reference Points:**
- In 2020, there were approximately 0.6 billion worldwide mobile AR users
- In 2018, 59.5 million people used AR monthly in the United States, with projections of 95 million users by 2022

**Current Growth Factors:**
- Meta has intensified investment in its Reality Labs division since the 2021 rebrand
- The company's "family" approach to products suggests they'll leverage existing network effects to drive adoption
- The 6.51% year-over-year increase in daily active people across Meta's products demonstrates continued platform growth potential[3]

## Forecast Challenges

Several factors complicate this forecast:

1. **Technology Adoption Curve**: AR/VR technology follows the classic S-curve adoption pattern, currently still in early-adopter phase rather than mass market

2. **Hardware Limitations**: Reaching 1 billion users requires significant advances in:
   - Device affordability
   - Form factor improvements
   - Battery life extension
   - Content ecosystem development

3. **Competition**: Apple, Google, Microsoft, and others are developing competing AR/VR platforms

4. **User Behavior Shift**: Moving from screen-based to screenless interfaces represents a fundamental behavior change

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on current data and trends, I estimate the following probability distribution for Meta reaching 1 billion daily active users on screenless platforms by December 31, 2031:

- **35-40% probability of success** - This assessment balances Meta's demonstrated ability to scale platforms against the significant technological and behavioral barriers to mass AR/VR adoption.

**Key supporting factors:**
- Meta's existing 3.43 billion daily active users across its family of products provides a massive potential conversion base[1]
- Meta's continued user growth demonstrates platform expansion capabilities, with a 5.5% year-over-year increase in Facebook DAUs[3]
- 98.5% of current Facebook users access via mobile devices, indicating comfort with evolving form factors[3]

**Key limiting factors:**
- The current growth rate of Facebook's traditional platform is showing signs of deceleration
- The gap between current AR/VR adoption and the 1 billion target remains substantial
- Hardware development cycles may constrain the pace of adoption

## Conclusion

While Meta has demonstrated remarkable ability to scale platforms to billions of users, reaching 1 billion daily active users on screenless platforms by 2031 represents a significantly more challenging goal than their previous scaling achievements. The probability of success hinges on technological breakthroughs, hardware cost reduction, and Meta's ability to create compelling use cases that drive daily engagement in AR/VR environments.

The trajectory over the next 2-3 years will be particularly telling, as Meta needs to demonstrate accelerating adoption rates by 2028 to have a realistic path to the 1 billion user milestone by the target date.
