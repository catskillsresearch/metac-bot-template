## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- No U.S. president has been a declared vegetarian or vegan while in office. Thomas Jefferson had a preference for plant-based foods but was not strictly vegetarian[1][4]. Bill Clinton adopted a mostly vegan diet post-presidency, sometimes consuming fish, but was not vegetarian during his term[3][5].
- Several U.S. politicians, including Cory Booker (vegan), Dennis Kucinich (vegan), and Ben Carson (vegetarian), have run for president but have not been elected[2].
- The U.S. population adopting vegetarian diets has gradually increased, and plant-based diets are more visible in public discourse.

## 2. Recent Announcements and Policies

- As of late 2019, there were no major policy changes or announcements making a vegetarian U.S. president imminent.
- Cory Booker, a vegan U.S. senator, was a 2020 presidential candidate, indicating increased visibility for plant-based diets in high-profile politics, but he did not win the nomination[2].
- Former President Bill Clinton publicly credited a vegan diet for improved health after leaving office, but this occurred post-presidency and was not strictly adhered to[3][5].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Bill Clinton's dietary habits and statements: The Hill, Politico, animal advocacy organizations, and his own public interviews[3][5].
- List of vegetarian politicians and presidential candidates: Wikipedia and news profiles[2].
- Historical eating habits of presidents: Food Timeline, VeganMed[1][4].

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- Forecasting future presidents' dietary habits is inherently uncertain due to the very small sample size, the unpredictability of candidates, and the fact that dietary choices may change or not be publicly disclosed.
- A claim of vegetarianism by a sitting president is required for resolution, and public statements may not always reflect actual behavior.
- The growing popularity of vegetarianism and veganism among public figures may marginally increase the probability, but the absence of a historical precedent suggests the event remains unlikely by 2036.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

- Given the lack of historical precedent, the increased but still limited incidence of vegetarianism among high-profile politicians, and the slow but steady growth in public acceptance, the probability of a sitting U.S. president being vegetarian by the end of 2036 remains low, but is slightly higher than in previous decades. A reasonable estimate, as of 2019, might place the probability in the 2â€“8% range, reflecting both the persistent rarity and the modest upward trend.
