# Forecasting Human-to-Human Transmission of H5N1 Before September 30, 2024

Based on available information as of the knowledge cutoff date, here's an analysis to help forecast whether human-to-human transmission of H5N1 will be reported before September 30, 2024.

## Current Status and Historical Trends

As of June 2024, three human cases of HPAI A(H5N1) virus infection in dairy farm workers were reported during April and May 2024 in the United States[1]. One case was reported in April 2024 in an adult dairy farm worker in Texas who worked at a farm with sick cows presumed to be infected with HPAI A(H5N1) virus[1]. The worker experienced only conjunctivitis without other symptoms, and virus detection confirmed clade 2.3.4.4b, genotype B3.13[1].

From 2003 to April 1, 2024, a total of 889 cases and 463 deaths (case fatality rate of 52%) caused by influenza A(H5N1) virus have been reported worldwide across 23 countries[2]. The most recent case prior to the Texas case was reported in March 2024 in Vietnam, and the Texas case was the fourth reported in the Americas region[2].

Importantly, most human cases of HPAI A(H5N1) reported since January 2022 had recent exposure to sick or dead poultry, and **no cases of human-to-human HPAI A(H5N1) virus transmission were identified**[1]. This is a critical point for forecasting the likelihood of human-to-human transmission in the coming months.

## Recent Developments and Risk Assessments

On March 29, 2024, HPAI was confirmed in a Michigan dairy herd that had received cows from Texas[3]. This indicates ongoing spread among cattle, which represents a potential source of human exposure.

The CDC has stated that the H5N1 infection in the Texas patient "does not change the H5N1 bird flu human health risk assessment for the U.S. general public, which CDC considers to be low"[3]. Similarly, Texas health authorities noted that "avian influenza A(H5N1) viruses have only rarely been transmitted from person to person. As such, the risk to the general public is believed to be low"[4].

Of the seven cases of clade 2.3.4.4b HPAI A(H5N1) virus infection with conjunctivitis or respiratory illness reported globally (excluding one case with fatigue only), four had severe or critical illness (57%), and one of those four died (25%)[1]. This indicates that while human infections remain rare, they can be serious when they occur.

## Preparedness Measures

Preliminary analysis of A(H5N1) viruses has not found changes that would make these viruses resistant to current FDA-approved flu antiviral medications, suggesting these medications would be effective if human cases increase[3]. Additionally, candidate vaccine viruses developed against related clade 2.3.4.4b viruses are available for vaccine manufacturing if necessary, and preliminary analysis indicates they may provide reasonable protection against H5N1 influenza viruses[3].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors create uncertainty in forecasting human-to-human transmission:

1. The recent spread of H5N1 to dairy cattle represents a new pathway for potential human exposure that wasn't significant in previous years.

2. Genome sequencing of the virus from the Texas case "didn't show new mutations possibly associated with increased transmission to humans"[2], but viral evolution is ongoing and unpredictable.

3. The full spectrum of illness caused by current H5N1 bird flu viruses in humans remains unknown, which could affect detection rates if mild cases go unreported.

## Conclusion

Based on current evidence, human-to-human transmission of H5N1 remains rare to non-existent with contemporary strains. No human-to-human transmission has been reported with the current circulating viruses, and all recent human cases have had direct exposure to infected animals. While the situation requires continued monitoring, especially with the virus's spread to dairy cattle, the available data suggests that human-to-human transmission before September 30, 2024, would represent a significant departure from current patterns.
