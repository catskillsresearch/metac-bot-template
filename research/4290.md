## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- NAD+ boosters (like NR, NMN) reliably extend lifespan in yeast, worms, and mice, with up to 16% extension in worms and about 5% in mice, even when started late in life[2][5].
- In humans, clinical trials have shown NAD+ boosters increase NAD+ levels safely and may modestly improve biomarkers (such as cardiac health), but there is currently no direct evidence of increased human lifespan or healthspan[1][3][4].
- As of 2025, human studies remain focused on surrogate outcomes rather than actual longevity measures. A recent review explicitly states that evidence for healthspan or lifespan extension in humans is lacking[3][4].

## 2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- Recent trials (2024–2025) confirm strong NAD+ boosting in humans but continue to report limited evidence on aging or lifespan outcomes[1][3].
- There are calls for more long-term studies, but no major policy shift or funding surge targeting multi-decade human lifespan trials is reported[3].
- No systematic review to date has concluded that NAD+ boosters extend human lifespan by ≥5%[3][4].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Peer-reviewed clinical trial results and systematic reviews in medRxiv and PubMed[1][3].
- NutritionFacts.org and News-Medical.net for science communication and review of evidence[2][4].

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- Human lifespan trials require decades; current and foreseeable studies focus on short-term biomarkers, not direct lifespan measurement.
- Systematic reviews depend on the existence of suitable clinical trial data—none currently provide direct lifespan measurements in humans.
- There is a risk of over-extrapolating animal data; many interventions (e.g., resveratrol, caloric restriction mimetics) showed promise in animals but not in humans.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given:
- No current or imminent human trial demonstrates ≥5% lifespan extension from NAD+ boosters.
- Systematic reviews rely on published human trial data, which is unlikely to shift dramatically by 2030 based on the current trajectory.
- The logistical and ethical hurdles to running direct lifespan trials in humans.

**Probability that a systematic review by 2030 will conclude that NAD+ boosters increase human lifespan by ≥5%: Very low (<5%).**
