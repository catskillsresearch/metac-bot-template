## Key Historical Trends and Current Status
- **Historical Cooperation**: The U.S.-India 123 Agreement has fostered civil nuclear cooperation but excludes sensitive military technologies like nuclear submarine propulsion[5].
- **Current Developments**: India is enhancing its nuclear submarine capabilities with indigenous projects and potentially integrating advanced U.S. sensors, though not nuclear propulsion technology[4].
- **Strategic Relationships**: India's reliance on Russian military hardware and its indigenous nuclear submarine program suggest that direct U.S. nuclear submarine technology transfer remains unlikely[1].

## Recent Announcements/Policies
- **Defense Cooperation**: The U.S. is considering providing advanced sensor technology to India's nuclear submarines, enhancing their capabilities but not directly involving nuclear submarine technology[4].
- **Policy Shifts**: No recent policy announcements suggest a change in U.S. laws regarding the sharing of nuclear propulsion technology with allies[5].

## Authoritative Sources
- The U.S.-India Civil Nuclear Agreement details the framework for civil nuclear cooperation but excludes military applications[5].
- Recent reports on India's submarine program highlight advancements through indigenous efforts and potential U.S. sensor technology integration[4].

## Limitations or Uncertainties
- The U.S. legal framework limits the sharing of nuclear propulsion technology, creating uncertainty about future changes[5].
- India's continued reliance on Russian military supplies and indigenous submarine development suggests a low likelihood of immediate U.S. nuclear submarine offerings[1].

## Probabilistic Assessment
Given the historical context and current developments, the probability of the U.S. offering India a nuclear submarine before 2026 appears low, primarily due to legal restrictions and strategic priorities.
