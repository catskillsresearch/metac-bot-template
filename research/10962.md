## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of June 2022, approximately 60% of India’s military hardware was sourced from Russia or the former Soviet Union, including most of its conventional and nuclear-powered submarines[1].
- The only Indian-built nuclear submarine in service at that time was the INS Arihant, with other nuclear submarines either leased from Russia or of Russian origin.
- The U.S. has historically maintained strict controls on nuclear submarine propulsion technology, only sharing it with the UK (since the 1958 Mutual Defence Agreement) and, in a major policy exception, with Australia under the AUKUS agreement announced in September 2021. Even this deal was widely recognized as extraordinary and not indicative of a broader policy shift[1].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- The U.S.–India Civil Nuclear Agreement (the “123 Agreement”) enables civil nuclear cooperation but explicitly does not permit the transfer of sensitive nuclear technologies such as reactor-grade enrichment, reprocessing, or nuclear submarine propulsion technology[5].
- As of February 2025, U.S.-India joint statements focus on furthering civil nuclear energy cooperation, but there is no mention of military nuclear propulsion or submarine technology transfers[1].
- India's recent submarine procurement activities as of early 2025 involve partnerships with Germany for new diesel-electric submarines and with France for civil and small modular reactor technology—none of which involve U.S. military nuclear propulsion[2][4].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- White House Joint Leaders’ Statement (February 2025) confirms ongoing civil nuclear cooperation but no mention of military nuclear technology transfer to India[1].
- Nuclear Threat Initiative and The Diplomat provide up-to-date coverage of India’s evolving nuclear and submarine capabilities, all consistent with the absence of U.S.-India military nuclear submarine cooperation[2][4].
- The Wikipedia summary of the U.S.-India Civil Nuclear Agreement highlights the legal exclusions that would still apply as of 2025[5].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- The primary uncertainty is the possibility of a sudden, unprecedented shift in U.S. export control laws or policy, but no evidence as of May 2025 suggests this is imminent.
- Measurement is limited to public, formal agreements; any covert or informal cooperation would not satisfy the resolution criteria.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the above, the probability that the U.S. will publicly offer to build, design, lease, or sell a nuclear-powered submarine to India before 2026 remains extremely low—significantly less than 5%. No credible policy, legal, or diplomatic developments suggest that such an offer is likely before the deadline.
