# Forecasting Eric Adams' Status as NYC Mayor on January 1, 2025

Based on the available information as of October 25, 2024, I can provide the following insights to help forecast whether Eric Adams will be Mayor of New York City on January 1, 2025.

## Current Status and Recent Activities

As of September 16, 2024, Eric Adams was actively serving as the Mayor of New York City. On this date, he delivered an update on the FY24 Mayor's Management Report at City Hall in Lower Manhattan[2]. During this update, Mayor Adams highlighted his administration's accomplishments, including doubling the number of affordable housing units built and helping more New Yorkers in shelters get into permanent housing[2].

Earlier in 2024, specifically on January 24, Mayor Adams delivered his third State of the City address at Hostos Community College in the Bronx[1]. In this address, he outlined a "future-focused vision for working-class New Yorkers" and discussed his administration's achievements over the previous two years, including crime reduction and job growth[1][3].

During his State of the City address, Adams emphasized that New York City had reached 4.1 million private-sector jobs, recovering all jobs lost during the pandemic more than a year ahead of projections[3]. He also highlighted that one in six New York City businesses had opened since the start of his administration[3].

## Administration's Stated Priorities and Ongoing Initiatives

Mayor Adams has consistently articulated three main priorities for his administration:

1. Protecting public safety
2. Rebuilding the economy
3. Making the city more livable for all New Yorkers[1][3]

His administration has announced several initiatives for 2024, including:

- Establishing a Department of Sustainable Delivery
- Supporting 400,000 green economy jobs
- Building new housing on public land
- Expanding the New York City Reads program
- Investing in clean, dynamic public spaces
- Protecting New York City from climate change[1]

## Limitations of Available Information

The available information is limited to official mayoral activities and announcements up to September 16, 2024. The search results do not contain information about any legal challenges, investigations, or political developments that might affect Adams' status as mayor beyond this date.

Without more recent information about the mayor's status, potential legal issues, or political developments, it is difficult to make a comprehensive assessment of whether Eric Adams will remain Mayor of New York City on January 1, 2025.
