## Key Trends and Current Status

- Argentina's YoY inflation rate fell from 211% (December 2023) and a peak of 292% (April 2024) to 47.3% by April 2025, marking the lowest level in four years[4].
- Monthly inflation rates dropped steadily, reaching 2.2%–2.8% in early 2025[4][5].

## Recent Policy Actions and Projections

- President Milei's administration enacted strict monetary and fiscal reforms: targeting a zero deficit, eliminating Central Bank financing of the government, and cutting subsidies[5].
- A managed floating exchange rate regime and a new IMF agreement stabilized inflation expectations[4].
- The Central Bank's Market Expectations Survey and independent experts now project YoY inflation for 2025 as low as 23.3%[5]. BBVA Research forecasts 30%, and Trading Economics projects 25% for 2026, implying a falling trend[1][3][5].

## Comparison to Reference Cases and Key Differences

| Forecast Source                | YoY Inflation for Dec 2025 |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Central Bank Market Survey     | 23.3%                     |
| BBVA Research                  | 30% (end-2025)            |
| Trading Economics (2026 proj.) | 25%                       |
| IMF (late 2024)                | 62.7%                     |

- Earlier IMF forecasts are now well above current trends, possibly lagging the rapid disinflation[2].
- Domestic and private-sector projections, which incorporate the latest data, are more optimistic.
- Market and expert consensus is converging on a sub-30% inflation outcome, barring new shocks.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- Although the trend is sharply downward, Argentina's inflation is still susceptible to external shocks, policy reversals, or renewed peso volatility.
- Official INDEC data will be the resolution source, and current projections are based on the latest available data.

## Probabilistic Assessment

Given:
- The rapid downward trend in monthly and annual inflation,
- The strong consensus among current domestic and private-sector forecasts,
- The ongoing commitment to tight fiscal and monetary policy,

**It is now probable (estimated 70–80% likelihood) that Argentina's YoY inflation rate will be below 30% for December 2025, barring an unforeseen macroeconomic shock or policy reversal.**[3][4][5]
