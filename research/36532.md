# Forecasting Analysis: BP vs. Shell Share Price Performance (June-July 2025)

As of May 26, 2025, I'll analyze whether BP's share price is likely to outperform Shell's through June and July 2025, based on current market conditions, recent financial performance, and strategic developments.

## Current Market Positioning

Shell and BP are currently following divergent trajectories in a challenging energy market environment. Recent financial results show Shell significantly outperforming BP:

- Shell reported Q1 2025 net income of $4.78 billion, exceeding analyst expectations despite a 35% year-over-year decline due to lower oil prices and refining margins[5]
- BP reported a more substantial 49% drop in Q1 2025 profits to $1.38 billion, down from $2.72 billion in Q1 2024[5]
- Shell has outperformed BP by approximately 7% year-to-date as of early May 2025[5]

The correlation between the two stocks is currently 0.33, considered low, suggesting their price movements are not closely related despite being in the same industry[1].

## Key Factors Affecting Near-Term Performance

Several factors will likely influence the relative performance of these energy giants through June-July 2025:

### Capital Allocation & Shareholder Returns

- Shell announced a $3.5 billion share buyback for Q1 2025, marking its 14th consecutive quarter of significant repurchases[5]
- BP reduced its share buyback program to $750 million and has seen its net debt rise to nearly $27 billion[5]
- The substantial difference in buyback programs (Shell's is 4.7x larger) signals stronger shareholder return potential for Shell in the immediate term

### Strategic Direction

Shell is pursuing modest growth in its upstream and integrated gas segments with a targeted 1% annual increase through 2030, while revising carbon reduction targets[5]. This balanced approach appears to be resonating with investors in the current market environment.

### Activist Investor Influence

In February 2025, activist investor Elliott Investment Management announced a 5% stake in BP, pushing for:
- Cost reductions in renewable energy investments
- Non-core asset divestments
- Refocused capital allocation priorities to boost shareholder returns
- A strategic shift to make BP more like other oil majors, including Shell[3]

While Elliott's involvement could eventually drive positive changes for BP, the implementation timeline suggests these benefits may not fully materialize during the June-July 2025 period.

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on current trends and available information, I assess:

- **Low probability (20-30%)** that BP will outperform Shell during June-July 2025
- **Medium probability (70-80%)** that Shell will continue to outperform BP

### Key Supporting Factors:

1. Shell's significantly stronger recent financial performance and shareholder returns
2. BP's higher debt levels constraining financial flexibility
3. The gap between the companies has been widening since recent earnings announcements[5]
4. While Elliott's activist position in BP creates potential upside, meaningful operational improvements typically require multiple quarters to implement and reflect in share price

### Potential Catalysts That Could Favor BP:

1. Accelerated implementation of Elliott's proposed strategy changes
2. Unexpected positive developments in BP's renewable energy investments
3. Asset sales or debt reduction announcements that exceed market expectations
4. Negative news specific to Shell's operations or strategy

## Limitations and Uncertainties

This forecast faces several limitations:
- Energy markets remain volatile and subject to geopolitical disruptions
- The full details of BP's response to Elliott's activism are still developing
- Commodity price fluctuations could disproportionately impact either company
- The forecast window (June-July 2025) is relatively short for fundamental changes to manifest in share prices

Given Shell's current momentum, stronger financial position, and more market-aligned strategy, the evidence suggests Shell is more likely to maintain its outperformance relative to BP through the June-July 2025 period.
