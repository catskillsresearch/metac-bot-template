# Forecasting Analysis: Will Emmanuel Macron cease being President before 2027?

As of March 28, 2023, Emmanuel Macron is serving his second term as President of France after winning reelection in 2022. His current term is scheduled to end in 2027, and he is constitutionally barred from seeking a third consecutive term. This analysis examines factors that could lead to an early departure from office.

## Current Political Situation

Emmanuel Macron is currently facing one of the most significant challenges of his presidency. In March 2023, he pushed through controversial pension reforms using Article 49.3 of the French Constitution, bypassing a final vote in the National Assembly. This has triggered:

- Nationwide protests with over one million participants
- Significant street violence
- A sharp drop in approval ratings to around 28%
- Explicit calls for his resignation from protesters

The pension reform, which raises the retirement age from 62 to 64, has become a flashpoint for broader dissatisfaction with Macron's governing style and policies. The use of Article 49.3 has been particularly controversial, as it's perceived as circumventing democratic processes.

## Historical Precedents

While rare, there is precedent for French presidents not completing their terms:

- Charles de Gaulle resigned in 1969 following a failed referendum, preferring to step down rather than govern with diminished authority
- Other presidents have faced "cohabitation" periods (governing alongside opposition prime ministers) rather than resigning

The French Fifth Republic has generally provided stable presidential tenures, but significant public opposition can create governance challenges that might make continuing in office untenable.

## Constitutional Mechanisms

Several mechanisms could lead to Macron leaving office before 2027:

1. **Voluntary resignation**: The president can resign at any time, as de Gaulle did
2. **Impeachment**: Article 68 of the French Constitution allows for removal for "breach of duties manifestly incompatible with the exercise of his mandate"
3. **Health reasons**: Incapacitation could lead to the Constitutional Council declaring the presidency vacant

Of these, voluntary resignation appears most plausible given current circumstances.

## Political Factors

Key factors that may influence Macron's ability to complete his term include:

- **Parliamentary dynamics**: Macron's Renaissance party lacks an absolute majority in the National Assembly, forcing him to build coalitions for legislation
- **Public opinion trends**: Sustained low approval ratings make governance increasingly difficult
- **Election cycles**: The 2024 European Parliament elections and 2026 legislative elections will serve as referendums on his presidency
- **Alternative leadership**: The emergence of viable alternative leaders could increase pressure for early departure
- **Success of reforms**: If pension reforms ultimately gain acceptance, Macron's position could stabilize

## Assessment and Forecast

Based on information available as of March 28, 2023, several factors suggest an increased probability of Macron not completing his term:

1. The severity and breadth of current protests exceed typical French political demonstrations
2. His use of Article 49.3 has created a legitimacy crisis that may be difficult to overcome
3. Without a parliamentary majority, governing effectively will remain challenging
4. Historical precedent (de Gaulle) suggests resignation is possible when a president's authority is severely undermined

However, counterbalancing factors include:

1. Macron has demonstrated resilience through previous crises (Yellow Vest protests)
2. The French presidency has significant constitutional powers that can be exercised even with low popularity
3. The lack of a clear alternative leader reduces pressure for immediate change
4. Time may allow for the pension controversy to subside

The most likely scenarios for early departure include:
- A voluntary resignation following devastating results in the 2024 European elections
- Resignation if legislative elections produce an ungovernable parliament
- Stepping down in favor of a chosen successor to avoid a more chaotic transition

Given the information available as of March 2023, there appears to be a moderate probability that Macron will not complete his term through 2027, though this remains a minority outcome compared to serving his full term.
