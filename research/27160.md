## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Diplomatic relations between the Philippines and China have sharply deteriorated in recent years, especially under President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., with both sides accusing each other of violating prior arrangements regarding the South China Sea[3].
- Tensions have escalated due to repeated confrontations at sea, including the use of water cannons, ramming, and other gray zone tactics by China to block Philippine resupply missions to disputed outposts[2][4].
- In July 2024, China and the Philippines reached an interim agreement aimed at reducing tensions, but both sides acknowledge that the deal is temporary and fundamental disagreements persist[1].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- The Philippines' national security adviser publicly called for the expulsion of Chinese diplomats in May 2024, following the leak of a confidential telephone transcript between a Philippine admiral and Chinese officials[3].
- Top Philippine defense officials have echoed calls for expulsions, citing alleged wiretapping and illegal activities by Chinese diplomats[3].
- Despite these calls, other senior officials within the Philippine government have advocated for continued diplomatic engagement, suggesting internal divisions on the appropriate response to Chinese actions[5].
- As of late July 2024, there is no official or credible report that either the Philippines or China has expelled or recalled diplomats in response to the ongoing disputes[1][3][5].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Official government statements from the Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs and the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
- Credible international news agencies and think tanks monitoring South China Sea developments, such as the United States Institute of Peace, Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, and Crisis Group[1][2][4].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- The situation remains highly volatile, and the risk of sudden escalation—including diplomatic expulsions or recalls—cannot be ruled out before September 30, 2024.
- Internal divisions within the Philippine government may delay or complicate any decision to expel or recall diplomats[5].
- Both sides have shown a preference for gray zone tactics and interim agreements rather than outright diplomatic breaks, but the breakdown in communications and rising mistrust could trigger more drastic measures[1][3].

## Conclusion

As of August 14, 2024, there are no confirmed reports of diplomatic expulsions or recalls between the Philippines and China. However, the risk remains elevated due to ongoing disputes, public calls for expulsions, and the breakdown in bilateral communications. The situation should be closely monitored for any official announcements or credible reports before September 30, 2024.
