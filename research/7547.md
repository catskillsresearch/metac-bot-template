## 1. Historical Trends and Current Status (as of 2021-07-31)

- As of July 2021, commercial farming of cows, pigs, and chickens for meat was legal and widespread in the US. The US was one of the world’s largest producers and consumers of meat, with animal agriculture deeply integrated into the economy.
- Major animal rights organizations, including Direct Action Everywhere (DxE), advocated for radical change, but their efforts were largely grassroots and had not translated into substantial legislative action at the state or federal level[1][3][5].
- No US state or federal law prohibited commercial animal farming for meat. Incremental reforms (e.g., animal welfare laws, bans on specific practices like gestation crates) were more common than outright bans.

## 2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- DxE, a leading activist group, updated its "roadmap to animal liberation" in mid-2021, moving its aspirational target for an Animal Bill of Rights (which includes banning animal farming) from 2055 to 2040[1].
- The roadmap envisions achieving a constitutional amendment or Supreme Court ruling to prohibit all animal farming, but this remains a long-term, highly ambitious goal and is not currently reflected in mainstream policy proposals[1][5].
- Grassroots advocacy was focused on "seed cities" like Berkeley, CA, aiming to create local momentum, but as of 2021, these efforts had not spread to state or national policy[3].

## 3. Key Differences from Reference Cases

- **Economic Entrenchment**: Unlike past bans (e.g., alcohol prohibition, slavery abolition), animal agriculture is a multi-billion dollar industry with significant political influence and rural economic importance.
- **Political Support**: There was no major political party or national movement endorsing a commercial meat farming ban as of 2021, in contrast to civil rights reforms or marriage equality, which eventually gained bipartisan backing.
- **Incrementalism**: Most legislative progress in animal welfare had been incremental (e.g., banning extreme confinement), rather than all-encompassing bans.
- **Activist Roadmaps vs. Policy Reality**: DxE’s projections are activist goals rather than indicators of legislative probability[1][5].

## 4. Probabilistic Assessment (Adjusted)

Given:
- The low legislative momentum for such a ban as of 2021,
- The massive economic and cultural role of animal agriculture,
- The activist nature (not legislative reality) of the 2040 target,
- The historical pace of comparable social change movements,

The probability that the US will prohibit commercial farming of cows, pigs, and chickens for meat before 2041 is extremely low—likely well below 5%, barring unforeseeable, transformative events.

## 5. Limitations and Uncertainties

- Unanticipated shifts in public opinion, technological alternatives (e.g., cellular meat), or global crises (e.g., pandemics linked to animal agriculture) could affect the trajectory, but as of 2021, such changes were speculative.
- The resolution criterion requires formal legal prohibition at the federal level, which is a high bar.
- Measurement is straightforward (legislation or constitutional ruling), but dependent on clear, unambiguous legal change.
