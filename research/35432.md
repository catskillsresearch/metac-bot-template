## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The share of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs, including BEVs and PHEVs) in U.S. light duty vehicle (LDV) sales has grown steadily, from under 3% in 2020 to above 10% by late 2024[5].
- According to Argonne National Laboratory, the PEV share was 10.86% in December 2024, with monthly figures in the second half of 2024 generally ranging from about 9.3% to 10.9%[5].
- The market saw record EV sales in 2024, with 1.3 million EVs sold, a 7.3% increase over 2023[2].

## Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Metric

- The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) continues to provide significant tax credits for EV buyers, supporting demand into early 2025[5].
- Major automakers are expanding hybrid offerings, but full EVs remain a key focus, and consumer anxiety about EVs is decreasing[2].
- Industry forecasts for 2025 vary: EV Volumes projects a 13.5% EV share for all U.S. light-vehicle sales in 2025, up from an estimated 10.3% in 2024[5]. Cox Automotive predicts full EVs will reach 10% of sales in 2025, with hybrids (including PHEVs) pushing the combined share higher[4].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Argonne National Laboratory’s Light Duty Electric Drive Vehicles Monthly Sales Update is the definitive source for the metric, publishing monthly PEV share data[5].
- Industry reports from Cox Automotive and EV Volumes provide projections and context for market trends[4][5].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- Monthly PEV share figures can fluctuate due to seasonality, supply chain issues, and consumer incentives.
- The February 2025 figure is not available as of the cutoff date; only historical data and projections can inform the forecast.
- Policy changes, such as potential alterations to IRA incentives, could impact future sales but are not expected to affect February 2025 data[5].

## Forecast Summary

Based on the most recent data (10.86% in December 2024) and industry forecasts, the electric vehicle sales share of light duty vehicles in the United States in February 2025 is likely to be in the range of 10.5% to 11.5%, assuming no major market disruptions. This reflects continued, but moderate, growth in EV adoption supported by ongoing incentives and consumer trends[4][5].
