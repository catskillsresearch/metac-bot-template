# Forecasting Texas Measles Cases by June 14, 2025

As of May 21, 2025, Texas is experiencing a significant measles outbreak that began in January. To forecast the expected number of cases by June 14, 2025, I'll analyze current data, recent trends, and relevant factors that may influence case growth.

## Current Status and Recent Trends

As of the latest reports, Texas has documented 717 measles cases from 32 counties that are part of the West Texas outbreak, plus an additional 15 cases in various counties not connected to the main outbreak, bringing the total to 732 cases[1][4].

The outbreak has shown signs of slowing in recent weeks:
- Between May 9 and mid-May 2025, Texas reported only 8 additional measles cases[1]
- The week leading up to May 16 saw just 9 new cases, which was noted as the lowest weekly increase since February[2]
- As of May 20, 2025, DSHS reported 15 additional measles cases, with Harris County (including Houston) leading in new infections[4]

The outbreak initially centered in Gaines County, which accounted for over half of all cases when the outbreak was at 624 cases in April[2]. The first case in this outbreak was identified on January 29, 2025, and by April, the outbreak had spread to 26 counties, with two fatalities reported among school-aged children[2].

## Factors Affecting Future Case Numbers

Several factors will influence the trajectory of this outbreak through mid-June:

**Containment Progress:**
- Two counties (Garza and Lynn) have already been removed from the list of active transmission areas after passing two incubation periods without new infectious cases[1]
- The state's response, including public education, testing, and vaccination clinics, had cost $4.5 million by April[2]

**Early Detection Systems:**
- Advanced surveillance methods are in place, including wastewater monitoring that successfully detected the measles virus in Houston before clinical cases were confirmed[1]
- This early warning system may help contain new clusters more efficiently

**Vaccination Rates:**
- The outbreak region has significant numbers of unvaccinated individuals[2]
- Health authorities continue to emphasize that receiving two doses of the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine is the most reliable prevention method[2]

**Virus Characteristics:**
- Measles is extremely contagious, with 90% of unvaccinated individuals likely to contract the disease if exposed[2]
- The virus can spread four days before symptoms appear and can remain airborne for up to two hours[2]

## Forecast Analysis

Based on the available data and recent trends, I project the following:

1. **Current Growth Rate:** The outbreak appears to be in a deceleration phase, with weekly new cases dropping from dozens to single digits.

2. **Time Period Analysis:** From May 21 to June 14 represents approximately 24 days or about 3.5 weeks.

3. **Projected Range:** If current trends continue:
   - Lower bound: Assuming continued deceleration to approximately 7-8 cases per week, we might expect 25-28 additional cases (732 + 25 = 757 total cases)
   - Upper bound: If containment efforts falter or new clusters emerge, we might see a return to 15-20 cases per week, resulting in 52-70 additional cases (732 + 70 = 802 total cases)

4. **Most Likely Scenario:** Given the consistent slowing of the outbreak and improved containment measures, I forecast that Texas will report approximately **770-780 total measles cases** by June 14, 2025.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors could significantly alter this forecast:

- Measles outbreaks can be unpredictable due to the virus's high contagiousness
- New clusters could emerge in areas with low vaccination rates
- Changes in public health response or resource allocation
- Reporting delays or changes in case definition
- Potential for imported cases from other states or countries

The forecast relies on the assumption that current containment strategies will continue to be effective and that no major new clusters will emerge in previously unaffected counties.
