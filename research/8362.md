## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Since the 1960s, US-China relations have grown increasingly tense, marked by strategic rivalry, trade disputes, and military competition, especially over Taiwan and the South China Sea[1][2].
- Despite rising tensions, there has been no direct large-scale conflict between the US and China, with both nations practicing cautious escalation management reminiscent of Cold War-era US-Soviet relations[3].
- Current trends point to the formation of global blocs aligned either with the US or China, but this division remains nascent as of early 2025[1].

## 2. Recent Announcements and Policies

- China is expanding its nuclear arsenal, targeting 1,500 operational warheads by 2035. This development heightens deterrence concerns but could also foster a stable mutual vulnerability, which historically has encouraged arms control and crisis management talks[3].
- The US defense community is increasingly focused on the risk of a Chinese move against Taiwan by 2027, but experts caution against treating this as a fixed timeline[5].
- Economically, both countries and their allies are working to reduce vulnerabilities and dependencies, reinforcing bloc formation but also increasing the costs and risks of open conflict[1].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Credible probabilities from expert prediction markets estimate roughly a 30% chance of a US-China war if a Taiwan invasion occurs, with slightly lower but still notable probabilities for war by 2035 overall[2].
- Major think tanks and academic institutions (e.g., Carnegie Endowment for International Peace) highlight both increased risks and the potential for deterrence to hold, especially if arms control and crisis communication channels are reinforced[3].

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- Forecasts are limited by the unpredictability of leadership decisions, accidental escalation, and global shocks (such as economic crises or technological breakthroughs).
- Measurement relies on open-source reporting and official statements, which may not capture covert operations or misreported incidents.
- The definition of "war" for this forecast (at least 1,000 battle-related deaths in a year directly between US and Chinese forces) sets a high threshold not reached in recent decades, further lowering the likelihood barring a major, sustained confrontation[4].

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given historical restraint, current deterrence dynamics, robust economic interdependence, and the high costs associated with war, the probability of a US-China war (as defined) before 2035 remains moderate but not high. Expert and market estimates suggest a likelihood in the range of 20â€“35%, with most forecasters leaning toward a negative (no war) resolution barring a dramatic escalation over Taiwan or similar flashpoints[2][3][4]. The situation should be monitored for sudden changes in political intent, military posturing, or crisis management breakdowns.
