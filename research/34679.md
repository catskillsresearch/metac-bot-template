# EU Gas Storage Capacity Forecast for February 12, 2025

To forecast the percentage of EU gas storage capacity that will be full on February 12, 2025, I'll analyze current trends, recent policies, and expert projections based on available data.

## Current Status and Recent Trends

As of January 23, 2025, EU gas storage levels had dropped to below 60% of capacity[2]. This represents a faster drawdown compared to previous years due to several factors:

- Cold weather across Europe has increased heating demand
- Strong gas demand in the power sector due to low wind generation
- The suspension of Russian gas flows to Europe via Ukraine on January 1, 2025, which has added to market tightness and triggered increased storage withdrawals[2]

At the rate of withdrawals observed in January 2025, the EU as a whole was projected to end January with storage sites filled to around 50%, which would align with the February 1 target[2].

## Regulatory Framework and Targets

The European Commission has established several key targets for gas storage in 2025:

- A binding EU target of 90% filling by November 1, 2025[1][4]
- Intermediate targets throughout 2025, including:
  - 50% by February 1, 2025 (raised from the previous 45% target)[2]
  - 30% by May 1, 2025[1]
  - Additional interim targets for July 1 and September 1, 2025[1]

These targets were established as part of the EU Gas Storage Regulation (EU/2022/1032), which has played a crucial role in ensuring sufficient gas availability since its adoption in June 2022[1].

## Expert Projections

Industry analysis from Commodity Insights projected that European storage sites would be approximately 48.5% full by the end of March 2025, which is about eight percentage points lower than the average for past years[3]. This suggests a continued gradual decline in storage levels throughout February and March.

## Forecast Considerations for February 12, 2025

Given that February 12 is approximately 11 days after the February 1 target date of 50% capacity, and considering the ongoing withdrawal trends due to winter demand, it's reasonable to expect the storage level to continue declining from the February 1 target.

The rate of decline will depend on:
1. Weather conditions in early February
2. Wind generation levels affecting gas demand for electricity
3. Industrial gas consumption patterns
4. Any potential supply disruptions

Based on the available information, the EU gas storage capacity on February 12, 2025, is likely to be somewhat below the 50% February 1 target, potentially in the range of 47-49%, assuming continued withdrawals at rates similar to those observed in January.

It's worth noting that six member states (Austria, Czech Republic, Hungary, Latvia, Slovakia, and the Netherlands) have derogations regarding their gas storage filling requirements, which may affect the overall EU average[2].
