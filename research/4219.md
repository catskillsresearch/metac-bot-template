## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of 2020, solar radiation management (SRM) was mainly a subject of modeling, laboratory research, and small-scale experiments, with no large-scale deployment. Theoretical models show that SRM could rapidly reduce global temperatures, but it cannot address other greenhouse gas impacts like ocean acidification[4].
- Major SRM techniques under study include stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI), marine cloud brightening (MCB), and cirrus cloud thinning (CCT)[3].
- The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and other scientific bodies recognize SRM's theoretical effectiveness for cooling but emphasize substantial knowledge gaps and risks—environmental, societal, and geopolitical[5][4].

## 2. Recent Announcements and Policies

- Since 2020, there has been increased research funding and international collaboration focused on understanding SRM's risks, efficacy, and potential side effects, but no government or international body has advocated for deployment[3][5].
- The Carnegie Climate Governance Initiative and recent NOAA factsheets confirm that although SRM research is expanding, governance mechanisms are lacking, and deployment is not imminent[1][5].
- International discourse increasingly treats SRM as a possible "emergency" option if climate targets are missed, but not as a substitute for emissions reduction[2][5].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Assessment Reports
- NOAA State of the Science Factsheet on SRM
- Scientific advice from European and international agencies[1][4][5]

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- Major uncertainties include the technical feasibility of large-scale SRM, unintended environmental consequences (e.g., changes to precipitation), potential for "termination shock," and geopolitics[1][4].
- SRM does not address non-temperature impacts of greenhouse gases, such as ocean acidification[4].
- Governance frameworks are weak or absent, and there is no international consensus on deployment pathways[5].
- Measurement of global CO2 levels and mean temperature is robust, but attribution of temperature moderation specifically to SRM (vs. natural variability or other interventions) could be contentious if multiple interventions overlap.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

- The probability of large-scale SRM being deployed as the decisive means to keep global mean temperature rise below 1.5°C while CO2 exceeds 600 ppm this century is low.
- Key barriers include insufficient technical readiness, unknown risks, lack of governance, and societal resistance[1][3][5].
- Probability estimate: **<10%** chance that—by 2101—SRM will be deployed at scale and successfully meet the resolution criteria, unless future emissions mitigation fails dramatically and climate impacts become acutely unmanageable.
