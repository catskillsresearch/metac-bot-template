# Forecasting Assessment: Will Jerome Powell cease to be Fed Chair before 2026?

As of May 2025, this analysis examines the likelihood of Jerome Powell leaving his position as Federal Reserve Chair before his term officially ends on May 15, 2026.

## Current Status

Jerome Powell is currently serving his second term as Chair of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. He was sworn in for this term on May 23, 2022, following his confirmation by the Senate on May 12, 2022[1]. His current term as Chair runs until May 15, 2026, while his position as a Board member extends until January 31, 2028[1][3].

## Key Factors Affecting the Forecast

### Presidential Stance

The most significant factor in this forecast is President Trump's explicit statement about Powell's tenure. Despite previously criticizing Powell and calling him "a total stiff," Trump has clearly stated he will not remove Powell before his term ends in 2026[5]. In an interview recorded on May 4, 2025, Trump specifically said:

"No, no, no. That was a total - why would I do that? I get to replace the person in another short period of time."[5]

This represents a significant shift from earlier positions. Trump's reasoning appears pragmaticâ€”he acknowledges that Powell's term will end "in another short period of time," making premature removal unnecessary[5].

### Market Considerations

Trump's commitment to keeping Powell in place appears partly motivated by concerns about market stability. After stocks fell sharply following Trump's earlier criticism of Powell, Trump has moderated his position, which "could reassure markets deeply unsettled by Trump's moves to upend the global trading system"[5].

### Federal Reserve Independence

The Federal Reserve's independence is a critical institutional norm in American economic governance. While a president can nominate Fed chairs, the historical precedent strongly discourages removing them before their terms end. Trump's recent statements align with respecting this independence, at least regarding Powell's current term[5].

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on the available evidence, there is a low probability that Jerome Powell will cease to be Fed Chair before his term ends in May 2026. The following factors support this assessment:

1. **Explicit Presidential Commitment**: Trump has made a clear, public commitment not to remove Powell before his term ends[5].

2. **Short Remaining Term**: As of May 2025, Powell has approximately one year remaining in his term, reducing the incentive for a potentially controversial removal[5].

3. **Market Stability Concerns**: Previous market reactions to uncertainty about Powell's position appear to have influenced Trump's approach toward the Fed Chair[5].

4. **Institutional Norms**: The tradition of Federal Reserve independence creates significant political barriers to removing a sitting Fed Chair.

## Potential Uncertainties

Despite the low probability assessment, several factors could alter this forecast:

1. **Policy Disagreements**: Severe disagreements between the administration and the Federal Reserve on monetary policy could potentially escalate tensions.

2. **Economic Volatility**: A significant economic downturn might lead to renewed pressure on the Fed Chair.

3. **Voluntary Resignation**: While unlikely given Powell's history, personal or health reasons could prompt an unexpected resignation.

## Conclusion

Based on current information, Jerome Powell is highly likely to complete his term as Federal Reserve Chair through May 15, 2026. The explicit commitment from President Trump not to remove him, combined with the relatively short remaining term and market stability considerations, strongly suggests continuity in Fed leadership through the scheduled end of Powell's chairmanship.
