**Forecasting Puerto Rican Statehood by 2035: Analysis and Probabilistic Assessment**

**1. Comparison to Reference Cases**

Puerto Rico’s situation is unique compared to previous US state admissions. Unlike most territories admitted as states, Puerto Rico has a large, diverse population and a long-standing commonwealth status. Historical referendums have shown fluctuating support for statehood, but recent votes (especially in 2017 and 2020) have demonstrated a clear majority in favor, though with varying turnout and political context[2][3][5]. However, unlike previous successful statehood cases, Puerto Rico’s path is complicated by its non-binding referendums and the necessity for Congressional approval, which has not been forthcoming despite decades of advocacy[4].

**2. Key Differences Affecting the Forecast**

- **Binding Congressional Action Required:** All previous referendums have been advisory. Statehood requires an act of Congress, which has shown little interest in advancing such legislation[4].
- **Partisan and Political Dynamics:** Statehood is a politically charged issue, with both Democrats and Republicans wary of changing the balance of power in Congress[4].
- **Economic and Disaster Context:** The economic crisis and aftermath of Hurricane Maria have increased calls for statehood, but also highlighted governance and fiscal challenges that could complicate the process[1][4].
- **Public Opinion:** Mainland US support for statehood is moderate, with about 40% in favor as of early 2017, but not overwhelming[5].

**3. Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment**

Based on the available data as of April 2018, the probability of Puerto Rico becoming a US state before 2035 is **low**. While local sentiment is increasingly pro-statehood, the lack of Congressional momentum, absence of a defined legal process, and persistent partisan divides make significant progress unlikely in the near term. The most probable scenario is continued territorial status unless there is a major shift in US politics or a binding, high-turnout referendum is coupled with strong bipartisan support in Congress.

**4. Authoritative Sources and Limitations**

- **Sources:** US Congressional Research Service, Puerto Rico government, major news outlets.
- **Limitations:** Non-binding referendums, volatile public opinion, and the unpredictable nature of Congressional action introduce significant uncertainty into the forecast[4][5].

| Factor                        | Puerto Rico (2018) | Reference Cases (e.g., Hawaii, Alaska) |
|-------------------------------|--------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Binding referendum            | No                 | Yes                                    |
| Congressional support         | Low                | High                                   |
| Mainland public support       | Moderate           | High                                   |
| Political urgency             | Moderate           | High                                   |

**Summary**

Puerto Rico’s path to statehood remains uncertain. While local support is strong and increasing, the critical bottleneck is Congressional action, which has not been forthcoming. Without a significant change in US political dynamics, the likelihood of Puerto Rico becoming a state before 2035 is low[1][4][5].
