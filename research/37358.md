# Forecasting US State Department Level 4 Travel Advisories for June 2025

As of May 26, 2025, I'll analyze the available information to forecast how many Level 4 travel advisories the US State Department might issue in June 2025.

## Current Status of Level 4 Travel Advisories

As of early May 2025, the US Department of State has issued "Do Not Travel" (Level 4) advisories for 21 countries worldwide due to various risks including terrorism, armed conflict, crime, political instability, and unlawful detention[3][5]. These advisories represent the highest risk level, indicating life-threatening conditions where the US government has very limited ability to provide assistance during emergencies.

Recent Level 4 advisories include:
- Venezuela (issued May 12, 2025)[1]
- Burkina Faso (issued April 16, 2025, as mentioned in the question)
- Syria (issued March 3, 2025)[2]
- Afghanistan (issued January 13, 2025)[5]
- Democratic Republic of the Congo (issued January 29, 2025)[5]

## Advisory Issuance Patterns

The State Department reviews and updates travel advisories based on ongoing assessment of safety and security conditions in each country. Level 4 advisories are issued when there is:
- "Highest advisory level due to life-threatening risks"
- Situations where "the U.S. government may have very limited or no ability to help, including during an emergency"[1][2]

These advisories specifically identify risk factors such as:
- Crime (C): Increased risk of US citizens becoming victims of violent or organized crime
- Terrorism (T): Specific terrorist threats or recent attacks[1][2]
- Other factors may include civil unrest, armed conflict, and political instability

## Forecast Considerations

Based on the available information, several factors should be considered when forecasting June 2025 Level 4 advisories:

1. **Recent issuance frequency**: With Venezuela receiving a Level 4 advisory in mid-May 2025, there appears to be ongoing activity in issuing these high-level warnings.

2. **Global security situation**: The existence of 21 countries on the Level 4 list as of May 2025 suggests a significant number of global hotspots requiring the highest warning level.

3. **Review cycles**: The State Department regularly reviews existing advisories, which may result in new Level 4 designations for countries with deteriorating conditions.

4. **Limitations in forecast precision**: Without specific information about pending reviews or developing situations, there is uncertainty in predicting exact numbers.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- The search results don't provide information on how frequently the State Department typically issues new Level 4 advisories
- No data is available on any pending reviews scheduled for June 2025
- Information about developing political situations that might warrant new advisories is limited
- The relationship between global events and the timing of advisory issuances is not clearly established in the provided information

Given the evidence of ongoing issuance of Level 4 advisories in recent months (January, March, April, and May 2025), and considering the current global security landscape with 21 countries already at Level 4, it appears reasonable to expect that at least one new or renewed Level 4 advisory might be issued in June 2025, though specific forecasting is limited by the available information.
