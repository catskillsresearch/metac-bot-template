### 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- In the past four years, three times the highest-grossing film worldwide was a franchise entry, reflecting a strong tendency for sequels and cinematic universes to dominate global box office revenues.
- As of late May 2025, the current box office leader is *Ne Zha 2*, a sequel and thus a franchise film, with over $2.1 billion in worldwide grosses[1][2][5].
- Other top contenders are also franchise films: *A Minecraft Movie* (video game adaptation with franchise potential), *Detective Chinatown 1900* (part of an ongoing series), and *Captain America: Brave New World* (Marvel Cinematic Universe)[2][5].
- No original or non-franchise film currently threatens the top spots at the global box office[2][5].

### 2. Recent Announcements and Upcoming Releases

- Several high-profile franchise films are still scheduled for release later in 2025, including “Avatar: Fire and Ash,” “Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning,” and “Jurassic World Rebirth.” These are expected to be strong box office performers based on historical franchise performance and anticipation[2].
- No non-franchise original has been announced or is tracking strongly enough to suggest it could surpass the current leaders.

### 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Box Office Mojo and The Numbers are the primary sources for up-to-date, worldwide box office data[1][3].
- Wikipedia’s 2025 in Film page aggregates authoritative data and lists franchise status for major releases[2].

### 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- Some films are still in theatrical release and box office totals could change, especially with major year-end franchises yet to debut.
- Late-year blockbusters or unexpected viral hits could theoretically disrupt trends, but no credible evidence currently suggests a non-franchise film will do so in 2025[5].
- Measurement is robust as totals reflect global grosses, but slight variations may occur depending on reporting cutoffs.

### Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the dominance of franchise films so far in 2025, the strong performance of *Ne Zha 2*, the presence of other top-grossing franchise films, and the historical trend, it is highly probable (well above 90%) that the highest-grossing film of 2025 will be part of a franchise.
