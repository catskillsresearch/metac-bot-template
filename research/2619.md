# Forecast Analysis: Openly LGBT Pope Before 2050

## Current Situation and Historical Context

The Catholic Church has never had an openly LGBT Pope in its approximately 2,000-year history. The papacy has traditionally been a position deeply rooted in conservative theological interpretations regarding sexuality and gender. As of 2019, the Catholic Church's official doctrine considers homosexual acts as "intrinsically disordered" and contrary to natural law, while distinguishing between homosexual tendencies and actions.

Research suggests that homosexuality may be relatively common among Catholic clergy. Donald Cozzens estimated in 2000 that between 23% and 58% of priests may be gay[3]. However, this does not translate to openly LGBT leadership at the highest levels of the Church hierarchy.

## Key Factors Affecting the Forecast

### 1. Changing Catholic Attitudes

American Catholics have shown significant shifts in their attitudes toward LGBT issues. As of 2019, approximately 61% of U.S. Catholics favored allowing gays and lesbians to marry legally[2]. This represents a significant change from previous decades, indicating evolving perspectives among the Catholic laity.

### 2. Papal Selection Process

The Pope is elected by the College of Cardinals, which consists of senior bishops appointed by previous popes. This creates a system where:
- Cardinals tend to be more theologically conservative than the average Catholic
- The selection process favors continuity in doctrine
- Cardinals under 80 years of age (eligible to vote) have all been appointed by conservative popes (John Paul II, Benedict XVI, and Francis)

### 3. Institutional Inertia

The Catholic Church changes doctrine very slowly, typically over centuries rather than decades. While Pope Francis has shown a somewhat more welcoming tone toward LGBT individuals ("Who am I to judge?"), he has not changed fundamental Church teachings on sexuality.

### 4. Geographic Shifts in Catholicism

The center of Catholicism is shifting from Europe and North America to the Global South (Africa, Latin America, and parts of Asia), where attitudes toward LGBT issues tend to be more conservative than in Western countries.

## Probabilistic Assessment

Given the available evidence as of February 2019, I assess the probability of an openly LGBT Pope before 2050 at approximately **5-10%**.

This low probability reflects several key considerations:
- The significant gap between changing lay attitudes and the much slower evolution of Church doctrine
- The conservative nature of the College of Cardinals
- The precedent that even if a Pope were LGBT, historical patterns suggest they would likely remain closeted
- The institutional pressure to maintain traditional teachings on sexuality

## Key Uncertainties

Several factors could significantly alter this forecast:
- Accelerated liberalization of attitudes within the College of Cardinals
- Structural reforms to the papal selection process
- Unforeseen cultural shifts within global Catholicism
- The potential for a Pope to come out as LGBT after being elected

## Limitations of This Forecast

This forecast is limited by:
- The unprecedented nature of the event (no historical reference points)
- Limited data on the actual sexual orientation of clergy at higher levels
- Difficulty predicting social attitude changes over a 30-year timeframe
- The secretive nature of Vatican politics and papal selection

While Catholic laity attitudes are changing rapidly, the institutional Church moves at a much slower pace, creating a significant barrier to the possibility of an openly LGBT Pope in the next three decades.
