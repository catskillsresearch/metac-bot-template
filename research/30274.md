# Will a Bilateral Ceasefire Be Announced in the Ukraine War Before January 1, 2025?

As of November 2024, the prospect of a bilateral ceasefire in the Ukraine war before January 1, 2025, remains uncertain, with several factors influencing the potential outcome.

## Current Status of the Conflict

The Russia-Ukraine war has continued throughout 2024 with shifting dynamics on both sides. Russia has made military advances on the front line in recent months, despite Ukraine's incursion into Russia's Kursk region[4]. Public sentiment within Ukraine has evolved significantly, with recent polling showing that 52% of Ukrainians now want to negotiate an end to the war as soon as possible, while only 38% want to continue fighting until Ukraine achieves victory[4].

Support for continuing the conflict has declined across all regions of Ukraine, falling below 50% everywhere in 2024, regardless of proximity to the front lines[4]. This represents a significant shift in public opinion since the early stages of the war.

## Russian Position

Russian President Vladimir Putin has maintained a hardline stance on ceasefire negotiations. On July 4, 2024, at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit in Kazakhstan, Putin explicitly rejected Russian participation in meaningful ceasefire negotiations[2]. Instead, he demanded Ukraine's "irreversible demilitarization" as a precondition for any agreementâ€”effectively requiring Ukraine's surrender before negotiations could begin[2].

This position represents a departure from Putin's previous approach of feigning interest in negotiations while continuing military operations[2]. The explicit rejection of ceasefire talks without Ukraine's effective surrender suggests significant obstacles to a negotiated settlement in the near term.

## Ukrainian Position

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky presented a "victory plan" to end the war, which includes Ukraine joining NATO and using Western long-range missiles against Russian territory[4]. This plan received mixed reactions from Western allies when presented in October 2024[4].

Earlier in 2024, analysts noted that Ukraine would not accept any formula for freezing the conflict similar to a "Korean scenario" unless Western support completely ceased, which was not anticipated at that time[1].

## International Diplomatic Efforts

Several diplomatic initiatives have emerged throughout 2024:

1. A Turkish peace initiative was announced on March 3, 2024, following a meeting between Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov[1]. The Turkish position was that "both sides have reached the limits of what they can get by war" and that "it is time to start a dialogue for a ceasefire"[1].

2. The prerequisites for a successful diplomatic process, including new assistance packages and security guarantees for Ukraine, were expected to be developed in the first half of 2024, culminating with the July NATO summit in Washington[3].

## Impact of U.S. Presidential Election

Donald Trump's victory in the 2024 U.S. presidential election has created uncertainty about the ongoing provision of military and monetary aid to Ukraine[4]. This uncertainty could significantly influence the trajectory of the conflict and negotiations.

Before the election, experts predicted that the final quarter of 2024 would be decisive in determining the fate of the Russo-Ukrainian war[1]. With Trump's victory and his campaign promise to end the conflict quickly, the dynamics have shifted, potentially creating new pressures and opportunities for a negotiated settlement.

## Military and Demographic Factors

Russia faces significant challenges, including the reported detention of military leaders like Colonel Artyom Gorodilov, commander of the 83rd Guards Airborne Assault Brigade, following heavy losses in the Kharkiv direction in June 2024[2].

Both Russia and Ukraine entered 2024 in worse positions than at the war's outset. Ukraine has lost additional territory, while Russia has suffered major losses and seen its geopolitical options diminish due to collapsed relations with the West[3].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors complicate predictions about a potential ceasefire:

1. The unpredictability of Trump's approach to the conflict once he takes office in January 2025
2. Ongoing military developments on the ground
3. The potential for escalation, as both sides were expected to "test the limits of dangerously escalating their conflict in 2024"[3]
4. Shifting Western support for Ukraine, with some NATO members questioning continued military aid

## Conclusion

Based on available information as of November 19, 2024, a bilateral ceasefire before January 1, 2025, faces significant obstacles. Putin's explicit rejection of meaningful negotiations without Ukraine's effective surrender, combined with the limited time remaining in 2024, suggests that a comprehensive ceasefire meeting the specified criteria is unlikely in the immediate term.

However, the shifting public opinion within Ukraine, Trump's election, and the fatigue of a prolonged conflict create potential conditions for diplomatic movement. The final weeks of 2024 may see increased diplomatic activity, but whether this will result in a formal bilateral ceasefire announcement before January 1, 2025, remains highly uncertain.
