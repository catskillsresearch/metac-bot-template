### Key Factual Information as of July 26, 2024

- **First Debate Held**: Donald Trump and Joe Biden participated in a live, formal presidential debate on June 27, 2024, hosted by CNN[2][3].
- **Second Debate Scheduled, Now Uncertain**: A second debate was scheduled for September 10, 2024, to be hosted by ABC News[1][2][3]. However, after President Biden announced on July 21, 2024, that he would no longer seek reelection, the status of this debate became uncertain. Trump publicly questioned whether the debate should proceed as planned, suggesting it be moved to Fox News and expressing reluctance to debate a yet-unnamed Democratic nominee[Deadline Hollywood, as referenced in the question].
- **Democratic Nominee Status**: As of July 26, 2024, the Democratic Party has not formally selected a new nominee to replace Biden. There is no public confirmation that Trump has agreed to debate any new Democratic nominee before October 1, 2024.
- **No Additional Debates Confirmed**: There are no confirmed or scheduled additional debates between Trump and any new Democratic nominee before October 1, 2024. The only debate that has occurred is the June 27 debate with Biden, who is no longer the nominee.
- **Bypassing the CPD**: Both campaigns bypassed the Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD) for 2024, organizing debates independently[1][3][4].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- The Democratic nominee for president is undetermined as of July 26, 2024.
- The second debate’s occurrence is in doubt due to Biden’s withdrawal and Trump’s public statements.
- No evidence exists of any formal, live debate between Trump and a new Democratic nominee scheduled or confirmed before October 1, 2024.

### Conclusion

Based on all available information as of July 26, 2024, there is no evidence to support that Donald Trump will debate the Democratic nominee for president more than once before October 1, 2024. Only one debate (with Biden) has occurred, and the status of any further debates is highly uncertain.
