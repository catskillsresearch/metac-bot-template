To forecast whether Donald Trump will have a positive net favorability rate on December 20, 2025, I'll analyze current approval trends and historical patterns.

## Current Status and Trends

As of May 24, 2025, Donald Trump has a **net approval rating of -5** according to the Silver Bulletin (Nate Silver's publication)[5]. This represents a slight improvement from his low of -9.7 on April 29, 2025, but a decline from -4.3 earlier in the week[5]. Recent individual polls show Trump consistently underwater:

- American Research Group: -14 points
- Civiqs: -5 points
- YouGov/Economist: -8 points[5]

Trump's second term began with relatively strong approval numbers. In early January 2025, his first approval ratings showed him at 49.7% approve/41.5% disapprove (+8.2 points net approval)[4]. However, by February 20, 2025, this had declined to 48.7% approve/46.2% disapprove (+2.5 points net approval) according to FiveThirtyEight[4].

This represents a clear downward trajectory in the first few months of his second term, with his approval rating moving from:
- +8.2 points (early January 2025)
- +2.5 points (February 20, 2025)
- -5 points (May 24, 2025)

## Historical Context

During Trump's first term, evidence suggests that standard presidential approval questions may have actually overestimated his popularity. A study conducted before the 2018 midterms and after his first impeachment found that when compared to other Republican figures, Trump consistently rated toward the bottom in favorability[3].

Presidential approval ratings typically follow a pattern where presidents enjoy a "honeymoon period" after election, followed by a gradual decline. Trump's second term appears to be following this pattern, with his initial positive approval rating already having turned negative within the first five months.

## Forecast Analysis

To determine the likelihood of Trump having a positive net favorability on December 20, 2025, I need to consider several factors:

1. **Current trend**: Trump's approval has declined by approximately 13 points (from +8 to -5) in about 5 months. If this trend continues, even at a slower pace, his approval would likely remain negative by December.

2. **Time in office**: Presidential approval typically continues to decline throughout the first year or two of a term as the honeymoon effect wears off and policy decisions accumulate public reactions.

3. **Historical patterns**: During Trump's first term, he rarely achieved positive net approval ratings, suggesting a ceiling on his potential approval.

4. **Volatility**: While approval can fluctuate with events, the 7-month period between May and December 2025 would need to see a significant positive shift of more than 5 points to move Trump into positive territory.

Given these factors, the probability of Trump achieving a positive net favorability by December 20, 2025 appears low. The downward trend in the early months of his second term, combined with the typical pattern of presidential approval ratings, suggests that Trump's net favorability will likely remain negative by the specified date.

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on the available data, I estimate:
- 15-25% probability of positive net favorability by December 20, 2025
- 75-85% probability of negative net favorability by December 20, 2025

This assessment acknowledges some uncertainty due to potential unexpected events or policy successes that could boost approval, but gives significant weight to the established downward trend and historical patterns of presidential approval cycles.
