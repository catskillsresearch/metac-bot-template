## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of late 2018, exoplanet atmospheres have been characterized primarily by transit spectroscopy, with most successful detections limited to gas giants and a few Neptune-mass planets[4].
- Detected atmospheric components have included hydrogen, sodium, water vapor, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, methane, and traces of oxygen—but not definitive, quantifiable measurements of oxygen abundance[4].
- Missions like Kepler ended in 2018, but TESS had begun finding new transiting planets, focusing on nearby, bright stars for easier follow-up[5].
- JWST, scheduled to launch in 2018 (and in reality launched later), was projected to be the first observatory with the capability to probe smaller, potentially habitable exoplanet atmospheres for biosignature gases, including O2[5].

## Key Differences Affecting the Forecast

- **Improved Target List**: The number of small exoplanets suitable for atmospheric characterization was increasing due to TESS, but remained small relative to the total exoplanet population[5].
- **Instrumental Limitations**: Even with JWST, only a few rocky planets may have atmospheres that can be probed deeply enough to detect and quantify O2 at the >5% level. High-resolution ground-based spectroscopy was advancing but still faced signal-to-noise challenges for small planets[3][4].
- **Measurement Challenge**: Detecting O2 is not enough; its abundance must be reliably quantified. As of 2018, no method had demonstrated the ability to measure O2 fractions in exoplanet atmospheres to the required precision[3][4].
- **False Positives**: High oxygen levels can arise from abiotic processes, and distinguishing these from biological sources adds complexity to both detection and interpretation[5].

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given:
- The technical hurdle of measuring O2 at >5% in a terrestrial exoplanet atmosphere,
- The very limited set of suitable targets reachable by JWST or ground-based telescopes,
- The lack of demonstrated methodology (as of 2018) for making such a precise measurement,

The probability that we will detect an exoplanet atmosphere with >5% O2 before January 1, 2030 is **low**—likely less than 10%. This assessment could shift upward if a breakthrough occurs in instrumentation, data analysis, or if an exceptionally favorable target is discovered.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- The main uncertainty is whether new observational techniques or unforeseen discoveries will enable such a detection.
- The number of target planets with both transits and suitable atmospheres is small.
- The signal from O2 is relatively weak and can be masked by other atmospheric features or stellar activity.
- Even if O2 is detected, quantifying its abundance to the required precision (>5%) is a major technical challenge not yet overcome as of 2018.
