## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of 2021, cultivated meat production remained at pilot and demonstration scale, with no commercial-scale facilities operating. The largest announced plan was BlueNalu’s five-stage strategy, culminating in a facility with 8,000 metric tons/year capacity, but this had not been built as of 2025[5].
- Upside Foods’ Emeryville facility, operational since 2021, has a current capacity of over 50,000 lbs/year (about 23 metric tons/year), with a future planned capacity of 400,000 lbs/year (about 181 metric tons/year), still far below conventional meat plants[5].

## 2. Recent Announcements and Policies

- BlueNalu’s plan for an 8,000 metric tons/year facility remains the largest publicized ambition but has not yet materialized into an operational plant[5].
- Regulatory delays and high capital costs continue to slow the transition from pilot to commercial scale, with most facilities operating well below 1,000 metric tons/year as of 2025[5][3].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The Good Food Institute’s State of the Industry Reports and infrastructure analyses provide annual updates on facility capacities and industry growth[1][4].
- McKinsey’s 2021 cultivated meat report projects industry-wide production of 1.5 million metric tons by 2030 but does not forecast any single facility exceeding a substantial share of this total[3].
- Company announcements (e.g., BlueNalu, Upside Foods) and coverage in industry journals (e.g., Food Processing) provide the most direct evidence for individual facility capacities[5].

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- There is considerable uncertainty in aspirational company forecasts for future facility capacities, as these are contingent on technical, regulatory, and market developments.
- Announced “future” capacities may not be achieved, and actual operational output could lag stated maximums for years.

## Probabilistic Forecast

Based on historical trends, current industry status, and announced plans, the largest cultivated meat production capacity of a single facility by January 1, 2030 is most likely to fall in the range of 8,000–20,000 metric tons/year. A facility at or near 8,000 metric tons/year is the most probable, with a less than 10% chance of exceeding 20,000 metric tons/year in this timeframe, barring a significant breakthrough in scale-up technology and regulatory approval[5][3].
