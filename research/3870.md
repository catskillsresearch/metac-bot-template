# Forecasting Analysis: Martian Fossil Discoveries

As of March 18, 2020, the question of whether Mars contains widespread fossils of algae and lichens remains uncertain, but several lines of evidence and upcoming missions provide context for this forecast.

## Current Status and Evidence (as of March 2020)

NASA's Mars exploration has been systematically searching for signs of past life, with increasing sophistication in each mission. The current evidence suggests that Mars once had conditions potentially suitable for microbial life:

- NASA scientists have identified distinct deposits of carbonates along the inner rim of Jezero Crater, which was the site of a lake more than 3.5 billion years ago[4]
- On Earth, carbonates help form structures that can survive in fossil form for billions of years, including stromatolitesâ€”rocks formed by ancient microbial life along shorelines[4]
- These environments on Mars represent potentially ideal conditions for preserving evidence of ancient microbial life, if it existed[4]

The Joseph et al. paper mentioned in the query reports potential evidence of fossils resembling terrestrial algae, lichens, and other organisms. However, as of March 2020, such claims remain highly controversial in the scientific community, with most researchers maintaining a cautious stance about definitive evidence of Martian life.

## Upcoming Missions and Data Collection

The most significant near-term development for answering this question is the Mars 2020 mission:

- The Mars 2020 rover (later named Perseverance) is scheduled to land in Jezero Crater on February 18, 2021[4]
- This rover is specifically designed to search for actual signs of past microbial life and will collect rock core samples that will be stored for potential return to Earth[4]
- The mission represents the most sophisticated attempt yet to detect fossil evidence of life on Mars, with instruments specifically designed for this purpose[4]

## Critical Analysis of Current Claims

The 2020 Joseph et al. paper's claims about fossils of algae, lichens, and even more complex organisms must be evaluated against several factors:

- Prior claims of Martian life have faced significant scrutiny and often been explained through non-biological processes
- The scientific community generally requires extraordinary evidence for extraordinary claims
- Visual similarities to Earth organisms can be misleading, as abiotic processes can create structures resembling biological forms
- The paper itself acknowledges that "some or most of these specimens may be abiotic"

## Forecast Considerations

Several factors will influence whether the Joseph et al. claims will be validated by 2025:

1. **Sample Analysis Capabilities**: The Mars 2020 mission will collect samples but may not be able to definitively analyze them for fossil evidence without returning them to Earth

2. **Scientific Consensus Building**: Even with compelling evidence, the scientific community typically requires multiple independent confirmations before accepting such significant discoveries

3. **Alternative Explanations**: Many formations that appear biological can have abiotic origins through chemical and geological processes

4. **Limitations of Remote Sensing**: Definitive identification of fossils may require sample return missions that won't be completed before 2025

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on the evidence available as of March 2020, the probability that "The tentative claims of the 2020 Joseph et al. paper are basically correct and a significant fraction of the features identified there were, in fact, fossils of life on Mars" appears low to moderate. The scientific consensus as of March 2020 would likely place this probability below 25%, with significant uncertainty.

The Mars 2020 mission represents the best near-term opportunity to gather evidence that could potentially support these claims, but definitive proof may require sample return missions that would likely extend beyond January 2025.
