### 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of November 2021, there has been no known case of a non-state actor acquiring a deployable nuclear weapon from a state. While theft or loss of nuclear material has occurred, these incidents have not involved complete, operational weapons[3].
- The global nonproliferation regime, centered around the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), has been effective in limiting both the spread of weapons and the risk of transfer to non-state actors. Nearly all states with nuclear arsenals continue to exercise strict control over their stockpiles[1][2].
- Notable episodes such as Ukraine's post-Soviet denuclearization (1990s) underscore international coordination in addressing proliferation risks following state collapse[3][5].
- The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) continues to report frequent incidents involving theft or unauthorized possession of weapons-usable materials, though not intact weapons.

### 2. Recent Announcements or Policies

- The indefinite extension of the NPT (since 1995) and the adoption of additional treaties like the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW) have further codified international norms against the transfer of nuclear arms, including to non-state actors[2][4].
- Enhanced verification protocols and export controls (e.g., Nuclear Suppliers Group) have strengthened barriers to illicit transfer[2].
- No recent policy changes as of 2021 have signaled an increased risk of state-to-non-state nuclear weapon transfer.

### 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Official government statements, intelligence assessments, and IAEA reports serve as primary sources for monitoring and verification.
- Resolution is contingent on authoritative disclosure, reducing the risk of undetected transfers affecting question resolution.

### 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- The primary risk factors are geopolitical instability (potential state collapse), insider threats, and the evolving capabilities of non-state actors.
- Measurement is limited by the clandestine nature of nuclear proliferation and the requirement for official confirmation.
- While the theft of nuclear material is not uncommon, the acquisition of a complete, functional weapon by a non-state actor remains unprecedented.

### Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given:
- The absence of precedent,
- Robust international controls and treaties,
- Ongoing but manageable incidents involving nuclear materials,
- No recent evidence of weakening state control,

The probability that a non-state actor will acquire a state-origin, deployable nuclear weapon by 2030 remains very lowâ€”likely well under 1%. However, the risk is not zero and will require ongoing vigilance and international cooperation to maintain at these levels.
