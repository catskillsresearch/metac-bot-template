### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- OpenAI typically releases major model upgrades every 1–2 years: GPT-3 (June 2020), GPT-4 (March 2023), GPT-4o (May 2024), and GPT-4.5 (February 2025)[1][2][5].
- There is a historical pattern of incremental improvements (e.g., GPT-4.5) followed by more significant "frontier" releases (e.g., GPT-4, anticipated GPT-5)[2][5].
- As of May 2025, GPT-4.5 serves as the latest incremental upgrade, with its deprecation (removal from API in July 2025) suggesting preparation for a major successor model[4].

### Recent Announcements and Policies

- In February 2025, CEO Sam Altman publicly stated that GPT-5 would launch in "months," following the arrival of GPT-4.5 in "weeks"[5].
- OpenAI’s published roadmap confirms plans to integrate advanced technologies into GPT-5, positioning it as a significant leap forward and not just an incremental update[3][5].
- OpenAI CTO Mira Murati has hinted that "frontier models" are coming soon, and that a major AI breakthrough (PhD-level intelligence) is expected by late 2025[5].
- The GPT-4.5 system card explicitly states it is not a frontier model, reinforcing that GPT-5 will be the next major leap[5].

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- OpenAI’s official blog, system cards, and CEO/CTO public statements are the primary sources for formal announcements[3][5].
- Industry trackers and AI news sites (e.g., Exploding Topics, Voiceflow) consistently report expectations for a 2025 announcement, citing OpenAI’s communication and industry patterns[1][2][5].

### Key Differences/Uncertainties

- OpenAI’s increased emphasis on AI alignment and safety may introduce delays compared to previous cycles[5].
- The precise timing is not confirmed; while “months” from February could imply mid-to-late 2025, unexpected technical or regulatory hurdles could push the date to late 2025 or even early 2026[5].
- The competitive landscape (e.g., advancements from Google, Anthropic) creates pressure to release new systems promptly, which may counterbalance delay risks[2][5].

### Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

- Given current evidence, the probability that OpenAI will formally announce and publish a paper or blog post describing GPT-5 (with performance results, not just development updates) before January 1, 2026, is **80–90%**.
- The timing will likely fall in the second half of 2025, in line with recurring patterns and leadership statements[1][2][5].

### Limitations

- No official release date or performance paper/blog has yet been published as of May 25, 2025.
- The forecast is subject to revision if OpenAI alters its release strategy or encounters major technical/safety challenges.
