### Key Factors for Bankruptcy Forecast  
1. **Financial deterioration**:  
   - $205 million Q1 2024 net loss[2][4]  
   - $573.8 million long-term debt as of May 2024 (+14.4% YoY)[2][4]  
   - Negative operating cash flow since 2022[2]  

2. **Operational challenges**:  
   - 10% YoY sales decline in Q1 2024[2]  
   - 244 underperforming stores (17.5% of total)[2]  
   - Reduced consumer spending on high-ticket home goods[4]  

3. **Regulatory disclosures**:  
   - SEC filing explicitly questioning viability[2][4]  
   - Credit Risk Monitor's 4-10% bankruptcy probability score (2023)[3]  

### Recent Developments  
- **Store strategy**: Closing 35-40 locations while opening 3 new stores[4]  
- **Leadership initiatives**: CEO Bruce Thorn emphasizes value communication and omnichannel retention[2]  
- **Market reaction**: 17% stock surge in July 2024 despite warnings[4]  

### Verification Sources  
- SEC filings (Q1 2024)[2][4]  
- Retail analyst assessments[1][2]  
- Company earnings reports[3][4]  

### Limitations  
- No explicit bankruptcy timeline in disclosures[2][4]  
- Potential for last-minute financing or restructuring  
- Meme stock volatility could delay collapse[2]  

**Conclusion**: While bankruptcy appears highly probable based on financials and disclosures, the absence of a formal filing announcement before August 2024 prevents definitive confirmation of a pre-September 30 timeline.
