## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- **Moxidectin Approval History:** Moxidectin was approved by the US FDA in 2018 for onchocerciasis in individuals aged 12 and older, marking the first new drug approval for this disease in 30 years. In December 2024, Ghana's Food and Drugs Authority also approved moxidectin for river blindness, reflecting growing regulatory acceptance in endemic countries[1][3].
- **WHO Prequalification Process:** The WHO PQ process evaluates medicines for quality, safety, and efficacy. PQ status is often a prerequisite for widespread adoption in low- and middle-income countries. As of late 2024, Medicines Development for Global Health (MDGH) is actively pursuing PQ for moxidectin, supported by a GiveWell grant awarded in June 2024[2].
- **Additional Clinical Requirements:** Despite regulatory approvals elsewhere, WHO has required extensive additional clinical trials for moxidectin before considering PQ, introducing significant uncertainty and likely delays[2][3].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- **GiveWell Grant and Forecasts:** In June 2024, GiveWell granted $637,549 to MDGH specifically to complete the WHO PQ process for moxidectin. GiveWell’s internal forecast estimates an 80% chance of PQ by the end of 2026, but does not expect PQ imminently. There is no indication that PQ will be achieved before April 2025[2].
- **No Official WHO PQ Announcement:** As of January 31, 2025, there are no official WHO announcements or credible third-party confirmations that moxidectin has been prequalified for onchocerciasis[1][2][3].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- **WHO Prequalification List:** The official WHO PQ list and news releases are the definitive sources for PQ status. As of the latest available information, moxidectin is not listed as prequalified for onchocerciasis[1][2].
- **MDGH and GiveWell Updates:** Both organizations provide regular updates on the PQ process and funding status, but neither reports PQ achievement as of January 2025[2].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- **Process Delays:** The requirement for additional clinical trials has introduced delays, and the PQ process can take several years, especially for new drugs targeting neglected tropical diseases[2][3].
- **Forecasting Uncertainty:** While GiveWell’s forecast is optimistic for PQ by 2026, it assigns a much lower probability to PQ being achieved in the near term (i.e., before April 2025)[2].

## Conclusion

Based on all available factual information as of January 31, 2025, there is no evidence that the WHO will prequalify moxidectin for onchocerciasis before April 1, 2025. The process is ongoing, with significant regulatory and data requirements still outstanding. The most authoritative forecasts and updates suggest PQ is unlikely before the specified date.
