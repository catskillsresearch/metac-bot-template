## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of October 2024, Zillow reports that national rent growth has slowed beyond typical seasonal patterns, with high levels of concessions and continued slow year-over-year rent growth expected into November[1].
- The October 2024 Rent Report specifically notes that renters in November will likely see continued slow YoY rent growth, implying that significant increases (such as ≥5.0%) are unlikely in most markets, including Providence, RI[1].
- There is no specific mention of Providence, RI, in the October 2024 report, but the national trend and commentary suggest that Providence is not an outlier experiencing rapid rent growth.

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- No major new policies or economic events affecting Providence, RI’s rental market have been reported in Zillow’s recent publications or investor materials as of late 2024[5].
- Zillow’s 2024 Investor Strategy Deck and annual report focus on platform enhancements and market opportunities but do not indicate any local factors that would drive a sharp rent increase in Providence[5].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The definitive source for resolving this question is Zillow’s Housing Data page, specifically the ZORI (Smoothed): All Homes Plus Multifamily Time Series for metros, where Providence, RI, can be selected for year-over-year rent growth calculations.
- The October 2024 Rent Report provides the latest available market commentary before the November 2024 data release[1].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- The November 2024 ZORI data for Providence, RI, will not be published until after the cutoff date, so the exact YoY figure is not available as of November 25, 2024.
- Local market dynamics can sometimes diverge from national trends, but there is no evidence as of the cutoff that Providence is experiencing a surge in rent growth.
- If the chart and CSV differ, the CSV value will take precedence for resolution.

## Conclusion

Based on the most recent available data and commentary from Zillow, it is unlikely that the year-over-year rent increase in Providence, RI, for November 2024 will be greater than or equal to 5.0%. The prevailing trend is one of slowing rent growth, with no indication of a reversal or local anomaly that would push Providence above this threshold[1].
