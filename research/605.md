As a forecasting analyst examining global warming projections for 2100, I'll analyze the available evidence as of December 21, 2017, to provide a probabilistic assessment.

## Current Situation vs. Reference Cases

The Paris Climate Agreement established goals to limit global warming to "well below 2°C" above pre-industrial levels, with efforts to limit warming to 1.5°C. However, current scientific projections suggest these targets face significant challenges.

A 2017 statistical analysis from the University of Washington found only a 5% chance of limiting warming to 2°C or less by 2100, and just a 1% chance of staying below 1.5°C[2]. Their research indicates a median projected warming of 3.2°C by century's end, with a 90% probability range between 2°C and 4.9°C[2].

Climate models from various research institutions suggest Earth's average temperature could increase between 1.1°C and 5.4°C by 2100 compared to present temperatures[5]. This wide range reflects different scenarios regarding greenhouse gas emissions, climate sensitivity, and policy implementation.

## Key Differences Affecting the Forecast

Several factors significantly impact warming projections:

**Greenhouse Gas Emissions Trajectory**: The primary driver of warming is carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases from human activities, particularly fossil fuel combustion[5]. Different emission scenarios create vastly different warming outcomes.

**Climate Sensitivity**: Scientific understanding indicates that extreme temperatures are likely to rise faster than averages. Dutch scientists report that if average temperatures rise by 3°C, peak temperatures on the hottest days could increase by up to 8°C in some regions[1].

**Geographic Variation**: Warming will not be uniform globally. Projections indicate parts of Australia, India, the Middle East, North Africa, the Sahel, and equatorial/subtropical South America could experience extreme temperatures exceeding 50°C (122°F) by 2100[1].

**Policy Implementation**: The announced U.S. withdrawal from the Paris Agreement creates additional uncertainty about whether global emission reduction targets can be achieved.

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on the available scientific evidence as of December 2017, I provide the following probabilistic assessment for global warming by 2100 (relative to 1880):

- **Highly Unlikely Range (≤5% probability)**: 0.8°C to 2.0°C
- **Lower Range (5-25% probability)**: 2.0°C to 2.8°C
- **Central Range (25-75% probability)**: 2.8°C to 4.2°C
- **Upper Range (75-95% probability)**: 4.2°C to 5.4°C
- **Extreme Range (≥95% probability)**: 5.4°C to 8.0°C

The median estimate of 3.2°C aligns with the University of Washington research, which represents one of the most comprehensive statistical analyses available[2]. This projection significantly exceeds the Paris Agreement targets, suggesting that without dramatic policy interventions beyond current commitments, the world is on track for substantial warming.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several important limitations affect this forecast:

1. **Model Uncertainty**: Climate models contain inherent uncertainties in representing complex Earth systems.

2. **Policy Implementation**: Future emission pathways depend heavily on political decisions that cannot be reliably predicted.

3. **Climate Feedbacks**: Some potential feedback mechanisms (like methane release from thawing permafrost) are not fully incorporated in all models.

4. **Measurement Challenges**: The question specifies using NASA data for resolution, but acknowledges this source may not be available in 2100, potentially introducing measurement inconsistencies.

5. **Baseline Considerations**: The question asks for warming relative to 1880, while some scientific literature uses different baseline periods.

## Conclusion

The scientific evidence as of December 2017 strongly suggests that global warming by 2100 will likely exceed the Paris Agreement targets. The most robust statistical analysis indicates a median warming projection of approximately 3.2°C above pre-industrial levels, with only a small probability of limiting warming to 2°C or below. Without significant additional climate policy interventions beyond current commitments, warming of 3-4°C appears to be the most likely outcome, with potentially severe consequences for human societies and ecosystems worldwide.
