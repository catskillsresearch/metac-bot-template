# Forecasting Global Malaria Mortality Reduction by 2030

In 2015, the World Health Assembly adopted the "Global technical strategy for malaria 2016-2030," which established an ambitious target of reducing global malaria incidence and mortality rates by at least 90% by 2030 compared to 2015 levels[1][2]. This analysis examines the likelihood of achieving this goal based on information available as of August 13, 2018.

## Current Status and Historical Trends

The WHO's global technical strategy represents a bold vision for malaria control and elimination in the coming decade. The strategy specifically aims for a 90% reduction in global malaria mortality rates by 2030 compared to 2015 baseline levels[1]. This target is part of a comprehensive framework guiding countries in accelerating progress toward malaria elimination.

The strategy aligns with broader sustainable development goals, with malaria specifically included as target 3.3 to "end the epidemics of AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria"[4]. For malaria specifically, this translates to: "Reduce malaria mortality rates and clinical case incidence globally by at least 90 percent compared with 2015, eliminate malaria from at least 30 countries that had transmission of malaria in 2015, and ensure prevention of re-establishment in countries that are malaria free by 2030"[4].

## Key Factors Affecting the Forecast

Several factors will influence the likelihood of achieving the 90% reduction target:

1. **Funding challenges**: The strategy acknowledges that expanded financing will be crucial to achieve the targets[2]. Adequate investments are identified as a necessary condition for making "remarkable strides against this complicated enemy"[2].

2. **Implementation capacity**: WHO has planned to develop and roll out implementation plans across all regions and support countries in updating their national malaria plans[2]. The effectiveness of this implementation will be critical.

3. **Health system strengthening**: The strategy emphasizes the need to strengthen health systems, address emerging multi-drug and insecticide resistance, and intensify national, cross-border and regional efforts[2].

4. **Political commitment**: Strong political commitment is identified as essential for achieving the targets[2]. The level of sustained political will across affected countries will significantly impact outcomes.

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on the information available as of August 2018, I assess that there is approximately a 30-40% probability that global malaria mortality rates will be reduced by 90% by 2030 compared to 2015 levels.

This assessment reflects:

- The ambitious nature of the 90% reduction target
- The acknowledged need for significant scaling up of resources and political commitment
- The complexities of addressing drug and insecticide resistance
- The challenges of implementing consistent strategies across diverse geographic and socioeconomic contexts

The WHO's framing of this target as ambitious but achievable suggests recognition of the significant challenges involved, while maintaining that the goal is technically feasible with proper implementation and resource allocation.

## Verification Sources

The WHO publishes annual reports on malaria that track progress toward established goals. As specified in the resolution criteria, these reports will be the authoritative source for determining whether the 90% reduction target has been achieved by 2030.

## Measurement Limitations

Measuring global malaria mortality presents several challenges:

1. Reporting infrastructure varies significantly across affected regions
2. Attribution of deaths to malaria can be complicated by comorbidities
3. Access to healthcare and diagnostic services affects data collection
4. Changes in reporting methodologies over time may complicate direct comparisons

These factors should be considered when evaluating progress toward the 2030 target.
