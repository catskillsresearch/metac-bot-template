### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The global average atmospheric CO₂ concentration in 2024 set a new record at approximately 422.7–422.8 ppm[1][4][5].
- The increase from 2023 to 2024 was 3.75 ppm, the largest annual rise on record, largely due to the influence of El Niño, widespread drought, and extensive forest fires that reduced terrestrial carbon uptake and increased emissions[1][4].
- Recent years (2022–2024) have seen CO₂ concentrations and emissions continue to grow, with 2024 fossil fuel emissions reaching an estimated all-time high[3][4].
- The RCP8.5 scenario projected an average of 426.63 ppm for 2022–2025 and 440.01 ppm for 2027–2030, implying a linear increase during the 2024–2027 window.

### Recent Announcements and Policies

- As of 2020-02-29, there were no major new international climate policies or mitigation measures in force with the scale or immediacy required to significantly alter the upward trajectory of atmospheric CO₂ concentrations by 2024–2027.
- Current emission trends are driven by continued fossil fuel use, with only modest reductions in some regions (e.g., EU, US) and increases in others (e.g., China)[3].

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- NOAA Global Monitoring Laboratory provides official annual mean CO₂ concentration data[1].
- The Global Carbon Project and Earth System Science Data offer comprehensive annual emissions and concentration reports, including the "Global Carbon Budget 2024"[3][5].
- IPCC RCP scenario datasets and peer-reviewed literature provide reference projections for atmospheric concentrations.

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- Year-to-year variations in the annual CO₂ growth rate can be affected by natural climate variability (e.g., ENSO), wildfires, and biosphere responses, introducing uncertainty into short-term forecasts[1].
- Measurement of atmospheric CO₂ is highly accurate, but regional variations and short-term volatility can influence annual means.
- There are no major unanticipated technological or policy breakthroughs (as of 2020-02-29) that would significantly alter the trajectory during this period.

### Probabilistic Assessment

Based on the actual 2024 value (422.8 ppm) and record-high annual increases, simple extrapolation (assuming ~3 ppm annual increase) yields:

- 2024: ~423 ppm
- 2025: ~426 ppm
- 2026: ~429 ppm
- 2027: ~432 ppm

The arithmetic mean for 2024–2027 would therefore be approximately (423 + 426 + 429 + 432) / 4 = 427.5 ppm, well below the threshold of 433.19 ppm.

#### Adjusted Forecast

**It is highly probable (>95%) that the average global CO₂ atmospheric concentration over the 2024–2027 period will be less than 433.19 ppm, barring a substantial, unforeseen jump in annual increases.**
