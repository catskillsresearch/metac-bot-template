# Forecasting Analysis: CDU-AfD Coalition Prospects Before 2030

As of May 30, 2025, I need to note that the current political landscape in Germany has evolved significantly since the February 2024 reference point specified in the question. The available information shows recent developments that may impact the forecast but doesn't directly address CDU's stance toward the AfD.

## Current Political Situation (May 2025)

Germany is currently governed by a new Grand Coalition (GroKo) between the Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union (CDU/CSU) and the Social Democratic Party (SPD)[1][2]. This coalition was formed following the February 2025 federal election, in which the CDU won the most seats[4].

Key facts about the current government:
- Friedrich Merz (CDU) has been sworn in as Germany's new chancellor[3]
- The coalition agreement, titled "Responsibility for Germany," was signed on May 5, 2025[3]
- The agreement is 144 pages long and focuses on the social market economy, defense capabilities, and migration policy[3]

The CDU chose to form a coalition with the center-left SPD rather than pursuing other potential coalition partners[2][3]. This decision followed 45 days of negotiations after the February 2025 election[4].

## Relevance to CDU-AfD Coalition Forecast

The recent formation of a CDU-SPD coalition provides several insights relevant to the forecasting question:

1. **Continued Mainstream Coalition Pattern**: The CDU has again chosen to govern with another mainstream party (SPD) rather than seeking alternative coalition partners[1][2]. This continues the historical pattern of avoiding coalitions with parties considered outside the mainstream.

2. **Migration Policy Focus**: The coalition agreement announces "a new, more consistent approach to migration policy"[3], which addresses an issue area where the AfD has traditionally focused its platform. By addressing migration policy within a mainstream coalition, the CDU may be attempting to address voter concerns without partnering with the AfD.

3. **Focus on Security and Defense**: The coalition emphasizes strengthening Germany's defense capabilities and extending powers for intelligence services and police[3]. This security-focused approach may be designed to address concerns that might otherwise drive voters toward the AfD.

## Limitations for Forecasting

The available information has several limitations for forecasting the specific question:

1. **No Direct Statements on AfD**: The search results contain no information about the CDU's current stance regarding potential coalitions with the AfD, nor any changes to the 2018/2020 position of non-cooperation.

2. **Temporal Gap**: The search results provide information from April-May 2025, rather than from February 2024 as requested in the query. This creates a significant gap in understanding the evolution of CDU's position during this period.

3. **No AfD Polling Data**: The current search results don't provide updated information on AfD's electoral standing or how it performed in the February 2025 election, which would be crucial for understanding the political calculus around potential coalitions.

## Assessment

Based on the available information, the CDU has continued its pattern of forming coalitions with mainstream parties, most recently with the SPD in May 2025. The formation of this new Grand Coalition suggests continuity rather than radical change in the CDU's coalition strategy. However, without specific statements regarding the CDU's position on the AfD, or information about changing political dynamics that might pressure the CDU to reconsider its stance before 2030, a definitive forecast cannot be made.

The fact that the CDU has chosen to form a coalition with the SPD as recently as May 2025, despite the challenges reported in the "feeble" start to this coalition[2], suggests that the CDU continues to prefer mainstream coalition partners over alternatives.
