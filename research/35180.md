- Historical price data from Northrop Grumman's investor relations and financial data sites confirm that the stock has not approached its all-time high in recent months[1][2].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- Northrop Grumman's official investor relations site also provides historical price lookup tools[1].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- Stock price forecasts are inherently uncertain and subject to market volatility, geopolitical events, and sector-specific developments.
- While the consensus view is that NOC will likely remain below its all-time high through March 31, 2025, a brief intraday spike above $555.57 cannot be completely ruled out, especially given the existence of some higher-end analyst targets[4][5].
- All forecasts are based on information available as of February 18, 2025, and do not account for unforeseen events after this date.

## Conclusion

Based on available data as of February 18, 2025, Northrop Grumman's stock is expected to remain below its all-time high of $555.57 through March 31, 2025, with most analyst forecasts and recent trading history supporting this view. However, the possibility of a brief price spike above this level, while unlikely, cannot be entirely dismissed.
