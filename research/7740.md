## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of early 2025, recreational marijuana is legal in 24 states and Washington, DC, representing nearly half the US, but this expansion is concentrated in states with more moderate or Democratic leanings[3].
- Of the 20 states that voted Republican in the last four presidential elections (2008–2020), only Alaska and Montana have legalized recreational cannabis[1][3]. These states together account for roughly 35.6% of the land area of the group in question.
- States with strong Republican control have shown significantly less movement toward legalization. Recent ballot measures in deep-red states (e.g., South Dakota, North Dakota) have failed or faced legal/political obstacles even after passing[5].

## 2. Recent Announcements and Policy Developments

- Legislative and advocacy attention for adult-use legalization in 2025 is focused on states outside this core Republican group, such as Pennsylvania, Hawaii, and New Hampshire[2][4][5].
- In the 2024 election cycle, efforts to legalize recreational marijuana failed in South Dakota and North Dakota, both part of the target group[5].
- Some states in the group (e.g., Nebraska) have made modest progress on medical marijuana, but even these efforts face litigation and implementation delays[2].
- There is no current indication (as of 2025) of imminent federal legalization, though this could change before 2041[2][3].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Up-to-date maps and lists (DISA, Leafly, Cover Cannabis) confirm the slow progress in these states[1][3][5].
- Forecasts and advocacy groups (Marijuana Moment, Cannabis Business Times) see the best legalization prospects in more moderate states, with deep-red states remaining resistant[2][4][5].

## 4. Key Differences and Uncertainties

- **Political Control**: Nearly all of the target states have Republican trifectas (control of governorship and both legislative chambers), which has correlated with strong resistance to recreational marijuana reform[2][4].
- **Initiative Pathways**: Some states lack citizen initiative processes or have high thresholds for ballot measures, further limiting change.
- **Federal Action**: A federal legalization law could instantly change the legal status in all states, but as of 2025, this remains speculative.
- **Long-term Trends**: National public opinion continues to shift in favor of legalization, especially among younger voters, but translating this into law in deep-red states and over such a large land area is uncertain.

## 5. Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given:
- Current status: Only 2 of 20 states have legalized recreational marijuana.
- Recent failures: Key target states (e.g., SD, ND) failed to pass legalization even via ballot initiatives[5].
- Legislative focus is elsewhere; Republican-trifecta states are not on advocacy shortlists[2][4][5].
- The long time horizon (through 2040) increases the chance for gradual change, especially if federal law changes or state-level politics shift, but no clear momentum is evident as of 2025.

**Probabilistic Assessment:**
- On present trends, the probability that at least 2/3rds of the land area of these 20 states (i.e., a supermajority) will legalize recreational marijuana before 2041 is **significantly below 50%**.
- The likelihood could rise if federal legalization occurs or if a major political realignment happens, but as of 2025, such scenarios remain speculative.
- Therefore, as of the latest available data, the most reasonable forecast is **No**, with an estimated probability in the range of 20–35%, reflecting substantial resistance but acknowledging the long time horizon and potential for unexpected shifts.
