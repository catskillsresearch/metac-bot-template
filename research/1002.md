## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- **Life Expectancy vs. Maximum Lifespan**: Since the 19th century, improvements in sanitation, vaccination, and medical care have dramatically increased average life expectancy, mostly by reducing early and mid-life mortality. However, the verified maximum human lifespan has remained essentially unchanged; the oldest confirmed age as of June 2018 is 122 years, with only two people living beyond 117[1].
- **Rarity of Extreme Longevity**: As of June 2018, only 46 people have reached 115, 19 have reached 116, 9 have reached 117, and only one person has reached 122. This extreme rarity suggests a biological ceiling[1].
- **No Trend Toward Increasing Maxima**: Historical records show that while more people are surviving into their 80s and 90s, the number of people reaching extreme ages (120+) has not increased meaningfully over time[1][2].

## 2. Recent Announcements and Policies

- **Genetic Research**: In 2018, researchers identified 25 parallel gene mutations linked to wound healing, blood coagulation, and cardiovascular disorders. These findings could inform future drugs targeting aging, but practical therapies are not yet available[1].
- **Animal Study Breakthroughs**: The Methuselah Foundation extended mouse lifespans significantly, but translation to humans is highly uncertain[1].
- **Intervention Strategies**: Scientific literature discusses two strategies for human lifespan extension: boosting resilience (delaying disease) and reducing biological age (true rejuvenation). While certain drugs (e.g., rapamycin in mice) have shown lifespan extension in animals, such interventions have not yet produced similar results in humans[5].
- **Expert Consensus**: As of the late 2010s and early 2020s, most experts argue that radical human life extension remains implausible in this century, and that the human lifespan may be nearing a natural upper limit[2][3][4].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- **Gerontology Research Group**
- **Our World in Data: Life Expectancy**
- **Peer-reviewed journals (e.g., Frontiers in Genetics)**
- **Government vital statistics agencies**

These entities provide rigorous age verification and maintain records consistent with the stringent standards outlined in the forecast resolution criteria.

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- **Biological Constraints**: The mechanisms that set the upper bound on human lifespan are not fully understood, but evidence suggests strong genetic and physiological limits[1][2].
- **Translational Gaps**: Success in extending lifespan in model organisms does not guarantee similar results in humans, due to complexity and scale[1][5].
- **Verification Standards**: Age claims beyond 120 require robust documentation, and the standards as of 2018 remain the benchmark for resolution.
- **Unpredictable Breakthroughs**: While unexpected scientific advances are possible, as of 2018 no credible technology or policy is on the immediate horizon to enable large numbers of humans to live past 120 or 130[2][3].

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the current biological, technological, and demographic evidence as of June 2018, the probability that by 2100 either 10+ people will live to 130, or 100+ to 120, or Ray Kurzweil will reach 120, is low—estimated at less than 10%. This assessment reflects the slow progress in extending maximum human lifespan, robust biological constraints, and the lack of proven interventions that significantly alter the course of aging in humans[2][3][5].
