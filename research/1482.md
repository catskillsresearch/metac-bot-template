### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- In 2013-2014, 70.7% of US adults were overweight or obese (BMI ≥ 25), with 37.9% classified as obese (BMI ≥ 30)[1].
- By 2019, about 40% of US adults were obese, and projections indicated this would rise to nearly 50% by 2030[1][4].
- Linear time trends and modeling consistently show a steady increase over recent decades, with no indication of reversal[2][4].

### Recent Announcements/Policies

- As of 2018, US dietary guidelines continued to promote a low fat/high carbohydrate diet for all Americans over age 2, despite evidence favoring alternative approaches for weight management.
- No major public health initiatives or policy shifts announced between 2018 and 2025 are expected to significantly alter the trajectory of rising overweight/obesity rates.

### Authoritative Projections for 2030

| Metric                               | 2013-2014 Actual | 2030 Projected     |
|---------------------------------------|------------------|--------------------|
| Obesity (BMI ≥ 30)                    | 37.9%            | ~50%               |
| Overweight or Obese (BMI ≥ 25)        | 70.7%            | ~75–77% (estimate) |

- Several studies project that by 2030, about half of US adults will be obese[1][2][4].
- Combining obesity and overweight, a conservative and widely cited estimate is that approximately 75–77% of US adults will be overweight or obese by 2030, continuing the trend from historical data and incorporating projected increases[1][2][4].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- Forecasts are based on past trends and current policy; unexpected medical, societal, or policy changes could affect outcomes.
- CDC definitions and measurement methods may evolve, but the BMI ≥ 25 threshold remains standard.
- All statistics are subject to the accuracy of self-reported data and sampling methodology.

### Probabilistic Assessment

- There is a high probability (estimated 80%+) that the percentage of US adults overweight or obese will be between 73% and 78% in 2030, barring unexpected intervention or reversal of current trends.
- The most likely point estimate is approximately 75–77%.
