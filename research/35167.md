### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- In the 2021 German federal election, eight parties won seats in the Bundestag, while seven did so in 2017[4].
- The German party system has become increasingly fragmented, but recent polling and projections suggest a possible contraction in the number of parties represented after the 2025 election[2][5].
- The 2023 electoral reform reduces the Bundestag to 630 seats and eliminates overhang seats, but the 5% threshold and three-direct-mandate rule for party entry remain unchanged[1][3].

### Recent Polls and Projections

- As of January–February 2025, major parties projected to win seats include:
  - CDU and CSU (counted separately for this forecast)
  - SPD (Social Democratic Party)
  - AfD (Alternative for Germany)
  - Greens (Alliance 90/The Greens)
  - BSW (Bündnis Sahra Wagenknecht, a new left-wing party)[3][4][5]
- FDP (Free Democratic Party) and Die Linke (The Left) are polling below or just at the 5% threshold, with some models projecting they may not enter parliament[4][5].
- The YouGov MRP model and other polling aggregators suggest the most likely scenario is five or six parties entering the Bundestag, depending on whether FDP and/or Die Linke cross the threshold[3][4][5].

### Recent Announcements and Policies

- The 2023 law to shrink the Bundestag may make it harder for smaller parties to win seats, as there are fewer total seats and no overhang seats to boost representation[1].
- No major new parties, aside from BSW, are projected to surpass the threshold as of early 2025[5].

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The official results will be published by the Bundeswahlleiterin (Federal Returning Officer)[4].
- Polling aggregators and reputable forecasting models (e.g., YouGov, Politico, INSA) provide pre-election estimates[3][4][5].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- Both FDP and Die Linke are close to the 5% threshold; small shifts in late polling or turnout could determine whether they enter parliament[4][5].
- A party can still enter parliament by winning three direct mandates, even if below 5%, but current projections do not indicate this is likely for FDP or Die Linke[5].
- The final number of parties could be five, six, or seven, depending on these outcomes.

### Summary Table: Parties Likely to Enter the 2025 Bundestag

| Party (counted separately) | Polling/Projection Status (Feb 2025) |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| CDU                       | Very likely                          |
| CSU                       | Very likely                          |
| SPD                       | Very likely                          |
| AfD                       | Very likely                          |
| Greens                    | Very likely                          |
| BSW                       | Likely                               |
| FDP                       | Uncertain (near 5% threshold)        |
| Die Linke                  | Uncertain (near 5% threshold)        |

### Conclusion

Based on all available factual information as of February 17, 2025, the most likely range for the number of parties in the next German parliament is **five or six**, depending on whether FDP and/or Die Linke surpass the 5% threshold or win three direct mandates. The most authoritative sources for the final count will be the official results from the Bundeswahlleiterin[4].
