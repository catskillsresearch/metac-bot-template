## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- From 1990 to 2015, the global rate of extreme poverty fell from nearly 36% to 10%, averaging about a 1% drop per year[1].
- In absolute numbers, people living in extreme poverty declined from about 1.9 billion in 1990 to 736 million in 2015, and estimates for 2018 are around 650–736 million[1][3][5].
- The pace of reduction has slowed: from 2013 to 2015, the poverty rate dropped only 1 percentage point, compared to a consistent average in previous decades[1].
- Sub-Saharan Africa is the outlier: since 2015, the number of extreme poor there has actually increased, and by 2015, more poor lived there than in the rest of the world combined[1][5].

## 2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- Adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in 2015, with a specific goal to end extreme poverty by 2030, spurred new data initiatives and policy focus[1].
- However, official estimates as of 2018 noted that the decline in extreme poverty has been slowing, and projections indicate that, absent major change, poverty in Sub-Saharan Africa will remain in double digits through 2030[1][4].
- The World Bank's preliminary forecast for 2018 was an 8.6% global poverty rate, signaling slower progress[4].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- World Bank's "Poverty and Shared Prosperity 2018" report[1]
- World Bank press releases and global poverty monitoring data[4]
- Cuaresma et al. (2018) study on poverty projections[4]
- Our World in Data and Human Progress datasets[2][3]

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- Substantial regional disparities, with Sub-Saharan Africa showing rising numbers in poverty despite global declines[1][5].
- Slowing progress suggests that achieving the SDG target of fewer than 375 million in extreme poverty by 2030 would require a marked acceleration relative to the 2015–2018 trend[1][4].
- Data quality and measurement in fragile, conflict-affected states remain problematic[1].
- Scenario analysis (Cuaresma et al.) shows 2030 poverty could range from 4.5% (~375M) in the best case to nearly 6% (>500M) in less optimistic scenarios[4].

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given:
- 2018 global extreme poverty estimated at 650–736 million[1][3][5]
- Recent slowdown in poverty reduction[1][4]
- Sub-Saharan Africa's population growth and poverty trends[1][5]
- Projections showing only best-case scenarios reaching the 375M threshold by 2030[4]

**Assessment (as of late 2018):**
- The probability of global extreme poverty falling below 375 million by 2030 is **less than 50%**, and likely closer to 20–30% barring a significant acceleration in poverty reduction or major positive shocks to growth and stability in Sub-Saharan Africa.
