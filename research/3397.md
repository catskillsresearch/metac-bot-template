## 1. Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of 2016, adult obesity rates in OECD countries ranged from 4.2% (Japan) to 40% (United States), with more than half of adults and nearly one in six children overweight or obese[5].
- In the five years leading up to 2017, obesity prevalence continued to rise throughout the OECD, albeit at a slower pace than in previous decades[5].
- OECD projections as of 2017 and 2019 indicated continuing increases in adult obesity rates in all OECD countries through at least 2030[5].
- By 2022, the OECD reported that unhealthy diets and sedentary lifestyles had led to rising obesity rates in all member countries, with an average of 60% of adults overweight or obese[2].
- The World Obesity Federation projected that global obesity prevalence would continue to rise, with more than one billion people affected by 2030, and that the UN’s 2025 targets to halt obesity growth would not be met[3].

## 2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- Most OECD countries have national action plans targeting obesity and healthy diets[5].
- Policy interventions analyzed by the OECD—such as food/menu labelling, advertising restrictions, and promoting exercise—have been shown to generate positive returns and could prevent chronic disease, but their implementation and impact remain limited and fragmented[5].
- The OECD has called for more ambitious and coherent policy packages, including a 20% reduction in calorie content of energy-dense foods, which could yield significant health benefits if widely adopted[5].
- Despite these initiatives, the OECD concludes that the response “needs to be stepped up,” and no country has demonstrated a large, sustained decline in adult obesity rates as of 2019[5].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- OECD annual health statistics and country obesity updates[5].
- World Obesity Federation global obesity projections and reporting[3].
- National government health statistics agencies.

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- Obesity prevalence is measured through population surveys, which can vary in methodology and frequency. Some countries report annually, others less often.
- For resolution, three consecutive years of data showing a sustained 10% reduction (from 2016 levels) are required; reporting gaps of more than one year break the required sequence.
- The COVID-19 pandemic (2020–2022) is likely to have increased obesity rates in many countries due to lockdowns, reduced physical activity, and increased consumption of unhealthy foods, though full effects are still being measured.
- Policy impacts are often delayed, and scaling effective interventions nationally is challenging.
- Data lags mean that reductions achieved in the late 2020s may not be visible until after 2030.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given persistent upward or plateauing trends, slow policy progress, and the absence of historical precedent for such a rapid, sustained reduction, the probability that any OECD country will achieve a 10% or greater reduction in adult obesity rate for three consecutive years before 2030 is **very low (estimated at less than 2%)**. This is slightly above zero to account for the possibility of unforeseen, highly effective national interventions, but there is no evidence as of 2019–2022 that such a turnaround is underway or imminent in any OECD country[2][3][5].
