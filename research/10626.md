## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Blake Masters is a Republican politician, entrepreneur, and venture capitalist associated with Peter Thiel. He ran for U.S. Senate in Arizona in 2022 but lost to incumbent Democrat Mark Kelly by nearly 5 percentage points[2][4].
- After his Senate defeat, Masters announced a run for an open congressional seat (Arizona’s 8th district) in late 2023, forgoing a second Senate campaign[2].
- He has never held elected office as of 2025, but is active in conservative circles and aligned with the MAGA movement, receiving endorsements from Donald Trump and support from Tucker Carlson[2][4].
- Masters' policy positions are staunchly right-wing, including opposition to critical race theory, strong border enforcement, skepticism of big tech, and advocacy for traditional family economics[2][4].

## Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- Shifted from a potential 2024 Senate rematch to a House campaign for Arizona’s 8th district, indicating a tactical change in his political strategy[2].
- Maintains high-profile endorsements and financial support from Peter Thiel, but has not demonstrated statewide or national electoral success[2][4].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Official campaign website, major news outlets, and political analysis sites provide up-to-date information on Masters' career and electoral results[1][2][4][5].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- The 45-year time horizon (until 2070) introduces significant uncertainty—political landscapes, party dynamics, and public attitudes can change unpredictably.
- While Masters is young and has a long potential career ahead, as of 2025 he lacks elected experience and a broad national profile, both of which are common among successful presidential candidates.
- Historical precedent suggests that failed Senate candidates and those without prior major political office rarely ascend to the presidency, especially if their initial bids are unsuccessful[5].
- However, exceptions exist, and political comebacks are possible over long periods, especially if the candidate gains substantial experience or shifts public perception.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given these factors:
- The probability that Blake Masters will be President of the United States before 2070 is low, likely under 5%, but not zero, primarily due to his lack of electoral success and conventional political experience to date.
- The long time window and unpredictable nature of U.S. politics mean the possibility cannot be fully discounted.
