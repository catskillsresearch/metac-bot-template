## 1. Historical Trends and Current Status

- The last human lunar landing was Apollo 17 in 1972; since then, no human (public or private) has set foot on the moon.
- As of January 2021, SpaceX was rapidly expanding launch operations, but all human flights had been in low Earth orbit using Falcon 9 and Crew Dragon[2].
- SpaceX's Starship, intended for lunar and interplanetary travel, was still in high-altitude suborbital testing as of early 2021. No orbital or lunar flights had occurred[2][3].
- NASA selected SpaceX's modified Starship as a candidate for the Artemis lunar lander in April 2020, with the goal of returning astronauts to the lunar surface in the mid-2020s[5].

## 2. Key Differences Affecting the Forecast

- **Technology readiness**: Starship's lunar architecture relies on large-scale in-orbit refueling, which had not yet been demonstrated. This adds significant technical risk and potential for delays[4].
- **Private funding and flexibility**: Musk's personal wealth and leadership of SpaceX provide him with unique flexibility to pursue a personal lunar mission, independent of government schedules if desired[3].
- **Ambitious timelines**: Musk is known for setting aggressive targets, but actual timelines for new crewed capabilities (e.g., Crew Dragon) have historically lagged behind his public estimates[2][3].
- **Programmatic risk**: NASA's Artemis program and commercial lunar efforts face uncertainties in funding, technical success, and regulatory approval for human lunar landings[5].
- **Personal interest**: Musk has expressed the desire for personal space travel and even to die on Mars, but as of January 2021, had not announced any concrete plan to personally land on the moon. In December 2020, he suggested his first trip to orbit might be in "two or three years," not specifying lunar ambitions[3].

## 3. Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given these facts and trends as of January 2021:
- No human has landed on the moon in nearly 50 years.
- Starship, while promising, had not yet demonstrated orbital flight or in-space refueling.
- NASA's lunar return plans targeted mid-2020s for Artemis, but schedules were uncertain and subject to delay.
- Musk has the resources and stated interest, but no public plan to personally land on the moon by 2030.

**Probabilistic assessment (as of January 2021):**
- The likelihood that Elon Musk personally sets foot on the lunar surface before January 1, 2030 is low, but nonzero. A reasonable estimate, accounting for technical, regulatory, and personal uncertainties, would be in the 5â€“15% range.

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- Timelines for new crewed lunar vehicles are highly unpredictable and subject to both technical and political delays.
- Musk's personal risk tolerance and health over the next decade are unknown variables.
- Regulatory and international approval for private crewed lunar landings remain significant hurdles.
