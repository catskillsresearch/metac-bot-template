## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- In 2014, Scotland held a legally sanctioned independence referendum, with 55.3% voting "No" and 44.7% voting "Yes" on a high turnout of 84.6%[3].
- Since then, the political landscape has shifted. The UK voted for Brexit in 2016, but 62% of Scottish voters preferred to remain in the EU, deepening constitutional tensions between Scotland and Westminster[3].
- The Scottish National Party (SNP) consolidated its dominance in Scottish politics, winning half the seats in the 2021 Scottish Parliamentary election, despite the proportional voting system[3].
- The SNP and Scottish Government have consistently argued that circumstances have fundamentally changed since 2014, citing Brexit as a key reason to revisit independence[3].

## 2. Recent Announcements and Policies

- On June 28, 2022, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon formally proposed a second independence referendum for October 19, 2023. This was to be legally sanctioned by requesting a Section 30 order (transfer of powers from Westminster) or, failing that, testing the legality in the UK Supreme Court[5].
- The UK Government, led by Boris Johnson at the time, rejected the Section 30 request. The Scottish Government then referred the matter to the Supreme Court to determine if the Scottish Parliament could legislate for a referendum unilaterally[3][5].
- On November 23, 2022, the UK Supreme Court ruled that the Scottish Parliament does not have the power to hold an independence referendum without Westminster's consent[3].
- In response, Nicola Sturgeon announced the SNP would treat the next UK general election as a "de facto" independence referendum if legal routes to a true referendum remained blocked[3].

## 3. Key Differences Affecting the Forecast

| Factor                | 2014 Situation                          | 2022 Situation                                                    |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Legal Basis           | Section 30 order granted                | Section 30 order denied; Supreme Court blocks unilateral action   |
| UK Govt Stance        | Cooperative (Cameron)                   | Adversarial (Johnson & successors)                                |
| Scottish Mandate      | Recent SNP majority, but no clear Yes majority | SNP/Green pro-independence majority, but divided public     |
| Brexit                | Not an issue                            | Major driver of renewed independence push                         |
| Polling               | No leads for Yes pre-2014               | Polls show Yes/No roughly tied, but not consistent Yes majority   |
| Political Strategy    | Agreed single-issue referendum          | Proposing "de facto" referendum via general election              |

## 4. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Official statements from the Scottish Government and UK Government[5][3]
- Supreme Court ruling on Scottish Parliament's powers[3]
- Polling data and election results[4]
- Historical context from Wikipedia and the Institute for Government[3][2]

## 5. Limitations and Uncertainties

- The UK Government holds de facto veto power over a legal referendum, and there is no indication (as of July 2022) that this will change before 2030[3][5].
- Legal and political challenges: The Supreme Court ruling closes the main legal route for a sanctioned referendum, leaving only high-risk or contested strategies (like a "de facto" referendum)[3].
- Public opinion remains split, with no sustained majority for independence or for holding a new referendum[2][4].
- Political leadership changes in either the UK or Scotland could shift the landscape, but such changes are unpredictable.
- Even if a "de facto" referendum is attempted, it is unclear if it would be recognized as legitimate by either UK authorities or the international community, thus possibly failing the strict resolution criteria.

## 6. Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given:
- The legal and political obstacles are greater than in 2014.
- Public opinion is divided but not decisively pro-independence.
- The UK Government is resistant to a second referendum.
- Unconventional strategies (like a "de facto" referendum) face legitimacy challenges.

It is **unlikely** that Scotland will achieve recognized, legal independence from the United Kingdom before January 1, 2030. While political pressure and calls for independence will remain high, the probability of actual independence being implemented within the timeframe—given the legal, political, and procedural barriers—appears low.

**Estimated probability (as of July 2022):** 15–30%.
