### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The idea of faster-than-light (FTL) communication has been a staple of science fiction and theoretical discussions for decades, but there is no experimental evidence or accepted scientific theory supporting its feasibility as of March 20, 2023.
- The current scientific consensus, rooted in Einsteinâ€™s theory of special relativity, holds that information cannot be transmitted faster than the speed of light in a vacuum. This limitation is fundamental to causality and the structure of space-time.
- Quantum entanglement, often cited in popular accounts as a candidate for FTL communication, does not allow information to be transmitted faster than light; all experimental and theoretical results to date confirm this[1][2][3].

### Recent Announcements and Policies

- There have been no credible announcements, policy changes, or technological breakthroughs as of March 2023 that indicate progress toward FTL communication.
- Theoretical proposals occasionally surface but none have withstood scientific scrutiny or led to experimental validation.

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Mainstream physics literature and leading scientific organizations, such as the American Physical Society and peer-reviewed journals in physics, consistently reaffirm the impossibility of FTL information transfer under current theories.
- The Wikipedia entry on [Superluminal communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superluminal_communication) provides a comprehensive overview of the topic, summarizing both the scientific consensus and common misconceptions.

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- The primary limitation is not measurement, but the lack of any credible theoretical or experimental basis for FTL communication.
- The only significant uncertainty is the possibility of a future paradigm shift in physics that would overturn special relativity or introduce new mechanisms for information transfer. However, as of March 2023, this remains entirely speculative with no supporting evidence.
