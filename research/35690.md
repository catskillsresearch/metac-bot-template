# Will Amazon Still List Coca-Cola as "SNAP EBT Eligible" on April 1, 2025?

Based on the information available as of March 6, 2025, there are several factors to consider when forecasting whether Amazon will continue to list a 12-pack of Coca-Cola as "SNAP EBT eligible" on April 1, 2025.

## Current Status of SNAP EBT on Amazon

As of early 2025, Amazon does accept SNAP EBT benefits for eligible food items across all participating states in the SNAP Online Purchasing Pilot program[3]. Items that qualify for SNAP benefits on Amazon are clearly marked with a "SNAP EBT Eligible" label near the product name[1]. This labeling system helps customers identify which products can be purchased using their SNAP benefits.

For an item to be SNAP EBT eligible on Amazon, it must be:
- A food item intended for human consumption
- Shipped and sold directly by Amazon.com (not third-party sellers)[3]
- Not classified as alcoholic beverages, tobacco, or other non-eligible categories

Soft drinks, including Coca-Cola, have historically been eligible for purchase with SNAP benefits under federal guidelines. The query notes that the 12-pack of Coca-Cola was listed as "SNAP EBT eligible" on February 19, 2025.

## Recent Policy Changes

There have been some changes to the SNAP program in 2025, including:

- Expanded income eligibility thresholds (increased from 130% to 140% of the federal poverty level)[5]
- Streamlined application processes for benefits[5]

However, none of the available information indicates any changes to product eligibility categories that would specifically affect soft drinks like Coca-Cola between February 19, 2025, and April 1, 2025.

## Factors That Could Affect Eligibility Status

Several factors could potentially influence whether the Coca-Cola 12-pack remains labeled as "SNAP EBT eligible" on April 1, 2025:

1. **Federal SNAP Policy Changes**: No information is available about pending federal policy changes that would specifically remove soft drinks from SNAP eligibility by April 1, 2025.

2. **Amazon's Internal Policies**: Amazon could potentially change how they categorize or label products, but there's no indication of planned changes to their SNAP EBT labeling system.

3. **Product Classification**: If the specific Coca-Cola product were to change in some way (such as being sold by a third-party seller rather than Amazon directly), it could lose eligibility[1][3].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

The available information has several limitations:

- No specific announcements about changes to SNAP-eligible product categories that would affect soft drinks
- No direct information about Amazon's plans for the specific Coca-Cola product listing
- Limited information about any technical or system updates that might affect product labeling on Amazon

## Conclusion

Based on the available information as of March 6, 2025, there is no evidence suggesting that the 12-pack of Coca-Cola will lose its "SNAP EBT eligible" status on Amazon by April 1, 2025. The product was confirmed to have this status on February 19, 2025, and no policy changes or announcements have been identified that would affect this specific product's eligibility in the short timeframe between then and April 1, 2025.

For verification purposes, the actual Amazon product page would need to be checked on or after April 1, 2025, as specified in the resolution criteria.
