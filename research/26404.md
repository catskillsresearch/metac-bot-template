# Will Cannabis Be Removed from Schedule I Before September 30, 2024?

The question of whether cannabis will be removed from Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) before September 30, 2024, requires analysis of the current rescheduling process, its timeline, and potential influencing factors.

## Current Status and Timeline

On May 21, 2024, the Department of Justice (DOJ) published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) announcing its intention to reschedule marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III under the Controlled Substances Act[1][3]. This publication initiated a formal rulemaking process with the following key dates:

- **May 21, 2024**: NPRM published in the Federal Register
- **July 22, 2024**: End of the 62-day public comment period[2][4]

After the comment period closes, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) must review all submitted comments before issuing a final rule. The timeline for this review and finalization process is not fixed and could vary significantly.

## Rescheduling Process Steps Remaining

Following the July 22, 2024 comment deadline, these steps remain:

1. **Review of Public Comments**: The DEA must review and consider all submitted comments
2. **Final Determination**: The DEA must make a final determination on rescheduling
3. **Issuance of Final Rule or Order**: The DEA must either initiate further rulemaking proceedings or issue an order to reschedule cannabis[5]

The timeline for these remaining steps is uncertain. According to available information, this process "could happen in days, weeks, months, or even years" depending on various factors[5].

## Factors Potentially Influencing Timeline

Several factors could impact whether rescheduling occurs before September 30, 2024:

### Political Considerations

The current administration has campaigned on marijuana reform, and there may be political motivation to complete the rescheduling process before the 2024 election[5]. This political context could potentially accelerate the timeline.

### Volume and Complexity of Public Comments

The number and nature of comments received during the public comment period could significantly impact the review timeline. A high volume of complex comments would likely extend the review process.

### Legal and Regulatory Hurdles

The DOJ's proposal represents a significant shift in federal drug policy. The rescheduling would ease some restrictions on cannabis-related research but would not fully legalize cannabis-related activities permitted under state law[1]. This complexity could potentially extend the timeline.

### Historical Precedent

Previous petitions for marijuana rescheduling have been denied, primarily due to the DEA's criteria for "currently accepted medical use" (CAMU)[4]. The current proposal represents a departure from previous interpretations, which could introduce additional complexity to the process.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several uncertainties make it difficult to predict with certainty whether rescheduling will occur before September 30, 2024:

- There is no mandated timeline for the DEA to issue a final rule after the comment period
- The volume and complexity of public comments are unknown
- Potential legal challenges could delay implementation
- The process could be influenced by changing political priorities

## Conclusion

Based on the available information, cannabis could potentially be removed from Schedule I before September 30, 2024, but this timeline is tight and depends on several factors. The public comment period ends on July 22, 2024, leaving just over two months for the DEA to review comments and issue a final rule before the September 30 deadline. While political factors might accelerate this process, regulatory and administrative requirements could extend the timeline beyond the specified date.

The most critical period will be the weeks immediately following July 22, 2024, when the pace and direction of the DEA's actions will become clearer.
