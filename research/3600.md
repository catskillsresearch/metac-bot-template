# Forecast Analysis: Iowa's Future as "First in the Nation" Democratic Caucus

As of February 7, 2020, I'll assess the likelihood that Iowa will host another "first in the nation" Democratic caucus before 2029.

## Historical Context

Iowa has maintained its privileged position as the "first in the nation" caucus state since the modern primary system was established in 1972. This 48-year tradition has brought significant media attention and economic benefits to the state. The Iowa caucus process involves a distinctive format where voters physically gather and organize into preference groups, rather than casting private ballots as in traditional primaries.

The most recent Iowa Democratic caucus occurred on February 3, 2020, just days before our analysis cutoff date. This caucus experienced unprecedented problems with result reporting, creating a major controversy that has placed Iowa's special status in jeopardy. The delays in reporting results have led prominent Democratic strategists like David Plouffe to declare that "caucuses are dead" on national television.

## Key Factors Affecting the Forecast

1. **Recent Caucus Problems**: The February 2020 Iowa Democratic caucus experienced significant reporting delays and technical difficulties, creating a national controversy. This represents the most serious threat to Iowa's status to date.

2. **Party Control of Process**: The Democratic National Committee (DNC) ultimately controls the primary calendar and can change it. Historical precedent shows the DNC has maintained Iowa's position despite previous criticisms, but this most recent failure creates unprecedented pressure for change.

3. **Institutional Inertia**: Despite periodic criticisms, Iowa's position has been maintained for nearly five decades, suggesting strong institutional resistance to change.

4. **Caucus Format Criticism**: The caucus format itself (versus primary elections) has faced increasing criticism for being less accessible to voters who cannot attend lengthy evening meetings, including working parents, people with disabilities, and those working evening shifts.

5. **Iowa's Demographic Representativeness**: Iowa has faced ongoing criticism for being unrepresentative of the Democratic Party's diverse coalition, being 90.7% white compared to approximately 60% of the national Democratic electorate.

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on information available as of February 7, 2020, I estimate a **40-45% probability** that Iowa will host another "first in the nation" Democratic caucus before 2029.

This assessment reflects:

- The unprecedented nature of the 2020 reporting problems creates the strongest case yet for removing Iowa's privileged position
- The Democratic Party will likely conduct a comprehensive review of its nomination process following the 2020 election
- Historical institutional inertia provides some counterbalance to change
- The caucus format itself (as opposed to primaries) faces increasing criticism for accessibility reasons
- Growing concerns about Iowa's demographic representativeness of the Democratic coalition

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- The DNC's decision-making process is influenced by internal politics not fully visible to outside analysts
- The 2020 presidential election outcome may significantly impact party priorities
- Changes to Iowa's process could potentially preserve its "first" status while addressing some concerns (e.g., by modifying the caucus format)
- Eight years is a long forecast window, allowing time for multiple rounds of party rule changes

This forecast is based solely on information available as of February 7, 2020, just days after the problematic Iowa caucus. The situation remains highly fluid, with party discussions about the future primary calendar likely to evolve significantly in the coming months and years.
