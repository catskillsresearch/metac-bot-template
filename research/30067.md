## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of early May 2024, StatCounter’s revised data shows Google holds a 90.91% global search engine market share, down from 91.38% in March 2024 and 92.82% a year earlier. This indicates a gradual, but not precipitous, decline in Google's global dominance[3].
- Bing’s global share has increased modestly to 3.64% (up from 2.76% YoY), while Yahoo is at 1.13%[3].
- Previous reports of a dramatic drop in Google’s share in April 2024 (to as low as 86.99%) were later corrected by StatCounter, which attributed the anomaly to data issues rather than a real market shift[2][3][5].

## Recent Announcements and Policy Changes

- There have been no major announcements or policy changes from Google or Bing reported in the sources that would suggest an imminent, dramatic shift in global market share as of November 2024.
- Google’s introduction of the Search Generative Experience in May 2023 did not result in a significant immediate change in global market share, though a slow decline has continued since then[3].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- StatCounter is the primary and authoritative source for global search engine market share statistics. The relevant data can be found on their website and is referenced in industry analyses[3].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- StatCounter’s April 2024 data was subject to significant revision, and the company continues to review its data for accuracy, with further changes possible within 40 days of initial publication[3].
- While the trend is downward, the decline is gradual. There is some uncertainty due to ongoing data quality reviews, but no evidence of an imminent drop below the 90% threshold globally as of the latest available data.
- Regional market shares (e.g., U.S. at 77.52%, Europe at 89.46%) are lower, but the global figure remains above 90%[1][4][5].

## Conclusion

Based on StatCounter’s most recent, revised data and the gradual nature of Google’s market share decline, it is likely—but not absolutely certain—that Google will retain over a 90% global search engine market share on December 31, 2024. There is no evidence of a sudden competitive threat from Bing or Yahoo sufficient to push Google below this threshold in the near term, though ongoing data revisions and market dynamics warrant continued monitoring[3].
