## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- **Artificial General Intelligence (AGI):** As of April 2025, expert estimates for AGI arrival have shifted earlier. Where previous medians put a 50% chance in the 2040s or later, recent community and expert surveys suggest a 25%–40% probability of AGI by 2030, with some entrepreneurs and researchers arguing for significant odds before that date[1][3][5]. Progress in large language models, improvements in reasoning, and increased investment continue to accelerate, although no AGI announcement has occurred as of May 2025[1][5].
- **Population Shock:** No evidence suggests a sudden 10% reduction in global population is imminent. Major risks (e.g., pandemics, global wars) remain, but as of mid-2025, global population continues to grow, and Metaculus assigns only moderate (36% by 2100, less before 2030) probabilities to such events.
- **Global GDP Spike:** There has not been a single-year global real GDP increase exceeding 30% in recorded history. The probability before 2030 remains low (13%), with no sign of imminent explosive growth as of 2025.
- **Alien Technosignatures/UAPs:** No discoveries or announcements have occurred. The chances before 2030 remain extremely low (3% or less for technosignatures, 1.4% for "shocking" UAP explanation).
- **WWIII/Nuclear War:** No major escalation to global war or nuclear exchange as of May 2025. Geopolitical risks persist, but Metaculus forecasts remain below 25% for such events before 2030.

## 2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- **AI Development:** Continued rapid AI progress, but no AGI yet. Increased regulatory discussion and safety research are notable, but no policy or technical breakthrough has shifted the risk landscape dramatically since July 2024[1][3][5].
- **Geopolitics:** While 2024–2025 saw ongoing conflicts (e.g., Ukraine, Middle East), no escalation to global war or nuclear exchange has occurred.
- **Demographics/Economics:** Economic growth rates remain within historical norms. No policy changes or crises suggest a sudden population or GDP shock.

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Metaculus aggregated community probabilities (July 2024).
- Recent expert surveys and analyses on AGI timelines[1][3][5].
- Public databases for world population and GDP (UN, World Bank, IMF).
- News and scientific publications for alien discovery and geopolitics.

## 4. Limitations or Uncertainties in Measurement

- **Forecasting AGI:** Estimates vary widely, and the definition/criteria for AGI remain debated[2][5].
- **Rare Events:** Black swan events (e.g., pandemics, unprecedented wars) are hard to model and may not be fully captured by probabilistic surveys.
- **Expert Bias:** Community and expert forecasts can be influenced by recent trends and may be over- or underconfident.
- **Event Dependencies:** Some criteria (e.g., AGI and GDP spike) may be causally linked, complicating simple probability multiplication.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

- **Probability the world remains "normal" through 2030:** 
  - Using Metaculus July 2024 probabilities as a baseline, and with no major new developments by May 2025, the combined chance that *none* of the listed events occur remains high.
  - The dominant risks—AGI and major geopolitical conflict—have not materially increased in probability since July 2024.
  - The cumulative probability that the world remains "normal" through January 1, 2030, likely remains around or slightly above 50%, perhaps in the 55–65% range, reflecting continued uncertainty in AGI timelines and persistent (but not escalating) geopolitical risks[1][3][5].
