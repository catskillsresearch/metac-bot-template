As of November 1, 2024, the total number of emojis in the Unicode standard is expected to be just over 3,640 following the release of Unicode 16.0 in September 2024, which added only 7 new emoji characters. This represents a much smaller increase compared to previous years. Given this, it is highly unlikely that the total number of emojis will reach or exceed 3,900 by December 31, 2024.

The historical trend shows steady growth from 2,789 emojis in Unicode 11.0 (2018) to 3,633 in Unicode 14.0 (2021), but the recent Unicode 16.0 update signals a slowdown in emoji additions. Major platform vendors will roll out Emoji 16.0 support starting late 2024 and into 2025, but the Unicode standard itself will not have reached 3,900 emojis by the end of 2024.

Regarding the longer-term outlook, the growth trend suggests moderate increases in emoji counts in future Unicode versions, but no evidence supports a jump to 3,900 emojis by the end of 2024 or immediately thereafter. The expected Unicode 19.0 release in 2026 will likely continue this gradual growth pattern.

**In summary:** There will be fewer than 3,900 emojis in the Unicode standard on December 31, 2024.
