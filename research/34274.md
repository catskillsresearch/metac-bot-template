### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- On January 15, 2025, Israel and Hamas reached a ceasefire and hostage release agreement after 15 months of conflict[1][2][3][4].
- The agreement stipulates a three-phase process, with the first phase lasting six weeks and focusing on the release of 33 hostages (including both living and deceased)[1][2][3][4].
- The first phase began with the release of three hostages, followed by a schedule of four hostages on the seventh day, and then three hostages every subsequent week[4].
- As of January 23, 2025, Hamas had released three Israeli hostages and was reportedly planning to release "some 30 more," consistent with the official agreement for 33 total in the first phase[1][4].

### Recent Announcements and Policies

- The ceasefire and hostage release deal was brokered with international mediation, and both sides have publicly committed to the terms, though skepticism remains about the truceâ€™s durability[1][2][3].
- The agreement specifies that the hostages to be released in the first phase include women, children, men over 50, and men under 50 who are wounded or sick[1][2][4].
- The release schedule is gradual, with the process designed to last the full six weeks of the first phase[4].

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The official text of the agreement and multiple reputable news outlets confirm the plan for 33 hostages to be released in the first phase, with the process beginning in late January 2025[1][2][3][4].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- The situation remains fragile, and the ceasefire could break down, potentially disrupting the release schedule[2][3].
- The agreement allows for the release of both living and deceased hostages; the exact breakdown may vary depending on circumstances[4].
- There is no public information as of January 30, 2025, indicating a change to the agreed schedule or a plan to release more than 33 hostages in this period.

### Forecast

Based on all available information as of January 30, 2025, the most likely number of hostages Hamas will release after January 26 and before April 5, 2025, is **30-39**. This aligns with the official agreement for 33 hostages in the first phase, minus the three already released, and matches the reported plan to release "some 30 more" hostages during the ceasefire period[1][4].
