## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- **US Strategic Ambiguity**: For decades, US policy toward Taiwan has been deliberately ambiguous, balancing deterrence of Chinese aggression with discouraging a unilateral declaration of independence by Taiwan. The US has not made a formal treaty commitment to defend Taiwan, but the Taiwan Relations Act provides for US arms sales and states that any effort to determine Taiwan’s future by non-peaceful means would be of "grave concern" to the US[2][4].
- **Military Balance**: China has steadily built up military capabilities, especially "anti-access/area denial" (A2AD) systems—large inventories of missiles, submarines, and aircraft designed to threaten US forces in the Western Pacific, including US bases in Japan and Guam, as well as aircraft carriers[3]. China’s capacity for blockades and amphibious operations has increased, marked by more frequent and sophisticated joint exercises and legal/institutional moves to prepare for possible conflict[3][5].
- **US and Allied Posture**: The US maintains significant military assets in the region and closely coordinates with allies such as Japan and Australia. Recent years have seen increased joint exercises and statements of support for Taiwan from US and allied officials, though not binding security commitments[2][3].

## 2. Recent Announcements and Policy Changes

- **Biden Administration Statements**: President Biden has made multiple public statements suggesting the US would intervene militarily if China attempted to take Taiwan by force. However, the White House has repeatedly clarified that the official US policy of "strategic ambiguity" remains unchanged, walking back Biden’s remarks[2].
- **Escalating PLA Activity**: After high-profile US visits to Taiwan, China has intensified military activities around the island, including blockade rehearsals and novel use of civilian-military integration for invasion logistics[5].
- **Chinese Countermeasures**: China’s strategic planning now includes options to deter or complicate US intervention, such as threats of escalation (including nuclear), cyberattacks, and pressure on regional allies to block US access to forward bases[1].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- **Official US Policy**: The Taiwan Relations Act and major US government statements provide the legal and policy backdrop[2][4].
- **Defense Analyses**: Think tanks and military observers document the evolving military balance and Chinese doctrinal innovations[1][3][5].
- **Independent Media**: Outlets like CNN and The New York Times report on public statements and crisis events.

## 4. Key Differences Affecting the Forecast

| Factor                     | Historical Cases (e.g. Korea, Ukraine) | Current Taiwan Scenario (2022)           |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| US Security Commitment     | Clear treaty (Korea), none (Ukraine)   | Strategic ambiguity (Taiwan Relations Act)|
| Opponent’s Capabilities    | Limited nuclear/threats (Korea)        | Nuclear-armed peer, A2AD, modern PLA     |
| Allied Support             | NATO/UN (Korea), NATO (Ukraine)        | US-centric, some allied support          |
| US Political Will          | Bipartisan in Korea, polarized Ukraine | Divided, public statements ambiguous     |
| Risk of Escalation         | Moderate (Korea), nuclear taboo (Ukraine) | High (potential nuclear escalation)      |

**Key differences**:
- China’s military can threaten US regional assets more effectively than past adversaries.
- The risk of nuclear escalation is higher, making US decision-making more cautious.
- The US has not formalized a clear security commitment to Taiwan, and ambiguity remains central to policy.
- Chinese strategies increasingly focus on deterring US intervention through legal, military, and economic means[1][5].

## 5. Probabilistic Assessment (as of 2022-05-29)

- **Baseline (pre-2022)**: Most experts assessed the probability of direct US military intervention as significant but uncertain—possibly in the 25–50% range if China launched a full-scale invasion.
- **Adjustment Factors**:
  - Biden’s repeated statements of intended military support, though walked back, suggest increased executive readiness for intervention[2].
  - China’s A2AD build-up and nuclear signaling raise the risks and costs for US intervention, possibly deterring action or delaying decision-making[1][3].
  - The lack of a formal treaty and ongoing US policy ambiguity continue to generate uncertainty[2][4].
  - PLA’s new tactics—blockades, civilian-military fusion—could create ambiguous scenarios complicating a clear US military response[5].

Taking these into account, a prudent forecast as of 2022-05-29 would be:

> "If China launches a clear, full-scale invasion of Taiwan before 2035, there is a substantial but not overwhelming probability (estimated at 40–60%) that the US would respond with military force within 365 days, as defined by direct offensive attacks on Chinese military targets. The probability is higher if the attack is unambiguous and the US perceives its credibility, regional security, or alliance commitments to be at stake. However, significant deterrence and escalation risks temper this likelihood." 

## 6. Limitations and Uncertainties

- US domestic politics, leadership changes, and public opinion could shift over time.
- China might use gray-zone tactics or ambiguous aggression, complicating US response criteria.
- The risk of nuclear or large-scale regional escalation may deter US action.
- Measurement is limited by the unpredictability of future leadership decisions and crisis dynamics.
