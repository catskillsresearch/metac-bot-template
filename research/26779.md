## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- From 2014 to 2023, the Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue metro area experienced highly variable numbers of days with AQI above 150 in Q3, ranging from 0 to 11 days per year. Only 2017 and 2022 reached or exceeded 11 days, while most years had fewer than 5 such days.
- Wildfire smoke is the dominant cause of unhealthy air quality in the region during summer and early fall, with the worst episodes typically occurring in August and September.
- As of July 29, 2024, there has been only one day in Q3 with AQI above 150 (July 5, AQI 166)[1].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- There are no major new policies or announcements as of the cutoff date that would significantly alter wildfire risk or air quality monitoring in the Seattle area for Q3 2024.
- The Washington State Department of Ecology and the EPA continue to monitor and report air quality using established AQI protocols[1].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The EPA's outdoor air quality data tool is the official source for daily AQI values and will be used for final resolution.
- The Washington State Department of Ecology provides real-time and historical AQI data for the region[1].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- Forecasting the number of high AQI days is inherently uncertain due to the unpredictable nature of wildfires and weather patterns.
- While climate change has increased the risk of wildfire smoke events in the Pacific Northwest, historical data shows that years with 11 or more days above AQI 150 remain relatively rare.
- Measurement is robust, but localized smoke events or rapid changes in weather can cause significant day-to-day variation.

## Summary

Based on historical trends, the current status as of July 29, 2024 (one day above AQI 150), and the absence of major wildfire events or policy changes, there is no strong factual basis as of the cutoff date to expect that the Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue WA metro area will experience 11 or more days with an AQI above 150 in Q3 2024. However, the possibility cannot be ruled out due to the unpredictable nature of wildfire smoke events.
