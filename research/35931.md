# Project 2025 Tracker Implementation Forecast Analysis

Based on the information available as of March 14, 2025, I'll analyze the likelihood of the Project 2025 Tracker classifying at least 120 objectives as "Done" by April 1, 2025.

## Current Status and Implementation Progress

The Project 2025 Tracker (project2025.observer) is actively monitoring the implementation of various policy objectives outlined in the Project 2025 plan. As of the data available, the tracker indicates there are "87 completed objectives remaining"[1]. This suggests that implementation of Project 2025 is already underway, with multiple objectives either completed or in progress.

The implementation appears to be proceeding at a steady pace, with specific objectives scheduled throughout March and April 2025. For example, the tracker shows several objectives scheduled for completion in March 2025, including:

- March 27, 2025: Weaken federal employee unions
- March 21, 2025: Eliminate the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties
- March 21, 2025: Eliminate the Office of Immigration Detention Ombudsman
- March 21, 2025: Eliminate the Office of the Citizenship and Immigration Services Ombudsman
- March 20, 2025: Expand energy exploration and extraction in Alaska[1]

Additionally, several objectives are scheduled for April 2025:
- April 11, 2025: Create a "single nationwide detention standard" for temporary facilities
- April 8, 2025: Reduce regulations on cryptocurrencies
- April 8, 2025: Lift the coal leasing moratorium
- April 1, 2025: Restrict the Low-Income Heat and Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP)[1]

## Implementation Factors

A significant factor supporting the implementation pace is that "Donald Trump has put many of Project 2025's authors in top-level positions in his administration and they've already started implementing it"[5]. This strategic placement of Project 2025 architects in key government positions suggests a coordinated effort to execute the plan's objectives.

However, it's also noted that "these plans are still deeply unpopular. Only 13% of Americans support Project 2025"[5]. This public opposition could potentially slow implementation through legal challenges, public pressure, or congressional resistance.

## Tracking and Verification

Multiple organizations are monitoring the implementation of Project 2025:

- The Project 2025 Executive Action Tracker by the Center for Progressive Reform[3]
- RedWine.Blue's tracking of Project 2025 implementation[5]
- Harvard's Regulatory Tracker and Environmental Justice Tracker, which monitor related regulatory actions[4]
- The Sabin Center Climate Backtracker, which tracks climate-related policy changes[4]

These multiple tracking efforts suggest robust verification mechanisms are in place to accurately classify objectives as "Done" when they are completed.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several limitations affect the forecast:

1. The available data doesn't explicitly state the total number of objectives in Project 2025, making it difficult to determine what percentage have been completed.

2. The phrase "87 completed objectives remaining"[1] is ambiguous - it could mean either that 87 objectives have been completed or that 87 objectives remain to be completed.

3. The pace of implementation may be affected by legal challenges, as suggested by tracking efforts focused on "legal challenges to Trump Administration actions"[4].

4. Public opposition (only 13% support)[5] could potentially slow implementation through various resistance mechanisms.

5. The available information doesn't specify the criteria used by the Project 2025 Tracker to classify an objective as "Done," which could affect the count.

## Conclusion

Based on the information available as of March 14, 2025, there is evidence of active implementation of Project 2025 objectives, with strategic placement of its authors in key government positions. However, without clearer data on the total number of objectives and the exact number already classified as "Done," it's difficult to make a precise forecast about whether 120 objectives will be classified as "Done" by April 1, 2025.

The scheduled objectives for late March 2025 suggest continued implementation momentum, but public opposition and potential legal challenges represent countervailing forces that could affect the pace of implementation.
