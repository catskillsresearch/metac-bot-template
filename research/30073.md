To forecast whether the United Nations will have exactly 193 member states on December 31, 2024, we need to examine the current membership status, recent developments regarding potential new members, and the formal process for UN admission.

## Current UN Membership Status

As of early 2024, the United Nations has 193 member states[3]. The last country to join was South Sudan in 2011, meaning there has been no change in membership for over a decade. For the forecast to be accurate (the UN having exactly 193 member states on December 31, 2024), either no new members would be admitted during 2024, or an exactly offsetting number of admissions and withdrawals would need to occur.

## UN Membership Process

The process for admitting new members to the United Nations follows specific steps outlined in the UN Charter:

1. A state submits an application letter to the Secretary-General
2. The Secretary-General refers the application to the Security Council
3. The Security Council establishes a committee to consider the application
4. The Security Council must recommend admission with at least 9 affirmative votes and no vetoes from permanent members
5. The General Assembly must then approve admission with a two-thirds majority vote[3][4]

This multi-step process is deliberately rigorous and can be lengthy, requiring broad international consensus and avoiding opposition from any permanent Security Council member.

## Palestine's Membership Bid

The most active current candidate for UN membership is Palestine, which has been pursuing full membership for years:

- Palestine first applied for UN membership in September 2011[3]
- In November 2012, Palestine was granted non-member observer state status[2][5]
- On April 2, 2024, Palestine requested renewed consideration of its membership application[2][5]
- The Security Council agreed to reconsider Palestine's application in April 2024[2]
- On April 18, 2024, a Security Council resolution recommending Palestine's admission was vetoed by one permanent member, preventing its advancement[1][5]
- On May 9-10, 2024, the UN General Assembly passed a resolution expressing support for Palestine's admission and calling on the Security Council to reconsider its decision[1][5]

Despite significant support in both the Security Council (12 members voted in favor) and the General Assembly, Palestine's path to full membership remains blocked by the Security Council veto[1]. Without a change in position from the vetoing permanent member, Palestine is unlikely to achieve full membership in 2024.

## Other Potential UN Membership Candidates

Several other entities could theoretically seek UN membership, though all face significant obstacles:

- Kosovo: Partially recognized but faces opposition from Russia and China, among others
- Taiwan: Functions independently but China opposes its recognition as a sovereign state
- South Ossetia and Abkhazia: Limited international recognition
- Northern Cyprus: Recognized only by Turkey

None of these entities appear to have active, advancing membership applications as of mid-2024, making their admission before the end of 2024 highly unlikely.

## Historical Context and Trends

The pace of new UN membership has slowed considerably in recent decades:

- 1945: 51 original members
- 1960s: Significant expansion during decolonization
- 1990s: Another wave following the dissolution of the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia
- 2011: Last admission (South Sudan)

This historical pattern suggests that new memberships typically follow major geopolitical shifts or the creation of widely recognized new states, neither of which appears imminent in 2024.

## Assessment for December 31, 2024

Based on the available evidence, the most likely outcome is that the UN will still have exactly 193 member states on December 31, 2024. Palestine's membership bid, while having substantial support, remains blocked at the Security Council level as of May 2024[1]. The formal requirements for membership and the veto power of permanent Security Council members create significant hurdles for any new admissions in the short term.

For the number to change, either:
1. A permanent Security Council member would need to change its position on Palestine's application
2. A new widely recognized state would need to emerge and complete the full application process
3. An existing member would need to withdraw

None of these scenarios appears likely to materialize before the end of 2024 based on current information.
