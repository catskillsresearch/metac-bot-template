# Will YouTube be Banned in Russia Before October 1, 2024?

YouTube currently stands as the last major free social media platform available in Russia, with over 93 million monthly users[1]. However, recent developments suggest that its continued availability in the country is increasingly threatened. Below is an analysis of the current situation and factors that may influence whether YouTube will be banned in Russia before October 1, 2024.

## Current Status of YouTube in Russia

As of July 2024, YouTube remains accessible in Russia, though with significant and increasing restrictions. The platform has become a vital channel for dissenting viewpoints as the Kremlin has clamped down on internet and media freedoms over the past decade[2]. For exiled Russian opposition and independent media, YouTube represents a critical means of reaching millions inside Russia and countering state propaganda[2].

YouTube's position in Russia is described by experts as "the last bastion of free expression and information" in the country[1]. Unlike other major Western platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter (which were blocked shortly after Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022), YouTube has thus far avoided a complete ban.

## Recent Actions Against YouTube

In late July 2024, Russian authorities began implementing measures to throttle YouTube's performance:

- Russian lawmakers announced that the country would start throttling YouTube loading speeds on desktop browsers by up to 70%[2]
- By the end of July 2024, YouTube download speeds on desktop computers in Russia were expected to drop by 40%, and by the end of the following week by 70%[5]
- The Russian government deliberately chose summer for implementing these slowdowns since "the majority of people are on vacation and use mobile devices to access the internet"[5]

These slowdowns appear to have been prompted by YouTube's decision to block pro-war musical acts and pro-government channels from its platform[2]. Russian authorities have framed these actions as a response to YouTube's "anti-Russian policy" and its removal of "channels of our public figures — bloggers, journalists, artists — whose position differs from the Western point of view"[5].

## Official Statements and Timeline Indications

Several statements from Russian officials suggest that a complete ban may be imminent:

- On July 25, 2024, Aleksandr Khinshtein, who heads a parliamentary committee on technology, stated that the "degradation" of YouTube is a "forced step" against the platform for violating Russian legislation[3]
- Khinshtein warned: "The future of YouTube in Russia depends solely on itself. If it doesn't change its policy and doesn't begin to comply with our laws, nothing good awaits it here"[5]
- There are reports indicating that "The Russian government plans to block YouTube by September"[4], which falls within the timeframe specified in the question

Russian authorities have explicitly stated that they are "actively developing" alternative domestic platforms, including Rutube and VK Video, to replace YouTube[5]. This development of alternatives typically precedes the banning of foreign platforms, as seen with previous social media restrictions.

## Expert Assessments

Analysts who study Russia's internet policies have concluded that "it is not a question of if but when" YouTube will be banned in Russia[1]. The throttling measures are viewed as a preliminary step toward a complete ban, with Khinshtein stating that "the platform itself will see that the state has moved from persuasion to concrete steps"[5].

The measure against YouTube is described as "one of Russia's latest steps to isolate its internet from the rest of the world"[5]. This follows a pattern of increasing internet isolation, including recent requests to Apple to remove dozens of virtual private network (VPN) services from the Russian version of the App Store[5].

## Technical and Social Considerations

Several factors have previously deterred Russia from banning YouTube:

- The platform's role in entertainment
- Potential backlash from society
- Technical challenges due to YouTube's vast data volume, which makes monitoring and blocking more resource-intensive[1]

However, the recent throttling suggests that authorities may have overcome these hesitations or found technical solutions to implement a ban.

## Conclusion

Based on the available information as of July 2024, there are strong indications that YouTube may be banned in Russia before October 1, 2024. The explicit statements about plans to block the platform by September[4], combined with the progressive throttling already underway and official warnings about YouTube's future in Russia, suggest that a complete ban is likely unless YouTube changes its policies to comply with Russian demands—something that appears unlikely given the platform's global standards and previous responses to similar situations in other countries.

The throttling measures appear to be a calculated first step toward a complete ban, with Russian authorities explicitly framing them as a warning to the platform. The timing of these actions, with a potential complete ban suggested for September 2024, falls within the timeframe specified in the question.
