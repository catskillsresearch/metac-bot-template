### Forecasting Acres Burned in California by March 4, 2025

**Key Historical Trends and Current Status**  
- By January 29, 2025, four major wildfires in Southern California had burned approximately 57,529 acres, including the Palisades Fire (23,448 acres) and Eaton Fire, among others. These fires were among the most destructive and deadliest in recent California history, with over 28 fatalities and more than 16,000 structures destroyed.  
- The fires were largely contained by the end of January 2025, with containment levels reaching 90% or more by late January.  
- The January 2025 fires are unusual for occurring so early in the year, as California’s wildfire season typically peaks in summer and fall.  

**Environmental and Weather Conditions**  
- The fires were fueled by severe Santa Ana winds and persistent drought conditions, which are expected to continue into early 2025 despite some recent rains.  
- These conditions could allow for additional fire activity or expansion of existing fires before March 4, 2025.  

**Projections and Boundaries**  
- As of late January, the burned acreage was just below the lower bound of 60,000 acres set for the forecast question.  
- Given containment progress and ongoing dry conditions, it is reasonable to expect the total acreage burned by March 4, 2025, to be slightly above 60,000 acres but likely below 100,000 acres.  
- The official figure will be reported by CAL FIRE on their statistics page under "2025 Combined YTD" and will be the authoritative source for the final number.  

**Limitations and Uncertainties**  
- The number of acres burned could increase if new fires start or if containment efforts face setbacks.  
- CAL FIRE acreage estimates may be revised as mapping and investigations continue.  
- The unusual timing of the fires adds uncertainty to typical seasonal expectations.  

**Authoritative Sources for Verification**  
- California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE) official incidents and statistics pages.  
- CAL FIRE’s "2025 Combined YTD" acreage burned figure on their statistics page as of March 4, 2025.

### Summary  
As of early February 2025, about 57,500 acres have burned in California’s major January wildfires. Given containment and weather conditions, the total acreage burned by March 4, 2025, is expected to be just above 60,000 acres, within the forecast bounds. The exact number will be confirmed by CAL FIRE’s official statistics on that date.
