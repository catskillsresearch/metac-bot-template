## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Joe Biden’s executive order issuance has declined since his first year, with recent monthly counts typically ranging from 0 to 4 per month[5].
- In November 2024, Biden signed one executive order, bringing his total to 143[5].
- In previous years, December executive order counts were: 6 (2021), 2 (2022), and 3 (2023), indicating some precedent for multiple orders in December[5].
- There is no evidence of a significant increase in executive orders immediately following Election Day in prior years.

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- In his final months, Biden has signed executive orders on gun violence and labor standards, showing continued use of executive authority late in his term.
- The only confirmed executive order after Election Day and before December 6, 2024, is the November 21, 2024, order regarding the New Jersey transit union dispute[5].
- No public announcements suggest a planned surge of executive orders in December 2024.

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The Federal Register’s executive order database is the primary source for official counts[2][3].
- The White House’s Presidential Actions portal also lists executive orders by date signed[1].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- As of December 6, 2024, there is no data on executive orders signed after November 21, 2024.
- December has historically seen between 2 and 6 executive orders, but there is no guarantee this pattern will repeat.
- Executive orders are sometimes signed and published with a delay, so final counts may not be immediately available.

## Summary Table: Biden Executive Orders, Nov–Dec (Recent Years)

| Year | November | December |
|------|----------|----------|
| 2021 | 4        | 6        |
| 2022 | 0        | 2        |
| 2023 | 1        | 3        |
| 2024 | 1        | ?        |

## Conclusion

As of December 6, 2024, only one executive order is confirmed to have been signed by President Biden after Election Day. While historical patterns suggest it is possible for two or more additional executive orders to be signed in December, there is no direct evidence yet to confirm or refute that three or more will be signed in total before January 1, 2025. The outcome remains uncertain and will depend on Biden’s actions in the remainder of December, which should be tracked via the Federal Register and White House portals.
