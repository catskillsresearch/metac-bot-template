### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The global average surface air temperature in February 2025 was 13.36°C, which is 0.63°C above the 1991-2020 average for February and 1.59°C above pre-industrial levels, making it the third warmest February on record[5].
- From September 2023 to February 2025, 13 out of 19 months saw global temperatures substantially above 1.5°C relative to pre-industrial levels, indicating a persistent period of record warmth[5].
- The warming trend is linked to widespread above-average sea surface temperatures, especially in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans, with the Pacific transitioning to ENSO-neutral conditions[1][2].

### Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Metric

- The WMO's seasonal climate updates for March–May and April–June 2025 forecast a high probability of above-normal temperatures for nearly all land areas, driven by continued oceanic warmth and a neutral ENSO state[1][2].
- No major new climate policies or interventions have been announced that would significantly alter global surface air temperatures in the short term.

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The ERA5 dataset from Copernicus Climate Change Service is the definitive source for daily global surface air temperature, including the value for April 1, 2025[4].
- The WMO provides seasonal climate outlooks and analysis of oceanic and atmospheric drivers[1][2].
- NOAA’s Global Climate Reports offer monthly summaries and context for ongoing trends[3].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- There is inherent uncertainty in monthly and daily global temperature estimates due to differences among datasets and the methods used to calculate anomalies[5].
- Natural variability, such as short-term weather fluctuations and transitions in ENSO, can cause deviations from projected trends[2].
- The precise daily value for April 1, 2025, will only be available after Copernicus publishes the finalized ERA5 data.

### Summary Forecast

Based on the persistent record warmth through early 2025, the continued above-normal sea surface temperatures, and authoritative seasonal forecasts, it is highly likely that the global surface air temperature on April 1, 2025, will remain well above the 1991-2020 average, likely in the range of 13.3–14.0°C (absolute), and more than 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, consistent with recent months[5][1][2]. The exact value will be determined by the ERA5 dataset as reported by Copernicus.
