# Global Surface Air Temperature Forecast for April 1, 2025

Based on available climate data and forecasts as of March 20, 2025, here is an analysis to help predict the global surface air temperature for April 1, 2025.

## Historical Trends and Current Status

The global climate has been experiencing significant warming in recent years:

- 2024 was the warmest year on record, exceeding 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels for the first time[5]
- 2023 was the previous warmest year, with temperatures 1.45°C above pre-industrial levels[5]
- 2025 is forecast to be among the top three warmest years on record, with a central estimate of 1.41°C above pre-industrial levels (range: 1.29°C to 1.53°C)[5]
- 2025 will likely be the twelfth consecutive year with temperatures at least 1.0°C above pre-industrial levels[5]

## Recent Climate Conditions and Forecasts

The most recent Global Seasonal Climate Update from the World Meteorological Organization provides specific insights for April 2025:

- Sea surface temperature anomalies in the Niño 3.4 and Niño 3 regions are forecast to decline to near-average levels by April-June 2025, indicating a neutral ENSO state[1]
- Despite this neutral ENSO state, above-normal temperatures are predicted for nearly all land areas during April-June 2025[1]
- Areas with the highest probability of above-normal temperatures include:
  - The Arabian Peninsula extending eastward into Eastern Asia
  - The Maritime Continent
  - A horseshoe pattern from the Maritime Continent into the North and South Pacific
  - The region between 45°N and 20°S encompassing North and South America
  - The Caribbean
  - Northern Africa extending into Europe
  - New Zealand[1]

The transition from La Niña conditions is noteworthy, as Professor Adam Scaife of the Met Office pointed out: "Interestingly, the warm 2025 predicted global temperatures occur despite the tropical Pacific moving towards a La Niña phase which is driving slightly cooler conditions."[5]

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

For verifying the actual temperature on April 1, 2025, the following sources are most relevant:

1. **Copernicus Climate Change Service** - Their Climate Pulse platform will provide the ERA5 data specified in the resolution criteria[4]
2. **World Meteorological Organization (WMO)** - Provides global seasonal climate updates and forecasts[1][2]
3. **NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI)** - Produces monthly global climate reports[3]
4. **UK Met Office** - Provides annual global temperature outlooks and analyses[5]

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors introduce uncertainty into temperature forecasts for a specific date:

- The forecast for April 1 specifically is challenging as most climate predictions are provided as seasonal averages (e.g., April-June)[1][2]
- The transition from La Niña to neutral ENSO conditions creates additional variability in short-term temperature patterns[1]
- While 2025 is expected to be among the warmest years on record, day-to-day and week-to-week variations can still occur[5]
- The Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) index is expected to trend toward below-average, which could influence global temperature patterns[1]
- The Met Office forecast provides a range (1.29°C to 1.53°C above pre-industrial levels), indicating inherent uncertainty in the annual average[5]

Given these factors, while April 1, 2025, is likely to show above-average temperatures globally based on the seasonal forecasts, the exact temperature value will depend on short-term weather patterns that cannot be precisely predicted months in advance.
