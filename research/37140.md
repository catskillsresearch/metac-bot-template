## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Florida is a leading state for UFO sightings, with cities like Orlando, Miami, and Jacksonville consistently ranking high in total reports[1][4].
- Since 1974, Florida has logged over 11,000 UFO sightings, making it one of the top states nationally, but California remains the clear leader with over 36,000 sightings[5].
- Per capita, Florida ranks high but is outpaced by smaller states like Vermont for sightings per 10,000 residents[2].
- The National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC) is the authoritative source for these statistics and provides state-by-state breakdowns[3].

## Recent Announcements or Policies

- There have been no recent announcements, policy changes, or unique events in Florida that would likely drive a spike in pilot-specific UFO reports for June 2025.
- Nationally, UFO/UAP reporting has increased, but this trend is not unique to Florida[2].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC) will publish the relevant June 2025 pilot report data for each state at their official site[3].
- Local and national news outlets periodically summarize and analyze NUFORC data[1][4][5].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- Pilot reports are a subset of all UFO sightings and may not follow the same distribution as general reports.
- Month-to-month variation is significant and can be influenced by factors such as weather, air traffic, and local events.
- The forecast is limited by the absence of June 2025 data and the inherent unpredictability of UFO sighting reports.
- If Florida ties with another state, the resolution is “No” per the question’s criteria.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given California’s historical dominance in total UFO reports and the absence of new factors favoring Florida, it is unlikely that Florida will have the most pilot UFO sightings in June 2025. The probability that Florida leads all states in this metric for June 2025 is low.
