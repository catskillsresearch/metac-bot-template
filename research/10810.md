### 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of May 2025, Russia has not lost significant territory relative to its internationally recognized borders as of January 1, 2022. Instead, since February 24, 2022, Russia has gained control of additional Ukrainian territory, totaling approximately 12% of Ukraine (27,410 square miles), and currently controls about 19% of Ukraine (44,035 square miles), including Crimea and parts of Donbas[1][2].
- There are minor Ukrainian incursions into Russian territory (Kursk and Belgorod regions), where Ukraine has held up to 5 square miles as of May 2025, but this represents a negligible fraction of Russia’s total area (over 6.6 million square miles)[1].
- Historically, the last major instance of Russian (or Soviet) territorial loss occurred with the dissolution of the USSR in 1991, when Russia lost control over multiple now-independent states. Since then, the Russian Federation has not experienced territorial loss on this scale.

### 2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- As of the latest authoritative reporting (May 2025), there is no evidence of widespread separatist movements successfully gaining and holding Russian territory, nor is there documented collapse of central authority in Russia’s Far East or other regions alluded to in Mesík's prediction[1][2][3].
- Russia’s territorial gains in Ukraine have slowed but remain positive; military setbacks or economic sanctions have not yet translated into significant, sustained territorial losses for the Russian state[2][3].
- Ukrainian armed forces have made only minor, temporary incursions into Russian border regions, without establishing persistent control over any significant area[1].

### 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Russia Matters’ War Report Cards, based on data from the Institute for the Study of War, provide detailed and up-to-date assessments of Russian and Ukrainian territorial control[1][2].
- The Institute for the Study of War maintains interactive maps and conflict assessments that corroborate these findings[3][5].

### 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- "De facto" control can be ambiguous in regions with ongoing partisan or guerrilla activity, but the resolution criteria require 30 consecutive days of lost control, which is not supported by current evidence.
- Internal Russian instability remains possible, but as of May 2025, there are no large-scale, sustained separatist movements or regional collapses.
- Predictive uncertainty remains due to potential for unforeseen crises (e.g., leadership turmoil, economic collapse, or external intervention), but no current trend points toward imminent loss of 20% of territory.

### Probabilistic Assessment (as of May 30, 2025)

- Russia has not lost, and is not on track to lose, at least 20% of its January 2022 territory for 30 consecutive days before 2028, as per all available data.
- Compared to the reference case of the USSR’s collapse, current Russia shows far less fragmentation or regional separatism.
- Adjusted probability of Russia losing ≥20% of its territory before 2028: **Very low (likely <5%)**, barring a dramatic and currently unforeseen development.
