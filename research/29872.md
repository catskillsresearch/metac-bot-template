## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of November 8, 2024, the total number of active US drilling rigs stood at 585, according to Baker Hughes. This figure has remained unchanged for three consecutive weeks, marking a period of stability not seen since at least 1987[4].
- The rig count is 31 rigs (5%) lower than the same week in 2023, continuing a downward trend that began after the post-pandemic recovery. The count dropped about 20% in 2023, after rising by 33% in 2022 and 67% in 2021[4].
- The decline in rig activity has been attributed to lower oil and gas prices, increased labor and equipment costs, and a strategic industry shift toward debt reduction and shareholder returns rather than aggressive production growth[4].
- Historical averages show much higher rig counts, but recent years have seen significant volatility, with a record low of 244 rigs in August 2020 and a high of 4,530 in December 1981[5].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- There have been no major policy changes or industry announcements as of early November 2024 that would suggest a rapid increase in drilling activity before the end of the month.
- Market conditions remain subdued, with US oil futures down about 2% year-to-date and gas futures up 6% after a sharp decline in 2023[4].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The Baker Hughes North American Rotary Rig Count is the industry standard for tracking active drilling rigs in the US. The most recent and historical data can be accessed directly from Baker Hughes[1][3].
- YCharts also provides weekly updates on the US rotary rig count, with the latest available data confirming the 585 rig figure for early November 2024[2].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- The rig count is a lagging indicator and can be affected by sudden changes in commodity prices, geopolitical events, or regulatory actions.
- While the current trend is stable or slightly downward, unforeseen market shocks could alter activity levels.
- Data is typically updated weekly, so short-term fluctuations may not be immediately reflected.

## Conclusion

Based on the most recent data and prevailing trends as of November 8, 2024, it is unlikely that the number of active US drilling rigs will exceed 590 on November 29, 2024. The rig count has remained steady at 585 for several weeks, with no indications of an imminent increase[4][2].
