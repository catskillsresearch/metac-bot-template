As of September 4, 2024, "Rockstar" by Lisa is nominated for Best K-Pop at the 2024 MTV Video Music Awards alongside strong competitors such as "Seven" by Jungkook featuring Latto and "LALALALA" by Stray Kids. Lisa’s song has also earned multiple other nominations, indicating strong recognition. However, Jungkook’s "Seven" is also a major contender given his global popularity and multiple nominations.

The 2024 MTV VMAs ceremony is scheduled for September 10, 2024, and the winner of Best K-Pop will be officially announced then. Until the results are published by MTV or updated on the Wikipedia page for the 2024 MTV Video Music Awards, it is not possible to definitively say whether "Rockstar" by Lisa will win.

Key points for forecasting:
- Lisa’s "Rockstar" has strong artistic recognition and fan support.
- Jungkook’s "Seven" is a formidable competitor with significant fanbase and critical acclaim.
- Public voting closed on August 30, 2024, influencing the outcome.
- The final winner will be confirmed only after the awards ceremony on September 10, 2024.

Therefore, the forecast remains uncertain, with both "Rockstar" and "Seven" as leading contenders for Best K-Pop at the 2024 MTV VMAs[1][2][3][4].
