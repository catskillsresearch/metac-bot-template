- In December 2022, the highest high was 74°F, and in December 2023, it reached 84°F, which is notably above the long-term average and represents an unusual event[3].

### Recent Announcements or Policies

- There are no recent announcements or policy changes that would directly impact the temperature in Phoenix for December 2024.

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The Iowa Environmental Mesonet (IEM) is the designated source for daily high temperature data at the Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport station, which will be used for official resolution[1].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- While December 2023 saw an anomalously high temperature of 84°F, such events are rare and not indicative of the typical December climate in Phoenix[3].
- Weather is inherently variable, and while historical trends suggest highs below 80°F, the possibility of a short-lived heat wave cannot be entirely ruled out.
- Measurement uncertainties are minimal, as the data are collected and reported by the National Weather Service and made available through the IEM[1].
- Only the data calendar posted at the Iowa State University Mesonet will be considered for resolution; missing data coded as "MM" will not count toward the outcome.

### Summary

Based on historical data and climatological norms, it is highly likely—but not certain—that Phoenix, AZ will remain below 80°F for every day in December 2024. December 2023 was an outlier, but the long-term trend supports highs in the 60s and 70s. The official outcome will be determined by the IEM data for the Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport station.
