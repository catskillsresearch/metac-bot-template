## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The two-child benefit cap, introduced in 2017, restricts child-related benefits to the first two children in a family receiving Universal Credit or Child Tax Credit. It is widely recognized as a significant driver of child poverty in the UK, affecting approximately 1 in 10 children and contributing to record levels of child poverty[1][3].
- The policy has been criticized by anti-poverty organizations, experts, and parliamentary committees, who argue that abolishing it would be the most cost-effective way to reduce child poverty, potentially lifting 300,000 children out of poverty at a cost of £1.7 billion per year[1][3].
- Despite these arguments, the cap remains in force as of July 31, 2024[2][4].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- The Labour government, under Prime Minister Keir Starmer, has not committed to abolishing the two-child benefit cap, citing financial constraints and the need for a broader, evidence-based anti-poverty strategy[2].
- In July 2024, the SNP tabled an amendment to the King's Speech calling for the abolition of the cap. The amendment was defeated, and seven Labour MPs who voted in favor were suspended, highlighting internal divisions but not signaling a policy shift[2].
- Labour leadership has emphasized fiscal responsibility and has not included abolition of the cap in its immediate legislative agenda[2][4].
- There are plans to develop a cross-government child poverty strategy and reform Universal Credit, but these do not include a commitment to abolish the cap before October 1, 2024[1][2].

## Parliamentary and Public Opinion

- The most recent YouGov polling indicates that 60% of the general public, and 50% of Labour supporters, oppose lifting the cap, suggesting limited political incentive for rapid action[2].
- Parliamentary records as of July 31, 2024, show no bills or government announcements indicating the cap will be abolished before October 1, 2024[2][4].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- While there is significant advocacy and ongoing debate, no official government action or legislative process is underway that would result in the complete abolition of the two-child benefit cap before the specified deadline.
- The only plausible routes for abolition—a standalone bill or inclusion in a finance bill—have not been initiated or announced as of the cutoff date[2].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The UK Parliament’s official bills register and government announcements are the definitive sources for confirming any change in the law.
- Major policy research organizations and anti-poverty coalitions provide ongoing analysis and advocacy but cannot substitute for official legislative action.

## Conclusion

Based on all available factual information as of July 31, 2024, there is no evidence that the UK government will abolish the two-child benefit cap before October 1, 2024. The cap remains in force, with no official government commitment or legislative process underway to remove it within the required timeframe.
