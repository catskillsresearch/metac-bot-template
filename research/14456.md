## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Ukraine’s exports peaked at $81.53 billion in 2021, with steady growth prior to Russia’s invasion[2].
- The 2022 war caused a dramatic collapse in both production and exports, particularly in grains and metals.
- While 2023–2024 saw partial recovery—helped by reopening sea corridors—2025 is witnessing renewed declines.
- In 2025, both grain and metals exports—Ukraine’s largest earners—are falling. Grain exports are predicted to decline 26%, corn by 33%, and iron ore exports by 20% from recent levels[1][5].

## 2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- The expiry of the EU’s tariff-free arrangement is making Ukrainian exports less competitive in Europe[1].
- Global oversupply and competition are depressing grain and metal prices, further reducing export revenues[1][5].
- Domestic policy issues (VAT, tariffs, labor shortages) are cited as key obstacles to recovering export capacity[1].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- World Bank data series for official export numbers[2].
- U.S. Department of Agriculture Foreign Agricultural Service for grain export trends[5].
- Business and trade news sources for sectoral breakdowns and policy developments[1].

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- Export data for 2025 is preliminary; final values may be revised.
- Ongoing war and global market volatility make forward projections highly uncertain.
- Exchange rate fluctuations and inflation may affect USD-denominated figures.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the sharp declines in Ukraine’s core export sectors (grains and metals), increased market competition, expiration of key trade preferences, and continued war-related disruptions, it is highly unlikely that Ukraine’s total exports in 2025 will surpass the $81.53 billion level reached in 2021[1][5]. Most forecasters and authoritative sources expect 2025 exports to be well below the 2021 benchmark.

**Probabilistic assessment:** The probability that Ukraine’s exports in 2025 will exceed those in 2021 is estimated at less than 10%.
