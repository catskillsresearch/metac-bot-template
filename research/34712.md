# Will the Florida DOT Official Transportation Map display Gulf of America instead of Gulf of Mexico before April 1, 2025?

Based on the available information as of February 9, 2025, there is insufficient evidence to suggest that the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) will change the name of the Gulf of Mexico to "Gulf of America" on its official transportation map before April 1, 2025.

## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

The Gulf of Mexico has historically been the official name used in Florida state documentation and maps. While the query references a CBS News article indicating that Governor DeSantis referred to the "Gulf of America" in a Florida winter storm order, this appears to be an isolated reference rather than an indication of an official name change.

As of January 21, 2025, FDOT was actively engaged in winter storm preparedness activities along the Gulf Coast, including:

- Pre-treatment of over 600 state-owned bridges in the Panhandle
- Focusing on larger intercoastal bridges such as the Pensacola Bay Bridge and Hathaway Bridge
- Deploying significant resources including 11 snowplows and various de-icing equipment[1]

These official communications from the Florida government continue to reference traditional place names without indicating any change in nomenclature for the Gulf of Mexico.

## Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

The most recent relevant government document available is from January 21, 2025, detailing Florida's response to a winter weather system affecting the Gulf region. This document does not use either "Gulf of America" or explicitly mention "Gulf of Mexico," but refers to traditional geographic features like the "Pensacola Bay Bridge" which borders the Gulf of Mexico[1].

The Florida Department of Transportation's documentation and planning materials available through July 2024 show no indication of a planned name change for the Gulf of Mexico in official maps or documents[5].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

The Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) would be the authoritative source for any official changes to state transportation maps. Their website and official documentation would reflect such changes if implemented[2].

The Florida Division of Emergency Management, which publishes disaster preparedness maps, would likely also reflect any official name changes in their documentation[3].

The Governor's Office press releases, such as the January 2025 update on the Gulf winter weather system, provide official state communications that would likely use updated terminology if a name change had been officially implemented[1].

## Limitations and Uncertainties in Measurement

Several limitations affect the assessment of this question:

1. The available search results do not include direct information about the current labeling on the MyFlorida Transportation Map referenced in the resolution criteria.

2. While Governor DeSantis reportedly used "Gulf of America" in a winter storm order according to the CBS News reference, the official documentation available does not confirm whether this terminology has been adopted in official state maps and documents.

3. The most recent FDOT documentation available in the search results is from December 30, 2024, for Port Canaveral information[4], and July 1, 2024, for the STIP report[5]. There could have been developments between these dates and the current date (May 4, 2025) that are not reflected in the search results.

Based on the available evidence, there is no clear indication that the Florida Department of Transportation has changed or plans to change the name from "Gulf of Mexico" to "Gulf of America" on its official transportation map before April 1, 2025.
