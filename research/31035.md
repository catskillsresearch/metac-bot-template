# Forecasting US Airline Passenger Volume for Christmas-New Year's Week 2024

Based on available data as of December 13, 2024, here is an analysis to help forecast whether TSA passenger screenings will total between 18-19 million for December 25-31, 2024.

## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

### Historical TSA Screening Data (Dec 25-31)
The historical TSA screening volumes for the December 25-31 period show a clear recovery and growth pattern:

- 2019: ~17.1 million passengers (pre-pandemic baseline)
- 2020: ~7.6 million passengers (pandemic impact)
- 2021: ~13.5 million passengers (recovery phase)
- 2022: ~14.8 million passengers (continued recovery)
- 2023: ~17.3 million passengers (return to pre-pandemic levels)

This represents a 16.9% increase from 2022 to 2023, showing strong year-over-year growth as travel returned to normal.

### Current 2024 Travel Trends

TSA passenger volumes have reached record highs in 2024, with an increase of 17% since 2022[5]. For the 2024 Thanksgiving travel period (November 26 to December 2), TSA projected screening 18.3 million people, representing approximately a 6% increase from the same period in 2023[5].

## Recent Announcements Affecting Air Travel

### Holiday Travel Projections

For the broader 2024 year-end holiday period (December 19, 2024, through January 2, 2025), TSA anticipates screening more than 39 million people at airports nationwide[3]. This 15-day projection suggests an average of approximately 2.6 million screenings per day, though actual distribution will vary by date.

AAA projects that 7.85 million passengers will travel by air during the holiday season from December 21 to January 1, setting a new record that surpasses the previous high of 7.5 million[2]. Overall, AAA expects 119.3 million people to travel 50+ miles from home during this period, narrowly surpassing the previous record set in 2019[2].

### Expected Peak Travel Days

According to TSA, the busiest days at Denver International Airport during the holiday period are likely to be Thursday, December 19, Friday, December 20, and Monday, December 30[3]. This suggests that December 30 will be one of the peak travel days within the December 25-31 period.

## Analysis for December 25-31, 2024 Forecast

Based on the available data, several factors suggest the 7-day total for December 25-31, 2024, could reach the 18-19 million range:

1. The same period in 2023 saw approximately 17.3 million passengers.
2. Applying the 6% year-over-year growth observed for Thanksgiving 2024 would yield approximately 18.3 million passengers for December 25-31, 2024.
3. The overall holiday period projection of 39 million over 15 days (Dec 19-Jan 2) suggests high daily averages.
4. December 30 is specifically identified as an expected peak travel day[3].
5. AAA's projection of record air travel for the broader holiday period supports the likelihood of higher numbers[2].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors could affect the accuracy of this forecast:

1. Weather disruptions could significantly impact travel volumes.
2. The specific distribution of the 39 million travelers across the 15-day holiday period is not precisely known.
3. Economic factors or last-minute travel changes could shift patterns.
4. The data from AAA (7.85 million air travelers) covers a different date range (Dec 21-Jan 1) than the TSA measurement period (Dec 25-31).

## Conclusion

Based on current trends and projections, it appears reasonably likely that TSA passenger screenings for December 25-31, 2024, could fall within the 18-19 million range. The 6% year-over-year growth seen at Thanksgiving 2024 would put the total at approximately 18.3 million if applied to the December 25-31 period, and this aligns with the broader holiday projections from TSA and AAA.
