### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The Warren Buffett Indicator (Wilshire 5000 to GDP Ratio) is a widely used measure of U.S. stock market valuation relative to the economy.
- As of July 8, 2024, the most recent figure from the Longtermtrends data table was 196.20%[1].
- Multiple sources report that the Buffett Indicator exceeded 200% in the first quarter of 2024, reaching as high as 201%â€”the second-highest level on record, only behind the 2022 peak[3].
- By the end of 2024, some sources project the indicator at 207%, but this is outside the relevant period for this question and may use slightly different methodologies[5].

### Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Metric

- The surge above 200% in Q1 2024 reflects strong stock market performance relative to GDP, despite various economic challenges[3].
- No major policy changes or economic shocks reported in the sources would have dramatically altered the ratio downward between Q1 and July 2024.

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The Longtermtrends website provides the official data table for the Wilshire 5000 to GDP Ratio, which is the resolution source for this question.
- Additional confirmation comes from financial analytics platforms and market commentary[3][5].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- The Buffett Indicator can vary slightly depending on the data source and whether GDP or GNP is used as the denominator.
- The resolution depends strictly on the Longtermtrends data table; if their data lags or differs from other sources, the exact date of exceeding 200% may vary.
- If the Longtermtrends website does not update through September 16, 2024, the most recent available data will be used for resolution.

### Conclusion

Based on available information, the Warren Buffett Indicator did exceed 200% in Q1 2024, reaching at least 201% according to multiple reputable sources[3]. Unless the Longtermtrends data table diverges significantly from these reports, it is highly likely that the indicator exceeded 200% before September 17, 2024.
