## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- **China's Water Scarcity**: China is experiencing a deepening water shortage crisis, particularly in the north. Home to 20% of the world’s population but only 6% of global freshwater, the per capita water availability is around 2,018 cubic meters/year—about 25% of the global average and declining[1][3][5]. This scarcity is most acute in the populous and agriculturally critical Northern China Plain[3][5].
- **Drivers of Scarcity**: The crisis is driven by climate change, regional precipitation disparities, overuse, pollution, and rising demand from industrial and agricultural sectors[1][3][5].
- **Government Response**: The Chinese government has prioritized water security, investing in projects such as the South-North Water Transfer Project (SNWTP), desalination, and water import strategies. However, these solutions are incomplete and may not fully offset shortages before 2050[1][2].
- **Food Security and Social Stability**: Water shortages threaten food production, with authorities enacting a wide range of policies to mitigate impacts on the food supply and urban stability[2].

## 2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- **South-North Water Transfer Project**: Ongoing, but not expected to be fully operational until at least 2050, leaving a multi-decade gap where shortages will persist[1][2].
- **Desalination and Water Importation**: Accelerated but not yet sufficient to meet national needs, especially in drought-prone northern regions[1].
- **Climate Change Adaptation**: The government is increasingly focused on adaptation, with stronger central oversight of water management and food security[2].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- World Bank and UN data on water resources[1][3][5]
- Chinese government policy announcements and infrastructure project updates[1][2]
- Geopolitical and security analyses regarding China-Russia relations and historical precedents[2][5]

## 4. Limitations or Uncertainties

- **Measurement Limitations**: Forecasting geopolitical shocks over two decades is inherently uncertain. The available data reflect current and near-term policy, but not black swan events such as regime collapse, systemic breakdown, or sudden, catastrophic resource failures.
- **Political and Strategic Factors**: China’s foreign policy has historically been risk-averse regarding direct military conflict with peer states. Russia, despite its current vulnerabilities, remains a nuclear power, and both countries have maintained a robust strategic partnership, lowering the likelihood of open conflict[5].
- **Unknown Future Developments**: Unpredictable shifts—such as domestic unrest, leadership change, or a dramatic escalation in water or food crises—could alter strategic calculations.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the above, the probability that China will overtly deploy at least 100 PLA troops to seize Russian territory for water access, specifically by 2046, remains **very low**—most likely in the 1–3% range. The combination of severe water stress, ongoing government mitigation, and the high geopolitical risks of such an action makes it highly improbable barring extreme, currently unforeseeable events. However, the risk is not zero and could rise if China's domestic crisis intensifies or if Russia’s state capacity collapses.
