## Key Factual Information as of March 14, 2025

**Current Status and Historical Trends**
- The Department of Defense announced that transgender Sailors and Marines must voluntarily separate by March 28, 2025, or face involuntary administrative separation[1][3].
- The policy stems from a January 2025 executive order aiming to ban transgender people from military service[5].
- The administrative separation process and further guidance were still pending as of mid-March 2025[1].

**Recent Legal Developments**
- Multiple lawsuits were filed to block the ban, notably *Talbott v. USA* (also known as *Talbott v. Trump*)[2][4].
- On March 18, 2025, a federal court issued a nationwide preliminary injunction halting enforcement of the transgender military ban[2].
- On March 26, 2025, the court rejected a motion to dissolve the injunction, maintaining the block on the ban's implementation[2].
- As a result, transgender service members are protected from discharge while the case proceeds.

**Authoritative Sources for Verification**
- The Project 2025 Tracker spreadsheet, maintained by the Keep_Track subreddit, is the reference for whether the objective is marked as "complete."
- Federal court documents and reputable news outlets (e.g., Military.com, GLAD) provide verification of policy status and legal actions[1][2][4].

**Limitations and Uncertainties**
- The legal process introduces uncertainty; the injunction could be lifted or modified, but as of March 14, 2025, it remains in effect.
- The Tracker spreadsheet updates based on public, verifiable policy enactment, not on announced intentions or incomplete implementation.
- The administrative separation process for transgender service members cannot proceed while the injunction is in place.

## Forecast

Given the federal court's nationwide injunction halting enforcement of the transgender military ban as of late March 2025, it is highly unlikely that the Project 2025 Tracker spreadsheet will mark the objective of expelling transgender people from the military as "complete" on April 1, 2025. The objective is expected to remain "in progress" until the legal situation is resolved and the policy is actually implemented.
