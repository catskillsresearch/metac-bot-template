As a forecasting analyst examining the likelihood of a US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) public health emergency (PHE) declaration for H5 avian influenza before January 1, 2026, I'll analyze the current situation and relevant factors.

## Current Status of H5N1 Avian Influenza

The H5N1 avian influenza situation in the United States has evolved significantly since December 2024:

- As of May 12, 2025, the CDC reports 70 confirmed human cases of H5N1 in the United States, representing a 20.7% increase from the 58 cases reported in December 2024[4].
- The first US death attributed to this strain of H5N1 was reported on January 6, 2025[5].
- Most infections have occurred in farm workers exposed to infected cattle or poultry, with mild symptoms predominantly featuring conjunctivitis and other flu-like symptoms[5].
- Three human cases now have no identified source of infection, up from two cases with unknown exposure sources in December 2024[5].
- The virus has been detected in wastewater, though the source of virus in wastewater remains unknown[5].

## Risk Assessment Factors

Several factors are relevant to assessing whether HHS will declare a PHE:

**Factors suggesting increased risk:**
- The continued growth in human cases (from 58 in December 2024 to 70 by May 2025)
- The occurrence of the first US death
- The presence of cases with no known source of infection, potentially suggesting undetected transmission patterns
- Detection of the virus in wastewater systems

**Factors suggesting lower risk:**
- The CDC and WHO continue to assess that "the avian flu risk to the general public remains low"[5]
- Most cases remain mild with conjunctivitis as the most common symptom[5]
- The majority of cases have clear exposure pathways through infected animals
- No explicit evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission has been reported

## Comparison to Historical PHE Declarations

When comparing to previous infectious disease PHE declarations (H1N1, Zika, COVID-19, and Mpox), several observations emerge:

1. The current case count (70) is still relatively low compared to some previous outbreaks that triggered declarations
2. The first US death represents a significant threshold that was crossed
3. The unknown exposure sources in three cases raise concerns about potential community spread
4. The expanded surveillance through wastewater monitoring suggests authorities are actively preparing for potential escalation[5]

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on the current trajectory and historical precedents, I assess the probability of an HHS public health emergency declaration for H5 avian influenza before January 1, 2026 as **moderate to high** (approximately 60-70%).

This assessment is based on:

1. The continued increase in cases despite control measures
2. The occurrence of the first death
3. The presence of cases with unknown exposure sources
4. The remaining 7 months before the resolution deadline, during which further developments could occur
5. The establishment of expanded monitoring systems like TexWEB, indicating elevated concern among public health authorities[5]

However, this probability could shift significantly based on:
- Whether human-to-human transmission is confirmed
- If genetic adaptations making the virus more transmissible to humans are detected
- Any substantial increase in case severity or mortality
- Further increases in cases with unknown exposure sources

The primary uncertainty in this forecast is the threshold at which HHS would determine that H5N1 "presents a public health emergency." The continued official assessment of "low risk to the general public" suggests we have not yet reached that threshold, but the situation appears to be evolving in a concerning direction.
