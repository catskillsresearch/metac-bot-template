## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of April 30, 2025, there have been 70 confirmed human cases of H5 avian influenza in the United States since 2024, with most cases linked to direct contact with infected birds or dairy cattle[3][4][5].
- The CDC currently assesses the public health risk from H5 avian influenza as low, reporting no evidence of sustained person-to-person transmission[2].
- Outbreaks among wild birds, poultry, and notably U.S. dairy cows continue, but human infections remain rare and primarily occupational[2][3][5].

## 2. Recent Announcements/Policies

- The CDC continues to monitor the situation closely, issuing periodic updates but maintaining its "low risk" assessment for the general public[2][3][4].
- No PHE declaration has been made by HHS for H5 avian influenza as of May 2025. The CDC and HHS have not indicated a shift toward emergency status[2][3].
- The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) has also tracked cases, but there is no indication of a regional emergency declaration[5].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- CDC H5N1 Situation Summary[2]
- CDC H5N1 Response Update[1]
- PAHO Epidemiological Update[5]
- HHS list of public health emergency declarations

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- There is some uncertainty about the potential for the virus to adapt for more efficient human-to-human transmission. However, as of the latest CDC and PAHO updates, such transmission has not been observed[2][5].
- Surveillance limitations may mean some mild or asymptomatic cases are undetected, but this has not changed official risk assessments thus far.

## 5. Comparison to Reference Cases

| Outbreak   | Human-to-Human Spread | Severity | PHE Declared | Circumstances for PHE |
|------------|----------------------|----------|--------------|----------------------|
| H1N1 (2009)| Yes                  | High     | Yes          | Rapid global spread, severe cases |
| Zika (2016)| Limited/possible     | Variable | Yes          | Birth defects, international concern |
| COVID-19   | Yes                  | High     | Yes          | Sustained transmission, severe outcomes |
| Mpox (2022)| Yes                  | Moderate | Yes          | Unusual outbreak, global spread |
| H5N1 (2024-25)| No (so far)      | Low      | No (as of May 2025) | Animal-to-human, rare in humans |

- In all referenced prior cases where a PHE was declared, there was either sustained human-to-human transmission or significant, widespread health impacts. The absence of such characteristics for H5N1, coupled with the CDC's continued "low risk" assessment, is a critical difference[2][3][5].

## 6. Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given:

- The number of human H5 cases, while notable, remains low and largely occupational.
- No evidence of sustained person-to-person transmission.
- The CDC and HHS maintain a "low risk" public health assessment.
- Historical precedent requires a higher threshold (e.g., substantial person-to-person spread or severe outcomes) for a PHE declaration.

**The probability of the US HHS declaring a public health emergency for H5 avian influenza before January 1, 2026, is currently low—significantly below 20%—unless there is a major change, such as the emergence of efficient human-to-human transmission or a marked increase in severe cases.**

This assessment should be revisited immediately if new evidence arises of increased transmissibility or severity in humans.
