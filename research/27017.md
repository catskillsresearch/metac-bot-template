To forecast whether the United Nations will have more than 193 member states before October 1, 2024, we need to examine recent developments, historical patterns, and the current status of potential new members.

## Current UN Membership Status

As of May 2024, the United Nations has 193 member states. The last country to join was South Sudan in 2011, meaning there has been no change in membership for nearly 13 years. This reflects the generally slow pace of UN membership expansion in recent decades.

## UN Membership Process

The admission of new members to the UN follows a specific procedure:

1. A state submits an application letter to the Secretary-General
2. The Secretary-General refers the application to the Security Council
3. The Security Council establishes a committee to consider the application
4. The Security Council votes on the recommendation
5. If approved by the Security Council, the application moves to the General Assembly

For Security Council approval, an applicant needs at least 9 affirmative votes out of 15 members and must avoid a veto from any of the five permanent members (China, France, Russia, UK, and US)[5]. If approved, the application then requires a two-thirds majority vote in the General Assembly (at least 129 votes out of 193 members)[5].

## Recent Developments: Palestine's Application

The most active candidacy for UN membership in 2024 has been Palestine's application:

- Palestine submitted a renewed application for UN membership consideration on April 2, 2024, following its original application from September 23, 2011[5]
- The Security Council held consultations and an open meeting on April 8, 2024, to discuss Palestine's application[2]
- On April 18, 2024, despite support from 12 Security Council members, Palestine's application was blocked by a veto from one permanent member (the United States)[1][4]
- Following this veto, on May 9, 2024, the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution expressing "deep regret and concern" about the veto that prevented Palestine's admission[1]

This recent development demonstrates the significant hurdle posed by the veto power of permanent Security Council members, even when an applicant has substantial support from other UN members.

## Historical Context

The historical pattern of UN membership expansion is worth noting:

- No admission of a new member had been vetoed since 1976 until Palestine's case in 2024[2]
- The admission process is deliberately slow and requires broad international consensus
- Geopolitical considerations often play a decisive role in membership decisions

## Forecast Considerations

Based on the available information, several factors are relevant for forecasting whether the UN will exceed 193 members before October 1, 2024:

1. **Palestine's prospects**: Despite significant support, Palestine's path to full membership remains blocked by a Security Council veto as recently as April 2024. Without a change in position from the vetoing permanent member, full membership appears unlikely in the short term.

2. **Other candidates**: While other entities like Kosovo, Taiwan, South Ossetia, Abkhazia, and Northern Cyprus seek greater international recognition, none appear to be in the advanced stages of the UN application process as of May 2024.

3. **Procedural timeline**: Even if a new application were to gain Security Council approval in the coming months, the subsequent General Assembly vote and formal admission process would need to be completed before October 1, 2024.

4. **Historical precedent**: The UN has not admitted a new member since 2011, indicating that membership expansion occurs infrequently and typically follows major geopolitical developments or the emergence of new states.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

The forecast is subject to several limitations:

- Diplomatic positions can change rapidly, particularly regarding contentious recognition issues
- The search results provide detailed information primarily about Palestine's application but limited information about other potential candidates
- Unforeseen geopolitical developments could accelerate or create new membership applications
- The exact timing of UN procedural steps, even if a candidate overcomes initial hurdles, is difficult to predict

Based on the available information as of May 2024, the most active candidacy (Palestine) has recently faced a significant setback, and there is limited evidence of other candidates being in the advanced stages of consideration for membership before October 1, 2024.
