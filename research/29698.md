# Merck Stock Forecast Through End of 2024

Based on the available data as of October 31, 2024, I'll analyze whether Merck stock (MRK) is likely to remain below its all-time high of $134.63 through December 31, 2024.

## Current Stock Position

As of the most recent data available, Merck's stock price stands at approximately $83.18[1]. This represents a significant gap of about 61.9% between the current price and the all-time high threshold of $134.63. For the stock to breach this level before January 1, 2025, it would require extraordinary growth in a very short timeframe.

## Recent Financial Performance

Merck announced its third-quarter 2024 financial results on October 31, 2024, reporting:

- Total worldwide sales of $16.7 billion, a 4% increase from Q3 2023
- KEYTRUDA sales grew 17% to $7.4 billion
- WINREVAIR sales were $149 million, with momentum building in the U.S. market
- Animal Health sales grew 6% to $1.5 billion[3]

The company narrowed its expected worldwide sales range for 2024 to between $63.6 billion and $64.1 billion, and adjusted its non-GAAP EPS outlook to between $7.72 and $7.77[3]. While these results show steady growth, they don't suggest the kind of dramatic price movement that would be necessary to reach the all-time high in the remaining months of 2024.

## Analyst Forecasts and Technical Indicators

Current analyst forecasts provide the following insights:

- The average analyst price target is $137.30, representing a potential 65.07% increase from the current price
- The highest analyst price target is $141.81, and the lowest is $132.80[1]
- The 12-month price target averages $139.55, suggesting a 67.77% upside[1]

These targets, while exceeding the all-time high threshold, are generally projected over longer timeframes than the two months remaining in 2024.

Technical indicators present a mixed picture:
- RSI(14) value of 49.54 indicates neutral short-term sentiment
- STOCH value of 86.1 suggests the stock is oversold
- ADX value of 25.88 indicates a moderate trend
- CCI(14) value of 59.96 suggests the stock is somewhat overbought but not extremely so[1]

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors could affect this forecast:
1. The available data doesn't account for potential market-moving events that might occur in November or December 2024
2. Unexpected clinical trial results, regulatory decisions, or major acquisition announcements could significantly impact the stock price
3. Broader market movements related to economic data or geopolitical events could influence pharmaceutical stocks generally

## Conclusion

Based on the current price level, recent financial performance, analyst forecasts, and the limited time remaining in 2024, it appears highly likely that Merck stock will continuously remain below its all-time high of $134.63 through December 31, 2024. The stock would need to experience unprecedented growth of over 60% in approximately two months to breach this threshold, which is not supported by current analyst expectations or company guidance.

While analyst price targets do suggest Merck could eventually exceed this level, these projections typically extend well beyond the January 1, 2025 timeframe specified in the question.
