### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- In May 2024, sunspot region AR3664 (now AR3697) produced numerous M- and X-class flares, causing extreme geomagnetic storms and widespread auroras at low latitudes.
- As of August 10–13, 2024, a series of CMEs from AR3697 and other regions triggered a severe (G4) geomagnetic storm, with Kp values likely reaching 8 or higher. This event was one of the most significant since May 2024, with impacts including auroras visible far south and disruptions to communications and satellites[2][3][5].
- By August 13, 2024, NOAA SWPC reported that geomagnetic storm conditions were waning, with no further increase in space weather activity anticipated at that time[3][5].

### Recent Announcements and Forecasts

- NOAA SWPC issued G3 (Strong) and G4 (Severe) geomagnetic storm alerts for August 12, 2024, but these expired by August 13, with forecasts indicating a return to quieter conditions[2][3][5].
- As of August 19, 2024, there were no new warnings or forecasts suggesting a high likelihood of another major geomagnetic storm (Kp > 7) between August 21 and September 11, 2024[3][5].

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The German Research Center for Geosciences provides the official running 30-day Kp index history, which is the resolution source for this question.
- NOAA SWPC is the primary agency for space weather forecasts and alerts in the United States[3].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- Solar activity, particularly from active regions like AR3697, is inherently unpredictable. While recent activity has been intense, forecasts as of August 19 do not indicate a high probability of another Kp > 7 event in the specified window.
- Kp values are measured in thirds and rounded to the nearest thousandth, as reported by the German Research Center for Geosciences.
- Forecasts can change rapidly if new solar flares or CMEs are observed.

### Summary

As of August 19, 2024, the most recent severe geomagnetic storm (Kp ≥ 8) occurred on August 12, with conditions waning thereafter. There are no authoritative forecasts or warnings indicating a high likelihood of another Kp > 7 event between August 21 and September 11, 2024. However, due to the unpredictable nature of solar activity, continued monitoring of official sources is recommended.
