## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Vladimir Putin resumed and increased his international travel in late 2023 and throughout 2024, visiting countries such as China, North Korea, Vietnam, Uzbekistan, Mongolia, Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, and Belarus[4].
- All documented trips in 2024 were to countries considered friendly or neutral toward Russia, reflecting ongoing geopolitical constraints[4].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

However, as of the latest available information, there is no confirmation that such a meeting has been scheduled or that travel arrangements have been made.
- The Kremlin has publicly stated Putin’s willingness to engage with international leaders, but no specific travel plans have been announced for early 2025[5].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Major news agencies such as TASS and Le Monde, as well as official Kremlin statements, are also used to verify travel events[4][5].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- Rumored meetings, such as the potential Saudi Arabia summit with Trump, have not been confirmed as scheduled or completed as of February 21, 2025.
- Putin’s ability to travel is constrained by international sanctions and his status as an “international pariah,” but he has recently traveled to several allied countries[3][4].
