### Key Factual Information Relevant to Forecasting Catalent's 10-K Filing

**1. Historical Filing Trends**
- Catalent, Inc. has a record of filing its annual 10-K reports, with the 2023 10-K filed in December 2023 and the 2022 10-K filed in August 2022[3][4].
- The 2023 filing was later than the typical post-fiscal-year window, suggesting possible delays in recent years.

**2. Current Status and Recent Announcements**
- On August 29, 2024, Catalent received a notification of failure to file its annual report for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024[1].
- Despite this, Catalent released its fourth quarter and fiscal 2024 financial results on the same day, which often coincides with or precedes the 10-K filing[2].
- The company is in the process of being acquired by Novo Holdings, with the transaction expected to close toward the end of 2024[5].

**3. Authoritative Source for Verification**
- The only source for resolution is the SEC EDGAR link: https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?CIK=0001596783&owner=exclude, where the 10-K must appear before October 1, 2024, to resolve as "Yes."

**4. Limitations and Uncertainties**
- The notification of failure to file indicates a risk of further delay.
- The pending acquisition could introduce additional delays or complications in the filing process.
- There is a note on the SEC EDGAR site about Catalent's Exchange Act registration being revoked as of March 1, 2024, but the company continues to issue financial results and press releases, suggesting it remains operational[1][2].
- No public statement from Catalent as of September 4, 2024, commits to a specific 10-K filing date.

### Summary Table: Key Factors

| Factor                        | Status as of 09/04/2024         | Implication for 10-K Filing      |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Historical 10-K Filing        | Filed, sometimes delayed         | Pattern of eventual compliance   |
| 2024 10-K Status              | Not yet filed, failure notice    | Increased risk of further delay  |
| Q4/FY2024 Results Released    | Yes, on Aug 29, 2024             | May indicate readiness to file   |
| Pending Acquisition           | Yes, closing late 2024           | Possible additional delays       |
| SEC Registration Note         | Revoked (unclear context)        | Uncertainty about reporting      |

### Conclusion

As of September 4, 2024, Catalent, Inc. has not filed its 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, and has received a notification of failure to file. While the release of Q4 and full-year results suggests the company has completed much of the required financial reporting, the recent history of delayed filings, the pending acquisition, and the SEC notification all introduce significant uncertainty. The authoritative resolution source is the SEC EDGAR link, and only an actual 10-K filing there before October 1, 2024, will resolve this as "Yes." There is no public commitment to a filing date, so the risk of a continued delay remains material.
