### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The FAA's long-term average rate for unruly passenger incidents is 1.818 per 10,000 flights.
- Incident rates surged in 2021 (5,973 cases), then declined but remained above pre-pandemic levels: 2,455 in 2022, 2,076 in 2023, and 2,102 in 2024[4].
- In 2024, 915 cases were reported from January 1 to June 9, and 1,240 cases by August, indicating a persistent issue[1][2][5].
- The rate per flight was 1 incident per 568 flights in 2022 and 1 per 480 flights in 2023, which translates to approximately 1.76 and 2.08 incidents per 1,000 flights, or 17.6 and 20.8 per 10,000 flightsâ€”well above the 1.818 threshold[5].

### Recent Announcements and Policies

- The FAA's zero-tolerance policy, implemented in January 2021, remains in effect, with increased fines and legal actions against unruly passengers[1][2][4][5].
- The FAA has referred over 300 of the most serious cases to the FBI since 2021, with ongoing collaboration to pursue criminal charges[2][5].
- The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) supports these efforts by revoking PreCheck privileges and placing offenders on no-fly lists[5].

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The FAA's official unruly passenger data and weekly rates are published at their dedicated website[1][2].
- News outlets such as Simple Flying and GlobalAir provide summaries and analysis of annual and monthly trends[4][5].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- The FAA publishes weekly rates, but only aggregate data is available up to early 2025 in the cited sources.
- Exact weekly rates for the first quarter of 2025 are not provided, but the annualized rates and incident counts strongly suggest that the weekly rate exceeded the 1.818 per 10,000 flights threshold at least once before April 1, 2025.
- There may be slight discrepancies in how incidents are classified or reported week-to-week.

### Conclusion

Based on the available data, the rate of unruly passenger incidents per 10,000 flights remained above the long-term average for much of 2024 and into early 2025. Unless there was a sudden, dramatic drop in incidents in early 2025 (for which there is no evidence), it is highly likely that the reported rate exceeded 1.818 for at least one week before April 1, 2025.
