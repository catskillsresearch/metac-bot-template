## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of 2025, **El Salvador** (since 2021) and the **Central African Republic** (since 2022) are the only countries to have legally designated Bitcoin as legal tender[2][4].
- Despite global interest in cryptocurrency, most countries allow trading or holding Bitcoin but do not grant it legal tender status[3][5].
- There have been discussions in other nations (such as Fiji and Tuvalu), but as of the latest reports, these have not culminated in official adoption[1][4].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- Several countries have explored or announced consideration of Bitcoin as legal tender, but no additional adoptions have occurred since El Salvador and the Central African Republic[1][4].
- Many governments are instead focusing on developing their own central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), which are distinct from decentralized cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and do not entail granting them legal tender status[4].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- **CoinMarketCap** and **Investopedia** both maintain up-to-date lists of legal tender status for cryptocurrencies globally[2][3].
- **Wikipedia** provides a continually updated summary of cryptocurrency legality by country[1].
- **RUSI** commentary and policy reviews offer analysis on the pace and likelihood of further legal tender adoptions[4].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- The legal status of Bitcoin as "legal tender" is precise, but countries can reverse, suspend, or reinterpret such laws, leading to sudden changes.
- Some jurisdictions may implement partial or experimental frameworks, complicating the count.
- Rapid technological or regulatory shifts could accelerate or stall adoption unexpectedly.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

- Reference case (2021–2025): Only two countries have recognized Bitcoin as legal tender, with no clear momentum for widespread adoption.
- Key differences since initial adoption: Increased regulatory scrutiny, preference for CBDCs, and global economic instability have made further adoption less likely.
- **Forecast for 2030-01-01**: Given current trends and barriers, the most likely outcome is that between 2 and 4 countries will recognize Bitcoin as legal tender, with a strong probability mass at 2 (status quo), and small but nonzero probabilities for 3 or 4 due to potential outlier adoptions.
- The probability of more than 4 is low (less than 10%), given the lack of momentum and increasing regulatory caution globally.

> **Best estimate:**  
> **Number of countries with Bitcoin as legal tender on 2030-01-01: 2**  
> (with a plausible range: 2–4, but the most likely outcome is no change from the current status)
