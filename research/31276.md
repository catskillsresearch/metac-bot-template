# Forecast: Will Argentina's Poverty Rate Be Lower in H1 2025 vs. H2 2023?

Based on the available data as of January 10, 2025, I will analyze whether Argentina's poverty rate in the first half of 2025 will be lower than the 41.7% recorded in the second half of 2023.

## Current Situation and Recent Trends

Argentina experienced a significant economic crisis in 2024, with poverty reaching a peak of 52.9% in the first half of that year—the highest level in almost two decades[5]. This represented an increase of 11.2 percentage points from the second half of 2023 as described in the question.

However, recent data shows a marked improvement. According to private estimates by economist Martín González-Rozada from Universidad Torcuato Di Tella, poverty had fallen to approximately 36.8% by the end of the second half of 2024[5]. This represents a substantial reduction of 16.1 percentage points from its peak earlier in the year.

## Economic Indicators and Projections

Several key economic indicators suggest continued improvement in 2025:

1. **Economic Growth**: The IMF projects 5% economic growth for Argentina in 2025[1]. Similarly, BBVA Research forecasts GDP growth of 5.5% for 2025, "driven by consumption and investment, within a context of disinflationary consolidation"[3].

2. **Inflation**: After reaching alarming levels of 166% in November 2024, inflation has been following a downward trend[1]. The IMF projects annual inflation of 62.7% for 2025[1], which, while still high, represents a significant improvement.

3. **Recession Recovery**: Argentina's economy emerged from recession in the third quarter of 2024[1], suggesting that economic fundamentals are improving.

## Policy Context

President Javier Milei implemented economic "shock therapy" in his first year in office, which appears to be yielding results despite initial hardships[1]. The administration's policies aim to bring inflation down to single digits by mid-2025[2].

However, challenges remain:

- Argentina faces significant debt obligations in 2025, including a $3 billion payment to the IMF and bond payments of approximately $4.3 billion each in January and July[1].
- Capital controls may dampen the economic recovery[1].
- Specialists warn of an "aggravation of scarcity in low-income sectors and the risks of structural poverty"[5].

## Poverty Measurement Data

The most recent official poverty data point shows the rate peaked at 52.9% in H1 2024[5]. Private estimates indicate a reduction to 36.8% by the end of 2024[5], which is already below the reference threshold of 41.7% from H2 2023.

The INDEC's Total Basic Shopping-Basket (used to calculate the poverty line) was reported at 356,073.460 USD in March 2025, an increase from the previous 342,370.040 USD[4]. While this indicates rising costs, the overall economic improvements appear to be offsetting these increases in terms of poverty reduction.

## Forecast Assessment

Based on the available data, there is a strong probability that Argentina's poverty rate in the first half of 2025 will be lower than the 41.7% recorded in the second half of 2023, thus resolving as "Yes" according to the criteria.

Key supporting factors:
- Poverty had already fallen to 36.8% by the end of 2024, below the 41.7% threshold[5]
- Projected economic growth of 5-5.5% for 2025[1][3]
- Continuing disinflation trend[1]
- Recovery in wages mentioned in reports[5]

However, uncertainties remain:
- Potential economic shocks from large debt payments due in early 2025[1]
- Risks of "structural poverty" highlighted by specialists[5]
- The impact of ongoing capital controls on economic recovery[1]

## Conclusion

The preponderance of evidence suggests that Argentina's poverty rate in the first half of 2025 will likely remain below the 41.7% threshold from the second half of 2023, barring significant economic setbacks. The economic trajectory, while still challenging, shows substantial improvement from the crisis peak in early 2024.
