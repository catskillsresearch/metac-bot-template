### Key Points

- **Current Status**: As of May 14, 2025, Javier Milei's approval rating is 61%, and Claudia Sheinbaum's is 60%, per Morning Consult. Milei leads by 1 percentage point.
- **No Recent Policy Shocks Noted**: There is no information about recent events or announcements that would likely cause a dramatic shift in approval for either leader.
- **Margin of Error**: Approval ratings measured by public polling are subject to sampling error, typically ±2–3 percentage points. A 1-point lead is not statistically significant and could easily reverse by June 28, 2025.
- **Volatility and Trends Unknown**: Without historical trend data, it is not possible to assess whether either leader's approval is trending upward or downward, or how volatile their ratings have been.
- **Authoritative Source**: The outcome will be determined by Morning Consult's Global Leader Approval tracker as verified by Metaculus.

### Key Differences and Forecast Implications

- **Small Margin**: The current 1-point difference is well within typical polling error and could change due to routine fluctuations or unexpected events.
- **Lack of Trend Data**: Because we lack data on the leaders' approval rating trajectories, we cannot confidently extrapolate the current snapshot forward.
- **Country-Specific Factors**: Events in Argentina or Mexico could differentially affect each leader's rating but are not detailed here.

### Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

- **Baseline Probability**: With Milei currently ahead but by a statistically insignificant margin, and lacking evidence of strong trends or major policy impacts, the probability that Milei maintains the lead on June 28, 2025, is only slightly above chance.
- **Assessment**: Milei's probability of retaining a higher approval rating than Sheinbaum on the target date is estimated at roughly 55%, reflecting a modest edge due to his current lead but high uncertainty due to potential volatility and polling error.

### Limitations

- The forecast cannot account for sudden political or economic developments.
- Polling data may be revised or adjusted by Morning Consult.
- Approval ratings may fluctuate more than historical averages due to the current political climate or unforeseen events.
