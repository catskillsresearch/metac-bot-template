**Key Factors Supporting a Pre-January 1 Declaration**  
1. **Scheduled Timeline**: The Electoral Commission's official timetable explicitly states results will be declared "within three days of December 7"[5], placing the deadline at December 10, 2024.  
2. **Institutional Readiness**: The EC has allocated 72 hours for verification and collation, with parliamentary results finalized at the constituency level before presidential aggregation[3].  
3. **Historical Efficiency**: The 2020 results were declared within 48 hours[3], suggesting the 2024 timeline is conservative and achievable.  

**Uncertainties**  
- **Dispute Risks**: While not explicitly mentioned in pre-December 5 sources, Ghana's history of peaceful transitions reduces the likelihood of prolonged legal challenges delaying the declaration.  
- **Technical Failures**: The EC has not reported systemic vulnerabilities in its pre-election assessments[1][3], minimizing risks of process-related delays.  

**Conclusion**: Available evidence strongly indicates the EC will declare a winner by December 10, 2024, well before January 1, 2025.  

**Answer**: Yes[1][3][5].
