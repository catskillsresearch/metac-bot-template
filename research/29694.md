# Waymo's Rider-Only Ride-Hailing Service Expansion Analysis

To forecast whether exactly 4 US states will have Waymo's rider-only ride-hailing service by December 31, 2024, I'll analyze the current operational status and announced expansion plans.

## Current Operational Status

As of November 2024, Waymo operates its fully autonomous ride-hailing service in the following locations:

1. **Arizona** - Specifically in Metro Phoenix, where Waymo has expanded its service area to 315 square miles as of June 2024[1]. This expansion included additional areas in Scottsdale, downtown Mesa, and the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community.

2. **California** - Operating in both San Francisco and Los Angeles[5]. These services are fully operational and available to the general public without requiring waitlists.

## Announced Expansion Plans

Waymo has officially announced plans to expand to two additional states:

1. **Texas (Austin)** - Waymo and Uber announced in September 2024 that they will bring autonomous ride-hailing to Austin "beginning in early 2025"[4][5]. Under this partnership, Uber will manage and dispatch a fleet of Waymo's fully autonomous, all-electric Jaguar I-PACE vehicles.

2. **Georgia (Atlanta)** - The same announcement confirmed that Atlanta will also receive Waymo service "in early 2025"[4][5]. In both new cities, riders who request certain Uber services (UberX, Uber Green, Uber Comfort, or Uber Comfort Electric) may be matched with a Waymo vehicle for qualifying trips.

## Analysis for December 31, 2024 Forecast

Based on the available information, by December 31, 2024:

- Waymo will be operating in **2 states** (Arizona and California)
- The planned expansions to Texas and Georgia are explicitly scheduled for "early 2025"[4][5]

This indicates that Waymo's rider-only ride-hailing service will **not** be available in exactly 4 US states by the end of 2024. The service will likely be available in 2 states, with expansion to 4 states occurring in early 2025.

## Verification Sources

The primary verification source mentioned in the question is Waymo's "Where Can You Go?" page on their official website. Additional verification can be found in Waymo's official blog posts and press releases, as well as Uber's investor relations announcements regarding their partnership with Waymo.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors could affect this forecast:

1. **Accelerated Timeline**: While unlikely given the explicit "early 2025" timeframe, Waymo could potentially accelerate its expansion plans.

2. **Regulatory Hurdles**: Autonomous vehicle deployments are subject to regulatory approval, which could either delay or expedite planned launches.

3. **Limited Public Information**: While the announced plans are clear, there could be internal developments not yet made public that might affect the timeline.

4. **Definition of "Available to the General Public"**: The question specifies that the service must be available without waitlists or limited testing phases, which Waymo has historically used when entering new markets.

Based on all available information as of November 7, 2024, the most likely outcome is that Waymo will be operating in 2 states by December 31, 2024, not 4 states.
