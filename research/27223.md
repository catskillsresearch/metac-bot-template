# Ukrainian Incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast: Forecasting Potential Capture of Rylsk

On August 6, 2024, Ukrainian forces launched a significant cross-border offensive into Russia's Kursk Oblast, marking a notable strategic shift in the ongoing conflict. This analysis examines available information that could help forecast whether Ukrainian forces will capture Rylsk, Russia before October 1, 2024.

## Current Status and Territorial Gains

Ukrainian forces have made rapid and substantial advances into Russian territory since the beginning of the operation:

- As of August 7, 2024, Ukrainian forces had advanced up to 10 kilometers into Russia's Kursk Oblast, penetrating at least two Russian defensive lines and a stronghold[1].
- By August 8, geolocated footage and Russian claims indicated Ukrainian forces had continued rapid advances further into Kursk Oblast, with Ukrainian presence reported in areas as far as 35 kilometers from the international border with Sumy Oblast[2].
- Russian sources claimed that Ukrainian forces had seized approximately 45 square kilometers of territory within Kursk Oblast since the launch of the operation[1].
- Reports indicated that Ukrainian forces had captured 11 settlements, including Nikolaevo-Daryino, Darino, and Sverdlikovo, with operations ongoing within Lyubimovka (8 kilometers north of the Sumy Oblast border)[1].

## Ukrainian Tactical Approach

The Ukrainian offensive has demonstrated specific tactical characteristics that may influence their ability to reach and capture Rylsk:

- Ukrainian forces are employing fast-moving vehicles to advance primarily along main roads[3].
- Russian sources describe Ukrainian "Ranger units" conducting "Thunder Run" operations with infantry fighting vehicles equipped with heavy machine guns driving forward across roads[3].
- The speed of the Ukrainian advance suggests a focus on mobility and surprise rather than consolidating territorial gains, which could affect their ability to hold captured areas including potential targets like Rylsk.

## Russian Response

The Russian response to the Ukrainian incursion provides context for assessing the likelihood of further Ukrainian advances:

- The Kremlin's initial response has been described as "contradictory," balancing the presentation of the Ukrainian operation as a significant escalation while avoiding overstating its implications to prevent domestic discontent[1].
- Russian President Vladimir Putin characterized the Ukrainian move as a "major provocation"[4].
- The Kremlin will "almost certainly endeavor to retake Russian territory in Kursk Oblast that Ukrainian forces have seized and stop Ukrainian activity further into Russia"[2].
- Some Russian military bloggers have heavily criticized the Russian military command for failing to detect preparations for or prevent the Ukrainian offensive operations[1].
- Russia has reportedly begun evacuating civilians from Rylsk, indicating concern about the Ukrainian advance potentially reaching the town.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors limit our ability to forecast whether Ukrainian forces will capture Rylsk:

- The search results do not provide specific information about Rylsk's location relative to current Ukrainian positions or advances.
- It remains unclear whether Ukrainian forces intend to push toward Rylsk specifically or if their operational objectives lie elsewhere.
- The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) notes that "Ukrainian forces most certainly do not control all of the territory within the maximalist extent of Russian claims about Ukrainian advances"[2].
- The ISW has deliberately avoided assessing the intent of the Ukrainian operation "in order to avoid compromising Ukrainian operational security"[2].
- The sustainability of the Ukrainian advance and Russia's ability to mount an effective counteroffensive remain uncertain.

## Conclusion

The Ukrainian incursion into Kursk Oblast represents a significant development in the conflict, with Ukrainian forces demonstrating the capability to advance rapidly into Russian territory. While the pace of advance (up to 35 kilometers within two days) suggests Ukrainian forces have the mobility to potentially reach Rylsk before October 1, 2024, the available information does not provide sufficient detail about Ukrainian intentions toward Rylsk specifically or the current distance between Ukrainian forces and the town.

The Kremlin's stated determination to retake lost territory and halt further Ukrainian advances will likely result in increased Russian resistance, potentially slowing or stopping Ukrainian progress toward objectives like Rylsk. The outcome will likely depend on Ukrainian strategic objectives, resource allocation, and Russia's ability to organize an effective defense or counteroffensive in the coming weeks.
