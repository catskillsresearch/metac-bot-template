### Key Factors for Forecasting February 2025 Federal Employment Change  
1. **Historical context**:  
   - Federal employment constituted 1.87% of the civilian workforce (3M workers) as of November 2024, including USPS employees[2].  
   - Executive-branch employment totaled 2,278,730 in March 2024[2], with attrition rates historically offset by new hiring.  

2. **Policy developments**:  
   - **January 2025 hiring freeze** ([5]) prohibited filling vacancies or creating new civilian positions, exempting only national security, immigration enforcement, and public safety roles.  
   - **Efficiency plan mandate**: OMB was required to submit a workforce reduction plan by April 2025 ([5]), but this would not affect February’s YoY calculation.  

3. **Verification sources**:  
   - **FRED CES9091000001** ([1]) provides the authoritative seasonally adjusted YoY metric, but February 2025 data is unavailable in the provided results.  
   - **BLS establishment survey** ([4]) tracks monthly federal employment changes, though the April 2025 report postdates the resolution period.  

4. **Uncertainties**:  
   - **Exemption implementation**: The freeze allowed OPM-granted exemptions, creating potential variability in workforce counts[5].  
   - **USPS inclusion**: Postal Service employment (600,000+ workers) is included in federal totals but operates semi-autonomously[2], potentially diluting freeze impacts.  

**Conclusion**: While the hiring freeze suggests downward pressure, the exact February 2025 YoY change requires FRED’s CES9091000001 data point, which is unavailable here. Pre-freeze trends (e.g., ~3M workers in late 2024[2]) and post-freeze attrition would determine the final figure.
