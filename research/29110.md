# Will Intel Get Dropped from the Dow Jones Industrial Average Before January 1, 2025?

As of September 2024, there has been significant speculation about Intel's potential removal from the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) due to its dramatic stock price decline and diminishing influence in the index. Let's examine the available evidence to assess this possibility.

## Intel's Current Status in the DJIA

Intel joined the Dow Jones Industrial Average in 1999, making it one of the first technology companies to be included in this prestigious 30-stock index[1]. However, as of September 2024, Intel's position in the index has become precarious:

- Intel is the lowest-weighted component of the DJIA, constituting just 0.3% of the index[1]
- The stock has fallen nearly 60% since the start of 2024, making it the worst-performing DJIA component[1]
- By September 9, 2024, Intel stock had declined by 62% in 2024 alone[4]

## Factors Suggesting Potential Removal

Several factors indicate Intel might be vulnerable to removal from the DJIA:

**Price-Weighting Concerns**: The DJIA is a price-weighted index, meaning companies with higher share prices have greater influence. Intel's shares were trading approximately 29 times lower than UnitedHealth (UNH), the Dow's highest-weighted stock as of September 2024[2]. This is significant because S&P Dow Jones Indices typically monitors stocks trading at levels 10 times lower than the highest-weighted stock[2].

**Historical Performance**: Intel has significantly underperformed the broader semiconductor sector. While the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) has returned over 700% in the decade leading to September 2024, Intel stock lost nearly 46% of its market value during the same period[4].

**Business Challenges**: Intel faces substantial operational difficulties:
- Disappointing Q2 2024 earnings sent shares to their lowest level since 2013[1]
- The company has lost more than $210 billion in market value since January 2020[2]
- Intel suspended its dividend and reduced its workforce by 15% due to financial pressures[4]
- The company struggles with bloated chip inventories and a money-losing foundry division[2]

## Recent Precedent for Index Changes

The most recent change to the DJIA occurred in February 2024, when Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) was replaced by Amazon (AMZN)[1]. This demonstrates that S&P Dow Jones Indices is willing to make changes to maintain the index's relevance and representativeness of the U.S. economy.

## Expert Opinions

Financial analysts have expressed mixed views on Intel's prospects:
- The consensus among 42 polled investment analysts as of April 2024 was to "hold" Intel stock[3]
- The median price target from 34 analysts was $40.21, representing a 38.42% increase from April 2024 opening prices[3]

However, these analyst projections preceded Intel's continued stock decline through the summer of 2024.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors complicate the forecast:

1. S&P Dow Jones Indices has not commented on Intel's status in the DJIA. When asked, a spokesperson declined to comment[1].

2. There are no fixed rules for DJIA component selection or removal. The committee that manages the index has significant discretion.

3. Intel's historical significance as a pioneering technology company might factor into the decision beyond pure price-weighting considerations.

4. The timeframe between announcement and implementation could be very short, as index changes are typically implemented quickly to prevent front-running.

## Conclusion

Based on the available information as of September 2024, Intel appears at significant risk of being removed from the DJIA before January 1, 2025, due to its dramatically reduced share price, minimal index weighting, and ongoing business challenges. However, no official announcement had been made as of the latest available information, and the decision ultimately rests with the S&P Dow Jones Indices committee.
