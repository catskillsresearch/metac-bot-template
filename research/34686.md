# Forecasting Elon Musk's Attendance at Super Bowl LIX (2025)

Based on information available as of February 7, 2025, here's an analysis of whether Elon Musk will attend Super Bowl LIX on February 9, 2025.

## Current Status and Relevant Information

Super Bowl LIX is scheduled to take place on February 9, 2025, at the Caesars Superdome in New Orleans, featuring the Kansas City Chiefs against the Philadelphia Eagles[2]. This will be a rematch of Super Bowl LVII, with the Chiefs aiming for a historic third consecutive Super Bowl victory[2].

President Donald Trump is confirmed to attend the event, which will make him the first sitting U.S. President to attend a Super Bowl[1][2]. According to reports, House Speaker Mike Johnson and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem will accompany President Trump to the event[1].

Regarding Elon Musk specifically, there is speculation about his potential attendance alongside President Trump, as indicated by media coverage questioning whether he will join the President at the event[1]. However, as of February 7, 2025, there is no official confirmation of Musk's attendance plans.

## Recent Announcements Affecting the Forecast

The U.S. Secret Service has released a statement confirming "extensive planning and coordination" and indicating "enhanced security" for attendees at the Super Bowl[1]. This suggests preparations for high-profile attendees, potentially including figures like Elon Musk, though he is not specifically mentioned in security announcements.

While the full traveling party for President Trump has not been announced yet, there is public interest in whether Elon Musk might be among those accompanying the President[1].

## Verification Sources

The most authoritative sources for verifying Musk's attendance would be:

1. Official statements from Elon Musk himself, potentially via his social media accounts
2. White House or Presidential communications regarding the official traveling party
3. NFL or Super Bowl organizer announcements about VIP attendees
4. Media reports from the event itself on February 9

## Limitations and Uncertainties

The primary limitation in forecasting Musk's attendance is the lack of official confirmation from either Musk himself or official White House sources. While there is speculation about his potential attendance with President Trump, this remains unconfirmed as of February 7, 2025[1].

Additionally, high-profile figures like Musk often make last-minute decisions about event attendance based on security considerations, personal schedule changes, or other factors that cannot be predicted in advance.

The resolution of this question will ultimately depend on verified reports of Musk's physical presence within the stadium grounds during the Super Bowl on February 9, 2025.
