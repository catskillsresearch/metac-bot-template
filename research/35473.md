## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Gilmour Space Technologies has been developing the Eris rocket, aiming for Australia's first sovereign orbital launch[5].
- The company completed major technical milestones, including the final qualification test-fire of its Sirius hybrid rocket engine and a wet dress rehearsal ahead of the first test flight[2][5].
- Regulatory approval was a significant hurdle, but as of November 2024, Gilmour Space received the country’s first orbital launch permit for its maiden Eris rocket launch from Bowen Orbital Spaceport[5].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- On February 24, 2025, Gilmour Space announced a launch window for its first orbital rocket, stating that the countdown is on and targeting mid-March 2025 for the Eris launch[1][3].
- News outlets and Gilmour's own updates confirm that regulatory delays have been resolved, and the company is preparing for a mid-March launch[3].
- The company has completed all major pre-launch preparations, and there are no public indications of further delays as of February 28, 2025[2][3].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Gilmour Space’s official website and news releases[1][2][3][5].
- Independent launch tracking sites such as RocketLaunch.Live, though their latest update lists the launch as "targeted for Q2 2025," which may be less current than Gilmour’s own February 2025 announcement[4].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- Rocket launches are inherently risky and subject to last-minute delays due to technical, weather, or regulatory issues.
- While all regulatory and technical preparations appear complete, and a mid-March 2025 launch is targeted, there is no guarantee the launch will occur before April 1, 2025.
- As of February 28, 2025, there is no public record of a successful launch.

## Summary Forecast

Based on all available factual information as of February 28, 2025, Gilmour Space Technologies is highly likely to launch its Eris rocket before April 1, 2025, with a mid-March window targeted and regulatory approval secured. However, the possibility of unforeseen delays means this outcome is not certain.
