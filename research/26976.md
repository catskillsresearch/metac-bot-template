# California Senate Bill 1047: Enactment Forecast Analysis

California Senate Bill 1047, the "Safe and Secure Innovation for Frontier Artificial Intelligence Models Act," represents a significant regulatory effort targeting frontier AI models. Based on information available as of August 8, 2024, here's an analysis of factors relevant to forecasting its enactment before October 1, 2024.

## Current Status and Timeline

SB 1047 passed the California Senate on May 21, 2024, with strong bipartisan support in a 32-1 vote[1][5]. Following Senate approval, the bill was scheduled for an Assembly vote in August 2024[3][5]. If passed by the Assembly, the final step would be Governor Gavin Newsom's signature to enact it into law[3].

The legislative timeline is tight but feasible for enactment before October 1:
- Senate passage: May 21, 2024 (completed)
- Assembly vote: August 2024 (pending)
- Governor's consideration: Would need to occur by September 30, 2024

According to the legislative process, the bill must pass the Assembly by August 31, 2024, to remain viable in the current session[1].

## Key Provisions of SB 1047

The bill establishes regulatory requirements for developers of large-scale AI systems:

1. **Scope and Applicability**: Targets AI models "trained using a quantity of computing power greater than 10^26 integer or floating-point operations (FLOPS), and the cost of that quantity of computing power would exceed one hundred million dollars ($100,000,000)"[4].

2. **Developer Requirements**:
   - Pre-training certification that models will not enable "hazardous capabilities"[3]
   - Implementation of safeguards against harmful usage[3]
   - Legal liability for downstream use or modification of their models[3]
   - Annual certification of model compliance[4]
   - Mandatory reporting of AI safety incidents[4]

3. **Enforcement Mechanism**: Creation of a new Frontier Model Division within California's Department of Technology to oversee compliance[4].

## Factors Influencing Enactment

Several factors may influence whether SB 1047 will be enacted before October 1, 2024:

1. **Strong Initial Support**: The 32-1 Senate vote demonstrates robust bipartisan backing, suggesting potential for similar support in the Assembly[1][5].

2. **Industry Response**: The bill has become "a lightning rod for safety advocates and developers alike"[4]. Tech industry stakeholders have expressed concerns about potential impacts on innovation, which could influence Assembly members' votes and the Governor's decision.

3. **Regulatory Context**: SB 1047 uses the same metric for training computing power (10^26 FLOPS) referenced in the Biden Administration's AI Executive Order, aligning with federal approaches to AI regulation[4].

4. **California's Tech Leadership**: As "home to many of the largest and most innovative AI companies," California has incentive to establish "industry-leading policies for safe, responsible AI"[1].

5. **Legislative Volume**: SB 1047 is one of over 600 new pieces of AI legislation being considered across the United States, indicating the broader regulatory momentum in this space[5].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several uncertainties affect the forecast:

1. **Assembly Vote Outcome**: While Senate support was strong, Assembly dynamics may differ.

2. **Industry Lobbying**: Ongoing advocacy from tech companies could influence both the Assembly vote and Governor's decision.

3. **Potential Amendments**: The bill may undergo modifications in the Assembly that could affect its passage timeline or the Governor's willingness to sign.

4. **Governor's Priorities**: Governor Newsom's position on the specific provisions of SB 1047 was not clearly established in the available information.

The bill's sponsors include the Center for AI Safety Action Fund, Economic Security Action California, and Encode Justice[1], whose continued advocacy may influence its progression through the remaining legislative steps.
