## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Autonomous weapons with the capability to select and engage targets without direct human intervention exist and have been used in conflict zones. The first documented use was in Libya in 2021, where a drone reportedly operated independently to attack retreating forces[3].
- The proliferation of drones, particularly among non-state actors, has accelerated sharply. The number of non-state groups using drones for attacks rose from 6 in 2018 to 91 in 2023—a 1,400% increase[5].
- However, most drone-related deaths remain within the context of military conflicts or civil wars. As of mid-2022, there were no confirmed media reports of at least 50 civilians being killed by autonomous drones outside a military conflict[3][5].

## 2. Recent Announcements and Policies

- Efforts to ban or regulate autonomous lethal weapons failed at the United Nations in 2021, underscoring the lack of binding international agreements to prevent proliferation or misuse[3].
- Several international conferences (Latin America, Luxembourg, UN General Assembly) have since been held, and both the UN Secretary General and the ICRC President called for a treaty on autonomous weapons by 2026, indicating increasing global concern but not yet resulting in concrete restrictions[3].
- U.S. and international definitions of LAWS (lethal autonomous weapon systems) now broadly include any weapon capable of selecting and engaging targets without further human input[2].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The United Nations Panel of Experts reports on autonomous weapon incidents[3].
- Major international news agencies and defense analysts track and verify drone-related casualties[5].
- The Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW) and related diplomatic processes are the primary forums for updates on policy and incident reporting[1][2][3].

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- Attribution: Distinguishing between truly autonomous attacks and remotely piloted or partially supervised drone strikes is challenging. Many drone systems involve varying degrees of human oversight and intervention[2][3].
- Reporting: Incidents outside conflict zones may be underreported, especially if perpetrated by non-state actors or criminal groups.
- Technical Barriers: While weapon autonomy is improving, reliably identifying and targeting specific individuals autonomously in complex civilian environments remains technically challenging and error-prone[3].
- Regulatory Response: The pace of policy change or technical countermeasures (e.g., anti-drone systems) could alter the likelihood of such attacks significantly before 2035.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the accelerating proliferation of drones and the steady advances in AI autonomy, it is plausible that non-state actors or criminal organizations could deploy autonomous lethal drones outside conflict zones by 2035. However, the lack of precedent, ongoing technical hurdles, and nascent regulatory efforts suggest that a major mass-casualty incident (≥50 civilian deaths) remains unlikely but possible within the forecast period.

**Estimated Probability:** 20–35% chance that at least 50 civilians will be killed by autonomous AI-driven "slaughterbots" outside military conflict by January 1, 2035, barring major advances in regulatory controls or counter-drone technology.
