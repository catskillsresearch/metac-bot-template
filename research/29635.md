# Forecasting Kalshi vs Coinbase App Store Rankings for December 31, 2024

Based on available information as of November 6, 2024, here's an analysis to help forecast whether Kalshi will outrank Coinbase in the top free Finance apps on December 31, 2024.

## Current Status and Recent Trends

As of November 5, 2024 (U.S. Election Day), Kalshi ranked first in Apple's finance app category and third overall among free apps, according to data from SensorTower[1]. This represents Kalshi's highest placement to date, with the surge clearly driven by interest in betting on the 2024 U.S. presidential election outcomes[1].

Prior to this peak, Kalshi had been gaining momentum in the app rankings. On October 20, 2024, Kalshi reported it was "skyrocketing to the top of finance apps, beating out big names like Robinhood, Coinbase and Fidelity"[2]. The query notes that on October 11, 2024, Kalshi's CEO tweeted that the app had surpassed Coinbase in the rankings, though Coinbase regained its lead the following day.

## Factors Driving Kalshi's Performance

Several key factors have contributed to Kalshi's recent surge in popularity:

1. **Election Betting Markets**: Kalshi relaunched its 2024 presidential election betting market on October 2, 2024, after securing a federal appeals court victory in September[3]. The presidential election market grew to $247 million in volume as of November 5, 2024[1].

2. **Regulatory Advantage**: Kalshi is currently the only prediction market operating in the U.S. that's regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC)[3]. This gives it a unique position in the legal U.S. betting market.

3. **Growing User Base**: Kalshi reports having over 1 million users trading across more than 300 markets including finance, politics, weather, culture, and more[4].

4. **High-Profile Attention**: The platform has gained attention from prominent figures, with its Instagram post noting that "even Elon Musk is using Kalshi as a source of truth"[2].

## Forecasting Considerations

When forecasting whether Kalshi will outrank Coinbase on December 31, 2024, several factors should be considered:

1. **Post-Election Trajectory**: The current rankings are heavily influenced by the U.S. presidential election. With the election concluding on November 5, 2024, Kalshi may experience a decline in user activity and downloads in the following weeks as election-related betting concludes.

2. **Cryptocurrency Market Conditions**: Coinbase's ranking is likely influenced by cryptocurrency market activity. Historical patterns suggest that cryptocurrency trading volumes can fluctuate significantly based on market conditions, which could affect Coinbase's ranking by December 31.

3. **New Market Offerings**: Kalshi's ability to introduce compelling new prediction markets after the election could help sustain user interest. The platform offers various markets beyond politics, including finance, weather, and culture[4].

4. **Seasonal Factors**: App usage patterns may be affected by the holiday season and year-end activities, which could influence both apps' rankings differently.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several limitations exist in forecasting this outcome:

1. App store rankings are volatile and can change rapidly based on daily download rates and user engagement.

2. The historical pattern of Kalshi briefly surpassing Coinbase (October 11) before falling behind again suggests that maintaining a top position is challenging.

3. The available data doesn't provide information on retention rates for new Kalshi users who downloaded the app specifically for election betting.

4. External factors such as regulatory changes, app updates, marketing campaigns, or cryptocurrency market movements could significantly impact either app's ranking by December 31.
