### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- In 2024, the city of Madrid experienced a significant 20% rise in average housing prices, reaching €4,952/m² by December 2024[2][5].
- As of Q1 2025, the average residential price in Madrid is approximately €4,290/m², representing a 12.6% year-over-year increase[5]. However, this figure is lower than the December 2024 value, likely reflecting seasonal variation or differences in reporting periods.
- The broader Spanish property market saw an 8.1% year-on-year increase, with new-builds rising even faster[4].

### Recent Announcements and Policies

- The European Central Bank reduced interest rates four times in 2024, down to 3%, with further cuts expected in 2025. This has improved mortgage affordability and is expected to support continued demand[2].
- Despite strong demand and tight supply, experts anticipate a moderation in price growth for 2025, as high prices and new housing developments in Madrid may temper further increases[2].
- Forecasts for 2025 suggest price increases in Madrid and other major cities will likely range between 4.5% and 10%[2][5]. Some sources mention a recent 12.6% annual increase, but no forecast projects a rise above 18% for 2025[5].

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The Idealista portal provides monthly sales price data for Madrid and will be the definitive source for resolving the question.
- Caixabank Research and other market analysts consistently forecast price growth below the 18% threshold for 2025[2][5].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- Market forecasts are subject to change based on macroeconomic conditions, interest rate policy, and unforeseen events.
- The most recent available data is for Q1 2025; actual December 2025 prices may differ due to seasonal trends or market shocks.
- All figures are nominal and do not account for inflation.

### Conclusion

Based on current data and expert forecasts, it is highly unlikely that average housing prices in the city of Madrid will rise by more than 18% from December 2024 to December 2025. Most projections indicate a continued but more moderate increase, generally in the 5–12% range, well below the 18% threshold required for a "Yes" resolution[2][5].
