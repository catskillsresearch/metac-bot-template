## Key Factual Information for Forecasting China's Youth Unemployment Rate (October 2024)

**1. Recent Data and Trends**
- In September 2024, China's youth unemployment rate (ages 16-24, excluding students) was 17.6%, down from 18.8% in August 2024[1].
- In July 2024, the rate was 17.1%, the highest since the new methodology began in December 2023[1].
- The rate started 2024 at 14.6% (January), rose to 15.3% in February and March, and then increased further before the recent decline[5].
- After peaking at 21.3% in June 2023 (old methodology), the rate dropped to 14.9% in December 2023 following the exclusion of students from the calculation[3][4].

**2. Policy and Economic Context**
- The Chinese government has implemented various measures and incentives to support youth employment, but structural challenges persist, including skills mismatches and a large influx of new graduates in 2024[3][4].
- Economic headwinds such as a real estate downturn and weak manufacturing continue, though the services sector shows some resilience[2].
- Wage growth remains under pressure, even in new economy sectors, which may limit job creation for young workers[5].

**3. Measurement and Methodological Notes**
- The current official youth unemployment rate excludes students, as per the methodology adopted in December 2023[3][4].
- The rate is defined as the percentage of the labor force aged 16-24, not in school, who are unemployed and seeking work.

**4. Limitations and Uncertainties**
- The most recent data available is for September 2024; there is no official release for October 2024 as of November 7, 2024.
- The rate has shown volatility in 2024, with both upward and downward movements.
- Structural and cyclical economic challenges may slow further declines in the unemployment rate.

**5. Authoritative Sources for Verification**
- Trading Economics and the National Bureau of Statistics of China provide the official data series for youth unemployment rates.

**Summary Judgment**
- As of the latest available data (September 2024), the youth unemployment rate is above 17.0% (at 17.6%)[1].
- The recent downward trend is notable, but given persistent economic and structural challenges, it is uncertain whether the rate will fall to 17.0% or below in October 2024.
- The outcome will depend on whether the pace of improvement seen in September continues.
