**1. Historical Trends and Current Status**

- In 2019, a national survey by the Vegetarian Resource Group (VRG) found that 4% of U.S. adults self-identified as vegetarian (including vegan)[1].
- The vegan subset saw rapid growth in the late 2010s, reportedly increasing from 0.4% to 3.5% in the U.S. between 2017 and 2019[5].
- The trend towards plant-based diets continues, with both consumer interest and product availability rising sharply[2][3][5].

**2. Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Metric**

- Market analysis projects the North American plant-based food sector will exceed $27 billion in revenue by 2028, reflecting significant consumer shift towards plant-based eating[2][3].
- Increased policy and corporate support for plant-based options in food service and retail further reduces barriers for adoption[2].
- Broader social movements (health, environmental, animal welfare) continue to promote the benefits of vegetarian diets[5].

**3. Authoritative Forecasts and Sources**

- Community forecasting platforms, such as Metaculus, estimate that about 7.08% of U.S. adults will self-report following a vegetarian diet in 2028[1].
- Market and demographic studies corroborate steady growth in the vegetarian and vegan population, but suggest that strict adherence remains a minority trend[2][5].

**4. Limitations and Uncertainties**

- Self-reported vegetarianism may not strictly match actual dietary behaviors; some "vegetarians" occasionally eat meat.
- Some market growth is driven by "flexitarians" (those reducing meat intake), not strict vegetarians, which may inflate perceptions of strict vegetarian adoption[2][5].
- Survey responses are sensitive to question wording and definitions.

**Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment**

Based on these trends and sources, the most credible probabilistic forecast is:

> **In a major poll of U.S. adults in 2028, approximately 7% (likely in the range of 6â€“8%) will self-report following a vegetarian diet (including vegan).**

This estimate is supported by both community forecasts and market signals, reflecting continued but gradual growth from the 2019 baseline.
