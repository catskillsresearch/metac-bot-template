# Yu Shang Food, Inc. Recall Status Forecast Analysis

Based on information available as of January 30, 2025, here is an analysis of factors relevant to forecasting whether the Yu Shang Food recall will be closed before March 1, 2025.

## Current Status and Timeline

The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced a recall by Yu Shang Food, Inc. on November 9, 2024, which was subsequently expanded on November 21, 2024[1]. The recall involves approximately 72,240 pounds of ready-to-eat (RTE) meat and poultry products that may be contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes[3]. According to FSIS records, this recall is scheduled to remain active from November 21, 2024, until April 15, 2025[4], which extends beyond the March 1, 2025 date in question.

## Scope and Severity of the Recall

The recall encompasses all ready-to-eat products produced by Yu Shang Food prior to October 28, 2024[3][5]. These products bear establishment numbers "P-46684" or "EST. M46684" inside the USDA mark of inspection and were distributed to retail locations nationwide and sold online[5].

This recall is particularly serious as it is linked to a multi-state outbreak of Listeria monocytogenes infections that has resulted in illnesses, hospitalizations, and infant deaths[2]. The California Department of Public Health (CDPH) issued a warning on December 11, 2024, urging consumers not to eat, serve, or sell these products[2].

## Factors Affecting Recall Duration

Several factors suggest this recall may remain active beyond March 1, 2025:

1. **Product Shelf Life**: The recalled products have a long shelf life of 8-12 months[2], meaning they could remain in consumers' refrigerators and freezers well into 2025.

2. **Outbreak Investigation**: FSIS and public health partners, including the CDC and state officials, are conducting an ongoing investigation into the multistate outbreak linked to these products[1]. Additional testing has confirmed Listeria monocytogenes in both product and environmental samples, with whole genome sequencing underway to determine if these samples match the outbreak strain[1].

3. **Expanded Recall Scope**: The recall was significantly expanded on November 21, 2024, increasing from 4,589 pounds to 72,240 pounds of product[1], indicating the potential severity and breadth of contamination.

4. **Official Timeline**: FSIS documentation explicitly indicates the recall is scheduled to remain active until April 15, 2025[4].

## Verification Sources

The primary authoritative source for verifying the status of this recall is the FSIS website, particularly the recall page for Yu Shang Food, Inc.[4]. The CDPH has also issued warnings and updates regarding this recall[2].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

While the scheduled end date for the recall is April 15, 2025, several factors could potentially alter this timeline:

1. If the outbreak is contained more quickly than anticipated
2. If all affected products are successfully removed from the market
3. If further investigation reveals a more limited scope of contamination

However, given the serious nature of Listeria contamination, the widespread distribution of products, their long shelf life, and the documented timeline from FSIS, it appears unlikely that the recall will be closed before March 1, 2025.
