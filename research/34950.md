# Forecasting Global Temperature for February 2025

Based on available information as of February 11, 2025, here's an analysis to help forecast the global land and ocean temperature increase for February 2025.

## Recent Temperature Trends

The most recent global temperature data shows that January 2025 set a record as the warmest January in recorded history, with global surface temperatures measuring 1.33°C (2.39°F) above the 20th-century average of 12.0°C (53.6°F)[4]. This continues the trend of exceptional warmth observed in recent years.

## Current Climate Conditions Affecting February 2025

Several key factors are likely to influence February 2025 temperatures:

1. **La Niña Conditions**: A slowly-developing La Niña is currently influencing global weather patterns[3]. La Niña typically leads to varying regional temperature effects rather than uniform global cooling.

2. **Regional Temperature Forecasts**: NOAA's February 2025 outlook indicates:
   - Well above average temperatures across the southern and eastern United States and in northern and western Alaska[1]
   - Below-average temperatures across parts of the northern U.S. (from the western Great Lakes westward) and in southeastern Alaska[1]
   - Above-normal temperatures for much of the southern and eastern U.S.[5]
   - Below-normal temperatures in the Pacific Northwest, Northern Rockies, and northern regions of North America[5]

3. **Circulation Patterns**: The predicted atmospheric circulation for February features an amplified trough across much of the western and north-central U.S. and ridging over the southern tier and along the East Coast, consistent with typical La Niña response[1].

## Analysis for Global Temperature Prediction

While regional forecasts provide valuable insights, predicting the exact global temperature anomaly requires considering several factors:

1. **January 2025 Baseline**: With January 2025 recording a 1.33°C anomaly[4], February could follow a similar pattern, especially if the drivers of January's warmth persist.

2. **La Niña Influence**: While La Niña typically has a cooling effect on global temperatures, recent La Niña years have still produced above-average global temperatures due to the underlying warming trend from climate change[3].

3. **Regional Variations**: The forecasted temperature patterns show a mix of above and below-normal temperatures across different regions[1][5]. The global average will depend on the relative strength of these regional patterns and how they balance out globally.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors create uncertainty in forecasting the exact global temperature anomaly:

1. **Regional vs. Global Forecasts**: Most available forecasts focus on regional patterns rather than providing a specific global temperature anomaly prediction[1][5].

2. **La Niña Variability**: The strength and exact impact of the developing La Niña conditions introduce uncertainty into temperature predictions[3].

3. **Data Availability**: Complete global temperature data for February 2025 will only be available after the month concludes.

## Conclusion

Based on the available information, particularly the January 2025 anomaly of 1.33°C and the ongoing La Niña conditions, February 2025's global temperature anomaly is likely to remain significantly above the 20th-century average. The January 2025 figure provides the most recent reference point, suggesting February might experience a similar range of warming, potentially in the >1.30 and <1.40 range, though this is subject to the uncertainties noted above.

For verification, the official NOAA global temperature data for February 2025 will be published at the NCEI "Climate at a Glance" global time series page after the month concludes.
