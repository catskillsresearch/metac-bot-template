### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- No U.S. president has ever formally invoked Article II, Section 3 of the Constitution to adjourn Congress, making this an untested and unprecedented action[1][2].
- President Trump has threatened to use the adjournment power in the past but has not followed through, and the tool remains theoretical in application[1][2].
- As of January 31, 2025, President Trump has renewed threats to adjourn Congress to facilitate recess appointments for Cabinet positions facing Senate delays[2].

### Recent Announcements and Policies

- In January 2025, Trump warned publicly and in private meetings that he might adjourn Congress if confirmation delays persist, specifically targeting opposition by Senate Democrats[2].
- The White House reportedly views this as "a significant possibility," but also indicates no immediate action is scheduled; the option remains under active consideration as of late January 2025[2].
- The Senate is controlled by Republicans, who generally support swift confirmation of Trump's nominees, but procedural delays—particularly by Democrats—have affected key appointments[2].

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Credible outlets such as CBS News and analyses from the Federalist Society confirm both the threat and the unprecedented nature of the adjournment power[1][2].
- Confirmation status and congressional proceedings can be monitored via official government and major news sites.

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- There is no direct historical precedent for invoking the adjournment power, so the legal process and political consequences are uncertain[1].
- Any formal invocation would likely face immediate legal and political challenges, raising the threshold for actual use.
- The situation is fluid and depends on both Senate action and Trump’s willingness to take a highly confrontational and risky constitutional step.

### Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the lack of precedent, the intention of the current Senate majority to cooperate with Trump's nominations, the severe legal risks, and the fact that as of January 31, 2025, Trump has not formally invoked this power (despite repeated threats), the probability that President Trump will formally adjourn Congress before January 1, 2026, remains very low—likely below 10%. The scenario is not impossible, especially if severe gridlock or political shocks arise, but all observable trends and incentives point away from formal invocation at this time[1][2].
