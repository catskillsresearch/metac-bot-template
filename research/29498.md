## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of October 2024, Sam Altman's net worth is listed at exactly $1 billion by Forbes, based on his investments in companies such as Stripe, Reddit, and Helion[1][2][5].
- Altman does not own equity in OpenAI, so his wealth is not directly affected by OpenAI's valuation increases[1][2][5].
- His billionaire status is recent, with Forbes first listing him at $1 billion in early 2024[2][5].

## Recent Announcements or Policies Affecting the Metric

- There have been no public announcements of major asset sales, new equity grants, or other events that would significantly increase Altman's net worth since October 2024[1][2][5].
- OpenAI was reportedly seeking a new funding round at a $150 billion valuation, but Altman does not benefit directly due to his lack of equity[1].
- Altman's wealth is tied to private investments, and while companies like Stripe and Reddit have seen valuation changes, there is no evidence of a liquidity event or revaluation that would push his net worth above $1.1 billion as of the latest reporting[1][2][5].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The Forbes Real-Time Billionaires List and Altman's Forbes profile are the primary resolution sources for this metric.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- Forbes' estimates for Altman's net worth are based on public filings and investigative reporting, but his holdings are primarily in private companies, which can introduce some uncertainty in valuation[2].
- Unless there is a significant, public change in the value or liquidity of his investments, Forbes' published figure is unlikely to change dramatically in the short term.

## Conclusion

Based on all available factual information as of November 1, 2024, there is no evidence that Sam Altman's net worth will exceed $1.1 billion on the Forbes Real-Time Billionaires List by December 31, 2024. His net worth remains at $1 billion, and there are no announced events likely to change this status in the near term.
