## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of May 2025, Bluesky has approximately 36 million registered users[2].
- The platform experienced explosive growth after its public launch in February 2024, jumping from 13 million users in late October 2024 to 36 million in May 2025[1][2][3].
- Growth was fastest in late 2024, with the user base doubling from 10 million in mid-September to 20 million by late November, then reaching 25.9 million by December 19, 2024[3].
- The average monthly user growth in early 2025 is about 1–2 million, with app installs in April 2025 at 0.88 million[2].
- Projections based on current trends estimate Bluesky will reach about 53 million users by December 2025 and 84 million by December 2026 if the current pace continues[1].

## 2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- The surge in Bluesky users was partly fueled by users leaving X (Twitter) due to changes implemented by Elon Musk and by political events such as Donald Trump's re-election in November 2024[1][2].
- There are no reports of major new features, partnerships, or viral events in 2025 that would suggest a renewed surge in user growth as of late May 2025.

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- [Jazco's Bluesky Stats](https://bsky.jazco.dev/stats) is cited as the primary source for real-time user counts.
- Other sources include Exploding Topics, Backlinko, Statista, and TechCrunch[1][2][3][4].

## 4. Limitations or Uncertainties in Measurement

- User counts reflect registered users, not necessarily active users.
- Growth rates may fluctuate due to external events, platform changes, or shifts in the competitive landscape.
- If Jazco's Bluesky Stats or other credible sources stop reporting user numbers, the question will be voided.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

- Based on current and projected growth rates, Bluesky is unlikely to reach 100 million users by January 1, 2026.
- If the current trajectory holds (about 1 user per second, or 2.6–3 million per month), Bluesky will have around 53 million users by the end of 2025[1].
- To hit 100 million, Bluesky would need to add over 5 million new users per month for the next seven months—more than double its current pace.
- Unless there is a significant new catalyst (e.g., a major migration from another platform or a viral event), the probability of reaching 100 million users by the end of 2025 is low—likely below 10%.
