## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- **Regulatory stance:** Most EU countries allow preimplantation genetic testing (PGT) primarily for medical reasons, such as preventing genetic diseases. There are explicit legal and ethical prohibitions against using embryo selection for "eugenic" purposes, which would include selection based on polygenic scores for intelligence[2].
- **Public opinion:** European opinion polling reflects widespread caution or opposition toward genetic technologies aimed at enhancement (such as higher intelligence) rather than disease prevention. Although not all EU countries have been surveyed, supportive attitudes are rare[2].
- **IVF prevalence:** Several EU countries, particularly Denmark, have high rates of IVF births, demonstrating technical capacity. However, this does not translate into support for or use of embryo selection for intelligence[2].
- **Fertility tourism:** Europeans often seek fertility treatments abroad, especially in countries with more permissive regulations (e.g., Israel), indicating that restrictive local policies push demand overseas rather than enable rapid domestic adoption[2].
- **EU biotechnology policy:** European Union regulations and guidelines for biotechnology remain cautious and emphasize ethical review, particularly for emerging technologies such as embryo selection for enhancement[4].

## Recent Announcements or Policies

- No EU member state had, as of 2022, announced policies permitting or encouraging embryo selection for intelligence or other enhancement traits at a population scale[2][4].
- Ongoing EU regulatory updates for biotechnology focus on plants and do not signal imminent liberalization of human embryo selection for enhancement[4].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- National and EU-level regulations on IVF and embryo selection[2]
- Opinion polling on gene editing and embryo selection in Europe (Pew Research, referenced in question description)
- European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) guidelines[3]
- EU biotechnology policy documents[1][4]

## Limitations or Uncertainties

- Some smaller EU countries with high IVF uptake (e.g., Denmark, Estonia) could, in theory, move faster if policy or public opinion shifts, but as of 2022, there is no evidence of imminent change[2].
- Not all EU countries have clear, up-to-date public opinion data on this specific use case.
- Rapid advances in technology or shifts in political or social attitudes could alter the forecast, but these are not supported by available 2022 data.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the combination of restrictive regulation, negative or cautious public opinion, ethical concerns, and lack of supportive policy announcements as of 2022, it is unlikely that a European Union member state will be among the first ten countries to select more than 10% of its newborns for intelligence via polygenic embryo selection meeting the specified effect threshold. The probability should be assessed as **low** under these conditions.
