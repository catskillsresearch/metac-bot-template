## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Since the capture of Avdiivka in early 2024, Russian forces have made steady, incremental gains along the eastern frontline, particularly northwest of Avdiivka, expanding a salient and advancing toward Pokrovsk[3].
- As of August 29, 2024, Russian forces are actively pursuing two tactical efforts to set conditions for an intensified assault on Pokrovsk: 
  - One axis is advancing along the Novohrodivka-Hrodivka line east of Pokrovsk, aiming to seize Myrnohrad and reach Pokrovsk's outskirts.
  - The other is along the Selydove-Ukrainsk-Hirnyk line southeast of Pokrovsk, intended to widen the Russian salient and eliminate vulnerabilities to Ukrainian counterattacks[1].
- Russian advances have been confirmed in Novohrodivka, with geolocated footage showing Russian troops over two kilometers beyond previous positions and Ukrainian withdrawals from some areas southeast of Pokrovsk[2].
- Despite these advances, Pokrovsk itself remains under Ukrainian control as of the end of August 2024, with Russian forces focusing on eliminating Ukrainian salients and stabilizing their flanks before launching a direct assault on the city[1][2].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- Russian military command is prioritizing the Pokrovsk direction, deploying some of its most combat-capable troops to sustain the offensive[2].
- Ukrainian forces have reportedly withdrawn from certain positions southeast of Pokrovsk, indicating pressure but not a collapse of defenses in the city itself[2].
- There are ongoing concerns within the Russian command about potential Ukrainian counterattacks from positions east of the Selydove-Ukrainsk-Hirnyk line, which could disrupt Russian logistics and concentrations as they prepare for further advances[1].
- The Ukrainian incursion into Kursk Oblast has not significantly slowed Russian momentum near Pokrovsk, but it does present a strategic distraction for Russian forces[2].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) provides daily and weekly frontline maps and assessments, which are the primary reference for determining control of Pokrovsk[1][2].
- DeepStateMap is designated as the backup source for frontline control if ISW ceases updates.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- The pace of Russian advances, while steady, is described as "grinding" and comes at high personnel costs, which could slow or stall further progress before October 1, 2024[2].
- Ukrainian defensive positions and the potential for counterattacks introduce significant uncertainty, as does the possibility of operational shifts by either side.
- The situation on the ground can change rapidly, and open-source reporting may lag behind real-time developments.

## Summary

As of August 29, 2024, Russian forces are making tactical advances toward Pokrovsk and have achieved notable gains in surrounding settlements, but there is no evidence that Pokrovsk itself is under Russian control. The city remains contested, and while Russian forces are setting conditions for a possible assault, the timeline for capturing Pokrovsk remains uncertain. The most authoritative sources for frontline control are the ISW and DeepStateMap, which should be monitored for updates as the situation evolves.
