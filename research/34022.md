## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of January 29, 2025, only six out of fifteen Cabinet secretaries had been confirmed by the Senate in President Trump's second administration. High-profile roles like Secretary of State and Secretary of Defense are filled, but many others are either awaiting votes or have acting officials in place[1][2][3].
- The first Trump administration was marked by an unprecedented rate of Cabinet turnover, with many executive departments frequently led by acting officials—a pattern not observed in other recent presidencies[1].
- As of May 2025, confirmations are ongoing, but the pace remains sluggish, with some departments still lacking confirmed leadership[4].

## Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Metric

- The Senate has confirmed a handful of nominees since January 2025, but the pace is inconsistent and several positions remain open or filled by acting officials[4].
- No new policies or procedural changes have been announced that would significantly accelerate the confirmation process or limit the president’s reliance on acting officials as of this assessment[1][3].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The Brookings Institution tracks Cabinet turnover and appointment pace, highlighting the Trump administration’s unique pattern of acting appointments and slow confirmations[1].
- The official Senate website provides up-to-date records of nominee hearings and confirmations, useful for real-time verification[2][3][4].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- The main uncertainty is the rate at which the Senate proceeds with confirmations for remaining and future vacancies. Political dynamics, unforeseen resignations, or changes in Senate composition between now and December 2026 could affect the number of acting secretaries.
- If historical patterns of high turnover and slow confirmations persist, the likelihood of at least eight acting secretaries by the end of 2026 is elevated. However, a shift in political incentives or a concerted push to fill vacancies could reduce this probability.
- The metric is binary and sensitive to late-2026 events; even a flurry of confirmations or resignations just before the resolution date could swing the outcome.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the slow pace of confirmations as of early 2025, the Trump administration’s historical reliance on acting officials, and ongoing Senate gridlock, the probability that eight or more of the fifteen executive department heads will be serving in an acting role on December 31, 2026, is **elevated compared to typical administrations**. While not a certainty, a reasonable forecast would place this probability in the **30–50% range**, notably higher than under most previous presidents, but still allowing for the possibility that political dynamics may shift and vacancies could be filled before the resolution date[1][3].
