# Forecast Analysis: Will Annual Average Temperature Anomaly Reach 2.0°C by 2037?

Based on information available as of January 28, 2022, this analysis examines the likelihood of the annual average temperature anomaly exceeding 2.0°C above the 1850-1899 baseline by 2037.

## Current Trends and Status

As of early 2022, global temperatures have risen by approximately 0.11°F (0.06°C) per decade since 1850, accumulating to about 2°F (1.1°C) of total warming[3]. This warming has not been linear, with acceleration observed in recent decades.

According to the Carbon Brief analysis from December 2020, the timing of when the world might exceed 2°C depends significantly on future emissions scenarios[1]:

- Under modest mitigation scenarios (where emissions remain close to 2020 levels), the 2°C threshold would likely be exceeded between 2038 and 2072[1]
- Under SSP2-4.5 (a middle-of-the-road scenario with relatively flat emissions), the median year for exceeding 2°C is projected to be around 2048[1]
- More aggressive emissions scenarios show earlier exceedance dates:
  - SSP3-7.0 (higher emissions): Earlier than 2048
  - SSP5-8.5 (very high emissions): Potentially earlier still

## Key Factors Affecting the Forecast

Several factors influence when the 2°C threshold might be crossed:

1. **Emissions Trajectories**: As of early 2022, the IEA World Energy Outlook suggests the world is likely following a trajectory close to SSP2-4.5, with emissions remaining relatively flat in the near term[1].

2. **Historical Warming Rate**: If we simply extrapolate the warming rate observed over the 30 years prior to 2020, global temperatures would exceed 1.5°C around 2037, suggesting 2°C would be reached sometime after that[1].

3. **Climate Sensitivity**: Different climate models show varying sensitivity to greenhouse gas concentrations, creating uncertainty in temperature projections.

4. **Natural Variability**: Short-term climate fluctuations can temporarily accelerate or decelerate warming trends.

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on the information available as of January 2022:

- The median projection from climate models following the SSP2-4.5 scenario (considered most likely at that time) suggests 2°C would be reached around 2048, which is after the 2037 threshold in question[1].
- Even under more aggressive emissions scenarios, the median projections typically place 2°C exceedance after 2037.
- However, there is significant uncertainty in these projections, with some models showing earlier exceedance dates.

The bet specifically references the Berkeley Earth dataset for resolution. As of early 2022, projections using this dataset were not specifically available in the search results, which adds uncertainty to this assessment.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several important limitations affect this forecast:

1. **Model Uncertainty**: Different climate models produce varying estimates for when temperature thresholds will be crossed.

2. **Dataset Differences**: The choice of temperature dataset (Berkeley Earth vs. others) influences the projected exceedance year, as different datasets show slightly different historical warming trends.

3. **Emissions Uncertainty**: Future emissions depend on policy decisions, technological developments, and economic factors that are difficult to predict.

4. **Natural Variability**: Short-term climate patterns like El Niño can cause temporary temperature spikes that might lead to crossing thresholds earlier than the underlying trend would suggest.

## Conclusion

Based on information available as of January 28, 2022, it appears more likely than not that the annual average temperature anomaly will NOT exceed 2.0°C above the 1850-1899 baseline by 2037. Most median projections from climate models place this exceedance after 2037, though there is significant uncertainty in these estimates.

The probability of exceeding 2.0°C by 2037 would be estimated at approximately 30-40%, based on the range of model projections available at that time.
