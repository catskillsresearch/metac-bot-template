# Forecasting Total Likes on Bluesky for March 30, 2025

To forecast the number of total likes that will be made on Bluesky on March 30, 2025, I'll analyze the available historical data and current trends as of February 2025.

## Current Status and Historical Trends

As of February 11, 2025, Bluesky users have generated over 2.9 billion total likes across all posts on the platform[1]. This represents the cumulative total of all likes since the platform's inception, not daily activity.

Bluesky has experienced significant user growth, particularly in recent months:
- February 2025: Surpassed 30 million users[4]
- January 14, 2025: 27.44 million registered users[3]
- December 19, 2024: 25.9 million users[3]
- November 20, 2024: 20 million users[3]
- October 24, 2024: 13 million users[3]
- September 15, 2024: 10 million users[3]

This represents a growth of approximately 3 million users per month in early 2025. The platform saw particularly rapid growth in November 2024, adding 5 million users in a single week following the US presidential election[2].

## Engagement Metrics

While we don't have specific daily like counts, we can infer engagement patterns from available data:

- Users have created over 720 million posts as of December 2024[2]
- The total like count of 2.9 billion (as of February 2025) compared to user count suggests an average of approximately 97 likes per user across all time[1]
- Engagement distribution is uneven, with 50% of users having only 1 follower, while the top 0.01% have over 11,241 followers[1]

## Factors That May Influence March 30, 2025 Like Activity

Several factors could impact like activity on the specified date:

1. **Continued User Growth**: If the current growth rate of approximately 3 million new users per month continues, Bluesky could have around 33-35 million users by late March 2025.

2. **Platform Maturity**: As of February 2025, Bluesky has over 50,000 custom feeds[1], which may increase content discovery and engagement.

3. **User Distribution**: The largest age group visiting Bluesky's website is 18-24 year olds[2], a demographic typically associated with higher social media engagement.

4. **Day of Week Considerations**: March 30, 2025, is a Sunday, which may have different usage patterns compared to weekdays.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several limitations affect the accuracy of any forecast:

1. **Limited Historical Data**: We don't have daily like counts or trends over time, only the cumulative total as of February 2025.

2. **Growth Volatility**: Bluesky has experienced uneven growth, with surges during specific events (like the post-election period in November 2024).

3. **Platform Changes**: Any feature changes or algorithm updates between February and March 2025 could significantly impact engagement.

4. **Measurement Methodology**: The exact methodology used by Jaz's Bluesky index for counting likes on a specific day is not detailed in the available information.
