### Key Factual Information as of July 29, 2024

- Apple has a history of removing ports and pushing wireless technologies, but as of 2023, the company transitioned iPhones to USB-C in response to EU regulations, rather than going portless immediately[1][2].
- Persistent rumors about a portless iPhone have circulated for years, but credible reporting and supply chain leaks have consistently indicated Apple would first adopt USB-C, with a portless iPhone considered a future possibility, not an imminent release[1][3][4][5].
- The EU’s common charger directive, effective December 2024, requires USB-C for devices capable of wired charging, but does not mandate a port if the device is exclusively wireless. Apple’s response so far has been to adopt USB-C, not to remove the port entirely[1][2].
- As of July 29, 2024, there is no official announcement from Apple regarding a portless iPhone. While rumors mention a possible iPhone 16 "Ultra" with a portless design, these remain speculative and unconfirmed by Apple[3].
- All authoritative sources and industry analysts expect the iPhone 16 lineup to continue with USB-C ports in 2024, with a portless iPhone potentially coming in a later generation[1][3][4].
- Only an official Apple announcement would resolve this question as "Yes." Leaks, rumors, or unofficial information do not count.

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- All information about a portless iPhone is based on rumors and speculation. No official Apple statement or announcement has confirmed such a device as of the cutoff date.
- Apple’s product plans are closely guarded, and the company could theoretically make a surprise announcement, but there is no factual basis for expecting this before October 1, 2024.

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Apple’s official newsroom and press releases
- Major technology news outlets (e.g., MacRumors, 9to5Mac, AppleInsider)
- Regulatory filings and compliance documents

### Conclusion

Based on all available factual information as of July 29, 2024, there is no evidence to suggest Apple will announce a portless iPhone before October 1, 2024. All credible reporting points to continued use of USB-C in the upcoming iPhone 16 lineup, with a portless iPhone remaining a possibility for the future, but not yet officially announced.
