# Forecasting the Highest Rank of metac-GPT4o or metac-o1 in Q1 2025 Quarterly Cup

Based on the information available as of February 19, 2025, here is the relevant factual information to help forecast the highest rank of metac-GPT4o or metac-o1 in the Q1 2025 Quarterly Cup.

## Current Status

As of January 31, 2025, there was an active Metaculus question specifically asking about the highest rank of metac-GPT4o or metac-o1 in the Q1 2025 Quarterly Cup[1]. This indicates significant community interest in tracking the performance of these AI forecasting models in the current tournament.

The Q1 2025 Quarterly Cup is actively running, with forecasters being encouraged to participate as of January 13, 2025[2]. The tournament follows Metaculus's established format of featuring 40-50 questions on various topics.

## Historical Context

Metaculus launched the AI Forecasting Benchmark Tournament series in Q3 2024, specifically designed to compare the performance of different AI forecasting models. Both metac-GPT4o and metac-o1 are participating in the Quarterly Cup tournaments, using a combination of GPT models and AskNews for search capabilities.

These models follow a standardized forecasting approach:
- They forecast every two days
- They use structured prompts that include analysis of time remaining, status quo outcomes, and alternative scenarios
- They leverage AskNews as a research assistant to gather relevant information

## Limitations and Uncertainties

The available information has several limitations:

1. There is no specific data on the historical performance of metac-GPT4o or metac-o1 in previous Quarterly Cups
2. No current rankings or interim results for the Q1 2025 tournament are available
3. There is no information about recent improvements or changes to either model
4. The total number of participants in the Q1 2025 tournament is not specified

## Verification Sources

The Metaculus platform itself would be the authoritative source for verification of the final rankings once the Q1 2025 Quarterly Cup concludes. The question appears to be set up to resolve based on the official tournament leaderboard after all other questions have been resolved.
