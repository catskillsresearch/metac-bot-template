## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- China's youth unemployment rate (ages 16â€“24, excluding students) peaked at 18.8% in August 2024, following a surge of new graduates entering the job market[3].
- The rate then declined for three consecutive months, reaching 16.1% in November 2024, according to official data from the National Bureau of Statistics[3].
- This decline followed a methodological change in 2023, when China began excluding students from the calculation, resulting in lower reported rates[3].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- After reaching record highs in mid-2023 (21.3% in June 2023, before the methodology change), China temporarily suspended publication of youth unemployment data, resuming with the new calculation method later in 2023[3].
- There have been no major new policy announcements specifically targeting youth unemployment reported in the latest available sources, but ongoing economic uncertainty continues to affect the job market, especially for new graduates[3].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The National Bureau of Statistics of China is the primary source for official youth unemployment data.
- Trading Economics aggregates and reports this data and is the designated resolution source for this question.
- Additional context and historical data are available from Statista and international organizations such as the International Labour Organization[1][5].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- The current youth unemployment rate excludes students, which may understate the true level of youth joblessness compared to previous years[3].
- Official data may be subject to delays, revisions, or lack of transparency, especially if the rate rises sharply.
- The labor market remains volatile, with uncertainty about the pace of economic recovery and the absorption of new graduates.

## Forecast for January 2025

Given the downward trend from August to November 2024 (from 18.8% to 16.1%), and barring significant economic shocks or policy changes, it is reasonable to expect the youth unemployment rate for January 2025 to remain in the mid- to high-15% range, possibly between 15.5% and 16.5%. However, this is subject to the limitations and uncertainties noted above, and the actual reported figure will depend on official data releases by the National Bureau of Statistics and Trading Economics.
