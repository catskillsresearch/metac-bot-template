- The opposition, led by González and María Corina Machado, immediately rejected the official results, claiming their own tallies showed a clear victory for González, with Machado stating the opposition won 70% of the vote[3][4].
- The CNE did not release detailed polling station results, citing a supposed hack, and refused to provide evidence supporting the official announcement[3].

- As of the morning after the election, González had not conceded. Instead, he and Machado publicly asserted that the opposition had won and committed to defending the people’s vote by peaceful means[4].
- There were no calls for protests or civil disobedience from González as of July 29, but the opposition’s rejection of the results was clear and unambiguous[4].
- The opposition began posting thousands of paper results forms online to support their claim of victory[3].
