## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Only two nuclear weapons have ever been detonated as acts of war: Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945. Since then, despite numerous crises and close calls, no further nuclear detonations have occurred in conflict[4].
- As of late 2023 and 2024, the global nuclear arsenal is estimated at around 15,000 warheads, with the vast majority held by the United States and Russia. Other nuclear-armed states include China, France, the United Kingdom, India, Pakistan, North Korea, and Israel (the latter maintains official ambiguity)[2][5].
- The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) reports that while the overall number of nuclear warheads is slowly declining due to dismantlement of older weapons, the number of operationally deployed warheads is increasing. Several states are modernizing arsenals and developing new delivery systems, including multiple-warhead ballistic missiles[5].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- The 2024 Annual Threat Assessment from the U.S. intelligence community notes that the risk of nuclear use, while still considered low, is rising due to deteriorating geopolitical relations, especially involving Russia, China, and North Korea[1][4].
- Russia’s ongoing war in Ukraine has involved repeated nuclear threats and escalatory rhetoric, but as of October 2024, there is no evidence of actual nuclear use. Analysts note that significant changes on the battlefield or attacks deep inside Russia could alter risk calculations, but the current assessment is that the risk remains low[4].
- North Korea continues to develop its nuclear and missile capabilities and has provided ballistic missiles to Russia, increasing concerns about escalation dynamics, but no nuclear use has been reported[4].
- SIPRI’s 2024 yearbook emphasizes that the role of nuclear weapons in security policies is growing as international relations deteriorate, and more states are pursuing advanced nuclear capabilities[5].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The U.S. Office of the Director of National Intelligence’s 2024 Annual Threat Assessment[1]
- The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) Yearbook 2024[5]
- The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists and other risk assessment organizations[2][3]
- Major media outlets and international monitoring agencies (for event verification)

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- Risk assessments are based on current intelligence, trends, and expert judgment, but escalation can occur rapidly and unpredictably, especially in active conflict zones.
- Some nuclear-armed states (notably Israel) maintain official ambiguity, complicating verification.
- The deliberate use of a nuclear weapon as an act of war would likely be widely reported by credible media, but the possibility of covert or unacknowledged use, while extremely low, cannot be entirely excluded.

## Summary

As of October 21, 2024, there is no factual evidence that a nuclear weapon has been detonated as an act of war since 1945. While the risk of nuclear use is assessed as rising due to increased geopolitical tensions, especially involving Russia, Ukraine, and North Korea, the consensus among authoritative sources is that the probability of deliberate nuclear use before January 1, 2025, remains low but nonzero. This assessment is subject to rapid change if escalation occurs in any major conflict zone[1][4][5].
