## Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting Gold

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The only resolution source is Yahoo Finance's historical gold spot price data, specifically the closing price for Comex Gold Spot (GC=F) before October 1, 2024.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- Gold prices are highly sensitive to macroeconomic news, especially regarding US interest rates, inflation, and geopolitical risks[2][3][5].
- While the trend is upward, analysts note the potential for sharp pullbacks and resistance at current levels, making a rapid move above $2,700/oz uncertain[3][4].
- Consensus forecasts have only recently been upgraded by 1.5% for 2024, and no major analyst has projected a close above $2,700/oz in the immediate term[5].

## Summary

As of September 13, 2024, there is no evidence that Comex Gold Spot prices have closed above $2,700/oz, nor is there a clear consensus or technical indication that such a level will be reached before October 1, 2024, despite strong upward momentum and supportive macroeconomic conditions. The outcome remains uncertain and will depend on future market developments, as verified by Yahoo Finance's historical data.
