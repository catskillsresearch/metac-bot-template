### 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of late May 2025, *no comprehensive federal law* specifically regulates AI in the US, nor are there any federal statutes that impose tighter restrictions on open-source AI compared to closed-source AI[3].
- Nearly 700 AI-related bills were introduced at the state level in 2024 alone, with several states (notably Colorado) enacting comprehensive AI laws. However, federal action has stalled, and the regulatory landscape remains fragmented[4].
- The White House, as of July 2024, publicly supported open-source AI, stating in a report that there was "no need right now for restrictions on companies making key components of their powerful AI systems widely available". This position aligns with recent executive actions and reflects a broader federal reluctance to single out open-source models for stricter treatment.

### 2. Recent Announcements and Policies

- In July 2024, Meta released Llama 3.1 405B, the largest and most capable open-source AI model to date, sparking renewed debate about the risks and benefits of open-source AI.
- Major AI safety experts and organizations have continued to warn that open-source models may increase misuse and catastrophic risks, as powerful AI becomes accessible to malicious actors. However, these concerns have not (yet) translated into specific federal legislative proposals imposing stricter rules on open-source models.
- Most active legislative developments in 2024 and early 2025 have been at the state level, with states like Colorado and California taking divergent approaches. Even here, recent bills have tended to carve out exemptions for open-source or open-weights models, rather than targeting them for stricter regulation[5].
- The Commerce Department's July 2024 report, responding to a presidential executive order, acknowledged ongoing risks but recommended continued support for open systems, signaling no imminent move toward tighter federal regulation of open-source AI.

### 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- White & Case's AI regulatory tracker confirms that as of March 2025, "there are currently no comprehensive federal laws or regulations in the US that have been enacted specifically to regulate AI"[3].
- National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL) databases provide up-to-date tracking of AI bills at both state and federal levels, showing that while federal proposals exist, none have passed that treat open-source more restrictively than closed-source[1][2].
- AP News and The Verge report on both the technical advances (Meta's Llama 3.1) and policy stances (White House support for open-source) in mid-2024.

### 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- State-level action is robust and may influence or pressure federal lawmakers, but only federal law will resolve this question.
- The risk landscape could shift rapidly: a major misuse incident involving open-source AI could produce a legislative reaction, but as of May 2025, no such law is moving through Congress.
- The balance of expert opinion (AI safety vs. open-source advocates) remains sharply divided, and political winds could change, particularly in an election cycle or following a high-profile event.
- Definition ambiguities—what counts as "open-source" or "open-weights"—may complicate legal interpretation, potentially requiring a panel ruling if a law is ambiguous.

### Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given:

- The current absence of any enacted or advancing federal law targeting open-source AI for stricter regulation[3]
- Ongoing federal support for open-source approaches
- State-level activity not yet mirrored at the federal level, and recent legislative tendencies to *exempt* rather than restrict open models[5]
- The deep divide between expert warnings and prevailing tech industry influence

**As of May 2025, the probability that, before 2028, the US enacts a federal law regulating powerful open-source AI more tightly than closed-source AI remains low—likely in the 10–20% range.** The most plausible path to such a law would involve a significant misuse event or a dramatic change in the political or regulatory environment, neither of which is strongly indicated at present.
