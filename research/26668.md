### Key Factual Information as of July 29, 2024

**Current Status and Official Nomination**
- JD Vance was officially nominated as the 2024 Republican vice presidential candidate on July 17, 2024, at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee[1][2][4][5].
- The nomination was formalized by party delegates, and Vance accepted the nomination in a nationally televised address[4].

**Recent Developments and Announcements**
- Former President Donald Trump selected JD Vance as his running mate, announcing the decision just before the convention began[2][5].
- Vance is a first-term senator from Ohio, a Marine Corps veteran, and author of "Hillbilly Elegy"[2][3][5].
- There have been no official announcements or credible reports suggesting Vance will be replaced or has withdrawn from the ticket as of July 29, 2024.

**Controversies and Public Reaction**
- After his nomination, footage resurfaced of Vance making controversial remarks about "childless cat ladies," including a reference to Kamala Harris.
- Vance's net favorability ratings are historically low for a newly nominated vice presidential candidate, with a -16% net favorability in the Midwest and -5% nationally, according to CNN's Harry Enten. This is significantly lower than previous nominees like Dan Quayle (+15) and Sarah Palin (+26) at similar points in their campaigns.
- Despite these controversies and low favorability, there is no indication from party officials or major news outlets that his position as nominee is in jeopardy[3][5].

**Historical Precedent**
- The only modern precedent for a vice presidential nominee being replaced after official nomination is Thomas Eagleton in 1972, who withdrew due to revelations about his mental health treatment. Such replacements are extremely rare and typically require a major scandal or health crisis.

**Limitations and Uncertainties**
- While Vance's low favorability and resurfaced comments could theoretically increase pressure on the campaign, there is no evidence as of July 29, 2024, of any formal process underway to replace him.
- Unforeseen events (e.g., health issues, major scandals) could still occur, but there is no current factual basis to expect a change.
