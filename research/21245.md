## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

**Artificial General Intelligence (AGI):**
- As of early 2024, there has been rapid progress in AI capabilities, particularly in large language models and multimodal systems, but AGI—defined as AI matching or exceeding human-level flexibility and autonomy—has not yet been achieved.
- Recent expert surveys and public statements from leaders in the field (e.g., Google DeepMind, OpenAI) cluster their median forecasts for AGI between 2035 and 2050. Notably, a 2024 survey by AI Multiple found most experts assign a >50% probability to AGI emergence within this window, though a significant minority remain skeptical of arrival before 2050[1][5].
- Some high-profile figures predict AGI as soon as 2025–2030, while others (notably more cautious voices) suggest it may not arrive until nearer 2050 or later, emphasizing technical and conceptual hurdles[1][5].

**Major Global Conflict:**
- The post-Cold War era has seen a reduction in direct great-power warfare, but there are rising tensions between the US and China, ongoing regional conflicts, and renewed nuclear saber-rattling.
- Historical precedent (e.g., Cold War) demonstrates that even with high tension and multiple near-misses, large-scale wars and nuclear exchanges can be avoided for decades.
- As of January 2024, there has been no direct US-China military conflict exceeding 1,000 battle deaths, nor any nuclear weapon use in war since 1945, nor an event meeting the criteria for "World War III".

## 2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- AGI development: Major AI labs (OpenAI, DeepMind) have publicly committed to safety research and international coordination but are also racing to increase capabilities, with industry and governments launching new regulatory initiatives.
- Geopolitics: The US and China have taken steps both to deter escalation (e.g., military hotlines, arms control dialogues) and to compete (e.g., tech export controls, military modernization), fueling both optimism for stability and concern about flashpoints.
- Nuclear risk: There have been renewed calls for arms control, but also new nuclear modernization programs and some erosion of existing treaties.

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Expert surveys on AGI timelines (AI Multiple, Google DeepMind statements, Metaculus community forecasts)[1][5].
- Metaculus questions tracking probabilities for AGI, US-China war, nuclear detonation in war, and World War III.
- Public statements from AI and policy leaders, as well as historical data on major conflicts.

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- AGI predictions are highly sensitive to unpredictable breakthroughs, regulatory responses, and paradigm changes. Survey medians may shift rapidly with new developments[1][5].
- The probability of major war is affected by a complex web of factors, including political change, accidents, escalation dynamics, and technological shifts, each with their own uncertainties and feedback loops.
- The risks may be correlated; for example, AGI development could either mitigate or exacerbate global conflict risk, but the net effect is deeply uncertain.
- Expert and crowd forecasts are subject to optimism bias, model uncertainty, and limited by the lack of historical precedent for both AGI and global nuclear war.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the best available evidence as of January 2024:
- The median forecast for AGI arrival is between 2040 and 2050, with substantial uncertainty in both directions[1][5].
- The risk of a major global conflict, while elevated relative to the post-Cold War low, remains below the levels seen during the most dangerous periods of the 20th century, though new sources of risk (e.g., AI arms race) are emerging.
- The probability of reaching 2050 *without* any of these four events occurring is less than 50%, but still substantial—likely in the range of 30–50%—based on the aggregation of community forecasts and expert opinion. This incorporates the possibility that one or more of the events (especially AGI) could happen before 2050, but that no single risk is overwhelmingly likely on its own by that date[1][5].

> In summary: The world in 2024 faces elevated but not unprecedented risk from both AGI development and major conflict. Current expert and community forecasts suggest roughly even odds (or somewhat less) of making it to 2050 without any of the defined catastrophic events, with the main drivers of uncertainty being the pace of AI progress and geopolitical stability.
