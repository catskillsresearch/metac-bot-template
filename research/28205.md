# Boeing Strike Forecast Analysis: Will it Continue Through September 30, 2024?

Based on available information as of September 16, 2024, here's an analysis to help forecast whether Boeing's aircraft assembly factory workers will remain on strike through September 30, 2024.

## Current Status of the Strike

Boeing's machinists in the Puget Sound area began their strike on September 13, 2024, at 12:01 a.m. PDT after overwhelmingly rejecting a new four-year employment contract[1][3]. The strike involves approximately 33,000 Boeing machinists, with most workers located in Washington state[3]. The union vote showed that 94.6% of members rejected the deal and 96% voted in favor of striking[1].

The rejected contract included:
- A 25% increase in average pay over four years
- A commitment from Boeing to build its next new aircraft in the Puget Sound region (contingent upon board approval)[1]

The strike is expected to significantly impact aircraft production, affecting programs such as:
- 737 Max
- 767
- 777
- P-8A
- KC-46[1]

## Historical Context and Strike Duration Patterns

Looking at Boeing's strike history provides important context for forecasting the current strike's duration:

- The last full contract was negotiated in 2008, which resulted in a 58-day strike[2]
- Boeing also experienced a 10-week walkout in 1995[3]

These historical patterns suggest Boeing strikes typically last for extended periods, often measured in months rather than days or weeks.

## Financial and Operational Impacts

The financial stakes are significant for both sides:

- According to TD Cowen, a 50-day strike could cost Boeing between $3 billion and $3.5 billion in cash flow[1]
- The 2008 eight-week strike cost the company approximately $100 million daily in deferred revenue[3]
- The strike is expected to disrupt Boeing's supply chain, potentially creating conditions similar to those during the pandemic when some parts suppliers went bankrupt[2]

## Negotiation Status and Union Position

The strike represents significant worker dissatisfaction:

- Workers are expressing resentment over concessions made in past negotiations, including the loss of pension benefits and the relocation of 787 Dreamliner production to South Carolina[1]
- IAM District 751 President Jon Holden stated, "This is about respect, this is about the past, and this is about fighting for our future"[3]
- The union plans to survey members to decide which issues to emphasize when negotiations resume[3]

## Forecast Considerations

When forecasting whether the strike will continue through September 30, 2024 (17 days after the strike began), several factors suggest a prolonged dispute:

1. Historical precedent shows Boeing strikes typically last much longer (58 days in 2008, 10 weeks in 1995)
2. The overwhelming rejection of the contract (94.6%) indicates a significant gap between worker demands and Boeing's offer
3. The union's plan to survey members before resuming negotiations suggests no immediate resolution is expected
4. Boeing's existing challenges (manufacturing problems, federal investigations) may complicate negotiations

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several uncertainties could affect the strike duration:

- No information is available about scheduled negotiation sessions
- Boeing's financial pressures might incentivize a quicker resolution
- The search results don't indicate any third-party mediation efforts
- The AP's Strike Hub reporting timeliness is uncertain

Given the historical patterns of Boeing strikes lasting multiple months, the significant gap between the parties' positions, and the absence of any reported progress in negotiations, the available evidence suggests a strong possibility that the strike will continue through September 30, 2024.
