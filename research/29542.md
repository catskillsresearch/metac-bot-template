### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of the CDC’s Nowcast for the two-week period ending October 26, 2024, the KP lineage (including KP.3.1.1) accounted for an estimated 68% of sequenced COVID-19 variants in the US. KP.3.1.1 alone was at 57%[2].
- The XEC variant, a recent offshoot, increased from 2% on September 14, 2024, to 17% by October 26, 2024, indicating rapid growth[2].
- KP.3.1.1 became the predominant variant in August 2024, after KP.2 first exceeded 10% prevalence in April 2024[2].
- A recent preprint study suggests XEC has the potential to outcompete KP.3.1.1 and other major lineages, though as of late October, it remained a distant second[2].

### Recent Announcements and Policies

- There have been no major changes to CDC’s variant tracking methodology or reporting frequency as of early November 2024. The CDC continues to report both weighted (empirical) and Nowcast (model-based) estimates, with weighted estimates lagging by several weeks due to processing time[2].
- The CDC’s reporting period remains at two weeks for variant proportions[2].

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The CDC COVID Data Tracker’s variant proportions page is the definitive source for weighted estimates of variant prevalence in the US[2].
- The World Health Organization and ECDC provide global and regional updates but defer to CDC data for US-specific trends[1][3][4].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- Weighted estimates are delayed by several weeks, so the most recent rapid changes in variant prevalence (such as XEC’s surge) may not be fully reflected in the latest available empirical data[2].
- Nowcast estimates are model-based and less reliable for official resolution, per the question’s criteria.
- Variant displacement can occur rapidly, but the exact timing is difficult to predict due to factors such as transmission dynamics, population immunity, and sampling variability.
- There is no evidence of imminent changes to CDC’s reporting or variant definitions that would affect the measurement before January 5, 2025.

### Summary

- As of late October 2024, KP remains the dominant lineage, but XEC is growing rapidly and may soon challenge KP’s dominance.
- The empirical (weighted) estimate for KP is still well above 50%, but if XEC’s growth continues at the recent rate, it is plausible that KP’s share could fall below 50% in a weighted estimate before January 5, 2025.
- The outcome will depend on whether XEC’s rapid growth is sustained and captured in the CDC’s weighted estimates for periods ending between November 9, 2024, and January 4, 2025.
