# Forecasting Texas Drought Population by December 31, 2024

Based on available data and forecasts as of November 2024, here's an analysis of factors that would help determine whether 15.0 million or more Texas residents will be living in drought conditions by the end of 2024.

## Current Drought Status and Recent Trends

As of early April 2024, approximately 24% of Texas was experiencing drought conditions (D1-D4 on the U.S. Drought Monitor scale), with 45% of the state classified as abnormally dry or worse (D0-D4)[5]. This represented a slight increase from the previous month when 23% of the state was under drought conditions[5].

The drought situation has been dynamic throughout 2024:

- In January 2024, central Texas experienced drought expansion southward, while much of the Southern Plains saw minor improvements[3]
- Extreme drought or worse remained at 2% of the state as of April 2024, with exceptional drought at 0%[5]
- Drought has been particularly persistent in western Texas and southern New Mexico[3]

## Forecasts and Projections for Late 2024

Multiple authoritative forecasts suggest drought conditions are likely to persist or worsen in Texas through the end of 2024:

- The U.S. Winter Outlook released on October 17, 2024, indicates that states bordering the Gulf of Mexico, including Texas, have the greatest likelihood for drier-than-average conditions[1]
- The Winter 2024-25 Outlook from October 24, 2024, projects that drought conditions are expected to persist across the Great Plains and likely to develop or worsen across portions of the Southwest and Gulf Coast[2]
- The October to December 2024 Outlook specifically notes that precipitation is leaning drier than normal for Deep South Texas and the Rio Grande Valley, with drought potentially developing by November/December 2024[4]

## Regional Variations

The drought impact is not expected to be uniform across Texas:

- West and Far West Texas are projected to see drought conditions remain and expand[5]
- Deep South Texas and the Rio Grande Valley are forecasted to experience drier than normal conditions through the October-December period[4]
- The Hill Country region may see some drought improvements, according to earlier 2024 forecasts[5]

## Limitations in Population Impact Assessment

While the forecasts strongly suggest expanding drought conditions in Texas through the end of 2024, there are several limitations in determining whether the 15.0 million population threshold will be reached:

1. The search results do not provide specific population figures for areas currently affected by drought
2. Population density varies significantly across Texas regions, making it difficult to translate geographic drought coverage to population impact
3. The exact timing and severity of drought development in different regions remain uncertain

## Conclusion

Based on the available forecasts, Texas is likely to experience persistent or worsening drought conditions through December 31, 2024, particularly in the western, southwestern, and Gulf Coast regions of the state. The Winter 2024-25 outlooks from both NOAA and the National Weather Service consistently project drier conditions for Texas[1][2].

Given that Texas has a population of approximately 30 million residents and forecasts indicate drought conditions could affect substantial portions of the state, there is a significant possibility that the 15.0 million threshold could be reached. However, without more precise population distribution data overlaid with drought forecasts, it's difficult to make a definitive prediction about meeting the exact 15.0 million resident threshold.

The most authoritative source for verification will be the U.S. Drought Monitor data available at the specified resolution link (drought.gov/states/texas), which will provide the official count of Texas residents in drought areas as of December 31, 2024.
