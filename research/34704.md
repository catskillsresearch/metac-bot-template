# Will the US Accuse China of Blockading Taiwan Before April 1, 2025?

As of early February 2025, there is no evidence that the United States has formally accused the People's Republic of China of blockading Taiwan. However, several developments and patterns in cross-strait relations provide context for assessing this possibility.

## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

China has increasingly employed "gray zone" coercion tactics against Taiwan in recent years, which fall short of armed conflict but are designed to wear down Taiwan's resistance to reunification with the mainland[1]. These tactics have included:

- Suspension of authoritative cross-strait communication channels since 2016
- Restrictions on tourism to Taiwan
- Thousands of daily cyberattacks against Taiwanese government agencies
- Economic pressure against countries maintaining ties with Taiwan
- Military intimidation through exercises and drills[1]

In October 2024, following President Lai's National Day speech, China launched large-scale naval drills and war games near the Taiwan Strait, which China's military described as a "stern warning" against "separatist acts of Taiwan independence forces"[1].

China has staged almost daily military activities around Taiwan, including war games that have specifically practiced blockades and attacks on ports[4]. These exercises demonstrate China's capability to implement a blockade if it chooses to do so.

## Recent Developments (Prior to February 2025)

### Undersea Cable Incidents

On January 5, 2025, the Taiwanese government alleged that a Chinese-owned vessel, the Shunxin-39, cut an undersea fiber-optic cable near Taiwan's Keelung Harbor by dragging its anchor across the seabed[5]. All seven crew members were reportedly Chinese nationals, and the ship's owner was based in Hong Kong[5]. This incident follows similar sabotage in 2023 that severed two submarine cables connecting Taiwan's Matsu Islands[5].

These actions represent what analysts describe as "gray-zone harassment" or hybrid warfare tactics that fall short of a formal blockade but demonstrate China's willingness to disrupt Taiwan's communications infrastructure[5].

### Strategic Assessment

Security analysts have identified a blockade as a potential strategy China might employ against Taiwan. According to a report published by the U.S. Naval War College, the United States is currently ill-equipped to defend against such a blockade[4].

Some experts suggest China may be pursuing a strategy of "ratcheting up economic and political pressure on Taiwan" to create a situation where "the Taiwanese decide on their own volition to throw in the towel and bow to Chinese demands without a shot being fired"[4].

The timing of recent provocations, occurring in the weeks before Donald Trump's second inauguration, suggests China may be testing the resilience of the Taiwan-U.S. partnership and Washington's broader commitment to Indo-Pacific security[5].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors complicate the assessment of whether the US will accuse China of blockading Taiwan:

1. **Definition of "blockade"**: There is ambiguity about what actions would constitute a formal blockade versus "gray zone" activities. China's current approach appears focused on intimidation and harassment rather than a traditional military blockade[1][4][5].

2. **US policy transition**: With the return of the Trump administration (as indicated by references to "President-elect Trump" in October 2024[4]), there may be shifts in US policy toward China and Taiwan that could affect how the US characterizes Chinese actions.

3. **Escalation risk**: Both the US and China have incentives to avoid direct confrontation. The US might be cautious about formally accusing China of a blockade, as this could require a military response[1].

4. **Information limitations**: Some military and intelligence assessments regarding Chinese activities around Taiwan may not be publicly available.

Based on the available information prior to February 8, 2025, while China has engaged in provocative actions including military exercises practicing blockades and sabotage of undersea communications, there is no evidence that the United States has accused China of implementing an actual blockade of Taiwan's seaports.
