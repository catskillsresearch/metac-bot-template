As of February 8, 2025, there are no credible public reports or official data disclosing how many US federal employees accepted the deferred resignation offer (the "Fork in the Road" program) that was available from January 28 to February 6, 2025. While the offer was extended to approximately 2.3 million federal workers, no verified acceptance numbers have been released. News coverage highlights widespread confusion and pressure but does not provide numeric acceptance figures. Consequently, the exact number of federal workers who accepted the offer remains unknown and unreported as of this date[1][2][3].
