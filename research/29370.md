# Oregon Measure 117: Ranked-Choice Voting Forecast Analysis

## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

Oregon Measure 117 would implement ranked choice voting (RCV) for all federal and statewide races in Oregon by 2028[1]. This voting system allows voters to rank candidates in order of preference, with the candidate receiving a majority of votes in the final round declared the winner[4].

The measure was referred to voters by the 2023 Oregon Legislature with strong support in both chambers:
- 35 yea votes in the House (with one excused)
- 17 yea votes in the Senate (on the last day of session)[4]

Several Oregon jurisdictions have already adopted or are implementing RCV:
- Corvallis and Benton County currently use RCV in their elections
- Portland voters passed a new system of government that includes RCV for mayor and city council elections
- Multnomah County will begin using RCV in 2026[1][5]

This local adoption trend suggests growing familiarity with RCV among Oregon voters. Additionally, more than 50 jurisdictions across the United States already use ranked choice voting, including Maine and Alaska[5].

## Recent Announcements/Policies

The measure has garnered significant organizational support, including endorsements from:
- League of Women Voters of Oregon
- Oregon American Civil Liberties Union
- Various labor unions[5]

Opposition to the measure comes from several sources:
- Some Republican lawmakers have expressed concerns about complexity and potential for errors
- State Rep. Ed Diehl (R-Scio) argued at a September 2024 debate that there is insufficient evidence that RCV meets goals of "transparency, ease of use, cost effectiveness, accessibility, predictability"[5]
- County clerks have raised concerns about lack of infrastructure and funding to support this voting change[1]
- The Equal Vote Coalition opposes the measure, though specific reasons aren't detailed in the search results[1]

If approved, Measure 117 would not take effect until 2028, providing a four-year implementation period[5].

## Financial Impact

The Oregon Secretary of State's office has estimated costs associated with Measure 117:
- Approximately $0.9 million during the 2023-25 biennium
- These funds would support necessary staff and consulting services to begin implementation[4]

The measure includes provisions for "culturally-appropriate, community-based education of voters" to be conducted by the Secretary of State[4].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors create uncertainty in forecasting voter approval:

1. **Partisan divide**: While the measure passed the legislature with significant support, it appears to have a partisan dimension, with only one Republican representative (Charlie Conrad from Dexter) voting in favor during the 2023 legislative session[5].

2. **Voter education challenges**: The complexity of RCV compared to traditional voting methods may require significant voter education. The measure's inclusion of education provisions acknowledges this challenge[4].

3. **Implementation concerns**: County clerks have expressed concerns about infrastructure and funding, which could influence voter perception of feasibility[1].

4. **Ballot exhaustion**: Critics have raised concerns about "exhausted ballots," which occur when all candidates ranked on a voter's ballot are eliminated, potentially resulting in that ballot not being counted in the final tally[5].

5. **Competing narratives**: Supporters argue RCV ensures winners have majority support and leads to more civil campaigns, while opponents question whether it truly delivers more democratic results compared to traditional methods[1][4].

The outcome will likely depend on how effectively each side communicates their position to voters and whether Oregon voters view the experiences of jurisdictions already using RCV as positive precedents.
