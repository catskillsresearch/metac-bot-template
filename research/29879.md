# Will the Social Democratic Alliance Lead Iceland's Government After the 2024 Elections?

As of November 11, 2024, Iceland is preparing for snap parliamentary elections scheduled for November 30, 2024, following the collapse of Prime Minister Bjarni Benediktsson's coalition government in October 2024. This analysis examines the available information that could help forecast whether the Social Democratic Alliance will secure the prime ministership after these elections.

## Current Political Situation

Iceland's political landscape is in a period of significant transition. In October 2024, the coalition government consisting of the Independence Party, the Progressive Party, and the Left-Green Movement collapsed due to disagreements over several key issues including immigration, energy policy, and the cost-of-living crisis[4][5]. Following this breakdown, Prime Minister Bjarni Benediktsson met with President Halla Tómasdóttir on October 15, 2024, to submit his government's resignation, which was accepted. The current government was asked to serve in a caretaker role until a new government could be formed after the parliamentary election set for November 30, 2024[5].

## Historical Context and Political Trends

The Independence Party has historically dominated Icelandic politics, having been the largest party in parliament for decades with only one exception in 2009 following the financial crisis[5]. Since 1991, the Independence Party has only been in opposition for a period of four years, demonstrating its remarkable political resilience and dominance in Icelandic governance[5].

However, the current political climate suggests a potential shift in this long-standing pattern. According to polling data available before the election, the Social Democratic Alliance was projected to become the largest party after the November 2024 elections, while the Independence Party was expected to reach "an all-time low" in terms of electoral support[5].

Political analyst Harðarson (quoted in the Nordic Labour Journal) noted that if these polling results were to materialize, it would represent a "watershed moment in Icelandic politics"[5]. The potential displacement of the Independence Party from its position as the largest parliamentary party would be historically significant, having occurred only once before in recent history.

## Factors Affecting the Outcome

Several factors could influence whether the Social Democratic Alliance secures the prime ministership:

1. **Electoral Performance**: If the Social Democratic Alliance becomes the largest party as polls suggest, they would be in a strong position to lead government formation negotiations.

2. **Coalition Dynamics**: Iceland's parliamentary system typically requires coalition governments. The Social Democratic Alliance's ability to form alliances with other parties will be crucial.

3. **Historical Precedent**: Despite not being the largest party in the 2017-2024 coalition, the Left-Green Movement held the prime ministership under Katrín Jakobsdóttir, demonstrating that the largest party doesn't automatically secure the top position.

4. **Public Sentiment**: The collapse of the previous coalition suggests public appetite for political change, potentially favoring opposition parties like the Social Democratic Alliance.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several uncertainties remain that could affect the outcome:

- Polls can shift significantly before election day, as noted by analyst Harðarson[5].
- Coalition negotiations in Iceland can be complex and unpredictable.
- The resolution criteria specify that if no one receives the mandate to form a government before January 1, 2025, the question resolves as "No."

## Conclusion

Based on information available as of November 11, 2024, there are strong indicators suggesting the Social Democratic Alliance could secure the prime ministership following the November 30 elections. Polling data shows them potentially becoming the largest party, which would represent a historic shift in Icelandic politics. However, the final outcome will depend on both electoral results and subsequent coalition negotiations, which cannot be predicted with certainty.
