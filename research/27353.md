## Historical Trends and Current Status

- The Russo-Ukraine war, intensified by Russia’s 2022 invasion, has resisted resolution despite multiple rounds of negotiations and international mediation. Both sides maintain maximalist positions: Russia demands recognition of annexed Ukrainian territories and Ukrainian neutrality, while Ukraine insists on restoring its pre-2014 borders.
- Early negotiations (e.g., in Belarus and Turkey) stalled due to irreconcilable demands, and more recent mediation attempts by China and others have also failed to achieve a breakthrough.
- The US and its Western allies have imposed sweeping sanctions on Russia and provided substantial military and economic aid to Ukraine, but no major peace process has succeeded so far.

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- Trump has repeatedly claimed he could end the war “within 24 hours” if re-elected, citing his negotiating skills and relationships with both Ukraine and Russia. However, critics and analysts widely doubt the feasibility of such claims, given the entrenched positions of both sides and the complexity of the conflict.
- Trump’s prospective foreign policy team is expected to include loyalists and individuals with hawkish or non-interventionist leanings, such as Rep. Mike Waltz (National Security Advisor) and Sen. Marco Rubio (Secretary of State), indicating a possible shift in approach toward the Russia-Ukraine conflict[1][3][5].
- Reports suggest Trump may be more transactional and open to pressuring Ukraine to accept concessions that would be unpalatable to the current Ukrainian government and many of its Western supporters[3].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Official announcements from the White House and State Department regarding peace negotiations.
- Bilateral agreements published by the Ukrainian and Russian governments.
- Acknowledgments by the heads of state or representatives of Russia, Ukraine, or the US regarding Trump’s role in facilitating talks.
- Prestigious international peace prizes awarded to Trump for these efforts.

## Key Differences and Impact on Forecast

- Unlike earlier US-led peace deals (e.g., Dayton, Abraham Accords), both Ukraine and Russia currently show little willingness to compromise, and the stakes for each side are existential.
- Trump’s unconventional and highly personal style may enable new talks but also risks alienating allies or pressuring Ukraine into a deal that may not meet the strict resolution requirements.
- The makeup of Trump’s foreign policy team suggests a possible willingness to break with longstanding bipartisan support for Ukraine, but it is unclear if this will translate into effective leverage over the warring parties[1][3][5].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- New battlefield dynamics, internal political changes in Russia or Ukraine, or unexpected third-party interventions could alter the diplomatic landscape.
- The probability of a formal, bilateral, and comprehensive ceasefire or peace agreement—sustained for at least 30 days and covering all combatants and all disputed territory—remains low under current conditions.
- Trump’s influence could increase the chances of some form of temporary or partial ceasefire, but the resolution criteria exclude limited or regional arrangements.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given current facts and trends, the likelihood that Trump, if re-elected, will achieve a bilateral ceasefire or peace agreement in the Russo-Ukraine war (as strictly defined by the resolution criteria) is low. While a Trump administration might change US diplomatic posture or pressure Ukraine toward negotiation, the structural obstacles—deep-seated territorial disputes, mutual distrust, and lack of compromise—remain formidable.

**Estimated probability: 10-20%** for a fully qualifying bilateral agreement achieved and sustained during Trump’s term, barring major unforeseen developments.
