As of May 25, 2025, I'll analyze the available data on Trump's cabinet confirmations to help forecast how many appointments might not be confirmed by the Senate.

## Current Confirmation Status

Based on the available information, at least eight of Trump's cabinet nominees have already been confirmed by the Senate:

1. **Pete Hegseth** (Defense Secretary): Confirmed on January 25, 2025, in an extremely narrow 51-50 vote requiring Vice President JD Vance's tie-breaking vote[3].

2. **Kristi Noem** (Homeland Security Secretary): Confirmed on January 25, 2025, with a more comfortable 59-34 margin[3].

3. **Linda McMahon** (Education Secretary): Confirmed with a 51-45 vote[4].

4. **Jamieson Greer** (U.S. Trade Representative): Confirmed with a 56-43 vote[4].

5. **Kelly Loeffler** (Small Business Administration): Confirmed with a 52-46 vote[4].

6. **Howard Lutnick** (Commerce Secretary): Confirmed with a 51-45 vote[4].

7. **Robert F. Kennedy Jr.** (Health and Human Services): Confirmed narrowly with a 52-48 vote, largely along party lines[4].

8. **Brooke Rollins** (Agriculture Secretary): Confirmed with a substantial 72-28 vote, showing strong bipartisan support[4].

As of May 21, 2025, Trump has nominated 315 individuals to fill various roles in his administration[2], though this includes positions beyond just cabinet-level appointments.

## Confirmation Pattern Analysis

The confirmation votes reveal interesting patterns:

- **Close votes**: Several confirmations have been secured by narrow margins (51-50, 51-45, 52-48), indicating significant partisan division on these nominees.

- **Strongest opposition**: Pete Hegseth's confirmation as Defense Secretary was the most contentious, requiring the Vice President's tie-breaking vote[3].

- **Strongest support**: Brooke Rollins received the most bipartisan support with a 72-28 confirmation vote for Agriculture Secretary[4].

- **Confirmation timeline**: Most confirmations occurred between January and February 2025, with Hegseth and Noem confirmed on January 25[3], and Rollins confirmed on February 13[1].

## Factors Influencing Confirmation Prospects

Several factors appear to be influencing the confirmation process:

1. **Senate composition**: Republicans currently hold a narrow majority in the Senate, which has facilitated confirmations despite close votes on controversial nominees.

2. **Nominee backgrounds**: Nominees with more controversial backgrounds or policy positions (like Pete Hegseth and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.) faced tighter confirmation votes.

3. **Expertise and experience**: Nominees with relevant experience in their fields appear to be receiving somewhat stronger support.

4. **Policy priorities**: Nominees have emphasized key administration priorities during confirmation hearings, such as Hegseth's focus on "rebuilding the nation's military" and "reforming the acquisition process"[3].

## Assessment of Non-Confirmation Risk

Based on the confirmation patterns observed so far:

1. The Senate has successfully confirmed nominees across multiple departments, including some contentious choices.

2. The Republican Senate majority, though narrow, has proven sufficient to confirm even the most controversial nominees.

3. No information is available about any failed nominations, withdrawals, or nominations returned to the president.

Given the current Senate composition and confirmation record, it appears that most of Trump's cabinet nominees are likely to be confirmed, though some may face significant opposition and narrow margins. The administration has been strategic in navigating the confirmation process, with even the most controversial nominees securing the necessary votes.

However, the incomplete information available makes it difficult to provide a precise forecast of how many, if any, nominees might ultimately not be confirmed.
