# Forecasting Laredo Oil's 10-K Filing Before October 1, 2024

Based on the available information as of September 2024, there is limited data to make a comprehensive forecast about whether Laredo Oil, Inc. will file its 10-K annual report with the SEC before October 1, 2024.

## Current Status and Recent Activities

Laredo Oil, Inc. (OTC Pink Sheets: LRDC) has been actively engaged in business operations in 2024. On March 14, 2024, the company announced that Texakoma Exploration and Production, LLC exercised its option to drill eight additional wells under an existing development agreement[4]. This indicates ongoing business activities, with Chairman and CEO Mark See expressing optimism about the company's mineral rights development in Valley County, Montana.

## Considerations Regarding Late SEC Filings

While there is no specific information about Laredo Oil's filing status in the search results, it's worth noting that delayed filing of annual reports can have significant consequences for companies:

- Companies that delay filing annual reports become ineligible to use registration statements on Form S-3 to register the offer and sale of securities until one year after regaining and maintaining status as a current filer[3].
- This ineligibility can increase transaction costs and time required to complete financial transactions, potentially harming a company's financial condition[3].
- Companies that fail to file timely reports typically receive notifications from regulatory authorities, as mentioned in the question description.

## Limitations in Assessment

The available information does not provide:

- Any direct statements from Laredo Oil regarding their plans to file the 10-K
- Historical patterns of Laredo Oil's filing behavior
- Information about any remediation efforts following the August 29, 2024 notification
- Details about the company's current financial reporting capabilities or challenges

## Conclusion

Based solely on the limited information available, it is difficult to make a confident forecast about whether Laredo Oil will file its 10-K before October 1, 2024. The company appears to be operationally active based on its March 2024 announcement[4], but there is insufficient data regarding its financial reporting status or intentions to file the required annual report by the specified date.

For accurate verification, interested parties should monitor the SEC's EDGAR database at the link provided in the resolution criteria.
