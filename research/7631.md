## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of August 2021, Israel does not recognize the State of Palestine, and has consistently voted against UN resolutions affirming Palestinian statehood or supporting a two-state solution[1][5].
- The State of Palestine has been recognized as an observer state by the United Nations and over 130 UN member states, but not by Israel or key allies such as the United States[1][5].
- Repeated international initiatives and negotiations (Oslo Accords, Camp David, Roadmap for Peace, etc.) have failed to produce mutual recognition or a final resolution[5].
- The 2021 crisis and subsequent events illustrated continued volatility and lack of progress; violence and entrenched positions have persisted in the absence of substantive negotiations[2][3].
- Israel’s dominant political parties, as of 2021, largely oppose unilateral recognition of Palestine, preferring direct negotiations to address final borders and status[4][5].

## Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- The UN General Assembly reaffirmed support for a two-state solution in 2021, but Israel voted against this resolution[5].
- As of 2021, no major Israeli governmental moves indicated any shift toward recognizing Palestinian statehood, and policies have often moved in the opposite direction, including settlement expansion and security crackdowns[3][5].
- The US, under both Democratic and Republican administrations, has not recognized Palestine as a sovereign state, continuing to support bilateral negotiations as the path to recognition[5].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- United Nations General Assembly records and Security Council resolutions[1][5]
- Official policy statements from the Israeli government[1][5]
- Major media outlets such as BBC, Reuters, and AP, which routinely report on any developments in recognition status

## Limitations and Uncertainties in Measurement

- The 2070 horizon introduces substantial uncertainty, as political landscapes can change dramatically over decades.
- Recognition is a legal and diplomatic act, and the resolution requires clear, official documentation—ambiguity in statements or de facto arrangements would not suffice.
- Potential for regional wars, diplomatic realignments, or transformative leadership in Israel or Palestine, any of which could abruptly change probabilities.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the entrenched positions, failed negotiations, and current regional dynamics as of August 2021, the probability that Israel will formally recognize Palestine before 2070 is low, but not negligible. Historically, such recognitions often take decades and may be triggered by major geopolitical changes. If current trends persist, recognition is unlikely, but over a 50-year period, the possibility for dramatic shifts—due to generational change, external pressure, or crisis—cannot be ruled out.

**Estimated probability as of 2021:**  
- 20–35% chance that Israel will recognize Palestine before January 1, 2070.
