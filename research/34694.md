# Forecasting Canada's CPI Growth Rate for January 2025

Based on available information as of early February 2025, several indicators point to a specific forecast for Canada's Consumer Price Index (CPI) growth rate for January 2025.

## Current Status and Recent Trends

As of late January 2025, inflation in Canada is reported to be close to 2.00%[3]. The Bank of Canada's Monetary Policy Report from January 29, 2025, confirms that inflation remains close to 2%[1]. This represents a continuation of the central bank's efforts to maintain price stability near its target rate.

## Key Policy Impact: GST/HST Holiday

The most significant factor affecting January 2025's inflation rate is the temporary GST/HST holiday implemented by the Government of Canada. In mid-December 2024, the government introduced a two-month GST/HST holiday on select consumer goods and services, which comprise approximately 12% of the total CPI basket[5].

According to Desjardins' economic analysis published on January 14, 2025:

- The GST/HST holiday could reduce the level of total CPI by anywhere from 0.1% to 1.1% in January 2025
- Their central estimate is a 0.6% reduction in the CPI level
- This tax holiday is expected to cause total CPI inflation to fall from 2.4% to 1.8% year-over-year in January 2025[5]

This 1.8% forecast is modestly above the "around 1Â½%" projection that accompanied the Bank of Canada's December 2024 interest rate announcement[5].

## Broader Economic Context

The temporary nature of this tax holiday means its effects will be short-lived. Desjardins projects that the first quarter of 2025 will see total CPI inflation of approximately 2.2%[5]. Furthermore, the Bank of Canada forecasts economic growth in Canada to rise to around 1.8% in 2025 and 2026, which may have implications for inflation as excess supply is gradually absorbed[2].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors create uncertainty in these projections:

1. The extent to which GST/HST holiday savings will be passed on to consumers is uncertain, affecting the actual impact on CPI
2. Desjardins notes that the lower base effects in early 2025 will push reported year-over-year inflation rates higher in early 2026[5]
3. The Bank of Canada has highlighted that the threat of new tariffs is causing major uncertainty in economic forecasts[1]
4. The temporary nature of the GST/HST holiday means the Bank of Canada may "look through" these effects when setting monetary policy[5]

## Conclusion

Based on the most recent and authoritative forecasts available before February 7, 2025, Canada's CPI growth rate for January 2025 is expected to be approximately 1.8% year-over-year, primarily due to the temporary effects of the GST/HST holiday.
