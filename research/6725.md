## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The police abolition movement gained significant momentum in 2020, particularly following the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis. This led to unprecedented calls to dismantle the Minneapolis Police Department[1][2].
- In 2021, Minneapolis voters considered "Question 2," a ballot measure to abolish the police department and replace it with a Department of Public Safety. The measure failed, with 56.2% voting "no" and 43.8% voting "yes"[1].
- Even in Minneapolis, support for abolition was uneven. Notably, Black voters expressed more concern about public safety than White voters, contributing to lower support among the demographic most affected by police violence[1].
- Other high-profile examples, like Seattle's Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone (CHAZ), were temporary and not the result of formal governmental action. The CHAZ experiment ended after several weeks and multiple violent incidents[2].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- Since the defeat of Minneapolis Question 2, no major American city has made serious moves toward the full abolition of its police department.
- The focus has shifted to incremental reforms, such as budget reallocations ("defunding") and changes in policing practices, rather than outright abolition. These reforms do not meet the strict criteria for "full abolition" as defined in the resolution[3].
- Political and community support for full abolition has waned, with many activists and officials now emphasizing reform over abolition[2][5].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Official election results for Minneapolis Question 2[1].
- Analysis and reporting on the aftermath of the abolition movement in Minneapolis and Seattle[2].
- Clarification of the distinction between "defund" and "abolish" in public discourse[3].
- Academic and legal analysis of the abolition movement's trajectory[4][5].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- Societal and political dynamics can change rapidly, especially after major incidents of police violence or shifts in public safety concerns.
- The possibility of future technological or policy innovations could alter traditional policing models, but there is currently no evidence of imminent, large-scale abolition efforts in cities over 1 million population.
- Measurement hinges on official government action, not temporary or informal changes.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the failure of the most prominent abolition effort (Minneapolis 2021), the lack of subsequent serious attempts in other large cities, and the ongoing preference for incremental reform over abolition, the likelihood that a large American city will fully abolish its police department before 2035 is lowâ€”likely well below 10%, absent a major, unforeseen sociopolitical event.
