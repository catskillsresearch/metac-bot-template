**Forecast on Databricks IPO Announcement Before July 1, 2025**

1. **Historical and Current Status**  
Databricks has been a highly anticipated IPO candidate for several years but has consistently delayed going public, opting for large private funding rounds instead. As of early 2025, the company raised approximately $10 billion at a $62 billion valuation, signaling strong private market support and reducing immediate IPO pressure[5][1].

2. **Recent Announcements and Policies**  
Public statements, including from Databricks CEO, have indicated that it is "dumb to IPO this year," reflecting caution due to market conditions and a preference to wait for a more favorable environment[1]. Analysts expect an IPO in late 2025 or early 2026, but no SEC Form S-1 filing or official announcement has been made as of May 2025[3][4][5].

3. **Key Differences Affecting Forecast**  
- The recent large private funding round delays the need to go public imminently.  
- Market volatility and leadership caution reduce the likelihood of a near-term IPO announcement.  
- No official IPO filing or announcement has been made, unlike typical IPO timelines where filings precede the offering by months.

4. **Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment**  
- Probability of Databricks announcing an IPO plan before July 1, 2025: Low (estimated under 30%).  
- More likely that the announcement will occur later in 2025 or early 2026, closer to the actual IPO event.

5. **Verification Sources**  
- No SEC Form S-1 filing for Databricks as of May 2025.  
- No IPO announcement on Databricksâ€™ official news channels.  
- Market and investment analysis platforms monitoring IPO activity.

6. **Limitations and Uncertainties**  
- Sudden strategic changes or improved market conditions could accelerate an IPO announcement unexpectedly.  
- Private company decisions are not always publicly disclosed in advance.

**Conclusion:** Based on current evidence and market context, it is unlikely that Databricks will announce plans for an IPO before July 1, 2025.
