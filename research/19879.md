## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Humanoid robots have been in development for decades, with notable examples such as Honda's Asimo and Boston Dynamics' Atlas. However, these projects have not achieved mass production, largely due to technical complexity, reliability, and cost barriers[3].
- Tesla's Optimus project began in 2021, with functional prototypes shown in public demos by 2024 and 2025. These robots currently demonstrate autonomous walking, object handling, and a range of household or industrial tasks[1][3].
- As of early 2025, Tesla has publicly demonstrated the second and third generations of Optimus, which can autonomously perform practical tasks such as sorting, carrying objects, and interacting with their environment without direct human control[1][3].
- Elon Musk and Tesla have stated intentions to produce at least 1,000 Optimus robots in 2025 for internal deployment within Tesla factories, with ambitions to ramp up to 10,000 and even 100,000 units per month in subsequent years[1][2][5].

## 2. Recent Announcements and Policies

- In January 2025, Elon Musk stated Tesla aims to build 10,000 Optimus robots within the year, with limited production starting in 2025 and full-scale production targeted for 2026 and beyond[2][5].
- Tesla is leveraging its manufacturing expertise from electric vehicles and batteries, repurposing assembly lines and automation processes to scale robot production more rapidly than previous industry attempts[1].
- Competition is increasing: Huawei is also targeting mass production of humanoid robots in 2025, signaling broader industry confidence and supply chain maturation for key components[5].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Tesla's official site and public investor communications[4].
- Press coverage from outlets such as Electrek, DigiTimes, and CNET[2][5].
- Detailed demonstrations and product updates on Tesla’s official YouTube channel and robotics industry guides[1][3].

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- Tesla CEO Elon Musk is known for ambitious public timelines that sometimes slip in practice.
- Mass production of complex humanoid robots remains unproven at this scale; unforeseen technical or regulatory hurdles could cause delays.
- The definition of “mass produced” (1,000+ identical, autonomous, bipedal robots) sets a clear but challenging benchmark.
- While internal deployment (e.g., in Tesla factories) is the likely initial use case, external commercial sales may require further validation or regulatory approval.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given Tesla's current progress, manufacturing infrastructure, and stated aims, there is a high probability (estimated 80–90%) that Tesla will mass-produce at least 1,000 humanoid robots (meeting the described criteria) before January 1, 2028. However, some risk of delay persists due to technical complexity and the unprecedented nature of this scaling effort.
