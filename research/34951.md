# Forecasting US BLS Egg Prices for January 2025

Based on available data as of early February 2025, here is the relevant information to help forecast egg prices for January 2025.

## Historical Trends and Current Status

The price of eggs has been experiencing significant volatility in recent years:

- In December 2024, a dozen large Grade A eggs cost an average of $4.15 according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, representing a nearly 37% increase from December 2023[2][3].
- This price level is approaching the all-time record of $4.82 reached in January 2023[2].
- Egg prices had previously moderated after the January 2023 peak but began rising again in late 2024[3].
- For context, the December 2024 price of $4.15 is specifically for a dozen large, Grade A eggs[3].

## Recent Factors Affecting Egg Prices

The primary driver behind the current egg price increases is a severe avian influenza outbreak:

- The ongoing avian influenza outbreak that began in 2022 has killed more than 145 million birds in the U.S. as of late January 2025[2].
- There was a significant acceleration in infections over December 2024 and January 2025, with approximately 33 million birds affected during these two months[2].
- In December 2024 alone, more than 13 million egg-laying hens died due to the virus â€“ the most of any month in 2024[3].
- An additional 3.3 million hens died in early January 2025[3].
- The conventional egg-laying flock was reduced by 3.7% in January 2025 due to bird flu[2].

## Forecasts and Projections

Several authoritative sources have made projections about egg prices in 2025:

- The USDA has predicted that consumer egg costs will rise 20.3% in 2025[2][5].
- This projection comes while other food categories have seen price growth moderate, with costs rising below the historical average[2].
- The monthly volume of frozen eggs in storage recently reached the lowest level in nearly three years, according to the USDA, further constraining supply[2].
- Some grocery stores have begun implementing purchase limits on eggs due to supply shortages. For example, Market Basket locations in parts of Massachusetts were asking customers to limit purchases to two cartons per family in late January 2025[5].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

There are several factors that make precise forecasting of January 2025 egg prices challenging:

- The unpredictable nature of the avian influenza outbreak could either worsen or improve, directly impacting prices[3].
- Poultry economist Jada Thompson noted that egg prices will likely fall as bird flu cases decrease and the egg supply recovers, but more outbreaks could push prices back up[3].
- The regional concentration of egg production means that localized outbreaks can have outsized effects on national supply and prices[3].

Given the December 2024 price of $4.15 and the USDA's projection of a 20.3% increase in 2025, January 2025 prices could potentially show the beginning of this upward trend, especially considering the continued bird flu outbreaks in early January.
