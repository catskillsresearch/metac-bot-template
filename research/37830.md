## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The UK payrolled jobs data for May 2025 showed an initial drop of 109,139 jobs, with the headline figure at 30,174,813, a monthly decline more than double any previously reported in 2025[5].
- In recent months, revisions between the initial and the following month's release have typically been upward. For example, the March 2025 figure was revised by +31,000 jobs (from a reported -78,000 to -47,000) as more RTI data was incorporated[1].
- The ONS explicitly states that early payroll estimates are provisional and likely to be revised with additional data[1][4].
- Broader labour market indicators (employment rate, redundancies) do not show an acute crisis—employment rates remain stable and redundancies have decreased for three months[5].

## Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- The ONS has faced a "crisis of confidence" following an admitted error in calculating April 2025 inflation, raising scrutiny over all statistical releases and potentially affecting the revision process[5].
- No major new policies directly affecting payroll jobs reporting have been announced, but the broader economic context remains challenging, with declining vacancies and rising unemployment[5].

## Limitations and Uncertainties in Measurement

- The ONS warns of volatility in monthly payroll figures and advises treating early estimates with caution[4].
- Data collection and imputation methods are subject to adjustment, especially in times of increased data quality concerns[1][4].
- Given the scale of the initial reported drop, the possibility of a substantial revision—upward or downward—is higher than in typical months.

## Probabilistic Assessment

- Reference months have seen revisions in the range of +20,000 to +35,000 jobs, almost always upward[1].
- Given the ONS' recent reputational issues, they may be particularly cautious, but the magnitude of the initial drop and the pattern of prior revisions suggest a moderate upward revision is most probable.
- There is a non-negligible risk of a larger revision (in either direction), but historical precedent and context make a substantial further downward revision unlikely.

**Forecast:**  
- The most probable outcome is that the May 2025 payroll jobs figure for May 2025 will be revised upward by between +10,000 and +35,000 in the July 17 release, i.e., the new figure will be higher than the initial 30,174,813, with a best-estimate revision of approximately +25,000 jobs.
- There is a roughly 70% probability that the revision will fall between +10,000 and +35,000 jobs, a 20% probability of no substantive revision (±5,000 jobs), and a 10% probability of a further downward revision or a very large upward revision (>35,000).
- The probability of a revision exceeding ±20,000 jobs is moderate (estimated at ~40%), given both the recent volatility and ONS' efforts to correct potential errors quickly.
