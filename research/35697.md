# Forecasting Pilot UFO Reports from South America in March 2025

Based on the available information as of March 6, 2025, I'll analyze the likelihood of pilot UFO reports from South America in March 2025 by examining NUFORC's reporting patterns and relevant data.

## NUFORC Reporting System

The National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC) serves as a primary collection point for UFO/UAP sightings worldwide. NUFORC describes itself as "the most trustworthy, transparent and respectful organization for UFO/UAP witness and experiencer reporting"[1]. Their database allows users to browse reports, images, videos, and maps of sightings.

NUFORC maintains an interactive map of worldwide UFO/UAP sightings[2], indicating they collect reports from various countries, not just the United States. Their reporting system categorizes sightings by location, with specific sections for different regions and countries[3].

## Pilot Reports in NUFORC Database

The NUFORC database does contain reports from pilots, which is relevant to the forecasting question. For example, in the search results, there is a report from May 28, 1995, from Eagle Creek, OR, where a "Commercial pilot/ATP (14k hrs.) witnesses large, extremely bright, flaming obj. descend steeply in W sky"[5]. This demonstrates that NUFORC has historically collected and documented pilot sightings.

Another example shows a "Prof. mech./pilot w/ daughter witness bright green light w/ tail descend westbound into Ft. Lewis"[4], further confirming that pilot reports are a regular category within the NUFORC database.

## Geographical Distribution of Reports

While the search results show numerous reports from various U.S. states, including Washington, Oregon, Tennessee, and Michigan[4][5], they don't specifically mention South American countries. However, NUFORC's description as handling "worldwide" UFO/UAP sightings[2] suggests they do collect reports from South America.

The database organizes reports by location, with specific sections for different regions, including U.S. territories like Puerto Rico[3]. This organizational structure implies that reports from South American countries would be similarly categorized if received.

## Limitations for Forecasting

Several limitations affect the ability to forecast South American pilot reports for March 2025:

1. The search results don't provide historical data on the frequency of South American reports or pilot reports specifically from that region.

2. There's no information about seasonal patterns in UFO reporting from South America or whether March has historically been a month with higher or lower reporting rates.

3. The search results don't indicate whether NUFORC has specific outreach or reporting mechanisms tailored to South American pilots or aviation professionals.

4. While NUFORC collects worldwide reports, the search results don't clarify the relative proportion of reports from different continents, making it difficult to assess how common South American reports are in their database.

## Conclusion

Based on the available information, we can confirm that NUFORC:
- Collects worldwide UFO/UAP reports
- Has a system for categorizing reports by location
- Does receive and document pilot sightings

However, the search results don't provide sufficient historical data about South American pilot reports specifically to make a confident forecast about March 2025. The question would require additional historical data about the frequency of South American pilot reports in NUFORC's database and any seasonal patterns that might affect March reporting rates.
