## Key Factual Information as of July 11, 2024

**1. Team Context and Quarterback Depth Chart**
- The Denver Broncos selected Bo Nix with the 12th overall pick in the 2024 NFL Draft, signaling a strong commitment to him as their quarterback of the future[1][4][5].
- After releasing Russell Wilson, the Broncos’ quarterback competition is between Bo Nix, Jarrett Stidham, and Zach Wilson. Neither Stidham nor Zach Wilson has established themselves as a reliable long-term starter in the NFL[1].
- Head coach Sean Payton has publicly stated that the Broncos believe they have found their quarterback with Nix, further suggesting organizational confidence in him as the likely starter[3].

**2. Historical Trends**
- NFL teams that draft quarterbacks in the first round, especially in the top half, almost always give them the starting job early—often by Week 1—unless there are injuries or the player is clearly unprepared.
- There is no indication as of the cutoff date that Nix is behind in his development or that the team plans to start another quarterback instead.

**3. Recent Announcements and Policies**
- There have been no announcements of injuries or setbacks for Bo Nix as of July 11, 2024.
- No official depth chart for Week 4 has been released, but all available reporting and public statements from the team suggest Nix is the presumptive starter[3].

**4. Authoritative Sources for Verification**
- The Denver Broncos’ official website and roster page list Bo Nix as a key player and highlight his status as a first-round pick[2].
- NFL.com and ESPN have covered the Broncos’ quarterback situation extensively, with analysis pointing to Nix as the likely starter barring unforeseen circumstances[1][3].

**5. Limitations and Uncertainties**
- Training camp and preseason performance, as well as injuries, could still affect the starting quarterback decision before Week 4.
- As of July 11, 2024, there are no reports of injury or demotion for Nix, but official confirmation of the Week 4 starter will only come closer to game day.

## Conclusion

Based on all available information as of July 11, 2024, Bo Nix is the strong favorite to be the Denver Broncos’ starting quarterback for their Week 4 game against the New York Jets. This forecast is supported by his draft status, the team’s public statements, and the lack of credible competition or negative developments. However, unforeseen events such as injury or drastic changes in performance could alter this projection, though there is no evidence of such issues as of the cutoff date.
