**Key Historical Trends and Current Status (as of 2016-10-18):**

- The maximum verified human lifespan is 122 years (Jeanne Calment). No one has approached 150 years; even ages beyond 120 are extremely rare and subject to strict verification.
- Studies published in 2016 (notably in Nature) argued for a "natural" upper limit to human lifespan around 125 years, based on demographic plateaus and biological constraints observed in global longevity records.
- The average life expectancy has increased due to public health and medical advances, but the maximum lifespan has not shown a comparable increase in over a century.
- The scientific community was divided: some researchers (e.g., Jay Olshansky) argued that living to 150 is virtually impossible without fundamentally new interventions, while others (e.g., Steven Austad) remained more optimistic, leading to high-profile bets on the topic[1].

**Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Metric:**

- As of October 2016, there were no major government policies or technological breakthroughs announced that would plausibly extend the maximum human lifespan to 150 for those already born.
- Ongoing research in aging biology (e.g., senolytics, gene therapy, caloric restriction mimetics) was promising but had not demonstrated the capacity to extend human life anywhere near this range in clinical trials or real-world evidence.
- The Nature article and associated commentary summarized the prevailing expert view: absent radical, currently unforeseeable advances, 150 years remains far beyond the observed human limit[1].

**Authoritative Sources for Verification:**

- Age validation organizations: Gerontology Research Group, Guinness World Records.
- Peer-reviewed scientific literature: Nature (2016) on lifespan limits.
- Demographic and actuarial datasets (e.g., Human Mortality Database).
- Media coverage of the Olshansky/Austad bet and related expert commentary[1].

**Limitations and Uncertainties in Measurement:**

- Extreme age claims are subject to error and require extensive documentation and cross-verification.
- The possibility of future breakthroughs in aging science cannot be ruled out, but as of 2016, no such technologies were available or imminent for those born before 2001.
- The resolution criteria exclude life extension by cryopreservation or mind uploading, focusing on continuous biological life in the same body.

**Summary Table:**

| Factor                        | Status as of 2016-10-18          |
