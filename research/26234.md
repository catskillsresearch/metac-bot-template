# Forecasting a Potential PHEIC Declaration for Avian Influenza

To assess whether an avian influenza virus in humans will be declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) by the WHO before September 30, 2024, I'll analyze the criteria for such declarations and relevant historical context.

## PHEIC Declaration Criteria

The World Health Organization has established specific criteria for declaring a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. According to the International Health Regulations (IHR), a PHEIC is declared when an event meets the following three criteria:

1. It constitutes an extraordinary event
2. It creates a public health risk to other states through international spread
3. It potentially requires a coordinated international response[2]

Additionally, the WHO considers an event for PHEIC declaration if it meets at least two of these four criteria:

- The public health impact of the event is serious
- The event is unusual or unexpected
- There is a significant risk of international spread
- There is a significant risk of international travel or trade restrictions[5]

For context, in June 2024, the WHO established a new "Pandemic Emergency" designation, which represents a level above PHEIC. This new designation requires meeting all six criteria, including being a communicable disease, having wide demographic impact, exceeding health system capacity, causing substantial social/economic disruption, and requiring enhanced international coordination[1].

## Historical Context of PHEIC Declarations

When evaluating the likelihood of a PHEIC declaration for avian influenza, it's helpful to consider previous declarations. Since the implementation of the International Health Regulations (2005), the WHO has declared PHEICs for several outbreaks[5]. Notable examples include:

- H1N1 influenza pandemic (2009)
- COVID-19 pandemic (declared January 30, 2020)

The COVID-19 PHEIC was eventually terminated after the WHO determined it no longer met the criteria of being an extraordinary or unexpected event, despite the virus continuing to circulate widely[2].

## Notification Requirements and Timeline

The IHR requires member countries to detect and report potential PHEIC events promptly. When a country identifies an event of concern:

1. They must assess public health risks within 48 hours
2. If determined to be notifiable, they must report to WHO within 24 hours[5]

Certain diseases always require reporting under the IHR, including "human influenza caused by a new subtype," which would include novel avian influenza infections in humans[5].

## Limitations in Current Assessment

The available information does not provide specific details about:

1. The current status of H5N1 outbreaks in cattle or humans as of May 2025
2. Whether there has been evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission
3. Recent WHO assessments of the avian influenza situation

## Key Factors That Would Influence a PHEIC Declaration

Based on the established criteria, these factors would be critical in determining whether avian influenza would be declared a PHEIC before September 30, 2024:

1. **Evidence of human-to-human transmission**: While not explicitly required per the resolution criteria, sustained human-to-human transmission would significantly increase the likelihood of a PHEIC declaration.

2. **Geographic spread**: If human cases appear across multiple countries or regions, this would strengthen the case for international concern.

3. **Disease severity**: High mortality or morbidity rates in human cases would contribute to the "serious public health impact" criterion.

4. **Unusual viral characteristics**: Any evidence that the virus has acquired mutations enabling easier transmission between humans would qualify as an "unusual or unexpected" event.

For verification purposes, any PHEIC declaration would be formally announced through the WHO's official communication channels, including their website and press releases.
