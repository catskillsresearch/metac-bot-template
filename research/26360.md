## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of mid-2025, AGI has not yet been achieved. Most AI experts forecast a 50% probability of AGI emergence by 2040, with a significant minority considering much earlier arrival (2025–2030) plausible due to accelerating advances in large language models and compute[1][4][5].
- The world has not experienced a conflict matching the scale of World War I or II since 1945. While there have been many regional wars and several nuclear near-misses, none have escalated to the defined threshold of World War III (≥10 million deaths, ≥30% world GDP or ≥50% world population involved).
- Previous world wars were triggered by a combination of nationalism, alliance entanglements, and technological shifts (e.g., industrialization, mechanized warfare, nuclear weapons). Both were marked by rapid escalation and failure of deterrence mechanisms.

## 2. Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Metric

- In 2024–2025, leading AI research figures (from DeepMind, OpenAI, Nvidia) have publicly warned that AGI could arrive within 5–10 years, with some suggesting as early as 2027[4][5].
- Experts and commentators increasingly warn that AGI could undermine traditional nuclear deterrence and exacerbate risks of bargaining failure among major powers, raising the possibility of catastrophic "flash wars" triggered by autonomous or semi-autonomous systems[5].
- Despite these warnings, no comprehensive, binding international treaty governing AGI development, deployment, or military application has been enacted as of mid-2025.

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Stanford University's 2024 AI Index and surveys of AI experts provide current consensus and dissenting views on AGI timelines[5].
- Public statements by leaders at DeepMind, OpenAI, and Nvidia corroborate a growing sense of urgency and risk[4][5].
- Wikipedia and Metaculus track historical precedents and close calls for World War III, as well as the evolving expert discourse on AGI and existential risks.

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- AGI timeline predictions remain highly uncertain, with significant disagreement among experts and no clear benchmarks for "true" AGI[1][4][5].
- Even with AGI, the likelihood of a world war depends on many contingent geopolitical, economic, and technological factors—including the pace of international coordination, robustness of deterrence, and the alignment or misalignment of early AGI systems.
- The definition of World War III used here (≥10 million deaths, ≥30% world GDP/50% population involved) sets an extremely high bar—a scale not matched by any conflict since 1945.
- Measuring deaths and involvement would rely on credible reporting, which could be compromised or delayed in a high-intensity AGI-enabled conflict.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given historical resilience against global war since 1945, the absence of AGI as of 2025, and the unprecedented (but still recognized) risk that AGI could destabilize great-power relations, the probability that World War III (as strictly defined) will have occurred within five years after AGI is **nonzero but remains below 20%** by default. This figure could rise if:
- AGI arrives suddenly with little international coordination,
- AGI is rapidly deployed in military settings without robust safeguards,
- or global power dynamics destabilize in the immediate aftermath of AGI.

Conversely, if AGI rollout is gradual and accompanied by strong international cooperation, the probability could remain in the low single digits.
