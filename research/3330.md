# Forecasting Analysis: Cryonic Revival Before 2200

As a forecasting analyst examining the probability of successful revival or emulation of cryopreserved humans before 2200, I'll analyze the state of cryonics technology and relevant research trajectories as of December 2019.

## Current Status of Cryonics (2019)

As of 2019, approximately 400 people worldwide have been cryopreserved after legal death, with the majority stored at Alcor Life Extension Foundation (~170 patients) and the Cryonics Institute (~180 patients). Several thousand more have made arrangements for future cryopreservation.

The standard preservation protocol involves:

1. Rapid cooling immediately after legal death
2. Blood replacement with cryoprotectant solutions to minimize ice crystal formation
3. Vitrification (transformation into a glass-like state) rather than freezing
4. Storage in liquid nitrogen at -196°C (-320°F)

No human has yet been revived from cryopreservation, and most mainstream medical organizations do not recognize cryonics as a legitimate medical procedure.

## Technical Challenges to Revival

Several fundamental challenges exist for successful revival as of 2019:

**Cellular Damage**
Despite advances in vitrification techniques, current methods still cause significant damage at the cellular level, including:
- Fracturing due to thermal stress
- Toxicity from cryoprotectants
- Ischemic injury before preservation begins
- Potential degradation during long-term storage

**Revival Technology Gap**
No technology exists to rewarm and repair vitrified human organs without causing additional damage. Even small tissue samples cannot be successfully revived without significant damage.

**Verification of Identity/Consciousness**
The question's criteria require verification of consciousness and identity, which presents philosophical and practical challenges in determining successful revival.

## Potential Pathways to Revival

As of 2019, two main theoretical approaches exist:

**Traditional Biological Revival**
This approach envisions advanced medical technologies that could:
- Safely rewarm tissue without devitrification damage
- Repair cellular damage at the molecular level
- Restore biological function to preserved tissues
- Potentially use regenerative medicine to replace damaged components

**Whole Brain Emulation (WBE)**
This alternative approach would:
- Scan the preserved brain at nanoscale resolution
- Map the connectome (neural connections) and other relevant structures
- Create a computational model that replicates the original mind
- Run this model on advanced computing hardware

## Expert Opinions on Feasibility

Scientific opinion remains divided, with most mainstream scientists skeptical of both approaches:

**Skeptical Perspective**
Most neuroscientists and cryobiologists express doubt about the feasibility of revival, citing:
- Irreversible damage to neural structures during preservation
- Loss of critical information necessary for identity
- Fundamental limits to repair technologies

**Optimistic Perspective**
Proponents, primarily within the cryonics and transhumanist communities, argue:
- Information theoretic death (destruction of brain information) is what matters, not biological death
- Future technologies may be capable of molecular-level repair or scanning
- The long timeframe (until 2200) allows for radical technological advancement

## Timeline Considerations

The question addresses a 180-year timeframe (from 2019 to 2200), which introduces several important considerations:

**Technological Acceleration**
The rate of technological advancement, particularly in fields like nanotechnology, artificial intelligence, and biotechnology, could dramatically change the feasibility landscape.

**Institutional Continuity**
Current cryonics organizations would need to maintain continuous operation for decades or centuries, presenting significant organizational challenges.

**Societal Interest and Investment**
Revival technology development requires sustained scientific interest and funding, which is currently minimal in mainstream research.

## Probability Assessment

Based on information available as of December 2019, I assess the probability of successful revival or emulation of a cryopreserved person before 2200 at approximately **15-25%**.

This assessment reflects:

1. The significant technical challenges that remain unsolved
2. The long timeframe allowing for potential technological breakthroughs
3. The existence of multiple theoretical pathways to success
4. The current lack of mainstream scientific engagement with the problem
5. Uncertainty about long-term institutional stability of cryonics organizations

The probability would be significantly higher if focusing solely on the technical possibility of revival, but the question's specific criteria requiring verified consciousness and responsiveness add substantial additional hurdles.

## Key Uncertainties

Major factors that could significantly affect this forecast include:

1. Breakthroughs in nanotechnology enabling molecular repair
2. Development of advanced brain scanning technologies
3. Progress in whole brain emulation research
4. Shifts in scientific consensus about information preservation in vitrified brains
5. Institutional longevity of cryonics organizations
6. Societal attitudes and funding priorities
