## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Since the 2018 legalization of sports betting, gambling-related suspensions in the NFL, NBA, MLB, and NHL have increased significantly. For example, eleven NFL players have been suspended for gambling violations since 2022, and similar patterns are seen in other leagues[1][3][5].
- All leagues enforce strict anti-gambling rules, with penalties ranging from fines to lifetime bans[5].
- As of December 2024, no All-Star (past or present) from any of these leagues has been banned or suspended due to sports betting[1][3][5].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- The NFL's gambling policy prohibits any form of gambling on league property, with recent suspensions highlighting enforcement[4].
- NBA, MLB, and NHL maintain similarly strict policies, with publicized consequences for violations[5].
- The expansion of legal sports betting, especially via mobile apps, has made infractions both easier to commit and to detect, prompting calls for even stricter enforcement[3][5].

## Key Differences and their Impact

- All-Star players are typically more aware of risks, face more scrutiny, and have more to lose, which may deter rule-breaking.
- However, the growing normalization and access to betting platforms increases the chance of accidental or deliberate violations—even among high-profile athletes[3][5].
- The increased focus on enforcement and use of technology by leagues may heighten the probability that any infractions are detected.
- The absence of any known All-Star suspensions to date suggests either greater caution or luck; this is a key difference from the overall rise in betting-related suspensions among non-All-Star players[1][3].

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

- The probability of at least one All-Star from the NFL, NBA, MLB, or NHL being suspended or banned for sports betting before 2026 is **not negligible**, given recent trends.
- However, the fact that no All-Star has been caught to date, despite rising enforcement and incidents among other players, suggests the risk is **less than 50% but not extremely low** for the next year.
- A reasonable forecast might place this probability in the **20–35% range**, reflecting the increased prevalence of betting-related suspensions, the size of the All-Star pool, the heightened enforcement, but also the unique incentives and scrutiny around All-Star-caliber athletes.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- The main limitation is that only suspensions that are detected and officially announced will count.
- The All-Star pool is relatively large, but each player is under intense public and league scrutiny.
- The situation could change suddenly if a single high-profile incident occurs.
