## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Since the 2024 election, Donald Trump has announced his cabinet picks for a potential second term, including high-profile figures such as Pete Hegseth for Secretary of Defense and Kristi Noem for Secretary of Homeland Security.
- The 2025 Senate is under Republican majority control, which historically increases the likelihood of confirmation for the president’s nominees[3].
- As of early 2025, all major announced cabinet nominees have been confirmed, some by narrow votes. For example, Pete Hegseth was confirmed as Secretary of Defense in a 51-50 vote with the Vice President breaking the tie, and Kristi Noem was confirmed as Secretary of Homeland Security in a 59-34 vote[2].
- Other key nominees—including Linda McMahon (Education), Jamieson Greer (Trade Representative), Kelly Loeffler (Small Business Administration), Howard Lutnick (Commerce), Robert F. Kennedy Jr. (Health and Human Services), and Brooke Rollins (Agriculture)—have all been confirmed, with several confirmations reflecting strong party-line divisions[3].

## 2. Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Metric

- Some nominees have faced significant public scrutiny and controversy, with extensive media coverage noting concerns about their qualifications or ideological stances[2][3]. However, these concerns have not led to any rejections or withdrawals as of December 22, 2024.
- The Senate’s Republican majority, combined with party loyalty and a willingness to advance Trump’s chosen candidates, has thus far prevented any cabinet-level rejections[3].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Senate.gov tracks all nominations, hearings, and confirmation outcomes for executive nominations[1][4].
- Media outlets such as Axios and GovCIO Media provide up-to-date reporting on confirmation votes and political context[2][3].

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- The process is ongoing, and additional nominations or withdrawals could still occur.
- High-profile controversies or newly emerging information could prompt the Senate to reject or delay a nominee.
- If a nominee is withdrawn, returned, or not acted upon for 100 days, it will count toward the total per the resolution criteria, even if the position is later filled.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

- Given the current dynamics (GOP Senate, all major picks confirmed despite controversy), the most likely outcome is that zero nominations will go unconfirmed.
- There remains a low but nonzero probability (perhaps 10-20%) that one nomination could be rejected or withdrawn due to unforeseen controversy.
- The chance of more than one failed confirmation is currently very low unless multiple highly controversial nominees are announced.

### Most Probable Answer: **'0'** non-confirmed nominations.

If forced to assign probabilities:
- '0': ~80%
- '1': ~15%
- '2 or more': ~5%
