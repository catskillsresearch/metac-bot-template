### Key Factual Information as of September 11, 2024

**Intel’s Current Status and Performance**
- Intel is the worst-performing stock in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) in 2024, with its share price down over 60% year-to-date and its market capitalization falling below $100 billion for the first time in years[1][2][4][5].
- Intel’s weighting in the price-weighted DJIA is now just 0.3%, the lowest among all 30 components[1][2].
- The company’s financial troubles include missed opportunities in AI, mounting losses in its contract manufacturing unit, a suspended dividend, and layoffs affecting 15% of its workforce[5].
- Intel’s share price is now more than 70% below its all-time high from August 2000[5].

**DJIA Removal Criteria and Recent Precedents**
- The DJIA is a price-weighted index, and the committee monitors whether the highest-priced stock is more than 10 times the lowest; currently, UnitedHealth Group’s share price is about 29 times higher than Intel’s[5].
- The DJIA committee has a history of removing underperforming or less representative companies, as seen with Walgreens Boots Alliance’s removal in February 2024[2][5].
- Changes to the DJIA are made as needed, often without advance notice, to maintain the index’s representativeness of the U.S. economy[5].

**Recent Announcements and Market Sentiment**
- Multiple credible sources (Reuters, Nasdaq, Investopedia, Silicon UK) report that Intel is “likely” to be removed from the DJIA, citing its poor performance and the index’s need to remain representative[1][2][4][5].
- Analysts and former board members quoted in these reports believe Intel’s removal is overdue and that recent financial results could be the final catalyst[5].
- Potential replacements mentioned include Nvidia and Texas Instruments, though Nvidia’s high volatility may make Texas Instruments a more likely candidate[1][5].
- As of September 11, 2024, there has been no official announcement or confirmation from S&P Dow Jones Indices regarding Intel’s removal[2].

**Limitations and Uncertainties**
- The DJIA committee does not pre-announce changes, and decisions are often made without public comment until the official announcement[2].
- A spokesperson for S&P Dow Jones Indices declined to comment on Intel’s status[2].
- The question’s resolution depends strictly on an official announcement or credible reporting of Intel’s removal before October 1, 2024.
