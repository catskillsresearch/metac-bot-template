# Forecasting US State Secession by 2030: Analysis as of June 2020

As of June 25, 2020, the question of whether any US state will secede from the Union by December 31, 2030 requires analysis of historical precedents, legal frameworks, current secession movements, and relevant socio-political factors.

## Historical Context

The most significant secession event in US history was the Civil War (1861-1865), when 11 Southern states attempted to leave the Union, leading to a devastating conflict resulting in their forcible reintegration. Since then, no state has successfully seceded, establishing a strong historical precedent against secession.

The US has expanded through territorial acquisitions and granted statehood to new territories, but the direction has consistently been toward integration rather than separation. The last states admitted were Alaska and Hawaii in 1959.

## Legal Framework

The US Constitution does not explicitly address secession. However, in *Texas v. White* (1869), the Supreme Court ruled that the Constitution created "an indestructible Union, composed of indestructible States," effectively determining that unilateral secession is unconstitutional. Any legal path to secession would likely require:

1. A constitutional amendment
2. Consent from Congress and potentially other states
3. Negotiated terms for separation

These requirements create significant legal barriers to secession.

## Current Secession Movements (as of 2020)

Several states have active secession movements as of mid-2020:

**Texas**: The Texas Nationalist Movement claims to be the largest independence organization in the US, advocating for Texas to become an independent nation. However, it remains a fringe movement without mainstream political support.

**California**: The "Calexit" movement gained attention following the 2016 presidential election. The group Yes California has attempted to get independence initiatives on the ballot but has not succeeded in gathering sufficient signatures.

**Alaska**: Alaska has a small but persistent independence movement. A 2014 poll suggested 58% of Alaskans might favor secession, though this hasn't translated into significant political action.

**Hawaii**: Some native Hawaiian groups advocate for sovereignty based on claims that the 1898 annexation was illegitimate, but these movements have limited mainstream political traction.

## Public Opinion and Political Factors

Public opinion polling shows fluctuating but generally minority support for secession nationally:

- A 2014 Reuters/Ipsos poll found about 24% of Americans supported the idea of their state seceding.
- Support for secession tends to increase among supporters of whichever party doesn't control the federal government.
- Regional differences exist, with somewhat higher support in the South and West.

Political polarization has increased since 2016, potentially strengthening secession sentiments among some groups. However, economic interdependence between states and federal funding dependencies create powerful disincentives against secession.

## Assessment of Probability Factors

**Factors decreasing likelihood of secession by 2030:**

1. Strong historical precedent against secession
2. Significant legal barriers requiring constitutional-level changes
3. No secession movement currently has mainstream political support
4. Economic interdependence between states
5. Federal funding dependencies
6. Military/defense considerations

**Factors potentially increasing likelihood:**

1. Growing political polarization
2. Regional cultural differences
3. Some polling showing conditional support for the concept
4. Precedents of peaceful secession in other countries (e.g., Czechoslovakia, USSR)

## Conclusion

Based on information available as of June 25, 2020, a successful state secession before December 31, 2030 appears highly unlikely given the substantial legal, political, historical, and economic barriers. While secession movements exist in several states, none have demonstrated the mainstream political support or legal pathway necessary to achieve secession within the next decade.

The most plausible, though still unlikely, scenarios would involve:
1. An unprecedented constitutional crisis leading to negotiated separation
2. A dramatic escalation of political division beyond current levels
3. External events creating new conditions that fundamentally alter the current union structure

These scenarios remain speculative and would require developments far beyond current trends visible in mid-2020.
