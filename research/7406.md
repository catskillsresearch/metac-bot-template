## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- No non-state actor has ever carried out a non-test nuclear detonation causing fatalities as of June 2021, nor have there been credible near-misses reported since then.
- The two main hypothetical pathways for non-state actors are: stealing a state nuclear device or constructing an improvised nuclear device using stolen fissile material (HEU or plutonium)[5].
- Numerous international efforts (e.g., securing nuclear arsenals, improving detection of illicit materials, intelligence sharing) have, so far, prevented such an event[3][5].

## 2. Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Metric

- Ongoing threat assessments (as of 2025) by the US Defense Intelligence Agency and other bodies continue to list non-state nuclear detonation as a threat, but emphasize that “the probability of a successful theft and detonation of an actual nuclear weapon or manufacturing of an improvised device by non-state actors is considered to be low”[1][3].
- Experts and officials identify groups like Al-Qaeda as having the greatest capability and motivation, but still rate the event as unlikely barring major changes in the security environment[5].
- Policy emphasis remains on international cooperation, arms control, and continued vigilance to maintain a low probability of occurrence[5].

- US Defense Intelligence Agency 2025 Worldwide Threat Assessment[1]
- MIRA Safety 2025 Global Nuke Threat Update[3]
- Harvard Political Review, “Nukes for Non-State Actors”[5]

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- The probability is not zero due to persistent uncertainties: possible state collapse, insider threats, or unforeseen technological developments.
- The clandestine nature of both nuclear security and non-state actor operations makes definitive risk quantification difficult.
- Forecasts are sensitive to unpredictable geopolitical events and potential lapses in state nuclear security.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment (as of mid-2025)

- The probability that a non-state actor will cause a fatal non-test nuclear detonation by 2030 remains very low—likely less than 1%—based on historical precedent, expert consensus, and ongoing global security efforts[1][3][5].
- There have been no qualitative shifts in the underlying drivers of risk since 2021; security measures and international cooperation remain robust.
- The forecast could change if a major state collapse or a significant breakdown in nuclear security were to occur, but absent such an event, the probability remains extremely low.
