### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Beyoncé leads the 2025 Grammy nominations with 11, making her the most-nominated artist in Grammy history[2].
- She has 32 Grammy wins, the most of any artist, and 99 nominations as of the 2025 ceremony[2].
- Her 2024 album "Cowboy Carter" is nominated in major categories, including Album of the Year, Record of the Year, and Song of the Year[2].
- Beyoncé has historically been recognized by the Grammys but has notably never won Album of the Year despite multiple nominations[2].

### Recent Announcements and Policies

- The Recording Academy's CEO urged voting members to "vote intentionally, deliberately, with pride and with purpose" for the 2025 awards, but no major rule changes affecting Beyoncé's chances have been reported[1].
- The eligibility period for the 2025 Grammys covered releases from September 16, 2023, to August 30, 2024[1].

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Entertainment Weekly and the Los Angeles Times both highlight Beyoncé as a top contender for multiple awards, especially in the major categories, but emphasize strong competition from other artists[1][2].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- As of February 3, 2025, the winners of the 67th Annual Grammy Awards have not been announced, so the actual number of awards Beyoncé will win is unknown.
- Grammy outcomes are influenced by the preferences of voting members and can be unpredictable, especially in major categories with high-profile competitors[2].
- Forecasts are based on nomination counts, historical performance, and expert predictions, not on confirmed results.

### Summary Table

| Option           | Supporting Facts                                                                 |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0 or 1           | Unlikely, given 11 nominations and Beyoncé's strong track record                 |
| 2                | Possible, but below her recent averages                                         |
| 3                | Plausible, aligns with past multi-win years                                     |
| Greater than 3   | Also plausible, given high nomination count and historical success              |

Based on available information, Beyoncé is expected to win multiple Grammys in 2025, with three or more wins being a reasonable forecast, but the exact number cannot be confirmed until after the ceremony.
