### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of mid-November 2024, 11% of South Carolina is experiencing moderate drought conditions, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor[5].
- The Southeast region, including South Carolina, has seen a rapid increase in drought coverage, with the drought area rising from 38.3% at the end of October to 65.2% at the end of November 2024[3].
- Drought conditions in South Carolina have fluctuated throughout 2024, with alternating wet and dry periods. October 2024 was notably dry, marking one of the driest Octobers on record for parts of the region[1].

### Recent Announcements and Policies

- The U.S. Drought Monitor and NOAA have highlighted the persistence and expansion of drought in the Southeast, attributing it to persistent high pressure and below-normal rainfall since fall began[5].
- The 2024-2025 winter outlook, influenced by La Niña, suggests a strong likelihood of continued or worsening drought across the southern United States, including South Carolina[5].

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The official resolution source is the Drought Monitor at drought.gov, specifically the South Carolina state page, which provides up-to-date maps and population estimates for residents living in drought-affected areas.

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- The percentage of state area in drought does not directly translate to population affected, as population density varies across South Carolina.
- Weather patterns can change rapidly; unexpected rainfall or shifts in atmospheric conditions could reduce drought coverage before December 31, 2024.
- The Drought Monitor's population estimates are based on census data and spatial overlays, which may have a margin of error.

### Summary Table

| Metric                              | Value/Status (as of Nov 2024)           |
|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| % of SC in Moderate Drought (D1+)    | 11%[5]                                  |
| Drought Area Trend (Southeast)       | Increased from 38.3% to 65.2% (Oct–Nov)[3] |
| Climate Outlook (Winter 2024-2025)   | Likely continued/expanded drought[5]    |

### Conclusion

As of November 2024, drought is expanding in South Carolina, with 11% of the state in moderate drought and climate outlooks favoring continued dryness. While this suggests an increasing risk that 300,000 or more residents could be living in drought by December 31, 2024, the actual number will depend on the spatial distribution of drought and any late-year weather changes. The Drought Monitor at drought.gov remains the authoritative source for final resolution.
