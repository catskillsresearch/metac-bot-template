### Key Factual Information Relevant to Forecasting Y2K’s Opening Weekend

**1. Lack of Public Forecasts or Tracking**
- As of November 25, 2024, BoxOfficeTheory and other major box office tracking services are withholding forecasts for Y2K, citing insufficient information and unconfirmed distribution details. No opening weekend range or pinpoint forecast is available[2].

**2. Comparable Films and Industry Context**
- Recent A24 releases like Heretic are forecasted to open in the $8–12 million range, but Heretic is a horror film with strong genre appeal, which may not be directly comparable to Y2K’s apocalyptic comedy[3].
- Other December releases with available forecasts, such as Pushpa 2: The Rule ($5.5–7.5 million) and The Fire Inside ($4–7.5 million), provide a reference for mid-tier openings, but these films differ in genre and target audience[1].

**3. Genre and Nostalgia Trends**
- Y2K is positioned as a nostalgia-driven comedy set during the turn of the millennium, a trend that has seen increased interest among Gen Z and millennials[4]. However, there is no direct evidence that this trend will translate into strong box office performance for this specific film.

**4. Cast and Distribution**
- The film stars Jaeden Martell and Rachel Zegler, both recognized young actors, but neither is considered a major box office draw based on available data[5].
- Distribution details, including theater count and marketing strategy, remain unconfirmed as of the latest reports[2].

**5. Box Office Measurement Standards**
- Box Office Mojo defines “domestic” as gross box office revenue from North America (U.S., Canada, and Puerto Rico), and “opening weekend” as Friday through Sunday receipts[3].
- Only theatrical box office earnings are counted; other revenue streams are excluded[3].

**6. Limitations and Uncertainties**
- No authoritative forecasts or tracking data for Y2K’s opening weekend are available as of the cutoff date.
- The film’s performance will depend on final distribution strategy, marketing, critical reception, and competition from other releases, none of which are fully known.
- Measurement will rely on Box Office Mojo’s reported figures, with fallback to other credible sources if necessary.

### Authoritative Sources for Verification
- Box Office Mojo will be the primary source for opening weekend revenue figures, as specified in the resolution criteria[3].
- BoxOfficeTheory and Boxoffice Pro are leading industry sources for forecasts and tracking, but neither has published a forecast for Y2K as of the cutoff date[1][2][3].

### Limitations
- No public tracking or forecast for Y2K’s opening weekend.
- Unknown theater count and marketing spend.
- No pre-release audience or critical response data.

### Conclusion
As of November 25, 2024, there is no authoritative forecast or tracking data to confidently predict whether Y2K’s domestic opening weekend box office will exceed $5 million. The available context suggests it is possible but uncertain, given the lack of distribution details, the film’s genre, and the absence of major box office draws.
