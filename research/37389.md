## Key Trends and Current Status

- As of late May 2025, there are 13 people in space per whoisinspace.com, reflecting recent crew arrivals to both the ISS and Tiangong stations[1].
- On May 21, 2025, there were 10 people in space, highlighting a recent increase due to overlapping crew handovers[1].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- Recent crew launches, including SpaceX Crew-10, Soyuz MS-27, and Shenzhou 20, have contributed to the elevated in-space population[1].
- Market trackers and enthusiast analyses indicate no major private missions or planned mass crew returns for late June 2025, making the current elevated count likely to persist if handover overlaps continue[4].

## Authoritative Verification Sources

- The authoritative source for this metric is whoisinspace.com, which provides real-time tracking of the number of humans in space[1].
- Secondary confirmation can be obtained from mission schedules and official announcements from NASA, Roscosmos, and CNSA.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- Short-term crew rotations can cause rapid fluctuations in the in-space population, typically within 1–2 weeks of scheduled handover dates.
- Delays or early returns due to technical or weather issues are possible, but no such disruptions are reported for the June 2025 timeframe[4][5].
- whoisinspace.com generally updates promptly, but real-time events could cause brief discrepancies.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the current elevated population (13), the proximity to recent crew handovers, and the absence of major scheduled reductions or private flights, the most probable outcome for June 27, 2025 is:

- **Greater than Ten**

There is a moderate chance the count could drop back to exactly ten if handovers complete just before June 27, but the probability of dropping below ten is low under current trends.
