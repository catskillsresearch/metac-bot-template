# Will Brasília, Brazil Receive More Than 150mm of Rainfall in December 2024?

Based on historical data and current climate conditions, I'll analyze the likelihood of Brasília receiving more than 150mm of rainfall in December 2024.

## Historical December Rainfall Patterns

December is traditionally the wettest month for Brasília, with substantial historical rainfall averages:

- Historical data indicates Brasília typically receives approximately 396mm of rainfall over 21 days in December[5]
- Other sources suggest an average of 207mm of rainfall during December with 21 rainy days[3]
- The typical December rainfall ranges between 215-253mm according to different meteorological sources

These historical averages significantly exceed the 150mm threshold in question, suggesting that under normal circumstances, December rainfall would likely surpass this amount.

## Recent Climate Conditions

Several factors may influence the December 2024 rainfall patterns:

- Brasília recently experienced a record-breaking drought with 167 consecutive days without rainfall
- September 2024 was recorded as the hottest September in 63 years for the area
- The National Institute of Meteorology (INMET) expects 2024 to be among the top 5 hottest years on record

These unusual conditions could potentially affect the typical rainfall patterns for December 2024.

## Temperature and Humidity Forecasts

December temperature forecasts for Brasília suggest:

- Maximum temperatures around 26-28°C and minimum temperatures of 20°C[5][3]
- Moderate heat and humidity levels[3]
- Approximately 5 hours of sunshine per day[3]

## Rainfall Probability and Distribution

The likelihood of rainfall in December appears high based on historical patterns:

- Between 15-22 days of rain are typically expected during December in Brazil[2]
- Approximately 21 days with some rainfall is the historical average[3]
- About 72% of December days (approximately 22 days) typically experience rainfall in Brasília[5]

## Measurement Considerations

The question will be resolved based on data from the INMET weather station [83377] BRASÍLIA - DF, which provides official measurements of cumulative rainfall. This ensures an authoritative source for verification.

## Conclusion

Historical data strongly suggests that Brasília typically receives well over 150mm of rainfall in December, with averages ranging from 207mm to 396mm according to different sources. However, the recent record-breaking drought and unusually hot conditions in 2024 introduce uncertainty into this forecast.

Given that December is traditionally the wettest month and historical averages are substantially above the 150mm threshold, there remains a strong possibility that Brasília will receive more than 150mm of rainfall in December 2024, despite the recent drought conditions.
