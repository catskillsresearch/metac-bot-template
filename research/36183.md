### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of March 12, 2025, BC Hydro and the Government of B.C. have removed Tesla products—including EV chargers, energy storage batteries, and inverters—from eligibility for CleanBC and BC Hydro rebates for single-family home EV charger installations[2][3][4][5].
- This policy is part of a broader initiative to preference Canadian goods and exclude U.S.-produced goods where practicable, in response to escalating trade tensions between Canada and the United States[3][4].
- The exclusion is not retroactive: Tesla products purchased or pre-approved before March 12, 2025, remain eligible for rebates and will be processed as normal[1][2][5].

### Recent Announcements and Policies

- The change was publicly announced and implemented on March 12, 2025, and is reflected in official BC Hydro documentation and on their website[2][3][4].
- The policy specifically targets Tesla products, with government officials confirming the exclusion is due to both trade policy and, reportedly, Tesla’s leadership[3][4].
- The list of eligible EV chargers is maintained and updated by BC Hydro, but Tesla chargers are explicitly excluded as of the cutoff date[1][2].

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- BC Hydro’s official rebate program page for home EV chargers[2].
- CleanBC and Go Electric BC program documentation and eligibility lists[1][5].
- News coverage from reputable local outlets confirming the policy and its rationale[3][4].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- The exclusion is based on policy as of March 20, 2025. There is always a possibility of future policy changes, but no such changes are indicated or planned as of the cutoff date.
- The eligibility list for chargers is updated periodically, but Tesla’s exclusion is explicitly stated and not subject to ambiguity at this time[1][2].

### Conclusion

Based on all available information as of March 20, 2025, BC Hydro will still exclude Tesla from its EV charger rebate program for single-family homes in April 2025, unless there is a policy reversal after the cutoff date. The exclusion is clearly stated and widely reported, with no indication of imminent change[2][3][4][5].
