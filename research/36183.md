### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of March 12, 2025, BC Hydro and the Government of B.C. have removed Tesla products—including EV chargers—from eligibility for the CleanBC and BC Hydro rebate programs for single-family homes[2][3][4][5].
- This exclusion is part of a broader policy shift to preference Canadian goods over U.S.-produced goods, in response to escalating trade tensions and tariffs between the U.S. and Canada[2][4].
- The official BC Hydro program guide and eligibility list confirm that Tesla products are not eligible for rebates if purchased or approved after March 12, 2025. Only purchases or pre-approvals before this date are grandfathered in and remain eligible[1][3][5].

### Recent Announcements and Policies

- The exclusion was publicly announced and implemented on March 12, 2025, as a direct response to the ongoing trade dispute and a "Buy B.C." movement[2][4].
- The BC Hydro website and program documentation explicitly state that Tesla products are not eligible for rebates, and this policy is being enforced as of the knowledge cutoff[3][5].
- There is no indication of any planned reversal or modification of this exclusion as of March 20, 2025.

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The official BC Hydro rebate eligibility page and program guide are the primary sources for up-to-date eligibility information[1][3].
- The Go Electric BC website also confirms the exclusion of Tesla products from all CleanBC rebates as of March 12, 2025[5].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- The only uncertainty would be if BC Hydro or the B.C. government reverses this policy after March 20, 2025. However, there is no evidence or announcement suggesting such a reversal as of the knowledge cutoff.
- The eligibility list is maintained and updated, but Tesla products are specifically named as ineligible, and the rationale is rooted in ongoing trade policy, making a near-term reversal unlikely barring a major policy shift[2][4].

### Conclusion

Based on all available factual information as of March 20, 2025, BC Hydro will still exclude Tesla from its EV charger rebate program for single-family homes in April 2025.
