# Thirlmere Reservoir Level Forecast for July 1, 2025

As of May 30, 2025, the Thirlmere Reservoir in Cumbria is facing significant challenges. Based on available data, I'll provide a probabilistic assessment of its expected state on July 1, 2025.

## Current Status and Historical Context

The Thirlmere Reservoir, part of the Haweswater & Thirlmere system, is currently at critically low levels. As of May 25, 2025 (the most recent data available), the reservoir stands at:
- 47.5% of capacity, which is a 3.8% decrease from the previous week[1]
- 7.43 meters below top water level[1]
- Significantly below both the average year level (79.6%) and last year's level (94.8%)[1]

For context, the usual range of Thirlmere Reservoir is between 10.09m and 16.68m (for 90% of historical measurements), with typical recent levels over the past 12 months ranging between 11.99m and 16.76m[5].

## Recent Trends and Announcements

Several concerning developments impact this forecast:

1. **Drought Declaration**: On May 29, 2025, the Environment Agency officially declared a drought in North-west England, describing the situation as "serious" with reservoir levels "well-below what they should be at this time of year"[4].

2. **Historic Dry Conditions**: The north west of England is experiencing the "driest start to a year for almost a century" according to recent warnings.

3. **Declining Trend**: The reservoir has shown a consistent downward trend, with the regional total dropping 3.1% in just one week[1].

## Forecast Analysis

Based on the available data and current trends, I can provide the following probabilistic assessment for July 1, 2025:

**Most Likely Outcome: LOW**

Reasoning:
- The reservoir is already at 47.5% capacity and declining at approximately 3-4% per week[1]
- If this trend continues, we could expect the reservoir to be around 30-35% capacity by July 1
- June typically sees increased water demand due to warmer weather
- The drought declaration indicates severe conditions that are unlikely to reverse in just one month
- The current level is already substantially below the historical average for this time of year (47.5% vs 79.6%)[1]

## Uncertainties and Limitations

Several factors could alter this forecast:

1. **Precipitation Events**: Unexpected heavy rainfall could improve the situation, though the current drought conditions suggest this is unlikely to fully reverse the trend.

2. **Conservation Measures**: Following the drought declaration, water companies may implement restrictions that could slow the decline.

3. **Measurement Variability**: The Thirlmere Reservoir monitoring data is not updated daily, and there may be a lag in reporting the most current conditions[5].

4. **Seasonal Patterns**: Historical patterns suggest reservoirs typically peak in June in normal years[2], but the current drought conditions make this seasonal pattern unlikely to manifest in 2025.

Given the severity of the current drought, the historical context of an extremely dry year, and the consistent downward trend in reservoir levels, the most probable outcome is that Thirlmere Reservoir will be in a LOW state on July 1, 2025, barring exceptional rainfall events in June.
