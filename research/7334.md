## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- **Federal Law Focuses on Welfare, Not Prohibition**: As of July 2021, major US federal legislation such as the Animal Welfare Act regulates the treatment of animals in research, exhibition, and transport, but does not prohibit commercial animal farming itself[4]. Most federal bills related to animals are aimed at improving welfare standards or addressing specific abuses rather than banning farming entirely[1][3].
- **Scope of Recent Legislation**: For example, bills like the Animal Cruelty Enforcement Act (2021) and the Puppy Protection Act primarily address cruelty, breeding conditions, or research animalsâ€”not the existence of animal agriculture as a whole[1][3].
- **Constitutional and Judicial Inertia**: There is no precedent for a US constitutional amendment or Supreme Court interpretation extending constitutional protections to animals in a way that would prohibit animal farming nationwide.

## 2. Recent Announcements/Policies

- **Animal Welfare Act Enhancements**: Recent legislative efforts (up to 2023) continue to focus on stricter enforcement of existing welfare laws, improving USDA oversight, and targeting specific practices (e.g., the Shark Fin Sales Elimination Act, the Big Cat Public Safety Act)[5]. None have proposed a ban on all commercial animal agriculture.
- **Activist Roadmaps (Non-Binding)**: Organizations like Direct Action Everywhere have updated their advocacy timelines to target 2040 for an "Animal Bill of Rights," aiming for nationwide prohibition[Description]. However, there is no legislative or judicial momentum aligning with this advocacy as of 2021.

## 3. Differences from Reference Cases

- **Scale and Economic Entrenchment**: Unlike prior bans on specific animal products or practices, commercial animal farming is a massive component of US agriculture, involving millions of jobs and significant economic output.
- **Political and Legal Barriers**: Sweeping federal bans or constitutional amendments require broad bipartisan support and public consensus, which are not currently evident.
- **No Precedent for Industry-Wide Bans**: Previous successful animal welfare legislation has targeted narrow issues, not industry-wide prohibitions.

## 4. Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the above, the probability that commercial animal farming will be prohibited in the US by legislation, constitutional amendment, or Supreme Court interpretation before December 31, 2040 is **very low**. As of July 2021, there is no legislative trajectory, judicial precedent, or significant public movement indicating imminent national prohibition.

- **Estimated Probability**: <5% based on historical inertia, lack of legislative activity, and economic/political realities.

## 5. Limitations and Uncertainties

- **Societal Shifts**: Major shifts in public opinion, unforeseen crises (e.g., zoonotic disease outbreaks), or technological advances (such as alternative proteins) could accelerate legislative action, though no such shifts are observable as of 2021.
- **State-Level Actions**: Some states may adopt stricter animal welfare or farming bans, but national prohibition is unlikely in the given timeframe.
- **Activist Influence**: While activist organizations provide aspirational roadmaps, these are not reliable predictors unless matched by political will and public support.
