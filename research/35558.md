## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Pierre Poilievre, leader of the Conservative Party, gained substantial momentum through 2024 and early 2025 by appealing to voters dissatisfied with the Trudeau administration, focusing on issues like housing, inflation, and economic recovery[1][3].
- In January 2025, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau resigned amid declining popularity, and Mark Carney became the new Liberal leader, reshaping the political landscape and intensifying the election's competitiveness[2][4].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- The 2025 federal election was scheduled for no later than October 20, 2025, but was held earlier in the spring.
- During the campaign, Poilievre emphasized lower taxes, reduced government spending, and a "Canada First" approach, drawing comparisons to U.S. populist politics[2].
- The Liberals, under Carney, focused on economic stability and distancing themselves from Trudeau's legacy, especially as U.S. trade tensions escalated[4].

## Authoritative Sources and Election Results

- In the final days before the election, major polls showed the Liberals overtaking the Conservatives, with a notable lead in Ontario and Quebecâ€”crucial provinces for forming a government[4].
- After the election, credible reports confirm that Pierre Poilievre lost his own parliamentary seat, and the Conservatives failed to win the most seats in Parliament[2].
- The Liberals, led by Mark Carney, are projected to form the next government, either as a majority or with support from smaller parties[2][4].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- While polling data can fluctuate and seat counts may be subject to final confirmation, multiple independent sources report that Poilievre and the Conservatives were defeated.
- There is no indication of annulled results or postponed elections that would alter this outcome.

## Conclusion

Based on the latest available information, Pierre Poilievre will **not** be elected Prime Minister of Canada in 2025. The Liberals, under Mark Carney, are set to form the next government following the election.
