## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of early 2022, Taiwan (Republic of China) had diplomatic relations with 13 UN member states. Since then, this number has declined: authoritative sources indicate that by January 2024, Taiwan had formal ties with 11 UN member states, plus the Holy See (Vatican City)[1][4].
- The trend since the 1970s has been a steady erosion of Taiwan's diplomatic partners. The loss of allies has accelerated in recent years due to increased PRC diplomatic pressure and economic incentives[1][4].
- Countries most recently switching recognition include Nicaragua (December 2021) and Honduras (2023)[1][4].

## Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Metric

- PRC continues to pressure Taiwan's remaining allies, often using economic inducements or infrastructure promises.
- Some of Taiwan’s current allies (e.g., Haiti, Paraguay) have experienced domestic political debate or external pressure regarding switching recognition.
- Taiwan has responded with increased aid and engagement but faces an uphill battle, given the PRC's global clout[1].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Taiwan Ministry of Foreign Affairs "Diplomatic Allies" page (official, regularly updated)[3].
- Congressional Research Service reports on Taiwan's international position[4].
- Wikipedia and third-party country-tracking sites for summary and context[1][2].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- Sudden switches can occur with little warning, as seen with Nicaragua and Honduras.
- Domestic politics in small allied nations can trigger rapid shifts.
- Some small nations, such as Palau, Tuvalu, and Nauru, have shown notable resistance to PRC overtures, but future stances remain uncertain[1].
- The Holy See is not a UN member state and is not counted for this metric.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Based on the trajectory (loss of 2-3 allies from 2022 to early 2024) and ongoing PRC pressure, the most likely outcome is a continued decline, but not a complete loss of recognition. A reasonable probabilistic estimate for the number of UN member states formally recognizing Taiwan at the end of 2025 is:

- **Most likely range:** 8–10
- **Median forecast:** 9

This reflects the expectation of 1–3 additional switches by the end of 2025, with a small chance of the number remaining at 11, and a low probability of dropping below 8.

> As of January 2024, the ROC has formal diplomatic relations with 11 of the 193 United Nations member states and with the Holy See, which governs the Vatican City State[1].
