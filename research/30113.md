# ICC Arrest Warrants: November-December 2024 Forecast

As of November 15, 2024, several developments provide context for forecasting whether the International Criminal Court (ICC) will issue any warrants in November or December 2024.

## Recent ICC Warrant Activity

On November 7, 2024, the ICC Pre-Trial Chamber II unsealed an arrest warrant for Edmond Beina related to the Central African Republic II situation[1]. It's important to note that this warrant was originally issued on December 7, 2018, but was only made public in November 2024[1]. While this represents recent ICC activity regarding warrants, the unsealing of a previously issued warrant does not constitute the issuance of a new warrant.

The unsealed warrant for Beina concerns serious allegations including crimes against humanity (murder, extermination, deportation, imprisonment, rape, and persecution) and war crimes (murder, attacks against civilians, pillaging, rape, displacement of civilians, and destruction of property) allegedly committed in Guen, Central African Republic, between February and April 2014[1].

## Pending Warrant Applications

A significant development that could lead to new warrants being issued in November-December 2024 is the ICC Prosecutor Karim Khan's May 2024 applications for arrest warrants against five individuals:

1. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
2. Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant
3. Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar
4. Hamas senior leader Mohammed Diab Ibrahim Al-Masri (known as "Deif")
5. Hamas senior leader Ismail Haniyeh[4][5]

As of November 15, 2024, these warrant applications were still under review by the ICC Pre-Trial Chamber, and no decision had been announced regarding their issuance[5]. The applications relate to alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity in the situation in Palestine[5].

## ICC Procedural Context

The ICC's process for issuing arrest warrants involves several steps. After the Prosecutor gathers evidence and identifies suspects, they request ICC judges to issue either an arrest warrant or a summons to appear[2]. The Pre-Trial Chamber then reviews the evidence and decides whether to issue the requested warrants.

Currently, the ICC has 27 suspects at large with outstanding arrest warrants[2], demonstrating that the issuance of warrants is a regular part of the Court's activities.

## Factors Affecting Potential Warrant Issuance

Several factors may influence whether the ICC issues new warrants in November-December 2024:

1. **Pending Applications**: The applications for warrants against Israeli and Hamas leaders represent the most likely source of new warrants in the specified timeframe.

2. **Procedural Timeline**: The time between application and issuance varies. The Pre-Trial Chamber must thoroughly review evidence before making a decision.

3. **Political Sensitivities**: The high-profile nature of the Israel-Hamas conflict cases may affect the timing of any decision.

4. **Ongoing Investigations**: The ICC has multiple active investigations that could potentially lead to warrant applications and issuances.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several limitations affect the forecast:

1. The ICC does not always publicly announce its timeline for reviewing warrant applications.

2. Some warrants may be issued under seal (kept secret) initially, only to be unsealed later.

3. The death of potential subjects (as noted with some Hamas leaders) may affect which warrants are ultimately issued.

Based on the available information as of November 15, 2024, there is a possibility that the ICC will issue warrants in November-December 2024, particularly given the pending applications regarding the Israel-Hamas conflict. However, no definitive timeline for these decisions had been announced as of the knowledge cutoff date.
