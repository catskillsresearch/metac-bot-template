### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of October 2024, the Baker Hughes US oil rig count stood at 479, significantly below the 590 threshold[4].
- The US oil rig count has been in a downward trend since early 2023, falling from 772 in January 2023 to 622 in October 2023, and continuing to decline into 2024[5].
- The year-on-year decline in the US oil rig count was 86 rigs (about -14.5%) as of March 2024[2].

### Analyst Forecasts and Industry Outlook

- Spears and Associates forecast the average active onshore US rig count will drop from 697 in 2023 to 674 in 2024, a 3% year-on-year decrease[5].
- A modest 4% increase in rig count is expected from Q4 2023 to Q4 2024, but this would still leave the count well below 590 if current levels persist[5].
- No major industry announcements or policy changes as of November 2024 indicate a likely surge in rig activity.

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The Baker Hughes North American Rotary Rig Count is the definitive source for weekly US oil rig counts[1].
- YCharts and the Baker Hughes official website are specified as resolution sources for this metric[1].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- The Baker Hughes rig count is updated weekly and may be subject to minor reporting lags or revisions, but is widely regarded as accurate and authoritative[1].
- Short-term fluctuations can occur due to weather, operational, or market factors, but no evidence suggests a sustained surge is imminent as of the latest available data.

### Conclusion

Based on the most recent data and industry forecasts available as of November 19, 2024, it is highly unlikely that the number of active US oil drilling rigs will exceed 590 on December 27, 2024.
