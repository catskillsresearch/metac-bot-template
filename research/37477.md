## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The U.S. has historically relied on voluntary frameworks and agency guidance rather than binding federal mandates for AI safety. The Biden administration issued the AI Bill of Rights and EO 14110, which required certain safety disclosures for "frontier" AI models, including red-teaming and sharing safety test results with the government[5].
- As of June 2025, there is no federal law or regulation that mandates safety evaluations for AI models. Instead, the U.S. has focused on sector-specific guidance and voluntary industry commitments[5].

## 2. Recent Announcements and Policies

- In January 2025, President Trump rescinded EO 14110 via Executive Order 14179, explicitly removing federal requirements for mandatory AI safety checks and instructing agencies to revise or rescind restrictive policies from the previous administration[1][5].
- The Department of Commerce also rescinded the planned "AI Diffusion Rule" in June 2025, which would have imposed additional guardrails[4].
- In April 2025, Congress passed the TAKE IT DOWN Act, targeting nonconsensual AI-generated imagery but not mandating broad AI safety checks[5].
- The House narrowly passed budget provisions in May 2025 to fund government AI modernization, but these focus on government IT upgrades and not on mandatory model safety checks or third-party evaluations[3].
- There is currently a congressional push, led by Senator Ted Cruz, for a ten-year federal moratorium on new state and local AI regulations—a move that shifts the U.S. further away from new federal mandates and toward regulatory restraint[3][4].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The White House Executive Orders database[1]
- NCSL tracking of federal AI legislation[2]
- DLA Piper and Faegre Drinker analysis of Congressional actions and federal preemption efforts[3][4]
- Xenoss review of current U.S. AI regulatory landscape[5]

## 4. Key Differences Affecting the Forecast

- The EU has enacted a binding regulatory regime (AI Act), while the U.S. has moved in the opposite direction, overturning previous executive actions and favoring deregulation[5].
- The current administration and congressional majority explicitly oppose new mandates, with active efforts to prevent state and local AI regulation and no proposed federal legislation that meets the question’s criteria as of June 2025[3][5].
- The only recent federal actions (e.g., TAKE IT DOWN Act, budget funding for AI modernization) do not introduce mandatory safety checks for "frontier" models[5].
- The deregulatory position could change with a new administration or in response to significant AI-related incidents, but no such shift is currently evident.

## 5. Limitations and Uncertainties

- The 2024-2025 deregulatory trend may not persist through 2029 if there is a change in administration or a major AI safety crisis.
- International developments (e.g., EU AI Act) and pressure from allies or the business sector could influence future U.S. policy.
- Legal and political gridlock, especially over contentious tech issues, makes rapid federal action unlikely barring a crisis.
- Some sectoral regulators (e.g., FDA, CFPB) may impose their own limited requirements, but these would not constitute a broad federal mandate for all "frontier" models.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given current trajectories—deregulation at the federal level, explicit rescission of AI safety mandates, and a lack of congressional momentum for new federal mandates—the probability of a federal law, regulation, or executive order mandating safety checks for AI models being enacted before January 20, 2029, is **low (estimated 10-25%)**. This estimate could rise if there is a change in administration or a significant incident that alters the political calculus, but as of June 2025, the outlook for such a mandate is unfavorable[1][3][5].
