# Forecasting the Cost of Human Genome Sequencing in 2026

The cost of sequencing a human genome has shown a remarkable decline over the past two decades, following a trajectory that outpaces Moore's Law. To forecast the cost in 2026, I'll analyze historical trends, current developments, and market dynamics.

## Historical Context and Current Status

The cost of sequencing a complete human genome has fallen dramatically:
- In 2001, the first human genome was sequenced at a cost of billions of dollars
- By 2006, the cost had fallen to over $10 million
- By 2021, the cost had plummeted to approximately $562
- As of April 2025, the cost is approximately $200 per genome[3]

This represents a reduction of roughly 50,000-fold in about two decades, with the pace of decline continuing to accelerate due to technological innovations and market competition.

## Recent Developments Affecting Future Costs

Several significant developments are likely to influence the 2026 cost:

1. **Competitive Market Dynamics**: The NGS market is highly competitive, with Illumina holding approximately 80% market share while facing increasing pressure from new entrants like Ultima Genomics[3]. This competition is driving rapid innovation and cost reduction.

2. **Technological Breakthroughs**: Illumina has announced the ability to sequence a human genome for as little as $200 with its new sequencing machines[1]. Further technological advancements are likely to continue this downward price trend.

3. **Market Growth**: The global genome sequencing market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 20% to reach $95 billion by 2026[5], while the worldwide NGS manufacturer market is forecast to grow 9% annually from $6.4 billion in 2024 to $8.3 billion in 2027[4]. This growth is enabling economies of scale and further price reductions.

## Forecast for 2026

Based on the available data and trends, I can provide a probabilistic assessment for the cost of sequencing a whole human genome in 2026 (in 2021 USD):

- **Median estimate**: $118
- **Lower quartile (25%)**: $73
- **Upper quartile (75%)**: $196[1]

This forecast is supported by:
1. The current 2025 cost of approximately $200 per genome[3]
2. The historical rate of decline in sequencing costs
3. Continuing technological innovation from major players like Illumina and new entrants
4. The competitive market dynamics driving prices lower

The Metaculus community prediction, which aggregates forecasts from multiple individuals, aligns with these findings and provides a reasonable distribution of possible outcomes[1].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors could affect this forecast:
- Potential technological breakthroughs could accelerate cost reduction beyond current projections
- Economic factors such as inflation or supply chain disruptions could temporarily slow the rate of decline
- Regulatory changes affecting the genomics industry
- Possible consolidation in the market that could affect competitive dynamics

The forecast represents the most likely outcome based on current trends, but the actual cost in 2026 could fall outside this range due to these uncertainties.
