As of February 14, 2025, the recall by Nail Factory of ineligible frozen Siluriformes fish products imported from Vietnam, announced December 19, 2024, remains active. The recall involves approximately 1,635 pounds of frozen catfish products from a non-eligible Vietnamese establishment, distributed in Arizona, California, and Iowa, including retail and nail salon channels. The products were not presented for required import reinspection, prompting the recall.

Historical precedent shows that similar Siluriformes fish product recalls have taken several months to resolve, depending on product recovery and regulatory compliance. Since this recall was announced late December 2024, there is a reasonable possibility it could be closed before April 1, 2025, but no public information confirms the progress or expected timeline. The FSIS recall status page will provide the definitive update on closure.

Therefore, while closure before April 1, 2025, is possible, it cannot be confidently forecasted based on currently available information. Monitoring the FSIS recall status page is necessary for verification.
