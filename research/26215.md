# Nuclear Weapon Use Forecast Analysis (as of July 2024)

The question of whether a nuclear weapon will be detonated as an act of war by September 30, 2024, requires analysis of current nuclear arsenals, geopolitical tensions, and expert risk assessments. Below is a comprehensive analysis based on available information as of July 2024.

## Current Nuclear Landscape

### Nuclear Arsenal Status

As of mid-2024, the global nuclear landscape shows concerning trends:

- While the total number of nuclear warheads continues to decrease as Cold War-era weapons are dismantled, the number of operational nuclear warheads is increasing year-on-year[4]
- The SIPRI Yearbook 2024 indicates that both the number and types of nuclear weapons in development have increased as states deepen their reliance on nuclear deterrence[4]
- Multiple countries are pursuing the capability to deploy multiple warheads on ballistic missiles, including India, Pakistan, and North Korea, joining Russia, France, the UK, the USA, and China[4]

### Key Nuclear-Armed States of Concern

Several nuclear states show developments worth monitoring:

- **North Korea** is placing new emphasis on developing tactical nuclear weapons, raising concerns that they might intend to use these weapons early in a conflict[4]
- **Israel**, while maintaining its policy of nuclear ambiguity, is believed to be modernizing its nuclear arsenal and upgrading its plutonium production reactor site at Dimona[4]
- **Russia** continues to make nuclear threats in the context of the Ukraine war, which entered its third year in 2024[2]

## Geopolitical Tensions and Risk Factors

### Russia-Ukraine Conflict

The ongoing war in Ukraine represents one of the most significant nuclear risk factors:

- As the war entered its third year in 2024, a key question is how Russia's nuclear signaling and threats will evolve and how the trajectory of the conflict affects the potential for nuclear use[2]
- While the risk of nuclear use likely remains low amid the current stalemate, significant changes on the ground, such as a spike in attacks deep inside Russia, could affect that calculus[2]
- Increased cooperation between Russia and North Korea, including North Korea providing Russia with ballistic missiles and launchers, adds complexity to the conflict and could affect overall escalation dynamics[2]

### Broader International Tensions

The 2024 security environment shows multiple pathways to potential conflicts:

- While a high-intensity war with China or Russia or a major conflict with North Korea is not inevitable, the pathways to potential conflicts are increasing[2]
- The risks of nuclear use—especially limited nuclear use—are growing alongside these increasing conflict pathways[2]
- The 2024 Doomsday Clock announcement noted that the risk of nuclear extinction has increased as Russia withdrew from certain agreements[5]

## Expert Risk Assessments

Security experts have highlighted several concerning trends in 2024:

- The SIPRI Director stated that the trend of increasing operational nuclear warheads "seems likely to continue and probably accelerate in the coming years and is extremely concerning"[4]
- Experts note that deterring nuclear use requires "a sober assessment of the new and changing ways adversaries are attempting to leverage nuclear weapons and clear-eyed plans for how to manage nuclear threats if deterrence fails"[2]
- The capability for countries to deploy multiple warheads on ballistic missiles would enable "a rapid potential increase in deployed warheads, as well as the possibility for nuclear-armed countries to threaten the destruction of significantly more targets"[4]

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors complicate forecasting nuclear weapon use:

- Nuclear decision-making is highly secretive and often depends on the psychology of a small number of leaders
- The actual threshold for nuclear use in various scenarios remains unclear and may shift with changing geopolitical circumstances
- While formal risk assessment tools are being explored for arms control issues, these methodologies are still developing[3]
- The complex interplay between conventional and nuclear escalation makes predicting specific triggers difficult
- Historical precedent suggests nuclear restraint has held for 75+ years despite numerous crises

## Conclusion

While current trends show increasing nuclear risks and tensions, particularly related to the Russia-Ukraine conflict and North Korea's nuclear development, there is no clear indication that nuclear use is imminent before September 30, 2024. However, the increasing operational nuclear warheads, development of new delivery systems, and ongoing geopolitical tensions create an environment where the risk, while still likely low in absolute terms, appears to be elevated compared to recent decades.

The most concerning scenarios involve significant escalation in Ukraine, potential North Korean aggression, or unforeseen crises involving other nuclear powers. Monitoring these situations closely through the summer of 2024 will be essential for updated risk assessment.
