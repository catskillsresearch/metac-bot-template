# Forecasting Analysis: DHS SEVP Certification Revocation for Ivy League

As of May 12, 2025, the question of whether the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) will revoke or suspend SEVP certification for an Ivy League university before September 1, 2025, requires careful analysis of current developments and historical precedents.

## Current Situation

The most significant development is that DHS has explicitly threatened to revoke Harvard University's SEVP certification, with a deadline of April 30, 2025, for the university to provide detailed records of international students' involvement in "illegal and violent activities."[5] This deadline has now passed, making the next 3-4 months critical for resolution.

Harvard currently enrolls 6,793 international students, representing 27.2% of the university's total enrollment in the 2024-25 academic year.[1] The potential impact of a revocation would be substantial, affecting thousands of students and creating significant disruption to Harvard's operations and finances.

## SEVP Certification Framework

SEVP certification is the regulatory mechanism that allows institutions to issue Forms I-20 to prospective international students, which is necessary for obtaining F and M student visas.[3] For a school to maintain certification, it must:

- Remain operational and instruct students in approved courses/programs
- Maintain necessary facilities, adequate finances, and qualified personnel
- Meet state requirements to operate as an institution of learning
- Provide instruction leading to a degree or professional, educational, or vocational objective[3]

The certification can be withdrawn through a formal process, after which affected students must either transfer to another SEVP-certified institution, change their immigration status, or leave the United States.[5]

## Precedent Analysis

As of March 12, 2025, ICE had listed six schools whose SEVP certifications had been withdrawn.[5] However, these cases primarily involved schools that had either:

1. Ceased operations completely
2. Been denied recertification through regular review processes[5]

There is no recent precedent for a high-profile, fully operational research university like Harvard losing SEVP certification due to political or policy disputes. This makes the current situation relatively unprecedented.

## Key Factors Affecting Probability

Several factors will influence whether DHS proceeds with revoking Harvard's (or another Ivy League's) SEVP certification:

1. **Harvard's Compliance**: Whether Harvard met the April 30 deadline and the adequacy of its response
2. **Legal Challenges**: Harvard would likely mount immediate legal challenges to any revocation attempt
3. **Political Considerations**: The significant economic and diplomatic impact of restricting international student enrollment at elite institutions
4. **Institutional Response**: Actions taken by Harvard to address the underlying concerns about campus climate

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on available information as of May 12, 2025, I estimate a **30-40% probability** that DHS will revoke or suspend SEVP certification for at least one Ivy League university before September 1, 2025.

This assessment reflects:

- The explicit threat against Harvard has moved beyond speculation to formal administrative action[5]
- The deadline for Harvard's response has passed, potentially triggering next steps in the process
- The significant stakes involved make this a high-profile case with potential for intervention
- The relatively short timeline (less than 4 months remaining until the September 1 deadline)
- The unprecedented nature of such an action against an elite university creates uncertainty

## Key Uncertainties

Major uncertainties in this forecast include:

1. Whether Harvard complied with the April 30 deadline (information not available in current sources)
2. The legal standard for SEVP revocation in cases involving alleged hostile environments (versus operational failures)
3. The effectiveness of potential legal challenges by Harvard or other affected institutions
4. The willingness of DHS to follow through on threats against a prestigious institution

This forecast should be updated as new information becomes available regarding Harvard's compliance with DHS demands and any formal notices of intent to revoke certification.
