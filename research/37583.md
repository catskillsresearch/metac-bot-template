### Forecast of Year-over-Year Rent Increase in Chicago, IL for May 2025 (Zillow)

**1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status**  
- Zillow’s Observed Rent Index (ZORI) tracks asking rent changes over time, reflecting market-wide rental price movements and inventory quality adjustments[1][2].  
- National Zillow data shows asking rents increased by about 3.4% year-over-year as of April 2025[5].  
- Chicago’s average rent is around $2,038 and has been climbing steadily[3].  

**2. Recent Market Conditions and Influences**  
- Vacancy rates in Chicago neighborhoods like Logan Square and Lincoln Park are tightening due to slowed multifamily construction and higher mortgage rates keeping renters longer[4].  
- Local legislation, such as the Anti-Gentrification Ordinance, is introducing some constraints on rent increases in certain gentrifying neighborhoods, potentially moderating rent spikes there[4].  
- Investor interest remains strong in Chicago due to its relative affordability and good cap rates, supporting sustained rental demand[4].  

**3. Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment**  
- Given the national rent increase of about 3.4% and Chicago’s tighter rental market conditions, the May 2025 YoY rent increase in Chicago according to Zillow’s ZORI is likely in the range of **3.5% to 4.5%**.  
- This estimate balances upward pressure from demand and limited supply with some moderation from local regulatory factors.  

**4. Limitations and Uncertainties**  
- Zillow’s ZORI measures asking rents, not necessarily final lease prices; actual rent growth may vary.  
- Lease renewal cycles cause lags in rent adjustment visibility in indices like the Consumer Price Index compared to Zillow data[5].  
- Neighborhood-level variations and policy impacts create heterogeneity in rent changes.
