### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of May 2025, Saipan International Airport (SPN) offers direct, scheduled passenger flights to 4 distinct destinations in 4 countries, served by 4 airlines[1][4].
- The airport averages 4 direct flights per day. Major destinations include Guam, Seoul, Tokyo, and Hong Kong[4].
- Some sources mention 6 destinations, but this likely includes seasonal or less-frequent routes, or reflects routes that are not consistently scheduled or operational as of May 2025[1][2].
- The local tourism industry continues to face challenges with reduced demand and flight suspensions, limiting the likelihood of significant route expansion in the near term.

### Recent Announcements or Policies

- There are no public announcements of new direct routes or increased flight frequencies from Saipan for summer 2025.
- The ongoing recovery of the tourism sector has not yet produced sustained growth in air service to or from Saipan[4].

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The [flightsfrom.com SPN tracker](https://www.flightsfrom.com/SPN), along with FlightConnections and DirectFlights, all indicate the current number of direct destinations remains at 4 as of May 2025[1][4].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- Airline schedules can change rapidly, especially in small island markets subject to tourism flux and airline business decisions.
- Some trackers may include planned, seasonal, or charter flights that are not part of the regular scheduled service, which could alter the count temporarily.
- The question resolves based strictly on the number shown on flightsfrom.com as checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.

### Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the current route map, lack of reported expansions, and historical context, there is a high probability (estimated 80â€“90%) that Saipan will have 4 or fewer direct scheduled destinations on July 1, 2025. The probability of exceeding this threshold (>4) appears low unless there are unexpected airline decisions or a rapid tourism rebound before July.
