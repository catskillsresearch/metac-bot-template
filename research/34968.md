### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- From January 26 to February 6, 2025, over 7,700 earthquakes were recorded near Santorini, with at least 800 exceeding magnitude 2.5[1].
- In the first six days of February 2025 alone, 94 earthquakes of magnitude 4 or higher were recorded, indicating an average of about 15–16 such earthquakes per day during the peak of the swarm[1].
- The strongest recent earthquake reached magnitude 5.1 on February 5, 2025[1].
- The seismic activity is concentrated northeast of Santorini, between the island and Amorgos, at depths of 4–10 km[2].
- The swarm is considered tectonic, not volcanic, in origin, though such swarms are not uncommon in the region[2].

### Recent Announcements and Policies

- The Greek government declared a state of emergency for Santorini on February 6, 2025, in response to the ongoing seismic crisis, with the measure set to expire on March 3, 2025[1].
- Over 10,000 residents and workers have been evacuated, and emergency services have been mobilized to maintain order and assist with evacuations[1].
- Authorities are issuing warnings and safety instructions via mobile alerts[2].

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The Department of Geophysics-Geothermics, University of Athens, will provide the official earthquake count for the period March 1–7, 2025, specifically for events with epicentral locations mentioning "Thira" (Santorini)[Resolution Criteria].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- Earthquake swarms can persist, intensify, or subside unpredictably; there is no reliable method to forecast the exact number of magnitude ≥ 4 earthquakes in a given week during an ongoing swarm[2].
- The current rate (94 in 6 days) may not persist; swarms often decline, but sometimes continue at high rates for weeks.
- The official count will depend on the reporting and classification by the University of Athens, and only earthquakes explicitly mentioning "Thira" will be included.

### Summary Table: Recent Seismic Activity

| Period                  | Magnitude ≥ 4 Earthquakes | Average per Day |
|-------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------|
| Feb 1–6, 2025           | 94                        | ~15.7           |

### Forecast Implications

Given the unprecedented recent rate, it is plausible that the first week of March 2025 could see anywhere from a handful to several dozen magnitude ≥ 4 earthquakes near Santorini, unless the swarm subsides rapidly. However, the precise number remains highly uncertain due to the unpredictable nature of earthquake swarms.
