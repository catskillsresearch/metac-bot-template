## Semaglutide Injection Shortage Status Forecast for April 1, 2025

**1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status**
- As of February 21, 2025, the FDA has removed semaglutide from its drug shortage list. Previously, all FDA-approved forms of semaglutide were labeled "available" but remained on the list; now, they are no longer labeled "currently in shortage" [1].
- The transition from "available" status to full removal from the shortage list typically occurs within two months, based on recent precedent with similar drugs like tirzepatide [4].
- All forms of semaglutide have been marked "available" since October 30, 2024, and the FDA's actions have followed a predictable timeline for resolving shortages once supply meets demand [4].

**2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric**
- The FDA's removal of semaglutide from the shortage list means compounding pharmacies will no longer be permitted to produce generic versions under the shortage exception, which is only allowed when a drug is officially in shortage [1][4].
- The FDA has updated its guidance to reflect the end of shortages for similar GLP-1 drugs, and is actively monitoring supply and demand to ensure shortages are resolved before removing drugs from the list [5].

**3. Authoritative Sources for Verification**
- The FDA's Drug Shortages Database is the definitive source for current shortage status of semaglutide injections.
- News and analysis from Verywell Health and industry observers confirm the FDA's recent actions and expected timelines [1][4].

**4. Limitations or Uncertainties in Measurement**
- While the FDA has removed semaglutide from the shortage list as of February 21, 2025, there is always a possibility of new supply disruptions or unexpected demand spikes that could lead to a renewed shortage.
- The FDA's shortage list is updated in response to real-time market conditions, so the status could change if circumstances shift before April 1, 2025. However, as of the latest available data, no such issues are reported.

**Conclusion:**  
Based on all available information as of February 20, 2025, semaglutide injections are not in shortage according to the FDA, and it is highly likely that they will not be listed as "currently in shortage" on April 1, 2025.
