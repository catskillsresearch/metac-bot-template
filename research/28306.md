# Forecasting US National Average Retail Price of Regular Gasoline for September 30, 2024

Based on available data as of September 2024, here is an analysis of factors relevant to forecasting whether the US national average retail price of regular gasoline will fall below $3.00 per gallon by September 30, 2024.

## Current Status and Historical Trends

As of mid-2024, the national average price for regular gasoline remains above the $3.00 threshold:

- The national average price of regular gasoline was reported at $3.62 per gallon as of April 2024, which is $0.02 higher than the same time in 2023[1]
- During summer 2024, gas prices have been hovering around $3.50 per gallon nationally[3]
- For context, the highest recorded average price of regular gas was $5.06 per gallon in June 2022[1]
- Prices have decreased approximately 15% over the past two years from their peak of $4.27 per gallon[1]

Regional variations continue to exist, with western states typically experiencing higher prices:
- California has the highest state average at $5.39 per gallon[1]
- Southeastern states generally have the lowest prices[1]
- In Michigan, the average price for regular unleaded gasoline was $3.57 per gallon as of June 14, 2024, down from $3.63 a year earlier[5]

## Recent Trends and Forecasts

Several indicators suggest continued price moderation, though not necessarily below $3.00:

- The Energy Information Administration (EIA) projects Midwest regular-grade gasoline prices will average $3.34 per gallon for all of 2024, down from $3.54 per gallon in 2023[5]
- Labor Day weekend 2024 gas prices were expected to be lower than the 2023 average of $3.81[3]
- Gasoline sales are projected to decline 1.1% in Michigan in 2024, potentially indicating reduced demand[5]
- National gasoline inventories were at 233 million barrels (26 days of supply) as of early June 2024, up 13 million barrels from the same period in 2023[5]

## Factors That Could Affect September Prices

Several variables could influence whether prices fall below $3.00 by September 30:

1. **Hurricane Season Impact**: The peak of hurricane season approaches in September, and storms affecting Gulf Coast refineries could cause gas prices to increase[3]

2. **Supply Disruptions**: Unforeseen refinery outages, international political unrest, or other supply disruptions could lead to higher product prices[5]

3. **Seasonal Patterns**: Gas prices typically decline after the summer driving season ends in September, which could push prices lower[3]

4. **Inventory Levels**: National gasoline inventories were in the lower half of the 5-year range as of June 2024, but were higher than 2023 levels, which could help moderate prices[5]

## Measurement Considerations and Limitations

When evaluating this forecast, several factors should be considered:

- AAA's methodology involves daily updates to reflect price changes by gas grade[1]
- Regional price variations can be significant, with differences of over $2.00 between the highest and lowest state averages[1]
- Short-term events like refinery outages or international conflicts can cause rapid price fluctuations that are difficult to predict[5]
- The EIA implemented statistical methodology changes to their retail fuel price estimates in June 2023, which may affect year-over-year comparisons[2]

## Conclusion

Based on current data, it appears unlikely that the national average retail price for regular gasoline will fall below $3.00 per gallon by September 30, 2024. While prices have moderated from their 2022 peaks and are generally lower than 2023 levels, they remain well above the $3.00 threshold as of the most recent reporting. Additionally, the hurricane season peak in September presents a risk factor that could potentially drive prices higher rather than lower in the short term.

The most recent national averages ($3.50-$3.62) would require a significant drop of approximately 15-17% to reach sub-$3.00 levels by the end of September, which is not supported by current forecasts or trends in the available data.
