# California Drought Forecast Analysis: Resident Impact Assessment for June 28, 2025

The current drought situation in California presents a concerning outlook as we approach the June 28, 2025 target date. Based on available data, I'll assess the likelihood of California having 20.0 million or more residents living in drought conditions by that date.

## Current Drought Status

As of April 8, 2025, approximately 44% of the California-Nevada region is experiencing drought conditions, with Extreme to Exceptional Drought (D3-D4) present in southern parts of California[1]. Since the beginning of the water year, drought-affected areas in California and Nevada have expanded by approximately 20% and intensified in severity[1].

The drought conditions display a notable north-south gradient, with central and southern California experiencing more persistent drought conditions[1]. This regional pattern is significant because southern California contains heavily populated areas, including the Los Angeles metropolitan region.

## Recent Trends and Indicators

Several key indicators suggest drought conditions are likely to persist or worsen:

1. **Soil Moisture Deficits**: As of May 17, 2025, low soil moisture conditions are widespread across almost the entirety of the Southwest United States, including Southern California[5]. This fundamental indicator suggests drought conditions are deeply established.

2. **Temperature Forecasts**: Above-normal temperatures are favored through spring and early summer[1]. The Climate Prediction Center's seasonal outlooks for April-June 2025 suggest high evaporative demand (the "thirst" of the atmosphere), which will likely accelerate moisture loss and intensify drought impacts[1].

3. **Precipitation Patterns**: Despite the Climate Prediction Center's 6-10 day outlook (valid May 25-29, 2025) favoring above-normal precipitation across most of the U.S.[4], drought forecasts still predict persistence throughout the Southwest and Southern California[5].

4. **Expert Projections**: As of May 28, 2025, drought experts note that the Southwest is entering summer in Extreme and Exceptional Drought conditions (D3-D4)[2], with specific forecasts indicating drought will "persist across southern California and throughout the entire southwest United States"[5].

## Population Impact Assessment

While the search results don't provide specific population figures for drought-affected areas, we can make reasonable inferences based on the geographic distribution of drought and California's population centers:

- The drought is most severe in central and southern California[1], which contains most of the state's population centers.
- Southern California, including Los Angeles County (with over 10 million residents alone), is forecast to remain in drought through the forecast period[5].
- The persistence of drought conditions in populated areas suggests a high likelihood that the 20 million resident threshold will be exceeded.

## Critical Factors for June 28 Forecast

Several factors will influence whether California reaches the 20 million resident threshold by June 28:

1. **Seasonal Progression**: As California moves deeper into summer by late June, drought conditions typically intensify due to lack of precipitation and increased evapotranspiration.

2. **Forecast Consistency**: Multiple forecasts consistently show drought persistence across Southern California[1][5], where population density is highest.

3. **Soil Moisture Deficits**: Current low soil moisture conditions[5] will be difficult to recover from without significant precipitation, which is unlikely during California's dry season.

4. **Water Management**: Despite some improvements from February and March storms[1], these gains are likely to be offset by the warm and dry conditions forecast through summer.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several uncertainties could affect this forecast:

1. Unexpected precipitation events could temporarily improve conditions, though the seasonal outlook makes this less likely.

2. The exact methodology used by Drought Monitor to calculate population affected by drought is not specified in the search results.

3. Drought classifications can change rapidly with significant weather events, though such events become increasingly unlikely as California enters its dry season.

Given the available information, the forecast indicates a high probability that California will have 20.0 million or more residents living in drought conditions on June 28, 2025, based on the persistent drought in heavily populated southern regions, above-normal temperature forecasts, and existing soil moisture deficits.
