### New Mexico

- Recent polls show Kamala Harris leading Donald Trump by 9 to 10 points in New Mexico. An Emerson College Poll from August 2024 had Harris at 52% and Trump at 42%[1]. A late October poll found Harris leading 50% to 41%[3]. The RealClearPolling average in August showed Harris ahead by about 6 points[4].
- New Mexico has a strong Democratic history, with Democrats winning eight of the last nine presidential elections. The state was rated as "Likely Harris" in the final consensus forecast for 2024[5].
- There is no indication of a major shift or event that would dramatically change the state's partisan lean before the election.

### New Hampshire, Virginia, and Maine

- The search results do not provide direct polling or forecast data for these states as of October 29, 2024.
- Historically, all three states have leaned Democratic in recent presidential elections:
  - **New Hampshire**: Voted Democratic in every presidential election since 2004 except 2016, when it was narrowly won by Hillary Clinton.
  - **Virginia**: Has voted Democratic in every presidential election since 2008, with increasingly large margins.
  - **Maine**: Has voted Democratic in every presidential election since 1992, though Maine splits its electoral votes by congressional district. The statewide vote and the 1st district are reliably Democratic; the 2nd district is more competitive.
- There have been no widely reported events or polling shifts suggesting a major Republican surge in these states as of late October 2024.

### Authoritative Forecasts

- New Mexico is rated "Likely Harris" by consensus forecasters[5].
- While not directly cited in the search results, major election forecasters (such as Cook Political Report, Sabato's Crystal Ball, and FiveThirtyEight) have consistently rated New Hampshire, Virginia, and Maine as "Lean Democratic" or stronger throughout 2024, with no late-breaking evidence of a Trump upset.

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- The absence of direct, late-October polling for New Hampshire, Virginia, and Maine introduces some uncertainty.
- Unexpected late events or turnout shifts could affect results, but there is no evidence of such developments as of October 29, 2024.

### Conclusion

Based on available polling, historical trends, and authoritative forecasts, Kamala Harris is strongly favored to win New Mexico, New Hampshire, Virginia, and Maine in the 2024 presidential election. There is no credible evidence as of October 29, 2024, to suggest a likely Trump upset in any of these states.
