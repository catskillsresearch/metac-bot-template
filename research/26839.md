# Will Apple Announce an iPhone with Stacked Battery Technology Before October 1, 2024?

Based on available information as of August 2, 2024, there are strong indications that Apple plans to introduce stacked battery technology in its upcoming iPhone 16 Pro models, which are expected to be announced in September 2024.

## Current Status and Key Trends

Apple appears to be on the verge of implementing significant battery technology improvements in its upcoming iPhone lineup. According to analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, the iPhone 16 Pro Max is set to incorporate advanced battery cells with heightened energy density[2]. This innovation could provide either extended battery life with the same battery size or equivalent battery life from a smaller cell[2].

The iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max models are specifically expected to use stacked battery technology, which can result in higher capacity and a longer lifespan[3][5]. This technology is already common in electric vehicles and medical devices but represents an emerging technology for smartphones[5].

Battery capacity data shows planned improvements for most iPhone 16 models compared to their iPhone 15 counterparts:

| Model | iPhone 15 | iPhone 16 | % Change |
|-------|-----------|-----------|----------|
| Standard | 3,349 mAh | 3,561 mAh | +6% |
| Plus | 4,383 mAh | 4,006 mAh | -9% |
| Pro | 3,274 mAh | 3,355 mAh | +2.5% |
| Pro Max | 4,422 mAh | 4,676 mAh | +5% |

The iPhone 16 Pro Max is expected to see a 5% increase in battery capacity[4][5], aligning with the table data.

## Recent Developments

To address potential battery overheating concerns with the new technology, Apple is reportedly introducing a stainless steel battery case as a thermal solution[2]. While stainless steel is less efficient than aluminum for heat dissipation, it offers superior robustness and resistance to corrosion[2].

This design change also serves another purpose: the adoption of a stainless steel battery case simplifies the battery removal process, enabling Apple to comply with the European Union's future mandate for mobile phone batteries' replaceability[2]. This aligns with EU regulations requiring smartphone manufacturers to create batteries that can be replaced by owners using easily accessible tools by 2025.

If the mass production of this new battery design proves successful for the iPhone 16 Pro Max, the technology is expected to be integrated into all iPhone 17 models in 2025[2].

The stacked battery technology may also come alongside faster charging capabilities, with rumors suggesting 40W wired charging and 20W MagSafe charging[5].

## Authoritative Sources

The information comes primarily from:

1. Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who has a strong track record of accurate Apple predictions based on supply chain information[2]
2. MacRumors, a reputable source for Apple-related news and rumors[2][3][5]
3. Supply chain surveys that indicate the energy density improvements in the upcoming iPhone 16 Pro Max battery cells[2]

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Despite strong indications, several uncertainties remain:

1. **Official Confirmation**: All information is based on rumors and analyst predictions. Apple has not officially announced these features yet[1][2][3][5].

2. **Production Challenges**: Kuo notes that mass production success is a prerequisite for the wider adoption of this technology[2]. Any manufacturing difficulties could delay or alter implementation.

3. **Model Specificity**: While the iPhone 16 Pro Max seems most likely to receive this technology first[1][2], it's less certain whether all iPhone 16 Pro models will feature it at launch.

4. **Timeline**: Apple typically announces new iPhones in September, which would fall before the October 1, 2024 deadline, but any delays in the announcement schedule could affect this forecast.

Based on the available evidence, there is a strong likelihood that Apple will announce at least one iPhone model (most likely the iPhone 16 Pro Max) with stacked battery technology before October 1, 2024, though this remains unconfirmed until Apple's official announcement.
