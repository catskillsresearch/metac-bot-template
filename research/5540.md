## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Only one US Supreme Court Justice, Samuel Chase, has ever been impeached (1804), and he was acquitted by the Senate, setting a precedent for judicial independence and lifetime tenure barring extraordinary misconduct[2].
- Impeachment and removal of federal judges is rare: as of 2025, only 15 federal judges have been impeached and just eight removed via conviction in the Senate—averaging about one every 14 years across all federal judgeships[1].
- No Supreme Court Justice has ever been removed by impeachment. The only Justice to resign under threat of impeachment was Abe Fortas in 1969[4].

## 2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- As of November 30, 2020, there were no active impeachment proceedings or credible Congressional efforts targeting sitting Supreme Court Justices.
- Although political rhetoric regarding the Court has intensified, no formal steps toward impeachment and removal have advanced past the discussion or investigation stage since the Fortas episode[4][5].
- The impeachment process remains constitutionally available, requiring a majority House vote and a two-thirds Senate conviction, a high bar that has not recently been approached for a Justice[2].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Senate.gov historical records on the Samuel Chase impeachment trial[2]
- Federal Judicial Center data on the impeachment of federal judges[3]
- CQ Press report on Justice Fortas’s resignation under threat of impeachment[4]
- Wikipedia’s list of impeachment investigations for reference on frequency and outcomes[5]

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- Future political developments could be unpredictable, especially given the polarized climate, but institutional checks and historical precedent strongly favor judicial independence.
- Increased scrutiny or revelations of misconduct could alter the calculus, but as of November 2020, no such credible threats were present.
- Measurement is limited by reliance on public records and official Congressional actions; informal threats or political rhetoric do not count unless formal proceedings are initiated and completed per the resolution criteria.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

- Reference probability (based on historical frequency): less than 1% per decade for Supreme Court Justices.
- Adjusting for higher political polarization and public scrutiny, the probability may rise modestly, but remains below 5% for impeachment and removal before 2030, given the procedural hurdles, historical precedent, and absence of any current credible threat as of the end of 2020[1][2][4].
