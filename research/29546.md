## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Oregon voters have a long history of rejecting new forms of broad-based taxation, particularly sales and gross receipts taxes. Since 1910, Oregonians have voted down sales tax proposals 10 times, with opposition rarely dipping below 70%[3].
- Measure 118 would replace the current corporate minimum tax with a 3% gross receipts tax on large corporations (those with over $25 million in Oregon sales), affecting fewer than 2% of businesses[2][4].
- The revenue generated (estimated at over $6.5 billion annually) would be distributed equally to all Oregon residents, with projections of about $1,600 per person per year[2][4].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- The measure is one of the most divisive on the 2024 Oregon ballot, drawing criticism from both business groups and progressive organizations that usually support higher corporate taxes and basic income policies[4].
- Some progressive policy groups, such as the Oregon Center for Public Policy and Tax Fairness Oregon, have publicly opposed Measure 118, citing design flaws and concerns about unintended consequences[4].
- There is no clear, widely reported polling data as of the knowledge cutoff to indicate strong support for the measure.

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The Oregon Legislative Revenue Office has published detailed analyses of the measure’s fiscal impacts and mechanics[2].
- Oregon Public Broadcasting (OPB) and the Tax Foundation have provided accessible summaries and critiques of the measure’s structure and likely effects[3][4].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- The absence of robust, recent polling data makes it difficult to precisely forecast voter sentiment.
- The measure’s complexity, potential impact on the state budget, and the breadth of opposition—including from groups that typically support similar policies—introduce significant uncertainty.
- The historical trend of Oregon voters rejecting similar tax measures is a strong indicator, but not a guarantee, of the likely outcome.

## Summary Forecast

Given Oregon’s historical resistance to new broad-based taxes, the divisive nature of Measure 118, and the lack of clear polling support, the available factual information as of November 4, 2024, suggests that Measure 118 faces significant challenges and is unlikely to be approved by voters[3][4].
