## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Historically, the Insurrection Act has been invoked rarely, typically in response to large-scale civil unrest, not for immigration enforcement or border control[4].
- As of January 31, 2025, President Trump had not formally invoked the Insurrection Act. However, on January 20, 2025, he declared a national emergency at the southern border and directed the Secretaries of Defense and Homeland Security to submit recommendations within 90 days regarding the potential invocation of the Act[1][4][5].
- There is significant public and political discourse, with members of Congress and advocacy organizations expressing concern about the potential use of the Act for purposes unprecedented in U.S. history, such as mass deportations or large-scale domestic military deployment[2][3][5].

## 2. Recent Announcements and Policy Developments

- Trump’s executive order on January 20, 2025, set an April 20 deadline for recommendations on invoking the Insurrection Act at the southern border[1][4][5].
- As of late April 2025, these recommendations are expected imminently, and there is active public speculation and congressional concern regarding possible invocation[2][4][5].
- On April 11, 2025, Trump issued a memorandum titled "Military Mission for Sealing the Southern Border of the United States and Repelling Invasions," signaling willingness to expand the domestic military role[5].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Major U.S. news outlets and legal organizations (such as the Brennan Center for Justice), official White House releases, and congressional press statements should be considered credible sources for confirming the formal invocation of the Insurrection Act[1][2][3][4][5].

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- No president has invoked the Insurrection Act for immigration enforcement or border control, making this a unique and highly controversial scenario[3][4][5].
- Pending cabinet recommendations and potential legal challenges introduce significant uncertainty into any forecast.
- Political, legal, and public opposition may influence the decision, and the resolution depends on clear, explicit invocation reported by credible sources, not merely consideration or rhetoric.

## 5. Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

- Compared to historical precedent (where invocation is rare), current developments significantly increase the probability that President Trump may formally invoke the Insurrection Act before 2026.
- However, the absence of a direct precedent, the need for explicit invocation, and potential legal/political barriers mean that such an invocation remains uncertain.
- As of January 31, 2025, the probability should be considered meaningfully higher than historical baseline (which is near zero), but well short of certainty—likely in the range of 20–40%, pending the outcome of the April 2025 cabinet recommendations and subsequent events.
