## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- On April 22, 2024, CMS finalized a federal rule requiring most non-rural LTC facilities to provide a minimum of 3.48 total nurse staffing hours per resident per day (HPRD) by May 10, 2027[1][4][5].
- This standard, developed in response to longstanding concerns about staffing and quality, aimed to set a national baseline for resident care[1][5].
- Most LTC facilities, as of 2024, did not meet the new standard, requiring significant hiring and operational changes[5].

## 2. Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Metric

- The rule faced immediate opposition from industry groups and Republican lawmakers, who argued it would exacerbate staffing shortages and impose unfunded mandates[1][5].
- On April 11, 2025, a federal judge struck down the CMS minimum staffing mandate. As a result, "nursing home operators are now free from federally imposed minimum staffing requirements"[3].
- The Trump administration’s DOJ had recently defended the rule in court (April 3, 2025), but the court's decision currently supersedes executive branch support[3].
- There is no current evidence of successful Congressional repeal or CMS rollback, but the court ruling is the prevailing legal status[3].
- There is no indication yet of an appeal or new national regulatory action since the court decision.

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- CMS official fact sheets and the Federal Register document the original rule and its requirements[1][2].
- Legal and industry commentary confirms the court has invalidated the rule as of April 11, 2025[3].
- Industry and policy analysis sources track ongoing reactions and potential future developments[4][5].

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- The court's decision could be appealed, potentially reinstating the rule, but there is no public indication of this as of late April 2025[3].
- New federal or state rules could be introduced, but such regulatory changes typically occur on long timelines, especially in the face of industry opposition.
- The question is resolved on whether the CMS (or equivalent federal) requirement is in effect for a majority of LTC facilities before May 11, 2027—state actions alone would not suffice unless they collectively cover most facilities.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the federal court’s April 2025 ruling striking down the CMS minimum staffing mandate, the probability that the 3.48 HPRD staffing standard will be in effect for a majority of non-rural LTC facilities before May 11, 2027, is now *significantly below 50%*. Unless there is a successful and prompt appeal or new federal action, the most likely outcome is that the standard will **not** be in effect nationally by that date.

> On balance, the forecast is that the minimum staffing standard will **not** be in effect before May 11, 2027, barring a reversal of the court decision or new federal regulation.
