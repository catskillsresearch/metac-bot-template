# Will the Independence Party Lead Iceland's Government After the 2024 Elections?

Iceland is heading toward a pivotal parliamentary election on November 30, 2024, following the collapse of Prime Minister Bjarni Benediktsson's coalition government in mid-October 2024. This analysis examines the likelihood that the next Prime Minister will come from the Independence Party based on current political developments and historical context.

## Current Political Situation

Iceland's political landscape underwent significant changes in 2024. In April, Prime Minister Katrín Jakobsdóttir of the Left-Green Movement stepped down to run for president, and Bjarni Benediktsson, leader of the Independence Party, took over as Prime Minister[2]. This transition maintained the three-party coalition that had governed since 2017, consisting of the Independence Party, the Progressive Party, and the Left-Green Movement.

However, on October 13, 2024, Benediktsson announced the dissolution of this governing coalition during a surprise press conference in Reykjavik[1]. He cited growing disagreements between the coalition parties on several key issues:

- Asylum seeker policies
- Energy efficiency vision
- Environmental policies[1]

Following this announcement, Benediktsson met with President Halla Tómasdóttir on October 15, 2024, to submit his government's resignation. The President accepted and asked the current government to serve in a caretaker role until after the parliamentary elections scheduled for November 30, 2024[4].

## Electoral Outlook and Polling

Recent polling data presents a challenging picture for the Independence Party:

- The Social Democrats are projected to become the largest party after the November elections
- The Independence Party is polling at what analysts describe as "an all-time low"[4]

Political scientist Ólafur Þ. Harðarson has noted that if these polling trends hold, it would represent a "watershed moment in Icelandic politics"[4]. The Independence Party has historically dominated Icelandic politics, having been the largest party in parliament almost continuously since 1991, with only one exception following the 2009 financial crisis[4].

## Historical Context

The Independence Party has maintained an unusually strong position in Icelandic politics for decades. As Harðarson explains, "It's increasingly likely that the party will end up in opposition, which it has been for only a period of four years since 1991"[4]. This level of political dominance is rare in Western democracies and has been compared to the historical position of Social Democratic parties in other Nordic countries during the 20th century[4].

In the 2021 parliamentary elections, the Independence Party won 16 of the 63 seats in the Althingi (Icelandic Parliament), making it the largest party[3]. The Progressive Party won 13 seats, forming part of the coalition that has now collapsed[3].

## Potential Government Formations

Based on current polling and political analysis, several scenarios appear possible after the November 30 election:

1. **Social Democratic-led coalition**: If polling trends hold, the Social Democrats could emerge as the largest party, giving them the first opportunity to form a government. This would likely exclude the Independence Party.

2. **Reduced Independence Party influence**: Even if the Independence Party retains significant representation, their historically low polling suggests they may lack the leverage to secure the Prime Minister position in coalition negotiations.

3. **Continuation of caretaker government**: If coalition talks prove difficult, the caretaker government might continue for some time, though the question specifies that if no mandate is given by January 1, 2025, the answer would be "No."

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors could still influence the outcome:

- Polls can shift significantly in the final weeks before an election
- Coalition negotiations in Iceland are often complex and unpredictable
- Voter turnout (which was 80% in the 2021 election) could affect results[3]
- The political analyst cited in the sources expects "the polls to change before election day"[4]

## Conclusion

Based on the available information as of early November 2024, the Independence Party faces significant challenges in maintaining its hold on the Prime Minister position after the November 30 elections. Current polling suggests the Social Democrats are favored to become the largest party, which would give them the first opportunity to form a government. Political analysts consider it "increasingly likely" that the Independence Party will end up in opposition for only the second time since 1991.

While Icelandic politics can be unpredictable and polling can shift before election day, the current trajectory suggests that the Independence Party's Bjarni Benediktsson may not continue as Prime Minister after the formation of a new government following the November 30, 2024 elections.
