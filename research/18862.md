## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Ukraine has sought NATO membership for decades, but its efforts intensified after Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea and the full-scale invasion in 2022[1][2].
- In September 2022, Ukraine formally requested NATO membership. The 2023 Vilnius Summit reaffirmed that Ukraine “will become a member,” and Allies removed the Membership Action Plan (MAP) requirement—a step intended to accelerate accession[1][2][4].
- NATO-Ukraine cooperation has deepened, including the creation of the NATO-Ukraine Council and expanded interoperability and reform support[1][2].
- As of July 2024, there is still no set timeframe for Ukraine’s accession, and the invitation depends on consensus among Allies and fulfillment of certain conditions[2][4].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- At the 2023 Vilnius Summit, NATO leaders agreed to shorten Ukraine’s path to membership by waiving the MAP, but reiterated that membership will occur “when Allies agree and conditions are met”[1][2][4].
- The G7 and other partners have provided bilateral security guarantees to Ukraine, ensuring continued support outside the NATO framework[2][4].
- Public support for NATO accession in Ukraine is extremely high (89% as of May 2023)[4].
- NATO’s 2024 Washington summit (July 9–11) did not change the basic conditionality or provide a concrete accession date[2].

## Key Differences Affecting the Forecast

| Factor                                | Past NATO Enlargements (e.g., Finland 2023) | Ukraine’s Situation (2023–2025)           |
|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Security Environment                   | No active war, no territorial disputes      | Ongoing war, territorial dispute with Russia[1][4]|
| Political Consensus Among Allies       | Broad, rapid consensus                      | Divided views, risk of escalation with Russia[1][3][4]|
| Reform/Interoperability Requirements   | Standard accession reforms                  | Advanced reforms, but additional criteria and wartime constraints[1][2][4]|
| Clear Timeline/Invitation              | Yes (for Finland/Sweden)                    | No set timeline for Ukraine[2][4]         |

- The ongoing war and Russian occupation of Ukrainian territory are major obstacles not present in recent enlargements.
- Some NATO members are cautious about direct confrontation with Russia and the collective defense obligations that would come with Ukraine’s membership[1][3].
- Despite progress on military and governance reforms, Ukraine’s accession remains subject to a consensus-based political decision and fulfillment of undefined conditions[1][2][4].

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

- **Relative to reference cases (e.g., Finland in 2023), Ukraine’s accession faces significantly higher hurdles due to active conflict and lack of political consensus.**
- The removal of the MAP requirement and deepening of practical cooperation signal a genuine commitment to future membership, but no firm guarantees or timelines exist.
- **Probability Estimate:** As of September 2023, the likelihood of Ukraine joining NATO before 2035 is plausible but less than 50%, primarily due to the ongoing war and the Alliance’s requirement for full consensus and fulfillment of conditions that may be unattainable while the conflict persists.

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- NATO official statements and summit communiqués[2]
- Reports from the Council on Foreign Relations and British Parliament[2][3]
- Major international news outlets and diplomatic briefings[1][4][5]

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- Accession depends on unpredictable geopolitical developments, including the duration and outcome of the Russia-Ukraine war.
- The criteria for “conditions” required for membership are not fully specified by NATO.
- Political changes within NATO member states or Ukraine could alter the trajectory.
