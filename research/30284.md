# Will Larry Ellison Be Ranked in the Top 2 of the Forbes Real-Time Billionaires List on December 31, 2024?

As of November 15, 2024, Larry Ellison holds the second position on the world's billionaire rankings with an estimated net worth of $228.4 billion, narrowly ahead of Jeff Bezos at $227.3 billion[5]. Both trail behind Elon Musk, who maintains the top position with approximately $299.9 billion[5]. To assess whether Ellison will maintain this position through December 31, 2024, I'll analyze key trends and factors influencing billionaire wealth rankings.

## Current Status and Historical Trends

Larry Ellison's position among the world's wealthiest individuals has been notably volatile throughout 2024:

- As of November 15, 2024, Ellison holds the #2 position with $228.4 billion[5]
- On October 8, 2024, Ellison was ranked 2nd with $211.6 billion
- In September 2024, Ellison was ranked 5th with $174.7 billion[2]
- In June 2024, Ellison's net worth jumped to $152 billion following Oracle's AI-related announcements[3]

The most significant trend is the ongoing back-and-forth between Ellison and Bezos for the second position. This rivalry began in September when Ellison initially overtook Bezos, followed by Bezos reclaiming the position earlier in November after Amazon reported strong earnings, only for Ellison to regain the title by mid-November 2024[5].

## Factors Affecting Ellison's Wealth and Ranking

### Oracle's Stock Performance

Oracle's stock performance has been the primary driver of Ellison's wealth fluctuations:

- In mid-November 2024, Oracle shares experienced a slight drop of over 1%, causing Ellison's wealth to decline by $2.9 billion in a single day[5]
- In June 2024, Ellison's net worth jumped $14 billion after Oracle announced its largest contracts related to artificial intelligence advancements[3]
- Earlier in 2024, Oracle's stock popped 13% on a quarterly earnings report, causing Ellison's net worth to jump almost $25 billion, which initially helped him overtake Bezos[1]

### Competitive Landscape

The competition for top positions remains intense:

- Jeff Bezos's wealth is highly sensitive to Amazon's stock performance, which saw a dip of more than 1% in mid-November 2024[5]
- Mark Zuckerberg remains in fourth position with $199.1 billion, with Meta shares underperforming in recent weeks (as of November 15, 2024)[5]
- The gap between Ellison and Bezos is extremely narrow (approximately $1.1 billion difference), making the #2 position highly contestable[5]

## Analysis and Outlook

Given the information available up to November 19, 2024, several factors will likely determine whether Ellison maintains his #2 position through December 31, 2024:

1. **Oracle's Q4 Performance**: Oracle's fiscal performance and any major AI-related announcements could significantly impact Ellison's wealth, as demonstrated by previous stock movements.

2. **Holiday Shopping Season Impact on Amazon**: The holiday shopping season typically affects Amazon's stock performance, which could boost Bezos's wealth in the final weeks of 2024.

3. **Market Volatility**: The narrow gap between Ellison and Bezos ($1.1 billion as of November 15) means that even minor market fluctuations could change their relative positions.

4. **Tech Sector Performance**: Both Oracle and Amazon are tech companies whose valuations are influenced by broader tech sector trends.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several uncertainties could affect the final outcome:

- Daily fluctuations in stock prices can rapidly change billionaire rankings
- End-of-year market movements are often unpredictable due to tax-loss harvesting and portfolio rebalancing
- Corporate announcements or major deals in December could significantly impact either Oracle or Amazon stock
- The extremely narrow gap between Ellison and Bezos makes predictions particularly challenging
