### 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Netflix’s global top 10 non-English movies list typically sees 1–3 new titles per week, with most weeks featuring one or two debuts and a stable core of popular holdovers[2][3].
- As of June 1, 2025, there are no indications of a mass influx of new non-English movie releases globally[1][3].
- Blockbuster non-English releases can occasionally disrupt this pattern, but such events are usually well-publicized and do not appear evident for the week in question[2].

### 2. Recent Announcements/Policies

- There are no reported changes to Netflix’s release strategy or ranking methodology that would affect the turnover rate for the global top 10 non-English movies[1][3].
- No festivals or large-scale content drops have been announced for early June 2025 that would drive an unusual number of new titles into the top 10.

### 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- FlixPatrol provides real-time and historical data on Netflix top 10 rankings globally, including non-English movies[1].
- Statista and IMDb offer summaries of the most-watched non-English Netflix films, reinforcing the stability of the rankings and the slow weekly turnover[2][3].

### 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- Forecast is based on past weekly patterns and absence of major events; a surprise hit release could increase the number of new entries.
- The “New movies on Netflix” list from Rotten Tomatoes is indicative but not predictive of global top 10 performance, as not all new releases achieve high enough viewership.
- The precise count will only be verifiable at the Netflix Top 10 site as of the resolution date.

### Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the above, the likeliest outcome is that either one or two movies will be new on the global top 10 non-English movies list for the week ending June 15, 2025. Of the multiple-choice options available, "One" is the single most probable answer, closely followed by "Two." There is low probability for "Zero" (rarely does the list have no turnover), and "Three" or "Four or more" are unlikely without special circumstances.

**Most Probable Forecast:**  
**One** new movie in the global top 10 non-English movies list for the week ending June 15, 2025.
