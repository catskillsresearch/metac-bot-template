### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of October 2024, the Baker Hughes US oil rig count stood at 479, significantly below the 585 threshold in question[3].
- Earlier in 2024, the total US oil and gas rig count dropped to 605 in early May, marking the lowest level in over two years[4].
- The trend since late 2023 has been a steady decline in active rigs, attributed to lower oil and gas prices and reduced drilling activity[2][5].

### Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Metric

- No major policy changes or market interventions have been reported that would likely reverse the downward trend in rig counts before the end of 2024.
- Analyst forecasts from late 2023 anticipated a flat or slightly declining rig count for 2024, with some expecting a mild recovery in late 2024, but actual counts have fallen below these projections[5].

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The Baker Hughes North American Rotary Rig Count is the industry standard and is updated weekly, providing the definitive source for this metric[1].
- Secondary verification can be obtained from financial data aggregators such as YCharts, which track the same Baker Hughes data.

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- The rig count is subject to weekly fluctuations and can be influenced by sudden changes in oil prices, weather events, or geopolitical developments.
- While the current trend is downward, an unexpected surge in oil prices or a significant policy shift could theoretically increase rig activity, though there is no evidence of such a development as of November 2024.

### Conclusion

Based on the most recent data (479 rigs in October 2024) and the ongoing downward trend, all available evidence as of November 19, 2024, strongly supports the forecast that the number of active US oil drilling rigs will be less than 585 on December 27, 2024[3][4][2].
