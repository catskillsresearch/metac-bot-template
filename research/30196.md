# Bausch Health Bankruptcy Risk Assessment

Based on available information as of November 2024, here's an analysis of factors relevant to assessing whether Bausch Health, Inc. might file for bankruptcy before January 1, 2025.

## Financial Performance and Current Status

Bausch Health has shown revenue growth in recent reporting periods. In Q4 2023, the company reported revenues of $2.41 billion, representing a 10% increase on a reported basis and 4% on an organic basis. For the full year 2023, revenues reached $8.76 billion, up 8% on a reported basis[1].

For Q2 2024, the Bausch + Lomb segment (one of the company's key divisions) reported revenues of $1,216 million, compared with $1,035 million for the same period in 2023[3]. This represents continued growth in a major segment of the business.

As of June 30, 2024, Bausch Health reported $595 million of available cash and equivalents, which included $285 million of cash held by Bausch + Lomb. Fitch Ratings characterized this as "adequate near-term liquidity"[4].

## Credit Rating and Risk Assessment

On September 11, 2024, Fitch Ratings affirmed Bausch Health's Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'CCC'[4]. A CCC rating indicates substantial credit risk and suggests that default is a real possibility. However, the affirmation rather than downgrade of the rating suggests that Fitch did not see an immediate deterioration in the company's credit profile at that time.

## Company Statements

In July 2024, Bausch Health explicitly denied considering bankruptcy, characterizing such reports as "unsubstantiated rumors." This public statement indicates the company's official position on the matter, though it's worth noting that companies facing financial distress sometimes maintain positive public messaging until formal bankruptcy proceedings are initiated.

## Recent Corporate Activities

Bausch Health announced plans to release its third-quarter 2024 financial results on October 30, 2024[5]. The company's continued adherence to regular financial reporting schedules suggests ongoing operational normalcy, though the content of those results would provide more current insights into the company's financial trajectory.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors limit a comprehensive assessment of bankruptcy risk:

1. **Debt Structure**: The search results don't provide detailed information about Bausch Health's debt maturity profile, which is crucial for assessing near-term bankruptcy risk.

2. **Cash Burn Rate**: While we know the cash position as of June 30, 2024, the rate at which the company is using cash is not clearly indicated.

3. **Legal Liabilities**: Any major litigation or regulatory issues that could trigger financial distress are not fully detailed in the available information.

4. **Q3 2024 Results**: While we know these results were scheduled for release on October 30, 2024, the actual performance data from this most recent quarter would be valuable for assessment.

## Conclusion

Based on the available information, Bausch Health showed revenue growth through the first half of 2024 and maintained what Fitch characterized as "adequate near-term liquidity" as of June 30, 2024. The company has publicly denied bankruptcy considerations. However, its CCC credit rating from Fitch indicates substantial credit risk. 

The limited timeframe between the latest available financial information and the January 1, 2025 resolution date for this question creates uncertainty, as financial conditions could change rapidly. The company's Q3 2024 results, released on October 30, 2024, would provide more current insights but details from that release are not included in the search results.
