Based on information available as of February 25, 2025, here's an analysis to help forecast whether Donald Trump will mention "Biden" in his upcoming joint session address:

## Scheduled Joint Session Address

President Donald Trump has been invited by House Speaker Mike Johnson to address a joint session of Congress on March 4, 2025[4][5]. This will be Trump's first formal speech to lawmakers since returning to the White House for his second term[3]. The invitation was extended on January 25, 2025, with Speaker Johnson inviting Trump to "share your America First vision for our legislative future"[4].

## Political Context

Several factors may influence whether Trump mentions his predecessor during this address:

1. **Policy Reversals**: The Trump administration has been issuing "a flurry of wide-ranging executive actions since returning to the White House undoing Biden administration mandates and implementing his 'America first' policies"[5]. When discussing these policy changes, Trump might reference the previous administration.

2. **Republican Control**: The Republican party holds majority in both the House of Representatives and the Senate[3][5], which may embolden Trump to more directly criticize his predecessor's policies.

3. **Focus on Future Agenda**: Speaker Johnson's invitation emphasizes sharing Trump's "America First vision for our future"[5], suggesting the speech may be more forward-looking than retrospective.

## Historical Precedent

While not explicitly mentioned in the available information, it's worth noting that presidents often reference their predecessors' policies when highlighting changes in direction, especially when there has been a transition between different political parties.

## Limitations in Forecasting

The available information does not provide direct evidence about the specific content of Trump's planned address. The speech is still being prepared as of February 25, 2025, and its content could change before delivery on March 4.

## Verification Sources

If the speech occurs as scheduled, authoritative verification will come from:
- Official White House transcripts
- Congressional Record
- The American Presidency Project (as specified in the resolution criteria)
- Major news networks covering the address
