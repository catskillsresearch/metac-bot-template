## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of April 21, 2025, multiple reputable polls indicate the Liberal Party holds a lead over the Conservative Party in national popular vote intention. Angus Reid (March 31) reports Liberals at 46% and Conservatives at 38%[1]. Nanos Research (April 14) finds Liberals at 44% and Conservatives at 39%[2]. Abacus Data (March 30) shows a tie at 39% among all eligible voters, but a 2-point Liberal lead among likely voters (41% vs. 39%)[4].
- The Conservative Party's support has reached its highest level since 2011, but polling analysts note this is still insufficient to overtake the Liberals in the popular vote[2].
- Demographically, the Conservatives lead among men aged 35-54, but the Liberals have a significant advantage among women and older voters[1].

## Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Metric

- The Liberal Party's surge is largely attributed to the leadership of Mark Carney, who replaced Justin Trudeau, and to external factors such as U.S. President Donald Trump's policies, which have galvanized Canadian nationalist sentiment and benefited the Liberals[5].
- The Conservatives have struggled to broaden their appeal, particularly among women, with their leader Pierre Poilievre viewed unfavorably by a majority of female voters[1].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Angus Reid Institute, Nanos Research, and Abacus Data are among the leading pollsters providing up-to-date and detailed polling data on voter intentions[1][2][4].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- Polls are subject to margins of error and may not fully capture late shifts in voter sentiment.
- The difference between national popular vote and seat count means that even a close race in the popular vote may not translate to a change in government, but this question is strictly about the popular vote.
- The campaign has been described as volatile, and external events could still influence the outcome in the final days[1][5].

## Conclusion

Based on all available factual information as of April 21, 2025, the Conservative Party is unlikely to win the popular vote in the 2025 Canadian federal election, as the Liberal Party maintains a consistent lead in national polling averages.
