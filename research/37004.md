Based on the available polling data and political analysis as of April 21, 2025, here is a comprehensive assessment of whether the Conservative Party will win the popular vote in the upcoming 2025 Canadian federal election.

## Current Polling Landscape

The most recent polling data consistently shows the Liberal Party maintaining a lead over the Conservative Party in terms of popular vote intention:

- The latest polls from April 20, 2025, show Prime Minister Mark Carney's Liberal Party with approximately 43% support compared to 38% for the Conservative Party led by Pierre Poilievre[2].
- Angus Reid Institute polling from March 31, 2025, indicates a similar trend with 46% support for the Liberals versus 38% for the Conservatives[3].
- CTV News/Nanos Research data from late March shows Liberals at 44% and Conservatives at 39%[4].

This consistent 5-8 percentage point gap across multiple polling sources suggests the Conservatives face a significant challenge in overtaking the Liberals in popular vote.

## Demographic Breakdown

The Conservative Party's support shows notable demographic patterns:

- The party leads by a small margin among men aged 35-54 years[3].
- However, they trail significantly among women, with Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre viewed unfavorably by approximately 61% of women voters[3].
- The Liberals maintain advantages across most demographic segments, with particularly strong leads among women over 55 years old (27-point lead)[3].

This gender gap represents a substantial hurdle for Conservative prospects of winning the popular vote.

## Historical Context and Trends

While current Conservative polling numbers are historically strong, they may still be insufficient to win:

- The 39% support level for Conservatives represents a "14-year election day high" according to Nanos Research[4].
- For historical comparison, the last time Conservatives achieved this level of support was in May 2011 when Stephen Harper formed a majority government[4].
- However, analysts note that "39% is not enough to win the election" in the current political landscape[4].

## Leadership Factors

Leadership dynamics appear to favor the Liberals:

- Prime Minister Mark Carney maintains positive net favorability ratings among both men (+18) and women (+26)[3].
- Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre struggles with favorability among women voters[3].
- The Liberal Party has experienced a significant resurgence since Mark Carney replaced Justin Trudeau, with polling showing a dramatic reversal from trailing by 29 points in late December 2024 to leading by 5 points by mid-March 2025[5].

## External Influences

Several external factors may impact the election outcome:

- U.S. President Donald Trump's policies and statements are identified as potentially influencing Canadian voter sentiment[1][5].
- The Conservative Party has lost two major campaign issues: Justin Trudeau (who is no longer PM) and the carbon tax[5].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors could still shift the race before election day:

- The polls represent snapshots in time and may not fully capture late campaign momentum.
- The exact election date is not specified in the search results, so the timeframe for potential changes remains unclear.
- Regional variations in support (particularly in Quebec and key battleground ridings) could affect the overall popular vote in ways not fully captured by national polling.

Based on all available evidence as of April 21, 2025, the Conservative Party faces significant challenges in winning the popular vote, with consistent polling showing them trailing the Liberal Party by 5-8 percentage points across multiple reliable sources.
