# Forecasting Texas Measles Cases by April 1, 2025

To forecast the number of measles cases Texas will report on April 1, 2025, I've analyzed the available data as of February 27, 2025. This analysis includes current case counts, growth patterns, and factors that may influence future spread.

## Current Status and Recent Trends

The Texas measles outbreak of 2025 has been described as the largest in the state in nearly 30 years[1]. The outbreak appears to be centered in West Texas, with significant spread occurring in February 2025.

There are some inconsistencies in reported numbers across sources:

- As of February 18, 2025: 58 cases across 5 counties (Gaines, Lubbock, Lynn, Terry, and Yoakum)[4]
- As of February 20, 2025: 422 cases reported statewide[3]
- As of February 25-26, 2025: 124 cases identified across 9 counties[1][5]
- As of February 27, 2025: More than 680 cases reported statewide, including seven in North Texas[2]

The most recent and comprehensive figure appears to be 680+ cases as of February 27, 2025[2]. This represents a dramatic increase from the 58 cases reported on February 18, indicating a growth of over 1,000% in just 9 days.

## Demographics and Hospitalization Rates

The outbreak is primarily affecting younger populations:
- Children under 18 account for 295 of the first 400 cases (73.75%)[3]
- In the early outbreak (58 cases), the age breakdown was:
  - 0-4 years: 15 cases (25.9%)
  - 5-17 years: 33 cases (56.9%)
  - 18+ years: 6 cases (10.3%)
  - Unknown: 4 cases (6.9%)[4]

Hospitalization rates appear to be around 14-22% of cases:
- 18 people hospitalized out of 124 cases (14.5%) as of February 25[1]
- 13 patients hospitalized out of 58 cases (22.4%) as of February 18[4]

## Vaccination Status

The vast majority of cases are occurring in unvaccinated individuals:
- Of the 124 cases reported by February 25, only five were in vaccinated patients (4%)[1]
- The remaining 96% were either unvaccinated or had unknown vaccination status[1]
- All 58 cases reported by February 18 were among people who were either unvaccinated or had unknown vaccination status[4]

## Mortality

The outbreak has resulted in fatalities:
- Two children in Lubbock had died as of February 27, 2025[2]
- An unvaccinated, otherwise healthy school-aged child died from measles on February 26, 2025, the first death from the virus in a decade[3]
- An unvaccinated adult in neighboring Lea County, New Mexico (about 50 miles from Gaines County) died with measles, though officials had not confirmed measles as the cause of death[3]

## Factors That May Influence Future Spread

Several factors may impact the case count by April 1:

1. **Spring Break Travel**: Public health officials have warned about potential increases in cases following spring break, which began on March 10, 2025[3]. The first incubation period after spring break would end around late March, potentially affecting the April 1 count.

2. **High Contagiousness**: Measles is described as "highly contagious," transmitted through direct contact with infectious droplets or airborne spread[4]. Health officials explicitly stated that "more cases are expected" due to this high contagiousness[4].

3. **Geographic Spread**: The outbreak has expanded from 5 counties on February 18 to 9 counties by February 25, suggesting continued geographic spread[1][4]. Cases have also been linked to Oklahoma[3].

4. **Exposure Events**: A contagious individual from the outbreak area visited multiple public locations in San Marcos and San Antonio during February 14-16, potentially creating new transmission chains in those areas[1].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors create uncertainty in forecasting the April 1 case count:

1. **Reporting Inconsistencies**: The significant discrepancies in reported numbers across sources make it difficult to establish a reliable baseline.

2. **Reporting Delays**: As noted by Lara Anton, spokesperson for the Texas Department of State Health Services, "the epidemiology team focused on completing open investigations" during a particular week, which contributed to a spike in reported cases[3]. This suggests that reporting may not always reflect real-time transmission.

3. **Intervention Effectiveness**: The impact of any public health interventions implemented after February 27 is unknown.

4. **Spring Break Impact**: The full impact of spring break travel may not be visible until late March, as noted by health officials: "Spikes in cases in an outbreak are easier to see when we're looking back at the data rather than in the moment"[3].
