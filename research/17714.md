**1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status**

- Norway has twice held referendums on EU membership (1972, 1994), both resulting in a majority vote against joining.
- The country participates in the European Economic Area (EEA), aligning closely with the EU economically and regulatorily, but remains outside the Union and decision-making[1][2].
- Public support for EU membership has risen recently, reaching about 41% in early 2025, but opposition remains ahead at 48%. Support for simply holding a new referendum is much higher, at 63%[1].

**2. Recent Announcements and Policies**

- In early 2025, Norway’s government collapsed over the adoption of EU energy rules, reflecting deep political divisions over EU integration[1].
- The Conservative Party, led by former Prime Minister Erna Solberg, has publicly endorsed EU membership and called for readiness to negotiate accession if an opportunity arises. However, their likely coalition partner, the Progress Party, remains firmly against membership[5].
- While the public debate has intensified, the Norwegian political leadership has explicitly ruled out announcing a new EU referendum at this time[1].
- As of May 2025, there has been no official government announcement or movement toward a referendum, and such a step would require broad parliamentary and cross-party support, which is currently lacking[1][5].

**3. Authoritative Sources for Verification**

- Government announcements would be made via www.regjeringen.no or official parliamentary channels.
- Major analytical coverage is available from Chatham House, Brussels Signal, and direct statements from party leaders[1][5].

**4. Limitations and Uncertainties**

- Political developments can be unpredictable, especially if external shocks occur (trade disputes, security crises).
- Public opinion is fluid, but as of early 2025, “No” still leads, and major parties are divided.
- The precedent set by Iceland’s promise for a referendum by 2027 could influence debate, but there is no sign of immediate Norwegian emulation[1].

**Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment**

Given current polling, party positions, and lack of movement at the government level, the chance that Norway will announce an official EU referendum before the September 2025 parliamentary election is low—likely less than 15%. This is higher than in previous years due to increased public support and debate, but significant institutional and political barriers remain.
