**Forecast on Norway announcing an official EU membership referendum before September 2025**

1. **Historical context**: Norway held two referendums on EU membership (1972, 1994), both narrowly rejecting accession with just over half voting 'No'. Public opposition was historically strong, with over 70% against joining as late as 2018 [2].

2. **Current status**: Norway remains outside the EU but participates in the European Economic Area (EEA), aligning closely with EU rules and policies without membership rights. This arrangement has caused political tension, including a government collapse in early 2025 over EU energy regulation [1].

3. **Public opinion shifts**: Support for EU membership has risen from 27% in 2023 to 41% in 2025, while opposition remains at 48%. A majority (63%) favor holding a new referendum, though political leadership currently rules out reopening the debate [1].

4. **Political leadership stance**: Despite rising public support and geopolitical shifts, Norwegian government leaders have so far resisted initiating a referendum debate, representing a key obstacle to an official announcement [1].

5. **Comparison to other Nordic cases**: Iceland is planning a referendum on EU accession by 2027, signaling regional momentum towards possible EU expansion among Nordic non-members [4][5].

6. **Key differences affecting forecast**:
   - Increased public support and urgency due to geopolitical factors (e.g., NATO memberships of neighbors, EU trade friction).
   - Government reluctance to reopen EU membership debate as of early 2025.
   - Historical precedents of close but negative referendums and government caution.

7. **Adjusted probabilistic assessment**: Given the mix of rising public support but government reluctance, the probability that Norway will officially announce a referendum before September 2025 is moderate, estimated at approximately 30-40%.

8. **Limitations**: This forecast is subject to change depending on political developments, government changes, external geopolitical events, and shifts in public opinion.
