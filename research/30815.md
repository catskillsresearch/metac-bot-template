**1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status**

- In Q1 2025, battery electric vehicles (BEVs) accounted for approximately 7.5% of new light-duty vehicle sales in the U.S., up from 7% in Q1 2024[1][3].
- U.S. BEV sales volume remains on an upward trajectory, growing 11.4% year over year in Q1 2025, though market share gains have been modest as overall new vehicle sales also rise[1][3].
- The U.S. reached the 5% “tipping point” for BEV share in Q4 2021. Historically, many international markets have crossed from 5% to above 10% BEV share within two to four years[1].

**2. Recent Announcements and Policy Environment**

- Major automakers such as GM, Honda, and Stellantis are launching new BEV models, with GM nearly doubling its EV volume year over year in Q1 2025[1][2].
- The U.S. market is seeing a surge in hybrid sales as well, which may compete with BEVs for eco-conscious buyers and moderate BEV share gains[2].
- While federal and some state incentives remain, there have been no recent national-level policy changes likely to cause a sharp, near-term spike in BEV share.

**3. Authoritative Data Sources**

- Argonne National Laboratory’s Light Duty Electric Drive Vehicles Monthly Sales Updates is the definitive source for monthly BEV and total LDV sales and will be used for official question resolution.
- Industry data from Kelley Blue Book and Cox Automotive supplements Argonne’s reporting[1][2][3].

**4. Limitations and Uncertainties**

- Measurement depends on Argonne’s reporting cadence and industry definitions.
- If overall new vehicle sales surge, BEV share could stagnate despite rising BEV volume.
- The pace of BEV adoption could accelerate if a new, popular mass-market model launches or if policy incentives change, but current evidence suggests steady, not explosive, growth.

**Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment**

Given the current trajectory—7.5% BEV share in Q1 2025, historical annual gains of about 0.5–1 percentage point, and no major accelerants visible—the probability that BEVs will make up more than 10% of U.S. new light-duty vehicle sales in any month before October 2025 appears below 50%. A reasonable forecast would place the likelihood in the 25–40% range, barring an unexpected surge in BEV demand or supportive policy changes before fall 2025.
