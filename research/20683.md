### 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- **AI capabilities grew rapidly in the decade preceding 2024**, especially in generative models (e.g., GPT, DALL-E, advanced language and vision systems). These systems now perform many expert tasks and are widely used in industry, education, and creative work[5].
- **No strong evidence of recursive self-improvement**: While there have been improvements in efficiency and scale, there is no sign of AIs autonomously improving themselves beyond human oversight or resource constraints[5].
- **Societal impact is significant, but not existential or utopian**: There is growing economic disruption (job displacement, productivity gains), and widespread concern over misinformation, deepfakes, bias, and surveillance. However, daily life continues, and humans remain the primary decision-makers[5].
- **Human control and oversight remain central**: Despite advances, AI systems are primarily used as tools by humans, and there is little mainstream discussion of sentient or agentic AIs outside speculative circles[5].
- **Regulation and safety are growing concerns**: Policymakers are developing and (sometimes) enacting AI safety and transparency laws, e.g., California's SB 1047 (though it was later vetoed, it reflects strong interest), and the EU's AI Act[1][3].

### 2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- **California SB 1047**: First-of-its-kind AI safety regulation passed the legislature in 2024, though it was vetoed by the governor[1][3]. This shows significant political attention to AI safety, even if policy lags technical progress.
- **AI alignment research**: Prominent researchers (including Scott Aaronson) are leading new academic initiatives focused on AI alignment and safety, suggesting ongoing concern but no breakthrough in “solving” control or alignment[2].
- **EU AI Act and similar frameworks**: Major economies are moving to regulate AI systems, focusing on transparency, safety, and accountability.

### 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Scott Aaronson’s original “Five Worlds of AI” post, which outlines the taxonomy and discusses the underlying assumptions[5].
- Recent blog updates and public statements by Aaronson, tracking both technical advances and regulatory responses[1][2][3].

### 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- **Forecasting decades ahead has high uncertainty**. Discontinuous breakthroughs, societal shocks, or regulatory shifts could change the trajectory.
- **Black swan risks** (e.g., sudden emergence of self-improving AI) are possible but currently lack supporting evidence.
- **Resolution criteria are subjective**: The final judgment will rest with a panel, which may interpret ambiguous developments differently.

### Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment (as of early 2024)

| AI World         | Likelihood | Justification                                                                                      |
|------------------|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| AI-Fizzle        | 15%        | Progress and investment remain strong; “fizzle” seems unlikely unless technical or social backlash halts advances. |
| Futurama         | 50%        | Most consistent with current trends: transformative impact, broad adoption, but no superintelligence or loss of control. |
| AI-Dystopia      | 25%        | Risk of negative societal outcomes (surveillance, inequality, job loss) is rising, but not yet dominant. |
| Singularia       | 5%         | No evidence of self-improving, superintelligent, agentic AI; technical hurdles remain.             |
| Paperclipalypse  | 5%         | No signs of AI agency, existential risk, or catastrophic misalignment; remains a speculative risk.  |

---

### Summary

- **Current evidence overwhelmingly favors “Futurama”**: AI is transforming society at scale, but as an advanced tool rather than an autonomous agent. Humans remain in control, and mainstream society does not treat AIs as sentient.
- **“AI-Dystopia” is the next most likely**: If negative consequences from AI (surveillance, job loss, elite enrichment) become dominant, the scenario could shift toward dystopia.
- **“Singularia” and “Paperclipalypse” remain remote**: There is little technical or societal evidence for the emergence of autonomous, self-improving superintelligent AIs—either benevolent or catastrophic.
- **“AI-Fizzle” is possible but not favored**: Continued rapid progress and investment make a major fizzle unlikely unless new technical or social barriers emerge.
