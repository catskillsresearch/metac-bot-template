- The position is intended to be nonpartisan, with the parliamentarian advising on Senate procedures, particularly crucial during budget reconciliation debates[2][3].
- Removal of a Senate parliamentarian is rare; the last notable removal occurred in 2001, triggered by a high-profile procedural disagreement[5].
