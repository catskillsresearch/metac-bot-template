## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of May 5, 2025, the US gross national debt stands at $36.21 trillion[3][5].
- Over the past year, the debt has increased by $1.66 trillion, averaging $4.54 billion per day[3][5].
- At this rate, projections indicate the US will reach $37 trillion in gross debt by approximately September 30, 2025—about three months after June 27, 2025[3][5].

## Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- The Congressional Budget Office projects a federal budget deficit of $1.9 trillion for fiscal year 2025, consistent with ongoing high deficits but not pointing to a sudden surge[1].
- The cumulative deficit for fiscal year 2025 as of the end of April 2025 was $1.1 trillion, which is 13% higher than the same point last year, suggesting a modest acceleration but not enough to alter the projected timeline for reaching $37 trillion[2].
- There are no indications of extraordinary fiscal measures or economic shocks that would sharply accelerate debt growth before June 27, 2025.

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- US Treasury’s Debt to the Penny tracker (official real-time source for public debt outstanding)
- Congressional Budget Office (CBO) publications for budget and debt projections[1][4]
- Joint Economic Committee monthly debt updates[3][5]

## Limitations or Uncertainties in Measurement

- Debt growth can be affected by unforeseen fiscal policy decisions, emergency spending, or economic shocks, which could alter the rate of increase.
- The "Debt to the Penny" data may occasionally lag by one business day, so resolution may use the next available date per the question’s fine print.
- All figures are gross federal debt, combining both debt held by the public and intragovernmental holdings[5].

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the current trend and absent evidence of a dramatic acceleration, there is a very high probability (estimated at 95%+) that the US national debt will remain below $37 trillion on June 27, 2025.
