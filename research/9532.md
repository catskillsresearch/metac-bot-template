## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- China has historically allowed human embryo research up to 14 days, with regulations permitting the creation of research embryos for medical purposes, but explicitly banning reproductive cloning[1][3].
- Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) is widely used in China for disease prevention, indicating technical and infrastructural capacity for embryo selection[5].
- Selection of embryos for nonmedical traits, such as sex or intelligence, is explicitly prohibited under current guidelines[2].
- The 2019 case of CRISPR-edited babies resulted in a strong negative governmental response, including criminal prosecution, signaling caution toward germline enhancements for nonmedical purposes[5].
- Regulatory frameworks are evolving, with recent calls for more legally binding and enforceable operational details, but as of early 2022, rules remain restrictive for nonmedical embryo selection[1].

## 2. Recent Announcements and Policies

- Chinese law and ethical guidelines prohibit embryo selection for nonmedical purposes, including intelligence and sex selection, with recent consensus documents reaffirming these restrictions[2].
- Germline gene editing is permitted for research but not for clinical reproductive use, and embryos cannot be implanted or developed past 14 days if genetically engineered[3].
- The revision of the international "14-day rule" has prompted ethical debate but no substantial liberalization of Chinese policy as of 2022[1][4].
- There is an ongoing push to make regulations more legally binding and to hold violators accountable[1].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- National regulatory documents and consensus guidelines from Chinese government ministries and expert panels[1][2].
- Public reporting on high-profile cases of genetic enhancement (e.g., the CRISPR babies)[5].
- International regulatory summaries (e.g., the Global Gene Editing Regulation Tracker)[3].

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- Operational details for large-scale embryo selection for intelligence are lacking, and regulatory frameworks, while evolving, are not yet permissive[1].
- Enforcement and legal bindingness of current regulations are improving but not fully realized, creating some uncertainty about underground or unauthorized practices[1].
- Public opinion data is limited due to restrictions on polling in mainland China; support in other Han societies does not guarantee similar Chinese policy[5].
- Technological capability exists for PGD, but the polygenic prediction of intelligence remains scientifically and ethically contentious.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given current trends, legal prohibitions, enforcement actions, and the lack of operational or regulatory infrastructure for intelligence-based embryo selection, it is unlikely that China will be the first country to have over 10% of its newborns selected for intelligence in the foreseeable future. While China's biotechnology sector is advanced and there is precedent for embryo selection for disease, multiple regulatory and ethical barriers make large-scale selection for intelligence improbable without significant policy change.
