## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Tesla's quarterly deliveries reached a record 484,507 vehicles in Q4 2023[1][2].
- Deliveries declined to 386,810 in Q1 2024 and rebounded to 443,956 in Q2 2024, but remained below the Q4 2023 peak[3].
- To achieve year-over-year growth in Q4 2024, Tesla must deliver more than 484,507 vehicles in that quarter.

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- In October 2024, Tesla predicted a "record" Q4 for deliveries, a rare move that signals confidence in surpassing previous highs[5].
- Tesla has implemented early-quarter discounts and sales incentives to boost Q4 2024 deliveries, rather than waiting until the end of the quarter as in past years[5].
- Earlier in 2024, Tesla management cautioned that annual vehicle volume growth in 2024 would be "notably lower" than in 2023, citing a transition period between major product cycles and the upcoming launch of a next-generation vehicle[2].
- Production capacity updates and expansions at global factories (Shanghai, Berlin, Texas) may support higher deliveries, but no major new model launches are expected to significantly impact Q4 2024 volumes[4].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Tesla's official Investor Relations site will publish the Q4 2024 delivery numbers, typically within two days after the quarter ends[1][3].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- Macroeconomic conditions, consumer demand, and supply chain factors could impact Tesla's ability to deliver a record number of vehicles.
- While Tesla's public prediction of a record Q4 and aggressive sales tactics suggest a strong push, actual deliveries are not guaranteed until officially reported.
- The company's own guidance earlier in the year was cautious, reflecting uncertainty about short-term growth as it prepares for future product launches[2].

## Summary Table: Tesla Quarterly Deliveries (2023â€“2024)

| Quarter    | Deliveries |
|------------|------------|
| Q1 2023    | 422,875    |
| Q2 2023    | 466,140    |
| Q3 2023    | 435,059    |
| Q4 2023    | 484,507    |
| Q1 2024    | 386,810    |
| Q2 2024    | 443,956    |

## Conclusion

As of late 2024, Tesla has publicly predicted a record Q4 for vehicle deliveries and has taken steps to boost sales, suggesting a strong effort to surpass the Q4 2023 figure of 484,507 vehicles. However, earlier company guidance was cautious, and external factors could still affect the outcome. The final resolution will depend on the official delivery numbers reported by Tesla after the end of Q4 2024.
