# Forecasting Russia's Potential Second Mobilization Wave Before October 1, 2024

Based on available information from the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) as of September 2024, there are several key factors to consider when forecasting whether Russia will initiate a second formal mobilization wave before October 1, 2024.

## Current Russian Force Generation Strategy

Russia has been consistently employing "crypto-mobilization" rather than formal mobilization to sustain its operations in Ukraine. According to Bloomberg reporting cited by ISW, the Kremlin is intensifying these crypto-mobilization efforts specifically to avoid conducting another partial mobilization call-up of reservists[5]. This suggests that Russian leadership recognizes the potential domestic political costs of a formal second mobilization wave.

Current Russian crypto-mobilization efforts are reportedly generating approximately 30,000 new personnel each month, with the potential to recruit 300,000 total personnel in 2024, according to Ruslan Pukhov, head of the Moscow-based Center for Analysis of Strategies and Technologies and a member of a Russian Ministry of Defense civilian advisory board[5].

## Operational Tempo and Casualty Rates

ISW assessments indicate that Russia has maintained a high operational tempo despite significant casualties:

- Russian forces are sustaining a higher casualty rate per square kilometer gained than they did in Fall 2024[1]
- Despite these losses, Russia has maintained the tempo of offensive operations by rapidly deploying low-quality troops to frontline units[1]
- This approach has hindered Russia's ability to conduct complex operations and make rapid advances in Ukraine[1]

Putin appears committed to maintaining the current offensive tempo despite diminishing returns, suggesting he is prioritizing battlefield gains to generate pressure on Ukraine in ceasefire negotiations or to force Ukraine's collapse[1].

## Russian Summer 2024 Offensive

Ukrainian intelligence, specifically GUR Head Lieutenant General Kyrylo Budanov, indicated that Russian forces would likely launch their expected large-scale summer offensive effort in June 2024[2]. This offensive was expected to aim at seizing the remainder of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts[5].

ISW's assessment suggests that Russia's ongoing crypto-mobilization efforts have proven capable of sustaining Russia's current offensive efforts despite heavy losses and could support the formation of limited operational reserves[4]. These reserves would allow Russia to backfill losses without taking a significant operational pause between spring operations and the anticipated summer 2024 offensive[4].

## Production Capacity vs. Mobilization Needs

ISW assessed that Russian defense production is capable of sustaining the current tempo of operations but is unlikely to fully support a potential operational or strategic-level mission in 2024[4]. This limitation in equipment production relative to Russia's strategic ambitions could influence decisions about formal mobilization.

## Analysis and Forecast

Based on the available information, several factors suggest Russia may continue to avoid a formal second mobilization before October 1, 2024:

1. The explicit Russian strategy of intensifying crypto-mobilization to avoid formal mobilization[5]
2. The apparent success of current crypto-mobilization in generating sufficient forces to sustain operations[4][5]
3. The political sensitivity of formal mobilization that Putin likely wishes to avoid

However, there are also factors that could potentially drive Russia toward formal mobilization:

1. The high and increasing casualty rates relative to territorial gains[1]
2. The limitations of low-quality troops in conducting complex operations[1]
3. Putin's demonstrated commitment to maintaining offensive operations despite costs[1]

## Limitations and Uncertainties

The available information has several limitations:

1. ISW does not provide a direct assessment of the likelihood of a second formal mobilization wave
2. The effectiveness of crypto-mobilization in meeting Russia's long-term personnel needs remains uncertain
3. Putin's decision-making calculus could shift based on battlefield developments or domestic political considerations

The search results indicate that Russia is currently prioritizing crypto-mobilization over formal mobilization, but the situation remains fluid and could change if current force generation methods prove insufficient for Russia's military objectives.
