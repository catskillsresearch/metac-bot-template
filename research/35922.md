**Key Historical Trends and Current Status**

- The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022 established a domestic content bonus credit, providing a 10% increase to the Production Tax Credit (PTC) under Section 45 and its technology-neutral successor, Section 45Y, for projects that meet specific domestic content requirements regarding US-made steel, iron, and manufactured components[1][2][5].
- As of May 2025, the domestic content requirement is not mandatory to claim the base PTC (45Y); it is only required to receive the bonus credit. IRS guidance—including the latest, Notice 2025-08 issued in January 2025—continues to describe the domestic content rules as an optional path to a bonus, not a baseline condition[3][5].

**Recent Announcements and Policies**

- The IRS and Treasury have issued updated guidance for calculating and certifying compliance with the domestic content bonus, including revised safe harbors and definitions to facilitate taxpayer compliance, but these updates do not change the requirement from optional bonus to mandatory for all PTC claims[3][4][5].
- After the 2024 election, Republicans gained control of Congress and the White House. The new administration has expressed interest in reducing IRA spending. However, the House Republican majority is slim, and some Republicans support a gradual phase-out of clean energy tax credits rather than an abrupt elimination[2].
- The House Speaker has indicated a targeted approach to IRA modifications, and a group of Republican representatives has advocated for a "thoughtful phaseout" rather than drastic changes, reducing the probability of new mandates being imposed[2].

**Authoritative Sources for Verification**

- IRS guidance on the domestic content bonus credit[1][3][5]
- Congressional Research Service analysis of domestic content rules[2]
- U.S. Treasury press releases and updates[4]

**Limitations and Uncertainties**

- Budget reconciliation, the most likely legislative pathway for major IRA changes, has failed before due to intraparty divisions, as seen in 2017 with ACA repeal efforts.
- While there is political momentum to reduce clean energy spending, there is no public legislative text or proposal—nor any precedent in recent IRS or Treasury guidance—indicating a move to make domestic content requirements mandatory for the base PTC (45Y)[1][2][3][5].
- A shift from a bonus to a mandate would be a major policy departure and would likely face significant opposition, both within Congress and from affected industries.

**Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment**

Based on current law, IRS and Treasury guidance, political signals, and historical precedent, there is a low probability that, before January 1, 2026, the domestic content requirements will become mandatory for obtaining the Production Tax Credit (45Y). The requirements remain optional for the bonus, and there is no evidence of imminent legislative or regulatory change to make them mandatory for all PTC claims.
