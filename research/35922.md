To forecast whether Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez will have a higher approval rating than Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan on April 1, 2025, I'll analyze the available data as of March 13, 2025.

## Current Approval Ratings

As of March 2025, Pedro Sánchez of Spain has an approval rating of 34%, with 60% disapproving of his leadership and 6% undecided[1]. This positions him relatively low among the 22 global leaders tracked in the same dataset.

Unfortunately, the available data does not specifically mention Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's current approval rating, making a direct comparison impossible at this time.

## Historical Trends for Pedro Sánchez

Examining historical data provides some context for Sánchez's current standing:

- As of September 2024, over 45% of Spanish respondents reported that Prime Minister Sánchez inspired them with "no confidence," while nearly 7% reported feeling "very confident" in his leadership[2].

- Confidence in Sánchez has been tracked from 2021 to 2024, suggesting a pattern of relatively low public confidence over an extended period[2].

## Political Context and Factors

Several factors may influence Sánchez's approval rating in the coming weeks:

1. **International Relations**: Sánchez is positioning himself carefully regarding the Trump administration. While avoiding direct confrontation with President Trump, he has criticized tech billionaires like Elon Musk and maintained his government's commitment to renewable energy and progressive policies[5].

2. **Domestic Politics**: Sánchez leads a fragile coalition government as "the bloc's most prominent left-wing leader"[5]. His government's progressive stance on issues like gender equality, transgender rights, and immigration differs significantly from many European counterparts.

3. **Foreign Policy**: Sánchez's alignment with Ireland and Norway in acknowledging a Palestinian state, along with his criticism of Israel's actions in Gaza, may affect his domestic approval depending on how these positions evolve[5].

4. **Defense Spending**: Spain's defense spending at 1.3% of GDP is below NATO targets, which could become a point of contention with the Trump administration and potentially affect Sánchez's standing[5].

## Forecast Limitations

Several significant limitations affect the ability to forecast this comparison:

1. **Missing Data**: The most critical limitation is the absence of current approval rating data for President Erdoğan in the available information.

2. **Measurement Methodology**: The resolution criteria specify Morning Consult as the data source, but the current data comes from different polling organizations with potentially different methodologies.

3. **Timing**: The forecast requires predicting ratings for April 1, 2025, which is several weeks away from the most recent data point of March 2025.

4. **Volatility**: Approval ratings can change rapidly in response to domestic and international events, making short-term forecasting challenging.

Without current approval rating data for Erdoğan, it's impossible to make a well-founded prediction about whether Sánchez will have a higher approval rating on April 1, 2025. The historical context suggests Sánchez has maintained relatively low approval ratings, but without a comparative baseline for Erdoğan, this information alone is insufficient for a forecast.
