### Key Factual Information for Forecasting 5+ Major Hurricanes by September 30, 2024

**Definition and Criteria**
- A major hurricane is defined as Category 3 or higher, with sustained winds greater than 110 mph (95 knots or 177 km/h)[2].

**Current Status (as of July 23, 2024)**
- Hurricane Beryl became the first major hurricane of the 2024 Atlantic season and the earliest Category 5 hurricane on record, reaching this status on July 2, 2024[2].
- As of this date, Beryl is the only confirmed major hurricane in the 2024 season.

**Seasonal Forecasts**
- **NOAA (June 2024 Update):**
  - Predicts a 90% chance of an above-normal season.
  - Expects 17–24 named storms, 8–13 hurricanes, and 4–7 major hurricanes (Category 3+)[2].
- **Colorado State University (CSU, July 2024):**
  - Forecasts 23 named storms, 11 hurricanes, and 5 major hurricanes for the 2024 season[5].
- **Other Forecasts:**
  - Allianz: 2–7 major hurricanes expected[4].
  - University of Pennsylvania: Up to 33 named storms, but no specific major hurricane count[3].

**Recent Announcements and Influencing Factors**
- All major forecasting agencies cite record-warm Atlantic sea surface temperatures and a developing La Niña as key drivers for an extremely active season[5].
- CSU notes this is their highest April prediction for hurricanes and major hurricanes since 1995, reflecting high confidence in an active season[5].

**Historical Trends**
- The 1991–2020 average is about 3 major hurricanes per season[2].
- The 2024 forecasts for major hurricanes (4–7 from NOAA, 5 from CSU) are well above average, suggesting a strong likelihood of meeting or exceeding 5 major hurricanes for the full season[2][5].
- The peak of the Atlantic hurricane season is typically August–October, so most major hurricanes historically occur in this window.

**Authoritative Sources for Verification**
- The National Hurricane Center (NHC) website is the primary source for official hurricane counts and storm classifications[2].
- NOAA and CSU regularly update their seasonal outlooks and storm tracking.

**Limitations and Uncertainties**
- Forecasts are probabilistic and subject to change as atmospheric and oceanic conditions evolve.
- The actual number of major hurricanes before September 30 may differ from seasonal totals, as the peak season extends through October.
- Real-time storm classification and counts should be verified directly from the NHC website on or before September 30, 2024.

### Summary Table: 2024 Major Hurricane Forecasts

| Source         | Major Hurricanes Forecast (2024) | Notes                                      |
|----------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| NOAA           | 4–7                           | 90% chance of above-normal season           |
| CSU            | 5                             | Highest April forecast since 1995           |
| Allianz        | 2–7                           | Range reflects high uncertainty             |

### Conclusion
- As of July 23, 2024, only one major hurricane (Beryl) has occurred.
- Forecasts from NOAA and CSU strongly suggest that 5 or more major hurricanes are likely for the full 2024 season, but the specific number before September 30 will depend on storm development in August and September, which is typically the most active period.
- The NHC website is the definitive source for real-time verification.
