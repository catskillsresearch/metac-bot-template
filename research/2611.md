## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- **Historical Incidents**: As of February 2019, there are no publicly confirmed cases of synthetic biological weapons (as defined: living, genetically engineered, and with medically distinguishable effects) infecting 100 or more people. Most known biological weapon use has involved natural pathogens, not synthetically engineered organisms.
- **Technological Advances**: Synthetic biology ("SynBio") has rapidly advanced, lowering the technical and financial barriers to engineering new or modified pathogens. Protocols and genetic information are increasingly accessible, shifting the threat landscape from state actors to include non-state actors and potentially individuals[5][1].
- **Threat Perception**: Authorities and analysts recognize that the tools needed to create synthetic pathogens are proliferating. The COVID-19 pandemic (post-2019) has demonstrated the global impact of novel biological agents, though COVID-19 is not believed to be synthetic or weaponized[5].

## 2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- **Biological Weapons Convention (BWC)**: The BWC continues to prohibit the development and use of biological weapons, but enforcement and verification remain challenging, especially as synthetic biology techniques advance and diffuse[2].
- **Governance and Risk Mitigation**: Recent (post-2019) policy discussions highlight the urgent need for improved global governance, oversight, and biosecurity measures for synthetic biology and gene editing, but these frameworks lag behind the pace of technological change[3].
- **Military and Security Assessments**: Security communities project that by 2030, synthetic bioweapons could fundamentally alter strategic and operational environments[1][4].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Confirmed infection events must be verified by credible medical sources—such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), World Health Organization (WHO), or peer-reviewed medical literature—demonstrating that the agent is synthetic (engineered), produces medically distinguishable symptoms or behaviors, and has infected at least 100 people.

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- **Attribution Difficulty**: Distinguishing a synthetic pathogen from a natural or conventionally engineered one is technically challenging and may delay or obscure confirmation.
- **Data Transparency**: Many state or non-state actors may conceal outbreaks or the origins of engineered agents, impeding public verification.
- **Measurement Uncertainty**: Infections must be confirmed as resulting from a synthetic agent with adverse effects, excluding natural outbreaks or indistinguishable engineered variants.
- **Technological Unpredictability**: Rapid advances may outpace policy and detection capabilities, increasing uncertainty.

## 5. Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given:
- No historical precedents of confirmed synthetic biological weapon attacks meeting the criteria as of 2019.
- Rapidly increasing accessibility and capability in synthetic biology.
- Ongoing but insufficient governance and oversight.
- Growing concern in the security and scientific communities about the feasibility and impact of such attacks by 2030[1][4][5].

**It is plausible, though not certain, that by 2030 a synthetic biological weapon could infect at least 100 people, particularly given the expanding technical capabilities and diffusion of expertise. However, the lack of historical precedent and the significant verification and attribution challenges mean the probability remains moderate—not high—but clearly rising compared to the pre-2010 era.**
