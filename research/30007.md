# Apple Stock Forecast Through End of 2024

Based on available data as of November 2024, Apple stock's performance through the end of 2024 shows mixed signals regarding whether it will remain below its all-time high of $237.49.

## Current Status and Recent Performance

As of the most recent data, Apple (AAPL) is trading at approximately $205.32, which is significantly below the all-time high threshold of $237.49[2]. The stock has demonstrated strong performance in 2024, with gains of 21.75% reported earlier in the year[1]. However, current technical indicators suggest a bearish sentiment, with the Fear & Greed Index showing a reading of 39 (Fear)[2].

Key technical indicators include:
- 50-Day Simple Moving Average: $215.73
- 200-Day Simple Moving Average: $227.08
- 14-Day Relative Strength Index: 33.06
- Price volatility: 6.29% over the last 30 days[2]

## Analyst Forecasts and Valuations

Morningstar analysts have established a fair value estimate of $200 per share for Apple, suggesting the stock is currently overvalued with a 2-star rating[3]. This valuation implies a fiscal 2025 adjusted price/earnings multiple of 27 times and an enterprise value/sales multiple of 7 times[3].

However, some forecasts present a more bullish outlook. One prediction suggests Apple's stock price could potentially increase to $244.71 in November, which would exceed the all-time high threshold of $237.49[2]. This forecast indicates a possible resolution of "No" to the question if it materializes.

## Recent Developments Affecting Stock Performance

Apple recently reported its fiscal fourth-quarter results on October 31, 2024, posting:
- Quarterly revenue of $94.9 billion, up 6% year over year
- Diluted earnings per share of $1.64 (excluding one-time charges), up 12% year over year[5]

The company's services business continues to show strong performance with double-digit annual growth, representing Apple's most promising revenue driver after the iPhone[3]. Additionally, iPhone revenue is expected to return to growth in fiscal 2025 after a couple of weak years[3].

Apple has also announced that its new line of iPhones will receive enhancements via software updates incorporating more artificial intelligence capabilities[4]. These AI features could potentially impact investor sentiment and stock performance in the coming months.

## Factors That May Limit Upside Potential

Several factors could constrain Apple's stock price through the end of 2024:

1. Analysts note growth headwinds for iPhone revenue in a mature smartphone market with increasing competition from China[3].

2. The current bearish sentiment and technical indicators suggest potential downward pressure in the near term[2].

3. Regulatory scrutiny remains a concern, as "regulators have a keen eye on Apple, and recent regulations have chipped away at parts of its sticky ecosystem"[3].

4. Geopolitical risks related to Apple's supply chain concentration in China and Taiwan could impact performance[3].

## Conclusion

Based on the available information, there are conflicting signals regarding whether Apple stock will continuously remain below its all-time high of $237.49 through December 31, 2024. While the current price ($205.32) is well below this threshold, some forecasts suggest potential upside that could breach the all-time high before year-end. However, bearish sentiment, valuation concerns, and various headwinds could limit upward movement.

Investors should monitor upcoming holiday season sales performance, AI feature adoption rates, and broader market conditions as key indicators for Apple's stock trajectory through the remainder of 2024.
