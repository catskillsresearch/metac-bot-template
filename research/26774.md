# Analysis of Gukesh Dommaraju's Chances in the 2024 Grand Chess Tour

Based on the available information as of May 2024, I'll analyze Gukesh Dommaraju's prospects for winning the 2024 Grand Chess Tour.

## Current Standing and Points Gap

As of May 5, 2024, the Grand Chess Tour standings show Gukesh Dommaraju in 6th place with 19.25 points and $97,583 in prize money[1]. He trails significantly behind the current leader, GM Alireza Firouzja of France, who has accumulated 43.58 points ($323,750)[1]. Other competitors ahead of Gukesh include:

- GM Fabiano Caruana: 36.75 points ($234,250)
- GM Maxime Vachier-Lagrave: 27.33 points ($129,333)
- GM Wesley So: 25.83 points ($91,333)
- GM Praggnanandhaa Rameshbabu: 22.25 points ($107,583)[1]

With this 24.33-point gap to the leader and two tournaments remaining (2024 Saint Louis Rapid & Blitz and 2024 Sinquefield Cup)[2], Gukesh faces a significant mathematical challenge to win the overall tour.

## Gukesh's Recent Performance and Capabilities

Gukesh has demonstrated his elite chess abilities in 2024, most notably by:

- Winning the FIDE Candidates Tournament (2024)
- Becoming the youngest player in history to challenge for the World Championship
- Defeating Ding Liren 7.5 to 6.5 to earn the World Champion title[2]

His current FIDE rating of 2787 places him at #3 in the world rankings[4], indicating his exceptional playing strength. As of March 2025, he maintained this #3 world ranking and holds the #1 position among Indian players[4].

In the 2024 Grand Chess Tour events completed so far, Gukesh finished 5th in the SuperUnited Rapid & Blitz Croatia, earning 19Â½ points and $15,000[2]. He also participated in the Superbet Poland Rapid & Blitz 2024, where he finished behind Magnus Carlsen[3][5].

## Factors Affecting His Chances

Several factors could influence Gukesh's prospects in the remaining tournaments:

1. **Form and momentum**: While Gukesh drew his round-3 encounter against Anish Giri in the Superbet Poland event, commentators noted his "tried-and-true mental strength" and expected him to "recover his form in the coming days"[5]. This resilience could serve him well in the remaining tournaments.

2. **Time control variations**: The remaining tournaments include both rapid/blitz (Saint Louis) and classical (Sinquefield Cup) formats. Gukesh's FIDE ratings in these formats (Rapid: 2654, Blitz: 2615)[4] are lower than his classical rating, which might affect his performance in the Saint Louis Rapid & Blitz.

3. **Point distribution**: Without specific information about the point distribution system for the remaining tournaments, it's difficult to calculate exactly how many points Gukesh could gain by winning both events.

## Assessment of Winning Chances

Based on the May 2024 standings, Gukesh's chances of winning the 2024 Grand Chess Tour appear slim. The 24.33-point deficit to leader Firouzja would require not only dominant performances by Gukesh in the remaining events but also poor showings from multiple competitors ahead of him.

However, Gukesh's status as the reigning World Champion and his demonstrated ability to perform at the highest level mean he cannot be completely discounted. His world #3 ranking and proven mental resilience provide some basis for a potential comeback[2][4].

## Limitations of This Analysis

This assessment is based on standings from May 5, 2024, and does not account for any tournaments or changes in standings that may have occurred between then and August 1, 2024. The point allocation system for the remaining tournaments is not specified in the available information, making it difficult to calculate exactly what results Gukesh would need to overcome his deficit.
