## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- **AI and Tech Sector Performance**: As of January 2021, leading AI-related stocks (e.g., Nvidia, Alphabet, Microsoft) had delivered strong returns in the preceding years, often outperforming global equity indices. AI-themes ETFs and indices—such as the Morningstar Global Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Index—had consistently outpaced the FTSE Global All Cap Index over certain periods, but with substantial volatility[1][3].
- **Major Innovation Precedents**: Historically, major tech breakthroughs (like the iPhone launch by Apple or the rise of cloud computing) have led to significant upward stock movements. However, the majority of the outperformance often occurred after the public announcement or product launch, not always in the run-up period, unless there were clear leaks or investor anticipation.
- **AGI Company Landscape**: Per 2021 data, most AGI-attempting companies were either large tech incumbents (public) or well-funded startups (private)[2]. No company had yet credibly claimed AGI status, but market speculation was focused on a small group of public firms with the capacity and resources for such a breakthrough.

## 2. Recent Announcements and Policies (as of Jan 2021)

- **AI Investment Boom**: There was a surge in AI investments, with capital inflows into both public and private companies, and the narrative of AGI was being used to attract further investor attention[5].
- **Recalibration of AGI Timelines**: Companies and analysts were beginning to moderate expectations for near-term AGI, signaling that, while progress was rapid, transformative leaps were not imminent[5].
- **Market Dynamics**: Global equities were in recovery from the COVID-induced 2020 crash, with tech stocks leading the rebound. This created a high baseline for measuring outperformance.

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Morningstar Global Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Index methodology and performance[1]
- Publicly available performance data on AI-focused ETFs and major tech stocks[3]
- Lists and updates on AGI companies and their market status[2]
- Industry analysis on the business and investment climate for AI and AGI[5]

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- **Unprecedented Event**: No true AGI had been developed as of 2021, so there are no direct historical precedents for the question.
- **Information Asymmetry**: If a company is close to announcing AGI, insider knowledge could drive stock price increases before public awareness, but this cannot be assured in advance.
- **Index Selection**: The FTSE Global All Cap Index is broad and diversified, and tech stocks, while outperforming at times, do not always sustain 1.5x outperformance over short (10-month) windows—especially when compared to periods of strong global equity performance.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given all available public data as of January 2021, the likelihood that a publicly traded company developing the first AGI would have outperformed the global equities market by at least 1.5x during the 12-to-2 months prior to AGI being publicly known is **plausible but not more likely than not**.

- Major tech stocks and AI leaders have demonstrated the capacity for such outperformance in the past, but the 1.5x threshold versus a rebounding global index is high.
- Outperformance before a public AGI announcement would require strong investor anticipation or leaked signals.
- **Estimated probability (as of Jan 2021):** 35-45%.
