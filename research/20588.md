## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Since 1945, no two Western countries (as defined in the question) have fought a war against each other. This "Long Peace" among Western nations is unprecedented in modern history, following centuries of frequent intra-Western conflict[4].
- Western countries are now bound by dense networks of alliances (NATO, EU), shared democratic values, and extensive economic interdependence, all of which historically reduce the risk of major interstate war within the group[4][5].
- As of 2023, global armed conflict reached a post–Cold War high, with 59 conflicts recorded worldwide. However, these are largely concentrated outside the Western world[1][5].

## Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Metric

- Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 has prompted Western nations to increase military spending, reintroduce or expand conscription, and upgrade civil defense infrastructure. Sweden and Finland joined NATO, further consolidating Western military integration[2][5].
- While several Western states are preparing for broader conflict scenarios, the focus is on external threats (notably Russia and, potentially, China), not on intra-Western rivalry[2][3][5].
- Rising anxiety over global war has led to heightened readiness but not to diplomatic or military tensions between Western states themselves[5].

## Key Differences Affecting the Forecast

- Unlike pre-1945 Europe, today’s Western world is characterized by high levels of economic, political, and military integration.
- Current preparations for war are oriented externally (against Russia or potentially China), not internally.
- While global cooperation is weakening and the risk of broader conflict is growing, there are no significant signs of brewing conflict among Western nations themselves[2][5].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- The 45-year forecast window (to 2070) introduces significant uncertainty. Potential disruptors include political realignment, technological upheaval, or alliance fragmentation.
- Measurement would be complicated by hybrid or ambiguous conflicts, but the definitions provided (minimum casualty thresholds, formal declarations, etc.) are designed to minimize ambiguity.
- Black swan events, such as the collapse of existing institutions or the rise of hostile governments within Western states, cannot be entirely ruled out, but such scenarios currently appear highly improbable given existing trends.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given:
- The remarkable 80-year absence of war between Western countries,
- The continued existence of strong integrative institutions,
- The focus of current military preparations on external, not internal, adversaries,
- And the lack of any notable trend toward intra-Western hostility,

The probability that two or more Western countries will go to war with each other (by the question’s definition) before 2070 remains low—likely well below 10%, though not zero due to the long time horizon and inherent unpredictability of geopolitical change.
