### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- From January 2020 through October 2024, the US State Department has approved an average of approximately 6.7 arms sales per month.
- Monthly approvals are highly variable, with most months ranging between 4 and 12 approvals.
- Notable outliers include August 2024 (22 approvals) and December 2023 (17 approvals), but these are exceptions rather than the norm.
- For Q4 2024, October has already recorded 9 approvals, which is above average but not unprecedented.

### Recent Announcements and Policies

- There is no evidence of new policies or emergency authorities in 2024 that would systematically increase the number of arms sales approvals.
- The process remains governed by the Arms Export Control Act, which requires formal notification to Congress and allows for a 30-day review period. Unless Congress blocks a sale, the State Department can proceed with the approval[1][2][5].
- Occasional spikes in approvals can occur due to geopolitical events or end-of-year processing, but these are not consistent or predictable.

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) Major Arms Sales notifications page is the definitive source for tracking State Department-approved arms sales.
- Congressional Research Service reports detail the legal and procedural framework for arms sales approvals[1][2].
- Additional context is provided by policy analysis and reporting on the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program[4][5].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- The monthly approval rate is subject to significant fluctuation due to geopolitical developments, administrative processing, and congressional review.
- While October 2024's figure is above average, there is no clear trend indicating that November and December will also be unusually high.
- The August 2024 spike appears anomalous and is not part of a sustained upward trend.

### Summary Table: Q4 2024 Approvals (as of October 2024)

| Month      | Approvals |
|------------|-----------|
| October    | 9         |
| November   | ?         |
| December   | ?         |

To exceed 25 approvals in Q4 2024, November and December would need to total at least 17 more approvals. Given historical patterns, this would require both months to be well above average, which is rare outside of exceptional circumstances.
