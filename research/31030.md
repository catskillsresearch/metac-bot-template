# Will Blue Origin Launch New Glenn Before January 1, 2025?

As of December 2024, Blue Origin has made significant progress toward the inaugural launch of its New Glenn rocket, with multiple official statements indicating a target launch before the end of 2024. However, several critical steps remain before the rocket can make its maiden flight.

## Current Status of New Glenn

Blue Origin has successfully placed a fully integrated, flight-capable New Glenn rocket on the launch pad at Launch Complex 36 (LC-36) at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station[1]. This milestone occurred in November 2024 when the company rolled the rocket out of the hangar and raised it into launch position[1][3]. The complete rocket stands approximately 98 meters (320 feet) tall and represents a major advancement in Blue Origin's orbital launch capabilities[4].

The payload for New Glenn's first mission (designated NG-1) will be Blue Origin's own Blue Ring Pathfinder spacecraft, which the company has confirmed is ready for launch[5]. This initial mission appears to be related to a National Security Space Launch certification flight called DarkSky-1, sponsored by the U.S. Defense Innovation Unit[3].

## Remaining Steps Before Launch

Despite the progress, several critical steps remain before New Glenn can make its inaugural flight:

1. **Static Fire Test**: Blue Origin must conduct what they call a "hot fire" test, which involves firing all seven BE-4 engines of the first stage at full thrust while the rocket remains secured to the launch pad[2]. This would be the first time Blue Origin fuels a fully-assembled, flight-ready New Glenn rocket[1].

2. **Regulatory Approval**: As of December 9, 2024, Blue Origin was still awaiting regulatory approval to conduct the static fire test[2]. This regulatory hurdle must be cleared before proceeding.

3. **Fairing Integration**: After a successful static fire test, Blue Origin will need to integrate the payload fairing as the final step before launch[2].

## Official Statements on Launch Timeline

Blue Origin has consistently maintained that New Glenn's first launch is on track for 2024:

- On December 9, 2024, Blue Origin stated it was "on track to launch its towering New Glenn vehicle before the year's end"[2].
- The company's website stated as of November 14, 2024, that "New Glenn's first launch is on track for this year"[4].
- Blue Origin confirmed on December 9, 2024, that their payload for the first mission is "ready for launch this year"[5].

## Uncertainties and Challenges

Several factors could potentially delay the launch beyond January 1, 2025:

1. **Regulatory Timeline**: The pending regulatory approval for the static fire test introduces uncertainty into the launch schedule[2].

2. **Technical Challenges**: Any issues discovered during the static fire test could necessitate additional work and delay the launch.

3. **Weather and Range Constraints**: December weather in Florida and end-of-year range availability at Cape Canaveral could impact launch opportunities.

4. **Historical Context**: Large rocket development programs often experience delays, particularly for inaugural launches.

## Conclusion

Based on official statements from Blue Origin as of December 2024, the company is targeting a New Glenn launch before January 1, 2025. The rocket is physically on the launch pad, and the payload is ready[1][5]. However, the pending static fire test and regulatory approvals represent significant hurdles that must be overcome in a relatively short timeframe. While Blue Origin maintains the launch is "on track" for 2024, the tight timeline and remaining technical steps introduce uncertainty into whether the inaugural flight will occur before the January 1, 2025 deadline.
