## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The past decade (2015–2024) contains all ten of the warmest years in the 175-year global record, with 2024 being the hottest year ever recorded globally, surpassing 2023 by 0.10°C[5].
- NOAA’s latest rolling periods up to April 2025 show "1st Warmest" designations, indicating persistent record-breaking warmth through early 2025[1].
- The methodology involves comprehensive blending of land and ocean surface temperatures from 1850 onward, using advanced data networks and anomaly calculations against a 20th-century baseline[4].

## Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- There are no new measurement methodologies or major policy changes reported by NOAA that would affect global temperature rankings as of June 2025. Measurement protocols remain consistent and authoritative[4].
- Global climate policy (such as emissions reductions) has not yet resulted in measurable cooling sufficient to impact short-term global averages or rankings.

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- NOAA’s [Climate at a Glance Global Rankings](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/monitoring/climate-at-a-glance/global/rankings) tracker is the official data source for resolving this forecast.
- NOAA’s annual and monthly climate reports provide context and historical comparisons[5].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- The final May 2025 data is not yet published; the forecast is based on trends and recent rolling data as of June 2, 2025.
- Short-term climate variability (e.g., unexpected volcanic eruptions, rapid oceanic changes) can influence monthly temperature rankings.
- Minor data adjustments or late-arriving datasets can occasionally revise initial rankings.
- The ranking is determined by a blend of land and ocean data globally, and anomalies are relative to the 20th-century average[4].

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Based on recent record-breaking warmth, the persistent "1st Warmest" designations through April 2025, and the absence of evidence for cooling or reversal, there is a **high probability (estimated at 80–90%)** that NOAA will report May 2025 as the hottest May on record on its Climate at a Glance Global Rankings tracker.
