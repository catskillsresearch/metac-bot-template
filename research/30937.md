# Forecasting ICE Deportations in FY 2025

To forecast whether ICE deportations in FY 2025 will reach at least twice the FY 2024 level, I'll analyze historical trends, current policy changes, and early indicators from the first months of FY 2025.

## Historical Context and Current Status

ICE reported 271,000 deportations in FY 2024, marking a 10-year high that exceeded the previous Trump administration peak of 267,000 in FY 2019[5]. This represented a significant increase from previous years, with FY 2024 showing a 69% increase in removals compared to the same period in FY 2023[2]. 

The majority (approximately 82%) of FY 2024 deportations involved migrants initially apprehended by U.S. border officials rather than those arrested by ICE in the interior of the country[5]. This distinction is important because interior enforcement represents a different operational challenge than processing recent border crossers.

## Recent Policy Changes and Early Indicators

Since the Trump administration took office in January 2025, there have been significant changes in immigration enforcement:

1. **Increased arrest rates**: ICE arrest rates have approximately doubled since FY 2024, increasing from 310 to about 650 per day as of mid-April 2025[4]. This represents a substantial intensification of interior enforcement activities.

2. **Expanded enforcement focus**: Unlike the previous administration, which prioritized certain categories of immigrants for removal, the current administration appears to be implementing broader enforcement priorities aligned with campaign promises of "Mass Deportation."

3. **Resource allocation**: The administration has redirected resources toward immigration enforcement, though the full impact of these changes is still developing.

## Forecast Analysis

To reach the threshold of 542,968 deportations (double the FY 2024 figure), ICE would need to maintain a monthly average of approximately 45,247 deportations throughout FY 2025.

### Factors Supporting Increased Deportations:

- The doubled arrest rate since the beginning of the administration suggests significantly increased enforcement activity[4]
- The administration's clear policy focus on deportations as a priority
- Potential streamlining of deportation processes and allocation of additional resources

### Limiting Factors:

- Operational capacity constraints within ICE
- Legal challenges to deportation policies
- Diplomatic limitations in securing cooperation from receiving countries
- Historical precedent: Even during the previous Trump administration, actual deportation numbers did not match rhetoric

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on the available data, I assess that ICE deportations in FY 2025 will likely increase significantly compared to FY 2024, but reaching double the FY 2024 figure faces substantial operational challenges.

The doubled arrest rate since the start of the administration is a strong indicator of increased enforcement activity[4]. However, the gap between arrests and completed deportations, combined with the logistical challenges of scaling operations, suggests that while deportations will increase substantially, doubling the FY 2024 number within a single fiscal year remains ambitious.

Given these factors, I assess a 30-40% probability that deportations in FY 2025 will reach at least twice the FY 2024 level. This assessment acknowledges both the clear policy direction toward increased deportations and the practical constraints on rapidly scaling such operations.

## Measurement Considerations

Several factors could affect the measurement and reporting of deportation figures:

1. Changes in reporting methodology could impact year-over-year comparisons
2. The distinction between Title 8 removals and other forms of return may affect total counts
3. Delays in data reporting could impact timely assessment of trends

I will continue monitoring ICE's enforcement statistics dashboards, which are typically updated quarterly, to refine this forecast as more data becomes available throughout FY 2025.
