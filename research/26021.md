### Key Factual Information for Forecasting

**1. Historical Trends and Current Status**
- Usain Bolt's Olympic record of 9.63 seconds was set at the 2012 London Olympics and has not been approached since[3].
- Bolt's world record of 9.58 seconds (set in 2009) is the longest-standing 100m world record in history, and no sprinter has run under 9.75 seconds since 2015[1][5].
- Bolt himself, as of late 2023, expressed confidence that his 100m and 200m records are unlikely to be broken soon[4][5].

**2. Recent Announcements/Policies**
- There have been no major changes in track technology, shoe regulations, or anti-doping policies announced before July 2024 that would significantly increase the likelihood of a new record at Paris 2024.
- Top sprinters like Christian Coleman have stated that while breaking Bolt's record is possible, it would require "perfect conditions" and an exceptional performance[2].

**3. Authoritative Sources for Verification**
- Official Olympic results (olympics.com)
- World Athletics (worldathletics.org)

**4. Limitations and Uncertainties**
- The 100m final is subject to variables such as weather, athlete form, and race-day pressure, which can affect outcomes.
- Timing at the Olympics is fully electronic and highly accurate, so measurement uncertainty is negligible.

### Summary Table

| Factor                        | Status as of July 2024                  |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Fastest 100m time since 2015  | â‰¥ 9.75s                                 |
| Olympic record                | 9.63s (Usain Bolt, 2012)                |
| World record                  | 9.58s (Usain Bolt, 2009)                |
| Recent sub-9.63s performances | None                                    |
| Expert/athlete sentiment      | Record possible but highly unlikely      |
| Technological/policy changes  | None significant                        |
| Measurement uncertainty       | Negligible (fully electronic timing)     |

### Conclusion

As of July 11, 2024, all available evidence suggests it is highly unlikely that the men's 100m dash winning time at the Paris 2024 Olympics will break Usain Bolt's Olympic record of 9.63 seconds. No athlete has approached this mark in nearly a decade, and there are no indications of imminent breakthroughs in performance or technology that would make a sub-9.63s time probable[1][2][5].
