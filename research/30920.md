# Forecasting Analysis: Maersk's Red Sea Shipping in 2025

As of May 24, 2025, I'll analyze the available information to forecast whether Maersk will resume shipping through the Red Sea before the end of 2025.

## Current Situation

Maersk continues to re-route its networks via the Cape of Good Hope as an alternative to transiting the Red Sea/Gulf of Aden[1]. Despite recent diplomatic developments, the company still expects disruption in the Red Sea to continue throughout the remainder of 2025[5].

A significant recent development is President Trump's announcement that the US will halt bombing the Houthis in Yemen following an agreement where the Houthis committed to stop attacking shipping lanes in the Middle East. Under this agreement, neither the US nor the Houthis would target each other, including US vessels in the Red Sea and Bab Al-Mandab Strait[5].

## Key Factors Affecting the Forecast

**Safety Requirements**: In July 2024, Maersk CEO Vincent Clerc explicitly stated that the company would only return to sailing via the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden "when the safety of seafarers, vessels and cargo is guaranteed"[5]. This establishes a clear threshold for resumption.

**Readiness for Quick Return**: Clerc noted that ships could "almost immediately return to sailing their usual routes through the Suez Canal once a resolution is found"[5]. This indicates operational readiness to resume Red Sea routes if safety concerns are addressed.

**Ongoing Concerns**: Despite the ceasefire agreement, Maersk's expectation of continued disruption throughout 2025 suggests remaining skepticism about the stability of the situation[5].

**Market Adjustments**: Maersk has revised its global container market volume growth forecast to between -1% and 4% due to "increased macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty"[5], indicating they're preparing for continued alternative routing.

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on the available information, I assess the probability of Maersk resuming shipping in the Red Sea during 2025 as **moderate to low** (approximately 30-40%), with the following considerations:

1. **Positive factors**:
   - The ceasefire between the US and Houthis represents the first major diplomatic breakthrough in the conflict
   - Maersk has indicated technical readiness to resume operations quickly if conditions permit
   - Economic pressure to return to the shorter, more efficient Red Sea route remains significant

2. **Negative factors**:
   - Maersk explicitly expects disruptions to continue throughout 2025, even after the ceasefire
   - The company has set a high bar for resumption, requiring guaranteed safety
   - Previous ceasefire attempts in the region have had mixed success in maintaining stability

## Limitations and Uncertainties

The forecast faces several limitations:

1. The durability of the US-Houthi ceasefire remains unproven
2. Maersk's specific safety metrics for resumption aren't publicly detailed
3. Other regional geopolitical developments could impact the situation
4. The forecast window (remaining 7 months of 2025) provides limited time for conditions to stabilize sufficiently

Given Maersk's stated expectations of continued disruption throughout 2025 despite the ceasefire, the most likely outcome is that full resumption will not occur in 2025, though limited or trial resumption remains possible if the ceasefire holds and security improves beyond current expectations.
