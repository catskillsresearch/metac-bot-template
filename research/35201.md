## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Perplexity AI has experienced rapid growth since its founding in 2022, achieving unicorn status with a valuation over $1 billion after a Series B funding round in April 2024[3].
- The company is frequently mentioned as a likely IPO candidate for 2025 due to its growth trajectory and investor interest[1].
- As of early 2025, Perplexity AI operates a freemium business model and has begun experimenting with advertising, further diversifying its revenue streams[2].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- There is no official news or confirmation of an IPO announcement from Perplexity AI as of February 21, 2025[3].
- The company has been involved in significant funding activities, including talks to raise $500 million at an $8 billion valuation, but these are private fundraising efforts, not public offerings[4].
- A notable strategic proposal involved a potential merger with TikTok’s U.S. business, which referenced a future IPO as part of the structure. However, this proposal is not an official IPO announcement and is contingent on various factors, including regulatory approval and ByteDance’s response[5].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- No SEC Form S-1 filing by Perplexity AI has been reported as of February 21, 2025.
- No IPO announcement has been made on the Perplexity AI News page or through official company channels[3].
- Industry analysis and news outlets continue to speculate about a potential IPO but do not cite any official company statements or filings[1][3].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- The absence of an official announcement or filing as of February 21, 2025, does not preclude the possibility of a future IPO announcement before April 1, 2025.
- Strategic proposals (such as the TikTok merger) may include IPO plans as contingencies, but these do not meet the resolution criteria unless formally announced or filed[5].
- Market conditions, regulatory developments, and company strategy could influence the timing and likelihood of an IPO, but no definitive action has been taken as of the cutoff date.

**Conclusion:**  
As of February 21, 2025, there is no factual evidence that Perplexity AI has announced plans for an IPO or filed an SEC Form S-1. All available information points to speculation and preparatory activity, but not to a qualifying announcement under the specified criteria.
