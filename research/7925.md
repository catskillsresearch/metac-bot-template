## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- **China has demonstrated willingness and capability to pioneer human germline interventions.** The most notable case is the 2018 birth of the world’s first gene-edited babies (He Jiankui case), where CRISPR was used to modify embryos for HIV resistance[1]. This event put China at the forefront of controversial reproductive genetic technologies.
- **Regulatory backlash was swift and severe.** The Chinese government condemned the experiment, prosecuted the scientist, and reinforced prohibitions on germline genetic modification for reproductive purposes, including implanting edited embryos or allowing them to develop past 14 days[1].
- **Legal and policy environment:** As of early 2022, China allows germline gene editing for research purposes only, not for reproductive use[1]. This places it in line with most developed countries, where polygenic embryo selection for intelligence is not explicitly permitted for reproductive purposes.
- **Healthcare infrastructure and demographic trends:** China has a large and advanced fertility treatment sector, with thousands of maternal and child health institutions and widespread access to assisted reproductive technologies[2]. However, there is no credible public reporting of polygenic selection for intelligence being used in actual births as of early 2022.

## 2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- **Tightened regulations post-2018:** Following the CRISPR baby scandal, China strengthened laws prohibiting the reproductive use of edited embryos, signaling a cautious regulatory stance[1].
- **Emphasis on child health and legal protection:** Policy documents through 2023 stress improvements in child health and legal protections but do not indicate official support for polygenic selection for intelligence[2].
- **Global context:** Similar regulatory caution exists in the US and Europe, and no country is known to openly permit embryo selection specifically for intelligence as of early 2022.

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Government and academic reports on gene editing and assisted reproduction in China[1][2].
- International regulatory trackers and genetic policy analyses.
- Peer-reviewed literature on the status of reproductive genetics worldwide.

## 4. Key Differences Affecting the Forecast

| Factor                            | China                                      | Rest of World                        |
|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Regulatory stance (2022)           | Prohibits reproductive germline editing; research only[1] | Generally similar restrictions      |
| Research capability                | High, demonstrated by 2018 incident[1]     | High in some countries              |
| Willingness to push boundaries     | Demonstrated in past                       | More conservative overall           |
| Enforcement of regulations         | Increased after 2018, but enforcement depth is variable[1] | Generally strong in developed countries |
| Public/elite attitudes             | Ambivalent, with both support and backlash | Generally cautious                  |
| Fertility industry scale           | Large and technologically advanced[2]      | Large in US, smaller elsewhere      |

## 5. Limitations and Uncertainties

- **Verification challenge:** Procedures may occur clandestinely, and official statistics may lag or be incomplete.
- **Ambiguity in what counts as “polygenic selection for intelligence.”** Commercial and research offerings may blur lines between health, intelligence, and other traits.
- **International collaboration and cross-border fertility tourism** could complicate attribution of births.

## 6. Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

- **Reference case:** As of early 2022, no country is publicly known to have produced babies selected for intelligence via polygenic embryo screening.
- **China’s past willingness to act outside international norms** (e.g., CRISPR babies) and its advanced fertility sector suggest *potential* for early adoption if/when the practice becomes feasible.
- **However, the post-2018 crackdown and explicit legal prohibitions** make it less likely that such births would be officially reported or occur in large numbers in the near future[1].
- **Given global regulatory caution and technical barriers,** if the first 100 such babies are born, the probability that a majority are born in China is *higher than for most countries, but not overwhelming* under current regulations.

**Probabilistic assessment (as of January 2022):**  
- The probability that more than 50 of the first 100 IQ-selected designer babies are born in China is *significantly above baseline global average*, but *well below certainty* due to regulatory crackdowns and reputational risks.  
- A plausible range is **25–50%**, with the most likely scenario being that China is a major contributor but not a clear majority, unless regulations loosen or clandestine practices evade detection.
