## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of 2019, whole brain emulation remained a theoretical and experimental pursuit, with no successful human upload achieved. The field was advancing via partial scans, improved scanning and simulation technologies, and scaling up from simpler organisms[1][5].
- Major milestones on the WBE roadmap—such as ground truth models, full cell simulation, organism emulation, and an automated pipeline—had not been fully realized for humans by 2019[1].

## Recent Announcements/Policies

- No major policy changes or announcements as of 2019 indicated imminent large-scale human uploading. Research was largely confined to academic and experimental domains, with ethical, legal, and technical challenges front and center[1].

## Authoritative Sources

- The most comprehensive sources include Bostrom and Sandberg's "Whole Brain Emulation: A Roadmap"[1] and Robin Hanson's "The Age of Em"[2], both of which discuss technical hurdles, potential adoption scenarios, and likely limits on early adoption.

## Forecast and Probabilistic Assessment

- **Reference Case**: Early adoption will be constrained by the destructive nature of scanning, high costs, and a focus on high-value individuals. Hanson's forecast expects something like one thousand "copy clans," with em worlds dominated by a small number of highly productive uploaded brains[2].
- **Key Differences**: If automated pipelines and hardware costs drop precipitously, and if social/legal frameworks adapt, a higher number is conceivable. However, such a scenario is not strongly supported by current trends or projections[1][5].
- **Adjusted Forecast**: Given these constraints, the maximum number of humans uploaded in any 5-year period before 2100, assuming successful WBE, is most likely to be in the low thousands, with the upper bound likely not exceeding 10,000 under optimistic but plausible scenarios.
- **Uncertainties**: This assessment could change if non-destructive uploading becomes viable, or if unforeseen societal changes create sudden mass adoption.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- There is substantial uncertainty due to unknowns in technological progress, costs, legal/ethical acceptance, and the potential for non-destructive methods.
- The destructive nature of the process and societal reticence are likely to limit adoption well below the theoretical maximum, even with radical advances[1][5].
