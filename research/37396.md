# Water Level Forecast Analysis: River Great Ouse at Welney Causeway

Based on the available data as of May 29, 2025, I'll analyze the current situation and provide a probabilistic assessment for the water level state on July 1, 2025.

## Current Status

As of 12:45pm on May 29, 2025, the River Great Ouse level at Welney Causeway is:
- **Current level**: 0.69m[2][5]
- **Current state**: Normal[2][5]
- **Current trend**: Steady[2][5]

This current level falls within the defined normal range for this monitoring station, though it is positioned closer to the lower end of this range.

## Historical Reference Points

The monitoring station at Welney Causeway provides several important reference points:

- **Normal range**: 0.459m (lower) to 2.40m (upper)[3][4]
- **Historical minimum**: 0.303m (recorded on October 9, 2010)[3]
- **Historical maximum**: 4.134m (recorded on January 7, 2003)[3]
- **Highest recent level**: 3.877m (recorded on December 29, 2012)[3]
- **Flooding threshold**: Low-lying land flooding possible above 2.35m[2][5]

The station has been operational since May 17, 1988, providing a substantial historical dataset for comparison[3].

## Forecast Considerations

Several factors are relevant to forecasting the water level on July 1, 2025:

1. **Current position within normal range**: The present level (0.69m) is in the lower half of the normal range, sitting approximately 0.23m above the lower normal threshold.

2. **Broader UK water level trends**: The BBC has reported "exceptionally low river levels" across most of the UK, with concerns about water supplies. Almost all UK regions except southwest England and southern Wales are expected to experience below normal or low river levels.

3. **Seasonal patterns**: Early July typically represents a drier period in East Anglia compared to spring months, which could contribute to further decreases in river levels.

4. **Current trend stability**: The "steady" designation suggests no immediate rapid change, though this could shift with changing weather patterns over the coming month.

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on the available information, I assess the following probabilities for the water level state on July 1, 2025:

- **Low** (below 0.459m): 60% probability
  - Justification: Current level is already in the lower portion of normal range, broader UK trend toward low water levels, and typically drier conditions in July.

- **Normal** (between 0.459m and 2.40m): 40% probability
  - Justification: Current steady trend and sufficient buffer (0.23m) above the low threshold could maintain normal levels if precipitation remains adequate.

- **High** (above 2.40m): <1% probability
  - Justification: Current level is far below the high threshold, and summer conditions make significant water level increases highly unlikely.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

This forecast has several important limitations:

1. No specific meteorological forecasts for the region over the next month were available in the search results.

2. No information on planned water management activities (releases, diversions) that might affect river levels was available.

3. The assessment doesn't account for potential extreme weather events that could significantly alter river levels.

4. Historical seasonal patterns may be less reliable given changing climate patterns.

The water level monitoring station provides regular 15-minute interval measurements[3], which will allow for tracking of any significant changes as the forecast date approaches.
