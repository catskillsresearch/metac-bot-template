**1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status**

- As of 2025, China’s humanoid robot sector is entering full-scale mass production. Six out of eleven leading domestic humanoid robot makers plan to manufacture more than 1,000 units each within the year, with the total domestic output value projected at approximately US$616 million[1].
- Notably, companies such as Agibot (Zhiyuan Robotics) have already reportedly produced at least 962 humanoid robots by late 2024, operating a dedicated mass production facility in Shanghai with the stated intent to surpass the 1,000-unit mark imminently[3].
- The sector is supported by a surge in artificial intelligence advances and China’s drive for technology self-sufficiency, resulting in a competitive market with rapid scaling and international ambitions[1][4].

**2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric**

- The Chinese Ministry of Industry and Information Technology’s 2025 guideline explicitly sets the goal of establishing a national innovation system for humanoid robots, achieving core technological breakthroughs, and enabling mass production by 2025[4].
- Major Chinese firms, including Xiaomi, Fourier Intelligence, and UBTech Robotics, are cited as major industry players, with several unveiling advanced bipedal platforms capable of autonomous operation (walking, picking up, carrying objects)[1][4].
- Government support and investment are accelerating the sector’s commercialization, with integrated supply chains and AI-driven control systems being rolled out[1][4].

**3. Authoritative Sources for Verification**

- Market research firms (e.g., TrendForce), major media outlets (e.g., South China Morning Post, People’s Daily), and trade show documentation all report that multiple Chinese companies have commenced or are on the cusp of large-scale mass production, with at least one company (Agibot) on track to surpass 1,000 units in 2025[1][2][3].
- Facility tours and factory footage (e.g., Agibot’s Shanghai plant) provide visual evidence of manufacturing at scale[3].

**4. Limitations and Uncertainties**

- While reported production numbers and facilities are credible, there is still limited independent third-party verification of *delivered* robots in end-user environments and whether all meet the strictest definitions of “identical model” and “fully autonomous operation.” However, the mass production of qualifying bipedal humanoids by at least one Chinese company appears highly probable as of May 2025[1][3].
- The precise deployment (operational vs. warehoused units) and performance in real-world environments may vary, but the minimum threshold of production (1,000+ units of an identical model) is likely to be met within the year.

**Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment**

Given the convergence of policy, industry action, and credible production reports, there is now a very high probability (>90%) that by the end of 2025, at least one China-headquartered robotics company will have manufactured more than 1,000 humanoid robots of an identical model, meeting the resolution criteria.
