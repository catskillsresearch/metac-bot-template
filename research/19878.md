### 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- China is a world leader in industrial robot deployment and is rapidly increasing its focus on humanoid robots as a new growth engine. By 2025, the government aims to have an initial innovation system and reach advanced international standards for humanoid robots, including mass production capabilities[3].
- As of early 2025, Shenzhen-based UBTech Robotics plans to mass produce its Walker S Series humanoid robots, targeting delivery of 500–1,000 units by year-end to major industrial customers, such as Foxconn and SF Express. These robots are bipedal, equipped with two arms and a head, and are deployed in factory settings for tasks like walking, picking up, and carrying objects—aligning with the technical requirements specified[5].
- Zhiyuan Robotics (Agibot) reportedly began mass production in late 2024, with footage showing at least 962 humanoid robots produced at its Shanghai facility. The company claims this is the first mass production factory for humanoid robots in China[1].

### 2. Recent Announcements and Policies

- The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) published guidelines in late 2023 committing China to mass-produce humanoid robots by 2025, targeting breakthroughs in AI, control systems, and core components[3].
- President Xi Jinping publicly called for the mass production of humanoid robots by 2025, underscoring the government's support and urgency on this goal[4].
- Companies like UBTech and Zhiyuan/Agibot have publicly announced their production targets and showcased progress through media and facility tours, aiming to meet or surpass the 1,000-unit threshold within 2025[1][5].

### 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- South China Morning Post (SCMP) coverage of UBTech's mass production plans and customer deliveries[5].
- Video and media reports documenting Zhiyuan Robotics' production facility and robot output[1].
- MIIT policy documents and public statements by Chinese government officials outlining national targets[3][4].

### 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- "Mass production" is generally interpreted as producing at least 1,000 identical units, but not all companies may publicly confirm shipment numbers or technical compliance with all specified criteria (bipedal, autonomous operation, basic task performance).
- Most current deployments are in industrial settings rather than consumer households, due to limitations in AI autonomy for general-purpose service.
- Some reported numbers (e.g., 962 robots by Zhiyuan) are approaching but have not definitively surpassed the 1,000-unit threshold as of early 2025. The pace of production and delivery throughout the remainder of the year will determine if the resolution criteria are fully met[1][5].
- Verification will depend on credible media reporting, government disclosures, or company statements confirming delivery of over 1,000 compliant units by a single Chinese company before the end of 2025.

### Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given government prioritization, visible progress by multiple firms, and ongoing ramp-up in production, there is a high probability (>70%) that at least one Chinese robotics company will credibly report manufacturing and delivering more than 1,000 autonomous, bipedal humanoid robots of an identical model before December 31, 2025, primarily for industrial use. However, this assessment remains contingent on continued production momentum and transparent disclosure by the companies involved.
