# Will Donald Trump outperform Rick Scott in Florida in the 2024 election?

Based on polling data available prior to October 29, 2024, there are strong indications that Donald Trump is likely to outperform Rick Scott in Florida in the 2024 election. Multiple polls consistently show Trump with a larger margin over his opponent compared to Scott's lead in the Senate race.

## Current Polling Status

The most recent polling data from Emerson College/The Hill (October 23, 2024) shows Donald Trump leading Kamala Harris by 8 percentage points (52% to 44%) in Florida[4]. In the same poll, Rick Scott leads his Democratic opponent Debbie Mucarsel-Powell by a smaller margin of 4 percentage points (48% to 44%)[4].

This pattern is consistent with earlier polling from September 2024, which showed Trump leading Harris by 5 percentage points (50% to 45%), while Scott held only a 1-point lead over Mucarsel-Powell[5].

The Florida Chamber's statewide poll from late October 2024 indicates that both Trump and Scott are leading their Democratic opponents, with both candidates showing strong support among Hispanic voters and No Party Affiliation (NPA) voters[1]. However, when looking at specific numbers from earlier polls, Trump appears to have a more substantial advantage.

## Key Demographic Trends

Several demographic factors may contribute to Trump potentially outperforming Scott:

1. **NPA Voter Support**: Trump holds a significant advantage among NPA voters in Florida, with 53% supporting him compared to 43% for Harris according to the August Florida Chamber poll[2]. This 10-point advantage among independent voters is crucial in a swing state like Florida.

2. **Hispanic Voter Support**: Both Trump and Scott are leading their Democratic opponents by double digits among Hispanic voters[1], a critical demographic in Florida. However, the polling doesn't specify if one candidate has a larger advantage within this group.

3. **Older Voter Support**: Both candidates show strength among older voters[2], who typically have higher turnout rates in Florida elections.

## Historical Context

In 2020, Trump won Florida by 3 percentage points over Biden (51% to 48%)[5]. The current polling suggests Trump may improve on his 2020 performance, with leads ranging from 5 to 8 points over Harris.

Scott, who is seeking his second term in the Senate, appears to be in a more competitive race with leads ranging from 1 to 4 points in recent polls.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors could affect the final outcome:

1. **Polling Volatility**: Polls represent snapshots in time and can change as Election Day approaches. The varying margins across different polls (Trump +5 to +8, Scott +1 to +4) demonstrate some inconsistency in the exact size of their leads.

2. **Undecided Voters**: The Emerson College poll notes that 3% of voters remain undecided in the presidential race[4]. How these voters ultimately break could affect the final margins.

3. **Ticket Splitting**: There is evidence of ticket splitting among Florida voters. As noted by Kimball (presumably from Emerson College), "There are varying degrees of ticket splitting in these statewide polls"[5], which could affect the relative performance of candidates.

## Conclusion

Based on the available polling data, Donald Trump appears positioned to outperform Rick Scott in Florida in the 2024 election. Multiple polls consistently show Trump with a larger lead over his opponent compared to Scott's margin. The most recent data shows Trump leading by 8 points while Scott leads by 4 points, suggesting Trump may receive a higher percentage of votes in Florida than Scott on Election Day.
