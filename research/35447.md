# Forecasting Whether Trump Will Mention "Trudeau" in March 4, 2025 Congressional Address

Based on information available as of February 25, 2025, I've analyzed the likelihood of President Donald Trump mentioning "Trudeau" during his upcoming address to a joint session of Congress.

## Current Status of the Joint Session Address

On January 25, 2025, House Speaker Mike Johnson formally invited President Donald Trump to address a joint session of Congress on March 4, 2025[1][2]. This will be Trump's first address to a joint session in his second term, following his return to office in January 2025[4]. In his invitation letter, Speaker Johnson invited Trump to "share your America First vision for our legislative future"[2] and praised the president's "strong leadership and bold action in the first days of your presidency"[1].

As of the date of the invitation, the White House had not yet formally accepted, though Trump was expected to confirm his March 4 address[3]. The planned address is intended to outline Trump's vision and agenda early in his second term, before delivering State of the Union addresses in subsequent years[4].

## Factors Relevant to Mentioning Trudeau

The available information does not specifically indicate whether President Trump plans to mention Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau in his address. The invitation letter and related news coverage focus on domestic priorities, with Speaker Johnson emphasizing an "America First vision" and noting that Republicans are charting "an ambitious legislative agenda that's expected to address border security, energy and taxes, among other things"[4].

## Historical Context and Limitations

The search results do not provide information about:

1. Any recent interactions between President Trump and Prime Minister Trudeau as of early 2025
2. The specific planned content of Trump's March 4 address
3. Whether foreign policy regarding Canada will be a focus of the speech
4. Historical patterns of Trump mentioning foreign leaders in congressional addresses during his previous term

## Verification Sources

If the address occurs as scheduled, the American Presidency Project (presidency.ucsb.edu) will be the authoritative source for verifying whether Trump mentions "Trudeau" during his speech, as specified in the resolution criteria[2]. This source has already documented the invitation letter from Speaker Johnson.

## Measurement Uncertainties

Several uncertainties exist that could affect the forecast:

1. The address might be rescheduled or canceled for unforeseen reasons
2. The speech content is likely still being developed as of February 2025
3. Current U.S.-Canada relations and any diplomatic developments between now and March 4 could influence speech content
4. Last-minute changes to the speech could occur based on emerging events

Based on the limited information available before February 25, 2025, there is insufficient evidence to make a strong prediction about whether President Trump will specifically mention "Trudeau" during his March 4 address to Congress.
