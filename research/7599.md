## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of October 2021, the United States was party to six major mutual defense treaties: the Rio Treaty (Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance), North Atlantic Treaty (NATO), ANZUS Treaty (with Australia and New Zealand), and bilateral defense treaties with the Philippines, South Korea, and Japan[1][2].
- Historically, the US has maintained these alliances as pillars of its global security strategy. Withdrawal from such treaties has been rare; the main precedent is the US exit from SEATO in 1977, which followed the withdrawal of key partners and the treaty's effective obsolescence.

## 2. Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Metric (2021–2024)

- **NATO:** The US has reaffirmed its commitment to NATO despite occasional political rhetoric questioning its value. No credible process for withdrawal has been initiated by the US government, and alliance cohesion has increased in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022.
- **Rio Treaty:** The treaty remains in force, but its operational significance is limited. No major US policy moves indicate an imminent withdrawal.
- **ANZUS Treaty:** The ANZUS alliance has been strengthened in recent years, particularly due to increased cooperation with Australia amid concerns about China's regional assertiveness.
- **Bilateral Defense Treaties (Philippines, South Korea, Japan):** All three remain active. In particular, the US-Philippines alliance has been repeatedly reaffirmed in response to Chinese activity in the South China Sea. Joint military exercises and high-level commitments have increased through 2024[3].
- As of late 2024, US officials have explicitly described their commitment to the defense of treaty partners—especially the Philippines—as "ironclad," and ongoing joint exercises underscore alliance durability[3].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- US Department of State: Treaties in Force[1]
- US Department of State: Collective Defense Arrangements[2]
- News reports and official statements regarding US defense treaties, particularly with the Philippines, South Korea, and Japan[3].

## 4. Key Differences Affecting the Forecast

- **External Threat Environment:** Compared to the late Cold War or immediate post-Cold War periods, the current environment is characterized by rising strategic competition with China and Russia, both of whom threaten US allies in Asia and Europe. This has reinforced, rather than weakened, US alliance commitments.
- **Domestic Political Signals:** While some US political figures (notably former President Trump) have questioned alliance costs, bipartisan consensus since 2021 has supported alliance maintenance, especially in light of Russia’s war in Ukraine and China’s assertiveness.
- **Alliance Dependence:** US partners (Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, Australia, NATO allies) are increasingly reliant on US security guarantees in the face of rising regional threats, and have taken steps to deepen cooperation.
- **Legal and Procedural Barriers:** Withdrawal from these treaties would require significant political and bureaucratic action, including formal notifications and, in some cases, Congressional involvement.

## 5. Limitations and Uncertainties

- The forecast depends on the continuity of US domestic politics and global security trends. A dramatic political shift in the US or an unforeseen global crisis could alter current trajectories.
- The definition of "withdrawal" includes both formal exit and de facto abandonment via suspension of support for a full year; while some allies have expressed concerns over US reliability, there is no evidence as of 2024 that such a threshold has been met or is likely to be.

## 6. Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the above, the probability that the United States will withdraw from any of its current mutual defense treaties (as defined) by 2030 remains low, likely below 10%. The strategic environment and recent alliance behavior both point toward continued US engagement. While Peter Zeihan’s thesis highlights potential retrenchment, actual policy and alliance dynamics since 2021 have moved in the opposite direction, especially in Europe and Asia[3].
