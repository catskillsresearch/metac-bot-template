## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The US frac spread count, which tracks the number of crews actively performing hydraulic fracturing, has been on a downward trend through 2024 and into early 2025. For example, the count was 242 in July 2024, down 18 from the previous year and down 30 from its recent peak[5].
- As of the week ending February 28, 2025, the frac spread count stood at 214, reflecting this ongoing decline.
- The US oil rig count has also decreased, with notable drops in major basins such as the Permian, Anadarko, and Bakken during 2024 and early 2025[1][3]. Lower rig counts often signal reduced future frac activity.

## Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Metric

- The startup of the Matterhorn Express Pipeline in late 2024 was expected to support Waha gas prices and narrow the frac spread, leading to less ethane extraction and potentially reducing frac activity in the short term[3].
- No major new policies or market shocks affecting frac activity have been reported as of early 2025.

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The American Oil & Gas Reporter maintains a tracking page for the US frac spread count, which is considered the resolution source for this metric.
- Primary Vision provides the underlying frac spread data, widely cited in industry analysis[2].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- The frac spread count is a weekly estimate and may be subject to revision.
- Short-term fluctuations can occur due to weather, maintenance, or operational changes.
- Broader market dynamics, such as oil and gas prices or unexpected policy shifts, could affect activity levels.

## Forecast for Week Ending March 28, 2025

Given the count was 214 at the end of February 2025 and the trend is downward, the most likely range for the US frac spread count for the week ending March 28, 2025 is:

**211-219**

This range reflects a stable to slightly declining activity level, consistent with recent trends and absent any major new developments.
