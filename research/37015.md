# Han Duck-soo's Potential Presidential Candidacy

As of April 22, 2025, there is significant speculation about whether Acting President Han Duck-soo will announce his candidacy for the South Korean presidential election scheduled for June 3, 2025. Here's a comprehensive analysis of the available information:

## Current Status and Historical Context

Han Duck-soo currently serves as South Korea's Acting President and Prime Minister[4][5]. He has emerged as a potential presidential candidate despite not having formally declared his candidacy[4]. The People Power Party (PPP) primary for the June 3 presidential election has already begun, with eight contenders participating in the first debate on April 18, 2025[1].

If Han decides to run, he faces a critical deadline: May 3, 2025, which is the legal cutoff for office-holding candidates to resign[1]. Since the registration period for the PPP primary has closed, Han would need to run as an independent candidate rather than through the party's nomination process[1].

## Recent Developments

Several significant developments have occurred in recent weeks:

**Growing Political Support:**
- A sizable subset of PPP lawmakers have been advocating for Han to run for president[1]
- Approximately 30 of the party's 108 lawmakers have expressed support for his potential candidacy[5]
- PPP floor leader Kweon Seong-dong publicly welcomed the scenario on April 11, suggesting Han's participation could boost public interest in the party's upcoming convention[4]
- PPP officials from the southwestern Honam region held a press conference urging Han to run, citing his economic and national security expertise[5]

**Public Support:**
- On April 22, 2025, a group of civic leaders formally called on Han to enter the presidential race[2]
- A Realmeter poll showed Han ranking as the second-most competitive conservative challenger to Democratic Party frontrunner Lee Jae-myung[3]

**Han's Own Statements:**
- Han reportedly told US President Donald Trump during a 28-minute phone call that he was "considering (the matter) due to several demands and the (current) situation," though he added that nothing had been decided[4]
- An official from the prime minister's office declined to confirm details of this conversation, stating that "it is difficult to reveal the specifics of diplomatic talks between two heads of state"[4]
- Han reportedly told aides he would remain focused on state affairs, though speculation suggests he is seriously considering a bid[5]

## Political Considerations

Han possesses unique cross-party appeal that distinguishes him from other potential conservative candidates:

- He has worked for presidents from both sides of the political spectrum, including serving as prime minister for the late President Roh Moo-hyun of the Democratic Party[1]
- He was born and raised in Jeonju, North Jeolla Province, a region where voters typically support the Democratic Party[1]
- According to a PPP insider, Han already has the support of Democratic Party of Korea elders[1]
- His potential to reach both middle-ground and liberal-leaning voters is considered a quality that other PPP candidates lack[1]

## Obstacles and Uncertainties

Several obstacles could affect Han's decision:

- Political insiders note it would be difficult for him to step down as acting president simply to enter the race while the presidency remains vacant[5]
- There are growing calls within the Democratic Party to impeach Han, though these have not yet materialized into formal action[5]
- Democratic Party lawmaker Jeong Seong-ho has stated, "At this point, we have no choice but to impeach him," suggesting an impeachment motion followed by resignation remains a possibility[5]

## Authoritative Sources

The information above comes from several reputable South Korean news sources:
- The Korea Herald (articles from April 11 and April 18, 2025)
- The Chosun Daily (articles from April 11 and April 22, 2025)
- Realmeter polling data (referenced in KoreaPro analysis from April 14, 2025)

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors limit our ability to predict Han's decision:
- Han has not made any definitive public statement about his intentions
- The political calculus is complex, involving considerations about the vacant presidency
- The deadline of May 3 creates a narrow window for decision-making
- The potential impact of an impeachment threat remains unclear
- Han's personal deliberations are not fully transparent to the public

Given these factors, while there is significant momentum building for Han's candidacy, his final decision remains uncertain as of April 22, 2025.
