# Will Han Duck-soo Announce His Presidential Candidacy Before May 5, 2025?

As of April 22, 2025, Acting President Han Duck-soo has not formally declared his candidacy for the upcoming South Korean presidential election scheduled for June 3, 2025. However, there are several indicators and developments that provide insight into the likelihood of his announcement before May 5.

## Current Political Context

South Korea is preparing for a presidential election on June 3, 2025, with the People Power Party (PPP) primary having already begun in mid-April[1]. While Han Duck-soo did not join the PPP's primary race, the window for his presidential run remains open until May 3, 2025, which is the legal deadline for office-holding candidates to resign[1]. Since the registration for the party's primary is closed, if Han decides to run, he would need to do so as an independent candidate[1].

Han currently serves as both Prime Minister and Acting President of South Korea, putting him in a unique position of visibility and influence during this pre-election period[4]. At 75 years old, Han has extensive political experience, having worked across the political spectrum, including serving as prime minister under the late President Roh Moo-hyun of the Democratic Party[1].

## Growing Support for Han's Candidacy

There is significant and increasing pressure on Han to enter the presidential race:

1. **Within the PPP**: A sizable subset of People Power Party lawmakers have been advocating for Han to run for president[1]. According to reports, approximately 30 of the party's 108 lawmakers have expressed support for his potential candidacy[5]. PPP floor leader Kweon Seong-dong has publicly welcomed the scenario, suggesting that Han's participation as a conservative candidate could boost public interest in the party's upcoming convention[4].

2. **Regional Support**: PPP officials from the southwestern Honam region held a press conference at the National Assembly, urging Han to run in the presidential election[5]. This is particularly notable as Han was born and raised in Jeonju, North Jeolla Province, a region where voters typically support the Democratic Party[1].

3. **Civic Leaders**: On April 22, 2025, a group of civic leaders in South Korea called on Han to enter the presidential race, describing him as the only viable candidate[2].

## Polling and Electoral Viability

A Realmeter poll has positioned Han as the second-most competitive conservative challenger to Democratic Party frontrunner Lee Jae-myung[3]. Political analysts suggest that Han has the potential to appeal to both middle-ground and liberal-leaning votersâ€”a quality that other PPP candidates reportedly lack[1]. According to a PPP insider who spoke anonymously to The Korea Herald, Han already has support from Democratic Party of Korea elders[1].

## Han's Own Indications

While Han has not made a formal announcement, there are signs he may be considering a run:

1. **Reported Conversation with US President**: Han reportedly told US President Trump during a 28-minute phone call that he was "considering (the matter) due to several demands and the (current) situation," though he added that nothing had been decided yet[4]. An official from the prime minister's office declined to confirm the specifics of this conversation[4].

2. **Public Statements**: On April 8, Han confirmed June 3 as the date for the early presidential election during a Cabinet meeting, instructing ministers to ensure thorough preparations[5]. While this could be interpreted as him fulfilling his duties as Acting President, it also positions him as a leader during this transition period.

3. **Mixed Signals**: Despite growing calls for his candidacy, Han reportedly told aides he would remain focused on state affairs[5]. However, there is speculation that he is seriously considering a bid[5].

## Potential Obstacles

There are several complications that could affect Han's decision:

1. **Dual Role Concerns**: Political insiders note it would be difficult for Han to step down as acting president simply to enter the race while the presidency remains vacant[5].

2. **Impeachment Threats**: There are growing calls within the Democratic Party to impeach Han, though these have not yet materialized into formal action[5]. Democratic Party lawmaker Jeong Seong-ho stated, "At this point, we have no choice but to impeach him," suggesting that an impeachment motion followed by resignation remains a possibility[5].

## Conclusion

As of April 22, 2025, Han Duck-soo has not announced his candidacy for the South Korean presidency. While there is substantial and growing support for him to run, with the legal deadline (May 3) approaching, he has not made his intentions clear. His reported comments to US President Trump suggest he is at least considering a bid, but there are significant political complications involved with his current role as Acting President. The period between April 22 and May 5 will be critical for his decision-making process.
