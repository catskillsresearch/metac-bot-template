Based on the most current information available, I can provide the following analysis to help forecast whether the Artemis Accords will have 55 signatories by July 1, 2025.

## Current Status and Recent Growth

The Artemis Accords have already reached 55 signatories as of May 15, 2025, when Norway became the 55th nation to sign the agreement[1]. This represents significant growth from previous milestones:

- December 2024: 50 signatories (with Austria and Panama joining)[4][5]
- January 2025: 53 signatories[2]
- April 8, 2025: 54 signatories (with Bangladesh joining, as mentioned in the question)
- May 15, 2025: 55 signatories (with Norway joining)[1]

The growth rate of signatories has been steady, with 15 countries joining in 2024 alone[4]. This demonstrates continuing international interest in the principles outlined in the Accords.

## Forecast Analysis

Given that the Artemis Accords have already reached 55 signatories as of May 15, 2025, the forecast question has effectively been answered. The Accords will have at least 55 signatories on July 1, 2025, barring any unprecedented withdrawals from the agreement (which is not indicated as a possibility in any available information).

Furthermore, there are indications that additional nations may join in the near future. For example, in December 2024, NASA Administrator Bill Nelson stated to expect "several more" nations to join over "the next few weeks"[5]. While this statement was made several months ago, it indicates ongoing diplomatic efforts to expand participation in the Accords.

## Key Factors Supporting Continued Growth

Several factors contribute to the continued expansion of Artemis Accords signatories:

1. **Bipartisan Support in the United States**: The Accords have maintained continuity across multiple U.S. administrations. NASA Administrator Bill Nelson described the Accords as a "relay race" that has woven "a continuous thread through administrations despite political differences"[5].

2. **International Cooperation Framework**: The Accords provide a framework for peaceful and sustainable exploration of space, reinforcing principles from the 1967 Outer Space Treaty while adding specificity to rules governing lunar exploration and off-world resource utilization[4].

3. **Growing International Interest**: The Accords have attracted "established and emerging spacefaring nations from every region of the world"[3], indicating broad global appeal.

## Conclusion

Based on the available evidence, the Artemis Accords will have at least 55 signatories on July 1, 2025, as they have already reached this threshold as of May 15, 2025. The question's resolution criteria of "55 (or more) signatories on July 1, 2025" has already been satisfied, and there is no indication of any factors that would reduce this number before the specified date.
