# Marijuana's Status as a Schedule I Controlled Substance: Forecast for December 31, 2024

Based on the available information as of November 2024, this analysis examines whether marijuana will remain classified as a Schedule I controlled substance by the end of 2024.

## Current Status and Rescheduling Process

As of November 2024, marijuana remains classified as a Schedule I controlled substance under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). However, a formal process to potentially reschedule it to Schedule III is currently underway. This process began approximately seven months prior to November 2024, when the Justice Department formally proposed moving cannabis from Schedule I to Schedule III following a scientific review[4].

The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has scheduled formal hearing proceedings regarding the proposed rescheduling of marijuana to begin on December 2, 2024[1]. It's important to note that this initial hearing is described as a "preliminary hearing" that will "serve as a procedural day to address legal and logistical issues and discuss future dates for the evidentiary hearing on the merits"[1]. No witness testimony will be offered or received during this preliminary hearing.

## Timeline and Procedural Delays

The timeline for the rescheduling process has already experienced delays. According to an order filed by DEA Chief Administrative Law Judge John Mulrooney II, in-person testimony in the DEA's marijuana rescheduling hearing will not begin until early 2025, specifically January or February[3]. The judge has requested further clarification from participants regarding their positions and how they "would be sufficiently 'adversely affected or aggrieved' by the proposed scheduling action to qualify as an 'interested person' under the [federal] regulations"[3].

Industry experts acknowledge that the rescheduling process is inherently time-consuming. Paul Armentano, deputy director for NORML, stated that "it's always been a possibility that this process could drag out longer than many either anticipated or would like... The administrative process is cumbersome and, as we have seen historically, administrative challenges to marijuana's Schedule I status take years to resolve"[4].

## Forecast for December 31, 2024

Given the current timeline and procedural requirements, it appears highly unlikely that marijuana will be rescheduled from Schedule I to Schedule III by December 31, 2024. The evidentiary hearings that would substantively address the merits of rescheduling are not scheduled to begin until early 2025[3][4]. Following these hearings, the DEA would still need to make a final determination and implement any changes through formal rulemaking procedures[5].

The rescheduling process involves multiple steps, including:
1. DEA determination on whether to reschedule marijuana
2. Initiation of rulemaking or issuance of an order to reschedule
3. Implementation of the new scheduling classification[5]

## Conclusion

Based on the information available as of November 2024, marijuana will most likely still be listed as a Schedule I controlled substance on December 31, 2024. The formal evidentiary hearings necessary for rescheduling will not even begin until early 2025, making it procedurally impossible for the rescheduling to be completed before the end of 2024.
