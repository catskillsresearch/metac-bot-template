# Google's Global Search Engine Market Share Forecast for January 2025

Based on available data as of January 29, 2025, here's an analysis to help forecast Google's global search engine market share for January 2025 according to StatCounter.

## Recent Historical Trends

Google's global search engine market share has shown a notable downward trend in recent months:

- October 2024: 89.34%
- November 2024: 89.99%
- December 2024: 89.73%[1][5]

This marks the first time since 2015 that Google's search market share has fallen below 90% for three consecutive months. The last similar period occurred in early 2015 when Google's share was 89.62% in January, 89.47% in February, and 89.52% in March of that year.[1]

## Current Status (January 2025)

For January 2025 specifically, we have the following data points:

- Google's global mobile search engine market share was 93.82% in January 2025[3]
- This represents a decline from approximately 95.8% in mobile search share from the previous year[4]

It's important to note that mobile search is just one component of the overall search market, though an increasingly significant one.

## Regional Variations

The search market share varies by region:

- In Europe, Google had approximately 89.46% market share (based on data from March 2024 to April 2025)[2]
- In the United States, Google's search market share peaked at 90.37% in November 2024 but fell to 87.39% in December 2024[5]
- Asia appears to be a significant contributor to Google's overall global market share decline[1][5]

## Factors Affecting Market Share

Several factors may be influencing Google's search market share:

1. **Regional competition**: Particularly in Asia, where alternatives like Baidu (China) and Yandex (Russia, with 2.5% global mobile search share) maintain significant presence[3]

2. **Competitor growth**: Bing has shown modest growth, increasing from 3.37% to 3.97% global market share over the past year[4]

3. **Potential shift to AI search engines**: Though not directly measured in the StatCounter data, users may be turning to AI-powered alternatives like ChatGPT Search and Perplexity[5]

## Limitations and Uncertainties

When forecasting Google's January 2025 global search market share, consider these limitations:

1. StatCounter's methodology primarily tracks traditional search engines and may not fully capture emerging AI-powered search alternatives[5]

2. Regional data should be approached with caution as noted by StatCounter themselves[3]

3. The data shows three consecutive months below 90%, establishing what appears to be a trend rather than an anomaly[1]

4. Mobile search (93.82% Google share) and overall search metrics differ significantly, with mobile showing higher Google dominance[3][4]

## Forecast Considerations

Based on the available data, a reasonable forecast for Google's January 2025 global search engine market share would need to account for:

1. The established three-month trend below 90% (89.34% - 89.99%)
2. The higher mobile search share of 93.82% for January 2025
3. Regional variations, particularly weakness in Asian markets
4. The overall year-on-year decline from 91.62% to 89.74%

Given these factors, Google's January 2025 global search market share is likely to remain in line with the recent sub-90% trend, potentially between 89-90%, unless there was a significant market disruption in January 2025.
