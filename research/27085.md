## Key Factual Information as of August 9, 2024

**1. ICC Prosecutor’s Application for Arrest Warrant**
- On May 20, 2024, ICC Prosecutor Karim A.A. Khan announced he had filed applications for arrest warrants against Benjamin Netanyahu (Prime Minister of Israel) and Yoav Gallant (Minister of Defence), alleging responsibility for war crimes and crimes against humanity in Gaza from at least October 8, 2023[1][3].
- The specific alleged crimes include starvation of civilians, attacks directed at civilians, wilful killing, and causing great suffering, as well as crimes against humanity such as extermination and persecution[3].

**2. ICC Procedure and Current Status**
- The Prosecutor’s application is a formal request to the ICC’s Pre-Trial Chamber, which must review the evidence and decide whether to issue an arrest warrant. This process can take several weeks or months[1].
- As of August 9, 2024, there is no public record or official ICC announcement that an arrest warrant has been issued for Benjamin Netanyahu. The ICC’s official defendant page for Netanyahu lists the application and charges but does not indicate that a warrant has been issued[4].
- The ICC’s official news releases and case records are the authoritative sources for such developments.

**3. International Political Context**
- There has been intense international lobbying, particularly from the US and G7 countries, to dissuade the ICC from issuing arrest warrants for Israeli officials, citing concerns about the impact on peace negotiations and regional stability[3].

**4. Historical Trends**
- The ICC has issued 42 arrest warrants since its founding in 2002, including high-profile cases such as the warrant for Vladimir Putin in 2023[1].
- The time from application to issuance of a warrant varies, but it is not immediate and is subject to judicial review.

**5. Limitations and Uncertainties**
- The ICC process is not bound to a fixed timeline and can be influenced by legal complexity and political considerations.
- Secret warrants would only count if publicly and officially disclosed before September 30, 2024, per the resolution criteria.

## Authoritative Sources for Verification
- ICC official news releases and defendant pages[1][4]
- Major international news organizations reporting on ICC proceedings[3]
