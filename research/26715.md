## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- **No engineered pandemic has yet infected one billion people:** The largest historical pandemic, COVID-19, is estimated to have infected over 700 million people, but was a naturally emerging virus, not engineered.
- **Expert risk estimates vary:** Toby Ord's 2020 estimate for existential catastrophe via engineered pandemic is ~1 in 30 over the next century. This risk is seen as much higher than for naturally arising pandemics, but still low on a per-year basis, and even lower for the specific scenario of one billion infections as opposed to existential catastrophe[1].
- **Growing concerns over AI/biotech convergence:** Recent studies and commentary highlight that AI, particularly large language models, can now assist in the design or synthesis of pathogens, potentially lowering barriers for malicious actors. This trend has accelerated concern in the field of existential risk[4].

## 2. Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Metric

- **Institutional risk management efforts are expanding:** The Cambridge Engineered Pandemics Risk Management Program was launched in 2024 to address social, biological, and policy factors influencing engineered pandemic risk, focusing on both technical and governance responses[1][3].
- **Reports stress rising risk but also preparedness:** The 2024 “Changing Face of Pandemic Risk” report highlights increased pandemic threat due to global interconnectedness, urbanization, and technological advances, but also outlines coordinated international efforts to increase resilience and preparedness[5].
- **Policy innovation is ongoing:** There is a growing emphasis on cross-disciplinary, policy-engaged research and international cooperation to manage pandemic threats, including those potentially exacerbated by AI[1].

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- **AGI timelines are highly uncertain:** The forecast hinges on when AGI will actually arrive, which is itself deeply contested and uncertain.
- **AI-bio risk interaction is rapidly evolving:** While AI capabilities are growing, current large language models cannot (yet) fully enable creation of novel, highly infectious pathogens; future AGI could change this, but the scale and timing are unknown.
- **Preparedness is improving but uneven:** Global investments in pandemic prevention, response, and surveillance are increasing, but vulnerabilities remain, particularly in politically unstable or resource-limited regions.
- **Measurement of "one billion infected":** Requires credible reporting and confirmation that a synthetic biological agent, as defined, has infected this many people—a high bar for both detection and attribution.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given:

- No precedent for engineered pandemics at this scale.
- Rising but still (historically) rare occurrence of pandemics infecting >1 billion.
- Significant but uncertain acceleration of risk post-AGI, especially if democratization of biotech is not matched by global safeguards.
- Ongoing, intensifying policy and preparedness efforts.

**A reasonable forecast is that the probability of an engineered pandemic infecting one billion people within five years of AGI is low but not negligible—likely in the 1–5% range, conditional on the arrival of AGI.** This is higher than historical base rates, reflecting concerns about AI-bio risk convergence, but lower than catastrophic risk estimates, given improving global defenses and the lack of precedent for such rapid, large-scale outbreaks[1][4][5].
