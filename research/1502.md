## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Historically, global catastrophes from biological causes have been rare, with the 1918 influenza pandemic being a major reference point for a naturally occurring event that spread globally and caused severe mortality, but still fell short of the 10% global population loss threshold[4].
- 20th-century bioweapons programs by states did not result in global catastrophes, largely due to deterrence, technical challenges, and international treaties (e.g., the Biological Weapons Convention)[4].
- As of 2018, advances in biotechnology (including synthetic biology, gene editing, and gene drives) have rapidly increased the capacity to engineer pathogens with potentially catastrophic traits—specifically, combining high transmissibility, lethality, and resistance to treatment, which are rarely found together in nature[1][2][3].
- Falling costs and increased accessibility of gene synthesis and genome editing tools (such as CRISPR) mean that more actors—both state and non-state—can create or modify organisms with pandemic potential[1][2][3].

## 2. Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Metric

- Ongoing international frameworks, such as the Biological Weapons Convention, continue to regulate and attempt to prevent the development and use of biological weapons, but enforcement is variable and challenged by the proliferation of dual-use technologies[1].
- Increased biosafety and biosecurity measures have been recommended and, in some cases, implemented, but the global expansion of high-risk pathogen research labs increases the risk of accidental release, especially in regions with weaker regulatory oversight[1][3].
- Leading analysts and policy organizations (e.g., NTI, Effective Altruism) have issued growing calls for prioritizing the mitigation of catastrophic biological risks, both deliberate (bioweapons/bioterrorism) and accidental (lab escapes, gene drive releases)[3][4].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Humanitarian Futures' 2018 Global Catastrophic Risks report details how synthetic biology and genetic engineering lower the barriers to creating novel, potentially catastrophic pathogens, and highlights the increased risk posed by both accidental and deliberate release[1].
- The Nuclear Threat Initiative (NTI) outlines the growing risk of global catastrophic biological events due to technological advances, increased capability, and state/non-state interest in biological weapons, as well as the risks of accidental release from research labs[3].
- Effective Altruism's 2018 analysis, as well as other recent risk assessments, emphasize the difficulty in quantifying probabilities but agree that the convergence of technological progress and increased actor capability has substantially raised the risk profile of bioengineered organisms as a source of global catastrophe[4].
- Additional scientific literature and risk analyses (e.g., Gryphon Scientific's report on gain-of-function research) have estimated non-trivial annual probabilities (ranging from 0.002% to 0.8% per year) for accidental pandemics resulting from advanced biological research, with global applicability[4].

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties in Measurement

- Secrecy and incomplete data on state bioweapons programs and private research hinder precise risk estimation.
- The pace of technological diffusion, and the effectiveness of international controls and safety measures, are uncertain and may change rapidly.
- The emergence of catastrophic pathogens through natural evolution, though possible, is considered less likely to combine worst-case traits than through deliberate engineering[1][2][3][4].
- Indirect risks (e.g., ecological collapse via gene drives) are harder to model and attribute, and may also interact with other global stressors.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the above, the probability that a global biological catastrophe before 2100 (as defined) would be due principally to the deployment of biotechnology or bioengineered organisms is higher than for natural pandemics or other biological causes, primarily due to:

- The capacity to engineer organisms with combinations of catastrophic traits not seen in nature.
- The increasing number of actors capable of deploying such technologies.
- Persistent challenges in global governance, oversight, and enforcement.

While the absolute annual risk is low, the cumulative probability over the century is non-trivial and rising. If a biological global catastrophe occurs before 2100, the most likely cause, compared to historical cases, will be biotechnology or bioengineered organisms, either by deliberate deployment or accidental release, rather than purely natural emergence.
