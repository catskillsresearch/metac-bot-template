### 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- In previous elections (2019, 2020), MAS dominated, but the party is now deeply divided between Morales and Arce factions[5].
- President Luis Arce, elected in 2020, has withdrawn from the 2025 race due to poor polling and a severe economic crisis, further weakening MAS[5].
- Evo Morales's candidacy is contested due to a court ruling barring third terms; he is attempting to run, potentially under a new party if not MAS[5].
- Polls for June 2025 show a fragmented field, with no candidate approaching the 40% threshold required to win outright[2].

### 2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- Arce's withdrawal ("I will not be a factor in dividing the popular vote") has left MAS without a clear front-runner[5].
- Morales's legal status is unresolved; if he runs, he will not do so as the MAS standard-bearer[5].
- Polls indicate rising support for centrists and right-leaning candidates, with both Samuel Doria Medina (Unidad Nacional/UN) and Jorge Quiroga (Libre) polling above 18%[2].

### 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The most recent polls (June 2025) show:
  - Jorge Quiroga (Libre): 22.1% (SPIE/El Deber, June 2025), 18.4% (Ipsos CIESMORI/UNITEL, May 2025)[2].
  - Samuel Doria Medina (UN): 24.0% (SPIE/El Deber), 19.1% (Ipsos)[2].
  - Andrónico Rodríguez (MAS): 14.7% and 14.2%[2].
  - Manfred Reyes Villa: 9.4% and 7.9%[2].
  - Eva Copa and Eduardo del Castillo: Low single digits[2].
- Large shares of undecided/blank/void votes (10–15%) remain[2].

### 4. Limitations or Uncertainties

- Morales's legal situation is unresolved; his candidacy could still alter the race, though current polling suggests his support is diminished[5].
- High undecided and blank/void rates mean late shifts are possible[2].
- Bolivian polling has limitations, especially in rural areas and among indigenous voters.

### Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Based on the latest polling and the persistent MAS split, the most likely first-round leader is Samuel Doria Medina or Jorge Quiroga. Of the candidates listed in the question, **Jorge Quiroga** is polling highest and is most likely to receive the most votes in the first round, though the margin is narrow and uncertainty remains high. If either Medina or another non-listed candidate wins the first round, or if the first round is not held before September 1, 2025, the correct answer would be **"Another outcome"**.

#### Probabilistic Estimate (as of 2025-06-24)
- Jorge Quiroga: ~40%
- Another outcome (e.g., Samuel Doria Medina or logistical disruption): ~40%
- Andrónico Rodríguez, Reyes Villa, or others: lower probability (<15% each)
- Evo Morales, Eva Copa, Eduardo del Castillo: very low probability (<5% each, due to polling and legal status)
