## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Nancy Pelosi's stock portfolio has a strong track record of outperforming the S&P 500. In 2023, her portfolio reportedly returned nearly 65%, almost tripling the S&P 500's 24% return for that year[1][3].
- In 2024, Pelosi continued to generate significant gains. By October 2024, she had reportedly made over $23 million through strategic investments, with her portfolio buoyed by timely bets on technology stocks, particularly Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Amazon (AMZN)[2][4].
- As of March 2024, her largest holding was Nvidia (21% of her portfolio), which had gained 95.75% since the start of the year. Other major holdings like Microsoft and Amazon also posted double-digit gains, while Apple (AAPL) and Tesla (TSLA) underperformed, with Apple down 7% and Tesla down 31% in the first quarter[2].
- Pelosi made notable trades in 2024, including a large purchase of Broadcom (AVGO) options in June and a well-timed acquisition of Palo Alto Networks (PANW) shares in February. She also exited her Tesla position during the summer after sustained losses[4].

## Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Metric

- Pelosi's portfolio remains heavily weighted toward technology and AI-related stocks, sectors that have driven much of the broader market's gains in 2024[2][4].
- Her trades are closely watched and often mirrored by other investors, but there is no evidence of major policy changes or regulatory developments directly affecting her portfolio's composition or reporting in 2024.

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Quiver Quantitative provides real-time tracking and 12-month total return data for Nancy Pelosi's portfolio, which is the specified source for resolution[2].
- Yahoo Finance is the authoritative source for S&P 500 historical prices and total return calculations, as required by the resolution criteria.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- As of the knowledge cutoff (December 2, 2024), final year-end returns for both Pelosi's portfolio and the S&P 500 are not available. The outcome will depend on market movements in December, which can be volatile.
- Pelosi's portfolio is concentrated in high-growth technology stocks, which can experience significant price swings, especially at year-end.
- The S&P 500 itself had a strong year in 2024, driven by similar tech sector gains, so the margin of outperformance may be narrower than in 2023.
- All performance figures are based on estimates and partial-year data; actual returns may differ once all trades and dividends are accounted for.

## Conclusion

Based on available data up to December 2, 2024, Nancy Pelosi's stock portfolio continued to perform strongly in 2024, driven by large positions in high-performing technology stocks. While her portfolio outperformed the S&P 500 by a wide margin in 2023 and showed substantial gains through October 2024, the final outcome for the full year remains uncertain without December data. The resolution will depend on the final 12-month total returns as reported by Quiver Quantitative and Yahoo Finance after the last trading day of December 2024.
