## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- **AGI Timelines**: As of early 2025, expert consensus has shifted toward expecting AGI between 2027 and 2032, with some notable forecasts as early as 2026 and a significant minority expecting it before 2030[1][2][4][5]. This represents a marked acceleration in AGI timelines compared to earlier decades.
- **Mind Uploading Progress**: No credible reports exist of successful human mind uploading or even full mammalian brain emulation. The most authoritative roadmap (Sandberg & Bostrom) highlights the immense gap between current brain mapping/modeling capabilities and the requirements for whole brain emulation[1].
- **Technical Requirements**: Mind uploading requires:
  - Non-destructive or destructive, high-resolution brain scanning at a synaptic level;
  - Accurate modeling of neural and glial activity;
  - Sufficient computational power to support real-time simulation of a human brain;
  - Reliable methods to verify psychological continuity in the digital substrate.
  None of these milestones have been achieved, and progress remains incremental.

## 2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- **AI Company Statements**: Leaders at DeepMind, OpenAI, and others have publicly mused about AGI leading to radical scientific advances, including possibly extending to fields like neuroscience and consciousness studies. However, there are no announced, funded initiatives or technical roadmaps targeting human mind uploading within five years of AGI[1][2].
- **Policy and Regulatory Environment**: Increased scrutiny and discussion of AI safety and bioethics have emerged alongside AGI progress. There are growing calls for oversight, especially for any research that could impact human identity or consciousness, which would likely apply to mind uploading efforts[2][3].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Metaculus forecasts and expert surveys on AGI timelines[1][2].
- The Sandberg & Bostrom "Whole Brain Emulation Roadmap" for technical requirements and progress benchmarks.
- Press releases and credible media reports from AI labs and neuroscience consortia (none currently report mind uploading).
- Government and institutional policy statements on AI and neurotechnology oversight.

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- **Definition and Measurement**: The question requires three credible media reports of whole human brain uploading, with preserved psychological continuity. This is a high evidentiary bar, and ambiguous cases defer to expert panels.
- **Technical Uncertainty**: Even with AGI, unknowns remain about how quickly the technical hurdles of brain scanning, modeling, and simulation can be solved—especially given the lack of current proof-of-concept.
- **Societal and Ethical Barriers**: Consent, risk, and societal acceptance may slow or prevent early human mind uploading experiments, even if technically feasible.
- **AGI Impact**: While AGI may accelerate neuroscience, it is not guaranteed to prioritize or solve mind uploading within five years, especially given other pressing global challenges.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given current trends:
- AGI arrival by 2030 is plausible, but not certain.
- Human mind uploading remains a speculative technology, with no direct technical pathway demonstrated or funded.
- Even with the full technical support of AGI, overcoming the biological, computational, and ethical challenges of mind uploading within five years seems highly unlikely.

**Adjusted probability estimate (conditional on AGI by 2030 and no human extinction):**
- The probability that human mind uploading (as defined) will have occurred within five years after AGI is **very low (<5%)**—barring unforeseen breakthroughs or societal shifts not currently in evidence.
