## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- **2017 marked the peak Google Trends interest** in "Effective Altruism," after rapid growth from 2013[5].
- **Post-2017:** Search interest dropped from its peak and stabilized around 2015 levels. This implies a decline but not a collapse; the relative baseline remained measurable and steady through at least 2020[5][2].
- **Community and organizational growth continued:** Despite flat search trends, EA organizations reported sustained or growing activity, membership, and funding through 2020[3]. This suggests that search interest is a partial proxy for engagement.

## 2. Recent Announcements or Policies Affecting the Metric

- **Active promotion:** EA organizations have continued to prioritize growth and outreach[5].
- **No major controversies or rebranding** are reported as of 2018 that would drastically alter search terms or public visibility.
- **Digital behavior shift:** Increasing direct navigation to EA forums and websites, as well as engagement via other channels, may reduce Google search activity without indicating reduced interest[5].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- **Google Trends:** The official tool for search interest data[4]. The 2017 data is publicly available and can be re-queried for benchmarks.
- **Metaculus:** Forecasting platform with a dedicated question and community forecast, as of November 2018, estimating a 79% chance that 2030 interest will be at least 0.2x 2017 levels[1].
- **Effective Altruism Forum and LessWrong:** Both provide historical analyses and visualizations of EA’s Google Trends data, confirming the post-2017 decline and plateau[2][5].
- **80000 Hours:** Reports on EA community growth and engagement, supplementing search data[3].

## 4. Limitations or Uncertainties in Measurement

- **Google Trends data is normalized:** It does not reflect absolute search counts and is sensitive to overall search volume for all terms[2][5].
- **Proxy limitations:** Google Trends measures search interest, not total engagement or impact; EA may become less dependent on search as a discovery channel[5].
- **Potential for methodological changes:** Ambiguity will arise if Google Trends ceases to exist or changes its methodology before 2030, as per the resolution criteria.
- **Terminology drift:** If "Effective Altruism" is replaced by another term or if public attention shifts to subfields, this could reduce measured search interest even if the movement persists.

## 5. Reference Cases and Key Differences

| Movement            | Trend Pattern                  | Key Differences                       |
|---------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Effective Altruism  | Peaked 2017, plateaued        | Ongoing org growth, digital shift     |
| Veganism            | Plateau after surge           | Broader term, more mainstream         |
| Rationalism         | Plateaued after peak          | Niche community, less public-facing   |

EA differs by being highly organized and having a strong web presence; this suggests baseline visibility likely persists even as initial curiosity wanes.

## 6. Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the:
- Plateau in Google Trends data post-2017,
- Continued organizational growth,
- High (79%) community forecast in 2018 that 2030 interest will remain above 20% of 2017 levels[1],
- Lack of evidence for collapse or dramatic change in search behavior for the term,

**It is likely (estimated 75–85% probability) that total Google Trends interest in "Effective Altruism" in 2030 will be at least 0.2 times the total in 2017.** The primary risk is a sharp drop in relevance or a methodological change in Google Trends, but there is no strong evidence as of 2018 to support that scenario.
