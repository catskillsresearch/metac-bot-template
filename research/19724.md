# Forecasting Russia's Territorial Control in Ukraine by January 1, 2026

As of May 12, 2025, I'll analyze the available data to forecast whether Russia will significantly expand its territorial control in Ukraine by January 1, 2026, according to the specified resolution criteria.

## Current Territorial Status

Russia currently controls approximately 19% of Ukraine's territory, equivalent to about 44,035 square miles (roughly the size of Ohio)[1]. This includes:
- 7% of Ukraine's territory that Russia controlled prior to February 24, 2022
- An additional 12% gained since the full-scale invasion began[4]

Russian forces maintain control of key areas including Crimea, parts of Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson regions. The Russians appear to be firmly in control of the locations specified in the "must control" list in the resolution criteria, including Simferopol, Nova Kakhovka, Svatove, Donetsk, and Tokmak.

## Recent Territorial Trends

The data reveals a consistent pattern of slow but steady Russian territorial gains:
- In the month between April 8-May 7, 2025: Russia gained 137 square miles[1]
- In the most recent week (prior to May 7, 2025): Russia gained 33 square miles[1]
- In the month between March 18-April 15, 2025: Russia gained 142 square miles[5]

This indicates Russia is consistently advancing at a rate of approximately 30-50 square miles per week, despite Ukrainian resistance and Western support. While these gains are modest in size, they demonstrate Russia's persistent offensive capabilities more than three years into the conflict.

## Strategic Assessment

Several factors point to continued Russian territorial expansion:

1. **Putin's Long-Term Strategy**: Russian leadership has demonstrated commitment to a strategy of gradual, incremental advances. Putin appears to operate under the assumption that Russia can continue making slow territorial gains indefinitely[2].

2. **Stated Objectives**: According to the US Office of the Director of National Intelligence's 2025 Annual Threat Assessment (March 2025), Putin remains committed to pursuing Ukrainian surrender through both diplomatic and military means[2].

3. **Command Decisions**: Russian commanders are operating with the understanding that Putin does not intend to end the war in the near future. Despite significant losses, Russian forces continue offensive operations toward strategic objectives like Pokrovsk and Kostyantynivka[2].

4. **Consistent Advance Rate**: Despite occasional fluctuations, Russia has maintained a relatively consistent rate of territorial acquisition throughout early 2025, suggesting their offensive capabilities remain intact.

5. **Ukrainian Counter-Incursions**: While Ukraine has managed to gain control of approximately 5 square miles in Russia's Kursk and Belgorod regions[1], these operations appear to be tactical rather than strategic in nature and haven't significantly impeded Russia's advances within Ukraine.

## Probability Assessment for January 1, 2026

Based on the available evidence, Russia appears likely to continue its pattern of slow but persistent advances. With approximately 7.5 months remaining until January 1, 2026, and at the current rate of territorial acquisition (approximately 140 square miles per month), Russia could potentially gain an additional 1,000+ square miles of Ukrainian territory.

The key question is whether these gains will include at least two of the specific locations identified in the resolution criteria (Mikolaiv, Zaporizhzhia, Kharkiv, Odesa, Lozova, Sumy, or Chernihiv). The search results don't provide specific information about Russian operations targeting these cities, but several factors suggest Russia could capture at least some of them:

1. Russia is demonstrating continued offensive capabilities despite the length of the conflict
2. Putin appears committed to long-term military operations
3. The consistent advance rate suggests Russian forces maintain sufficient combat power

However, several of the specified locations (particularly Odesa, Kharkiv, and Mikolaiv) are major cities that would require significant military resources to capture, and some are relatively far from current Russian positions. The resolution criteria requires Russia to capture at least two of these locations while maintaining control of all currently held territories.

Given the current rate of advance and Putin's demonstrated commitment to territorial acquisition, I assess there is a moderate-to-high probability (approximately 65-75%) that Russia will meet the resolution criteria by January 1, 2026, capturing at least two additional specified locations while maintaining its current territorial holdings.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

This assessment is subject to several significant uncertainties:

1. **Western Support**: Changes in Western military aid to Ukraine could significantly impact the battlefield dynamics
2. **Ukrainian Capabilities**: The search results provide limited information about Ukrainian defensive capabilities and resilience
3. **Russian Resources**: The sustainability of Russia's current offensive tempo remains uncertain
4. **Diplomatic Developments**: Potential peace negotiations could alter the territorial situation
5. **Specific Targeting**: The search results don't indicate which specific Ukrainian cities Russia is prioritizing for capture
