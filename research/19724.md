# Forecast: Will Russia Have Significantly Expanded Its Controlled Territory in Ukraine by January 1, 2026?

Based on the available data as of May 26, 2025, I'll provide a probabilistic assessment of Russia's territorial control in Ukraine by January 1, 2026.

## Current Territorial Status

As of May 2025, Russia controls approximately 44,035 square miles of Ukrainian territory, which represents about 19% of Ukraine's total area[1]. This includes Crimea and parts of Donbas that Russia had seized prior to the full-scale invasion that began on February 24, 2022. Since that invasion, Russia has gained an additional 27,410 square miles, equivalent to about 12% of Ukraine's territory[1].

Russia's territorial gains have continued at a slow but steady pace:
- In the month from April 8 to May 7, 2025: Russia gained 137 square miles[1]
- In the last week of that period: Russia gained 33 square miles[1]
- This represents a return to Russia's normal slow rate of advancement after a previous slowdown[1]

## Trend Analysis

The data shows that Russia has maintained a consistent pattern of territorial gains throughout 2025, though at varying rates:
- Late April 2025: Russia gained 50 square miles in one week (nearly double the previous week's rate)[4]
- Early May 2025: Russia gained 33 square miles in one week[1]

This indicates that while Russia continues to make advances, the rate of territorial acquisition fluctuates but remains relatively slow compared to earlier phases of the conflict.

## Factors Affecting Future Control

Several key factors will influence territorial control by January 1, 2026:

1. **War Duration Projections**: An IMF forecast predicts the war will end by late 2025 in the baseline scenario, or continue until mid-2026 in the downside scenario[3]. If peace negotiations conclude before January 2026, final territorial control will depend heavily on ceasefire terms.

2. **Russian Strategic Objectives**: Russian officials have consistently demanded international recognition of Russia's annexation of Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhia, and Kherson oblasts as a condition for peace, despite not fully controlling these regions[5]. The Kremlin appears to be intentionally stalling ceasefire and peace negotiations to gain more territory for leverage in future peace talks[5].

3. **Specific Territorial Goals**: Russian forces have been trying to seize the remaining 1% of Luhansk Oblast since November 2024[5]. The Kremlin would likely exploit the complete seizure of Luhansk Oblast to gain leverage during negotiations and as a victory for its domestic audience[5].

4. **Ukrainian Counter-Operations**: As of May 2025, Ukraine holds approximately 5 square miles of territory in Russia's Kursk and Belgorod regions[1], which complicates Russian claims and potentially affects resource allocation.

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on the resolution criteria requiring Russia to control at least two additional specified locations (from Mikolaiv, Zaporizhzhia, Kharkiv, Odesa, Lozova, Sumy, or Chernihiv) while maintaining control of all currently held key locations, I assess:

- **60% probability** that Russia will NOT have significantly expanded its controlled territory according to the resolution criteria by January 1, 2026.
- **40% probability** that Russia WILL have significantly expanded its controlled territory according to the resolution criteria by January 1, 2026.

### Reasoning:

1. At the current rate of territorial acquisition (approximately 33 square miles per week), Russia would gain roughly 1,000 additional square miles by January 2026. This represents only about 3.6% of what Russia has already gained since February 2022, suggesting limited capacity for major new conquests.

2. The slow rate of advance makes it unlikely that Russia will capture two major urban centers from the specified list within the remaining timeframe.

3. The IMF forecast suggesting the war may end in late 2025[3] indicates that final territorial lines may be drawn before January 2026, potentially freezing the conflict before Russia can achieve significant additional gains.

4. Russia appears focused on completing the seizure of Luhansk Oblast[5] rather than launching major new offensives toward the specified cities, most of which are far from current front lines.

5. The Kremlin's approach of stalling negotiations to gain territorial leverage[5] suggests a strategy focused on incremental gains rather than dramatic breakthroughs.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

This assessment is subject to several important limitations:

1. The exact front-line positions relative to the specific locations in the resolution criteria are not detailed in the available data.

2. Unforeseen developments such as major battlefield breakthroughs, significant changes in Western support for Ukraine, or dramatic shifts in Russian military strategy could substantially alter the trajectory.

3. The potential for peace negotiations to conclude before January 2026 introduces significant uncertainty about the final territorial disposition.
