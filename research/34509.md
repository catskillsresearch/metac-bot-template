## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), codified at 5 U.S.C. § 552, establishes public access to government records for all federal agencies, subject to nine specific exemptions and three special exclusions[4][5].
- These exemptions cover issues like national security, personal privacy, law enforcement, confidential business information, and more, but are longstanding and have not been recently expanded to create blanket exemptions for entire executive departments, the CIA, or EPA[3][5].
- When Congress has amended FOIA in the past, it has generally increased transparency, as with the 2016 reforms that limited agency deliberative process exemptions and required agencies to presume openness[4].

## 2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- As of January 31, 2025, there is no credible reporting or evidence of any legislation approved by either the House or Senate in 2025 that would partially or fully exempt any of the listed executive departments, the CIA, or EPA from FOIA[1][2][3][4][5].
- The existing statutory framework and agency guidance remain in place, with agencies continuing to apply the nine standard exemptions and special exclusions as described in federal regulations and agency FAQs[2][5].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Congressional Research Service report on FOIA legal overview[1]
- Federal Register on FOIA and Privacy Act regulations[2]
- Official FOIA.gov information and FAQs[3][5]
- Office of Management and Budget (OMB) FOIA page[4]

## 4. Limitations or Uncertainties

- The analysis is limited by the absence of explicit Congressional tracking for every introduced or pending bill as of January 31, 2025. While no evidence or reports indicate such legislation was approved, the possibility of overlooked or rapid late-session developments, though unlikely, cannot be fully ruled out.
- FOIA exemptions are subject to change by Congressional action at any time, but such changes typically generate significant public, legal, and media attention, which is not reflected in the available sources.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the absence of any credible source reporting relevant legislation and the historical pattern of legislative transparency, the probability that at least one chamber of Congress has approved such FOIA-exempting legislation for the specified agencies or departments by January 31, 2025, is assessed as **very low (less than 5%)**.
