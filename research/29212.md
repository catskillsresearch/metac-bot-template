## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- David Schweikert is the incumbent Republican congressman for Arizona's 1st Congressional District, having served since 2010. He has a long tenure but has seen his margins of victory shrink over time. In 2014, he won with 65% of the vote, but by 2022, he narrowly retained his seat by less than 1 percentage point against Democrat Jevin Hodge[1][3][4].
- The district, which includes northeast Maricopa County (Paradise Valley, Scottsdale, Cave Creek, and parts of north Phoenix), leans slightly Republican but is considered highly competitive. It is viewed as one of the top pickup opportunities for Democrats in 2024[1][3][4].
- Schweikert's Democratic challenger is Amish Shah, a former state lawmaker and emergency room doctor. Shah won a competitive Democratic primary and is running a well-organized campaign, emphasizing his legislative experience and community engagement[1][2][4].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- There have been no major new policy announcements or events from Schweikert or Shah that significantly alter the race's trajectory as of October 25, 2024.
- Schweikert's past ethics violations (admitted in 2020) remain a potential vulnerability, though he has continued to win re-election since then[1].
- The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has identified this district as a prime target, indicating increased national attention and resources for Shah's campaign[3].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Ballotpedia, KJZZ, and Politico provide up-to-date information on the candidates, district demographics, and the competitive nature of the race[1][2][3][4].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- As of October 25, 2024, there is no available polling data or final projections for the race.
- The district's competitiveness and recent narrow margins for the incumbent introduce significant uncertainty.
- The outcome may depend on late-breaking events, turnout, and national political trends, none of which can be fully assessed before the election.
