# Forecasting Analysis: Nuclear Weapons Above 30 MT by 2030

As of October 28, 2021, this analysis examines the likelihood of any country possessing a nuclear weapon with yield above 30 MT by 2030, based on historical trends, current nuclear postures, and technological capabilities.

## Historical Context

The era of extremely high-yield nuclear weapons peaked during the Cold War, with the largest nuclear weapon ever tested being the Soviet Union's Tsar Bomba in 1961, which had a yield of approximately 50-58 megatons. This test represented the upper practical limit of nuclear weapon yield, though the original design could have yielded around 100 MT if fully fueled. Following this period, nuclear weapon development shifted toward smaller, more accurate warheads rather than massive yields.

By 2021, no country is confirmed to maintain nuclear weapons with yields above 30 MT in their active arsenals. The global trend has been toward more sophisticated delivery systems and multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles (MIRVs) rather than single high-yield warheads.

## Current Nuclear Postures and Capabilities

### Russia

Russia maintains the world's largest nuclear arsenal as of 2021, with approximately 6,000 total warheads. While most of Russia's current strategic warheads have yields in the hundreds of kilotons to low-megaton range, Russia has been developing several new strategic weapons systems:

- **Poseidon/Status-6**: This underwater nuclear drone was publicly acknowledged in 2018 and is reported to be under development. Some Russian sources have claimed it could carry a multi-megaton warhead, potentially exceeding 30 MT, designed to create radioactive tsunamis against coastal targets. This system represents the most likely candidate for a >30 MT weapon by 2030.

### United States

The US has been pursuing nuclear modernization but has shown no interest in developing very high-yield weapons. The largest yield in the current US arsenal is the B83 gravity bomb at approximately 1.2 MT, significantly below the 30 MT threshold.

### China

As of 2021, China maintains a relatively small but growing nuclear arsenal estimated at around 350 warheads. China has historically maintained a minimum deterrence posture, with warheads typically in the hundreds of kilotons to low-megaton range. There is no public evidence as of October 2021 suggesting China is pursuing weapons with yields above 30 MT.

### Other Nuclear Powers

Other nuclear weapons states (UK, France, India, Pakistan, North Korea, Israel) maintain arsenals with yields well below the 30 MT threshold, and none have indicated interest in developing such high-yield weapons.

## Technical and Strategic Considerations

Several factors make the development of >30 MT weapons unlikely:

1. **Limited Strategic Utility**: Modern precision guidance systems have reduced the need for extremely high yields. Multiple smaller warheads provide more flexibility and effectiveness than single large ones.

2. **Physical Constraints**: Weapons with yields above 30 MT present significant engineering challenges for delivery systems due to their size and weight.

3. **Environmental Concerns**: The environmental consequences of testing such weapons make their development politically problematic.

4. **Arms Control**: While some arms control agreements have been weakened or abandoned by 2021, there remains international pressure against developing new high-yield nuclear weapons.

## Forecast Assessment

Based on the information available as of October 28, 2021, the probability that any country will have a nuclear weapon with yield above 30 MT by 2030 is assessed at approximately **10-15%**.

This assessment is primarily driven by:

- Russia's Poseidon/Status-6 system, which represents the most plausible candidate for a >30 MT weapon
- The general trend away from high-yield weapons toward more precise, lower-yield systems
- The limited strategic utility of such high-yield weapons in modern nuclear doctrines

For this forecast to resolve positively, Russia would most likely need to complete development of the Poseidon system with a warhead exceeding 30 MT, and this capability would need to be confirmed by at least two credible sources without significant contestation from other credible sources.

The primary uncertainty in this forecast stems from limited public information about Russia's Poseidon program and the possibility that other nuclear powers could pursue very high-yield weapons in response to changing strategic circumstances.
