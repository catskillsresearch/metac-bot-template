# Forecasting Major Atlantic Hurricanes in September 2024

As of early September 2024, several factors are relevant to forecasting whether exactly one major Atlantic hurricane will occur during September 2024. This analysis examines current conditions, seasonal forecasts, and historical patterns to assess this possibility.

## Current Hurricane Season Status

The 2024 Atlantic hurricane season has shown unusual characteristics through early September:

- AccuWeather reported that the 2024 Labor Day weekend (early September) was the first in 27 years without a named storm in the Atlantic basin[5]
- As of September 3, 2024, the season had experienced "limited tropical activity" during August[5]
- Tropical Storm Alberto had formed by early September, though there is no indication it reached major hurricane status[3]

Several environmental factors have been inhibiting tropical development in the weeks leading up to September:
- Widespread dry air
- Saharan dust
- Wind shear
- Unusual cold waters off the coast of Africa[5]

## Seasonal Forecasts and Adjustments

Multiple agencies have issued forecasts for the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season, with some recent adjustments:

- On May 23, 2024, NOAA predicted an above-normal season with 17-25 named storms and 8-13 hurricanes[1]
- In March 2024, Tropical Storm Risk (TSR) forecasted 20 tropical storms, 9 hurricanes, and 4 major hurricanes for the entire season[4]
- Most significantly, on September 3, 2024, AccuWeather reduced their seasonal forecast to:
  - 16-20 named storms (down from previous forecast)
  - 6-10 hurricanes
  - 3-6 major hurricanes
  - 4-6 direct impacts to the United States[5]

This downward revision is particularly relevant as it occurred just before September, suggesting reduced expectations for major hurricane activity in the peak month.

## Climate Factors Influencing September Activity

Several climate patterns are influencing the 2024 hurricane season:

- La Ni単a conditions were expected to emerge during the 2024 season, which typically weakens wind shear and creates conditions more conducive to tropical storm and hurricane formation[4]
- However, AccuWeather noted that despite favorable La Ni単a conditions, other factors including "widespread dry air, Saharan dust, wind shear, and unusual cold waters off the coast of Africa" were disrupting tropical development as of early September[5]
- Abnormally warm sea surface temperatures were noted as counteracting the coming La Ni単a in some forecasts[2]

## Historical Context and Verification Sources

For verification of September 2024 hurricane activity, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) provides several authoritative sources:

- The NHC Tropical Cyclone Reports contain comprehensive information on each tropical cyclone, including synoptic history, meteorological statistics, and post-analysis best track data[3]
- The NHC's Tropical Cyclone Advisory Archive and Monthly Atlantic Tropical Weather Summary will provide official counts of major hurricanes in September 2024

## Assessment of September Major Hurricane Likelihood

Based on the available information as of early September 2024:

1. The reduced forecast from AccuWeather on September 3 suggests lower expectations for hurricane activity than initially predicted
2. Environmental conditions in early September were inhibiting tropical development
3. The season's slow start through August and early September indicates a potential delay in peak activity

While the overall season is still predicted to have 3-6 major hurricanes according to AccuWeather's latest forecast, the inhibiting factors present in early September and the unusually quiet August suggest that September may see fewer major hurricanes than would be typical in an above-average season.

However, it's important to note that September remains the peak of hurricane season, and conditions can change rapidly. The presence of La Ni単a conditions could still support the development of major hurricanes later in the month.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several limitations affect the accuracy of this forecast:

- Hurricane forecasting beyond 7-10 days carries significant uncertainty
- The timing of environmental pattern changes (such as the dissipation of Saharan dust or changes in wind shear) cannot be precisely predicted
- While seasonal forecasts provide general expectations, they cannot predict the exact timing or number of major hurricanes in a specific month
