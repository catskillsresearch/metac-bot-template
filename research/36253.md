# NATO Defense Spending Target Forecast for 2025 Summit

As of May 2025, the upcoming NATO summit in The Hague (June 24-26, 2025) is expected to focus heavily on revising the alliance's defense spending targets. Based on current information, I can provide the following analysis to help forecast the likely outcome.

## Current Situation and Recent Developments

NATO has maintained a 2% of GDP defense spending target since 2006, which was reaffirmed after Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea. By 2024, 22 NATO members had met or exceeded this target, compared to only three in 2014[3]. However, several members still lag behind, including Portugal, Italy, Canada, and Spain[3].

Most recently, Spain announced a significant increase in military spending, with a €10.5 billion ($12 billion) boost that will raise their total to €34 billion ($39 billion) for 2025, allowing them to reach the 2% target this year instead of their original goal of 2029[1][5]. This demonstrates increasing momentum among previously underperforming members to meet alliance obligations.

## Key Indicators for the 2025 Summit Target

Several important developments point to a likely increase in the NATO spending target:

1. **NATO Secretary General's Position**: Mark Rutte, NATO's Secretary General, is actively seeking member countries' agreement at the June summit to reach 5% of GDP on defense-related spending by 2032[4]. This represents a significant increase from the current 2% target.

2. **Proposed Implementation Structure**: Rutte's plan appears to involve boosting traditional defense spending to 3.5% and introducing a further 1.5% target for broader security-related spending, totaling 5%[2]. This suggests a potential two-tier or expanded definition approach.

3. **Expert Analysis**: Geopolitical assessments indicate that "the most likely scenario is that the allies will agree to a new defense spending floor of 3.5 percent of gross domestic product"[3].

4. **U.S. Pressure**: The Trump administration has been pushing for higher defense spending, potentially even proposing "restrictions or penalties on allied nations that do not meet the spending requirement"[3].

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on the available information, the most likely outcomes for the NATO defense spending target at the 2025 summit are:

1. **3.5% Target (Highest Probability)**: The evidence most strongly supports a new defense spending floor of 3.5% of GDP[3]. This represents a significant but potentially achievable increase from the current 2% target.

2. **5% Target with Extended Timeline**: There appears to be a push for an eventual 5% target by 2032, which may be structured as 3.5% traditional defense spending plus 1.5% for broader security spending[2][4]. This could be adopted as a long-term goal while establishing 3.5% as the immediate target.

3. **Compromise Target (3% or 4%)**: Given that some nations are still struggling to meet the current 2% requirement, there may be resistance to a sharp increase, potentially resulting in a compromise figure.

4. **Maintaining Current Target (Lowest Probability)**: With strong momentum for increased spending and explicit statements from NATO leadership about the inadequacy of the current target, maintaining the 2% level appears unlikely.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors could influence the final outcome:

- Resistance from economically constrained NATO members who struggle with even the current 2% target
- Potential redefinition of what constitutes "defense spending" to make higher targets more achievable
- Geopolitical developments between now and the summit, particularly regarding Russia or Ukraine
- Internal political changes within key NATO member states

The most likely outcome based on current information is a new defense spending target of 3.5% of GDP, potentially with a longer-term roadmap toward 5% by 2032.
