# NATO Defense Spending Target Forecast for 2025 Summit

As we approach the June 2025 NATO Summit in The Hague, there is significant momentum toward establishing a new defense spending target that exceeds the longstanding 2% of GDP benchmark. Based on available information as of May 2025, I'll analyze the current landscape to forecast the likely outcome.

## Current Situation and Historical Context

Since 2006, NATO members have aimed to spend at least 2% of GDP on defense, with this target being reaffirmed after Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea. By 2024, 23 of 32 members had met this benchmark, driven largely by the ongoing war in Ukraine. However, NATO officials have increasingly argued that the 2% target is insufficient for current security challenges.

The upcoming NATO summit in The Hague (June 2025) is expected to finalize a new defense spending target that reflects the heightened threat environment[1][3].

## Key Positions and Proposals

Several specific target proposals are currently under consideration:

1. **3.5% of GDP by 2030**: There appears to be substantial support for establishing a 3.5% minimum target to be achieved by 2030. This proposal includes provisions for yearly progress reports to ensure accountability[1].

2. **5% "Defense-Related" Spending**: The United States has reiterated demands for a 5% target that could include spending on areas like mobility, infrastructure, and cybersecurity[2].

The United States is already on track to meet the 3.5% target in fiscal year 2026 under its National Defense Authorization Act and defense reconciliation bill[1]. This suggests that while the US may publicly push for 5%, there may be internal acceptance of the 3.5% figure as a reasonable compromise.

## Factors Influencing the Decision

Several key factors will likely influence the final target agreement:

1. **Russian Threat Perception**: The increasing threat from Russia is explicitly cited as a driver for raising the minimum level of defense spending[3].

2. **Burden-Sharing Dynamics**: The 3.5% proposal is framed as a way to "right size burden-sharing through larger relative spending increases by other NATO members"[1].

3. **Capability Gaps**: There is discussion of a needed 30% increase in capability targets, suggesting that any spending target will be tied to specific capability improvements[1].

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on the available information, I assess the following probabilities for the NATO defense spending target to be agreed upon at the June 2025 summit:

- **3.5% target**: 65% probability
  - This appears to be the most developed proposal with specific implementation timelines (by 2030)
  - Already has framework for accountability through yearly progress reports
  - The US is already planning to meet this level by 2026

- **3% target**: 20% probability
  - May emerge as a compromise between European reluctance and US pressure

- **5% target**: 10% probability
  - While strongly advocated by the US, appears to face resistance from European allies
  - May be used as a negotiating position rather than an expected outcome

- **4% target**: 3% probability
  - Possible compromise between the 3.5% and 5% positions

- **2.5% target**: 1% probability
  - Minimal increase that would likely be seen as insufficient

- **2% or lower**: 1% probability
  - Maintaining current target seems highly unlikely given current security environment

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors could alter this assessment:

1. The exact definition of "defense spending" may be expanded to include areas like infrastructure and cybersecurity, potentially making higher targets more palatable[2].

2. Individual country circumstances may lead to differentiated targets rather than a single Alliance-wide figure.

3. Political developments in key member states between now and the summit could shift negotiating positions.
