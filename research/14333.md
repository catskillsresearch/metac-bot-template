### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The oldest living person as of January 2023 was Maria Branyas Morera, born March 4, 1907, who reached 115 years of age in early 2023[1][2][3].
- The maximum documented human age is 122 years, 164 days (Jeanne Calment, died 1997), a record that has not been surpassed[3].
- Life expectancy has roughly doubled since 1900, but the oldest ages attained have increased far less—by only a few years over more than a century.
- Supercentenarians (age 110+) remain extremely rare; increases in average life expectancy mostly reflect reductions in early mortality, not dramatic shifts in extreme longevity.

### Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- As of early 2023, there were no major scientific announcements or policy changes credibly forecasting a dramatic increase in the maximum human lifespan by 2100.
- Ongoing research in geroscience, biotechnology, and regenerative medicine might eventually impact this metric, but no concrete breakthroughs with proven effects on maximum human age had been achieved or widely implemented by 2023.

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The Guinness Book of World Records is the standard authority for verifying the world's oldest living person[3].
- Secondary verification comes from organizations such as the Gerontology Research Group and national statistics agencies.
- As of 2023, news organizations and research publications also report on new record-holders and verification standards[2][3].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- The slow historical growth in maximum age suggests that, barring unprecedented medical advances, the oldest living person in 2100 is unlikely to be older than 125.
- Outliers are possible due to the growing global population, but the probability of surpassing Jeanne Calment’s record by more than a few years remains low.
- Measurement uncertainty persists due to the need for rigorous documentation and the possibility of unverified cases.
- Radical life extension (e.g., 130+ years) remains speculative as of 2023, lacking empirical support.

### Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given these factors, a reasonable probabilistic forecast (as of January 2023) would be:
- **Most likely range:** 118–125 years
- **Chance of surpassing 125 years:** Low, but not zero
- **Chance of 130+ years:** Very low unless future breakthroughs occur
