### 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Life expectancy worldwide has nearly doubled since 1900, rising steadily due to improvements in medicine, sanitation, and public health[1].
- Despite increasing average life expectancy, the maximum verified human lifespan has increased more slowly, with Jeanne Calment holding the record at 122 years since the late 20th century[3].
- Maria Branyas Morera (1907–2024), the oldest living person as of early 2023, died at 117 years, making her one of the longest-lived verified individuals in history[1][4].
- Studies on Maria Branyas reveal genetic and microbiome factors contributing to her exceptional longevity, suggesting biological limits can be influenced but not dramatically extended without breakthroughs[2][3].

### 2. Key Differences Affecting the Forecast

- Advances in genetics, epigenetics, and microbiome research may enable incremental increases in maximum lifespan by improving resistance to age-related diseases and inflammation[2][3].
- The maximum lifespan is less responsive to improvements than average life expectancy, indicating a biological ceiling likely near 120–130 years under current medical paradigms.
- Potential future technologies (e.g., gene editing, regenerative medicine) could push this boundary further but remain speculative as of 2023–2024.
- The rarity and verification challenges of supercentenarians create uncertainty in forecasting precise maximum ages.

### 3. Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment for 2100

- Based on current biological and demographic data, the oldest living person in 2100 is likely to be approximately **125 to 135 years old**.
- This range reflects modest gains beyond the current extreme ages (around 117–122 years) due to ongoing medical and scientific advancements without assuming revolutionary anti-aging breakthroughs.
- The probability of surpassing 140 years without novel, radical therapies remains low based on current knowledge.

### 4. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Guinness World Records (official age verification for oldest living persons)[1][4]
- Scientific studies published on Maria Branyas’s longevity biology (bioRxiv preprint, NMN.com)[2][3]
- Historical global life expectancy data from Our World in Data

### 5. Limitations and Uncertainties

- Maximum lifespan is influenced by rare genetic and environmental factors, making precise forecasting difficult.
- Future medical breakthroughs may alter longevity trends unpredictably.
- Verification depends on credible documentation, which can be challenging for extreme ages.
