## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The U.S. average weekly hours of all employees in the private nonfarm sector has remained remarkably stable in recent years.
- As of April 2025, the figure stands at 34.3 hours, unchanged month-over-month and consistent with the average over the past decade[2][3][5].
- Since 2006, the series has averaged 34.39 hours, with only modest fluctuations outside of recessionary or pandemic periods. The post-pandemic normalization has seen the metric settle in the 34.2–34.4 range[2].

## Recent Announcements or Policies Affecting the Metric

- There have been no major policy changes or labor market disruptions reported as of May 2025 that would significantly impact average weekly hours[2][4].
- The labor market appears steady, with unemployment at 4.2% and a participation rate of 62.6% as of April 2025, indicating neither overheating nor contraction[4].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Bureau of Labor Statistics Current Employment Statistics (CES) program, specifically the AWHAETP series, is the gold standard for this metric[1][3].
- Trading Economics and MacroMicro aggregate and forecast BLS data using macroeconomic models[2][5].

## Limitations or Uncertainties in Measurement

- The BLS measure reflects hours for which pay was received, so it may undercount effects from unpaid leave, part-time shifts, or labor stoppages.
- Short-term shocks (e.g., strikes, pandemics, or sudden economic downturns) could move the metric, but none are evident as of May 2025.
- Forecasts assume no major, unforeseen disruptions will occur before October 2025.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the current stability in the metric, the absence of disruptive policy or economic news, and consistent forecasts from macroeconomic models, the most likely outcome for October 2025 is:

> **The U.S. average weekly hours of all employees (total non-farm private) will be 34.3 hours, with a probable range of 34.2–34.4 hours.**

This reflects both historical stability and expert forecasts, with low probability of deviation barring unexpected events[2][5].
