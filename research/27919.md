- **Age Considerations**: At 75, González would be subject to house arrest rather than jail time if detained, according to Venezuelan law.

### Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric
- **Arrest Warrant**: The recent issuance of an arrest warrant indicates a heightened legal risk for González.
- **International Sanctions**: The U.S. is considering sanctions against Venezuelan officials, which could impact the government's actions regarding González.

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- **The Economist**: Offers insights into the political context and implications of the arrest warrant.

### Limitations or Uncertainties in Measurement
- **Enforcement Capability**: The Venezuelan government's ability to locate and detain González while he is in hiding is uncertain.
- **International Influence**: The impact of international pressure on the government's decision to enforce the arrest warrant is unpredictable.

Given these factors, while there is a legal basis for González's detention, the actual enforcement of the arrest warrant depends on various political and logistical factors.
