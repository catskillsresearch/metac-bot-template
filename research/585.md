## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status (as of 2017-11-21)
- The global average temperature had already increased by about 1°C relative to pre-industrial times by 2017[3].
- The Paris Agreement set the goal to keep warming "well below 2˚C," ideally below 1.5˚C, but the sum of countries’ pledges (Nationally Determined Contributions) fell short of these targets[3][4].
- Projections based on current (2017) policies and emissions trajectories indicated a high likelihood of exceeding 2°C by 2100, with reference studies giving a median warming of 3.2°C and only a 5% chance of staying at or below 2°C[3].
- Without additional, ambitious emissions cuts, baseline scenarios (no new policies) predicted even higher temperature increases by 2100, often above 3°C[4].

## 2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric (as of 2017)
- The United States announced plans to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, undermining global efforts and potentially leading to weaker collective action[3].
- While some countries strengthened climate policies, overall commitments were insufficient to guarantee the 2°C target, and the gap between pledges and required action remained significant[3][4].
- No major new global policy framework or enforcement mechanism had emerged to close this gap by late 2017.

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification
- IPCC special reports and assessment reports provide consensus forecasts and uncertainties[2][4].
- NASA’s global temperature data is the standard for measuring long-term trends and will be critical for resolution[1].
- Peer-reviewed studies (e.g., Raftery et al., Nature Climate Change, 2017) offer probabilistic assessments based on emissions and policy scenarios[3].

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties
- Climate models have inherent uncertainties, particularly regarding feedbacks (e.g., carbon cycle, clouds) that could amplify or dampen warming[4].
- Projections depend critically on future policy choices, technology development, and economic growth, all of which were highly uncertain in 2017[3][4].
- The use of 1880 as a baseline instead of true pre-industrial introduces minor uncertainty, but is generally accepted due to data limitations.
- The Paris Agreement’s voluntary nature and lack of binding enforcement made actual achievement of targets uncertain as of 2017.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment (as of 2017-11-21)
- Based on the best available evidence, the probability of the world experiencing at least 2°C of warming by 2100 was very high—around 95%, according to leading statistical analyses[3].
- Only a sustained, global, and unprecedented policy effort could reduce this probability significantly; as of late 2017, such an effort was not in place[3][4].
- There was a small (5% or less) probability that warming would stay at or below 2°C, with the median expectation being well above that threshold[3].
