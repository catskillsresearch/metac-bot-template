# FiveThirtyEight Polling Tracker Status Analysis

Based on the information available as of March 20, 2025, it appears highly unlikely that FiveThirtyEight will update its polling tracker before April 1, 2025, due to the following key developments:

## Current Status

FiveThirtyEight has been shut down by ABC News in early March 2025[3][4]. The website, which was known for its opinion poll analysis, politics, economics, and sports blogging, is now referred to in the past tense as it is no longer operational[5]. The last recorded update to the FiveThirtyEight polls page appears to have been on March 4, 2025[1].

## Recent Developments

The New York Times has explicitly announced that it has "begun a new effort to track public opinion surveys" to fill the gap left by FiveThirtyEight's closure[4]. This transition was necessitated because "FiveThirtyEight is gone, and along with its visualization-centric projects, so is their poll tracking"[3]. The Times has specifically stated they are "building on the work of the politics website 538, which for several years released this data as a public service until it was shuttered by ABC News this month"[3].

William P. Davis, the Times' director of election data analytics, confirmed on March 18, 2025, that they are taking over this function to "ensure that this resource, which is a foundational tool for many journalists and researchers, remains updated long-term"[4].

## Authoritative Sources

The shutdown of FiveThirtyEight has been reported by multiple credible sources:

1. The New York Times has officially announced taking over the poll tracking function[3][4]
2. Nieman Lab, a reputable journalism research organization, has covered the transition[4]
3. Wikipedia has updated its entry to refer to FiveThirtyEight in the past tense[5]

## Limitations and Uncertainties

While the evidence strongly suggests FiveThirtyEight will not update its polling tracker before April 1, 2025, there are some limitations to consider:

1. There is no explicit statement about what will happen to FiveThirtyEight's existing web infrastructure or whether the domain will remain accessible
2. It's unclear if any automated systems might continue to function temporarily despite the organization's shutdown
3. The search results don't provide information about any potential legal or contractual obligations that might require maintaining certain services

Given the explicit statements about FiveThirtyEight being "shuttered" and "gone," combined with the New York Times actively taking over its polling functions, it appears highly unlikely that the FiveThirtyEight polling tracker will be updated before April 1, 2025.
