Based on the available information as of March 20, 2025, it appears highly unlikely that FiveThirtyEight will update its polling tracker before April 1, 2025.

## Current Status of FiveThirtyEight

FiveThirtyEight was shut down by ABC News in early March 2025[4]. The website's last update to its polls page was on March 4, 2025[1]. The shutdown affected all of FiveThirtyEight's publicly available polling databases, including its presidential approval rating tracker[4].

As of March 6, 2025, Wikipedia already referred to FiveThirtyEight in the past tense, stating that it "was an American website that focused on opinion poll analysis, politics, economics, and sports blogging"[5].

## Transition to The New York Times

Following FiveThirtyEight's closure, The New York Times has stepped in to continue the polling tracking function. As reported on March 19, 2025, the Times has "begun a new effort to track public opinion surveys, starting by collecting all polls on President Trump's job approval"[4].

William P. Davis, the Times' director of election data analytics, wrote that their goal is "to ensure that this resource, which is a foundational tool for many journalists and researchers, remains updated long-term"[4]. The Times is providing the data in approximately the same format as FiveThirtyEight did to make the transition as seamless as possible.

## Analysis and Forecast

Given that:
1. FiveThirtyEight has been officially shut down by ABC News
2. The last update to its polls page was on March 4, 2025
3. The New York Times has explicitly taken over the polling tracking function

It is highly improbable that FiveThirtyEight will update its polling tracker again before April 1, 2025. The website appears to be defunct, with its functions being transferred to The New York Times.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

While the evidence strongly suggests FiveThirtyEight will not update its polling tracker, there are some potential uncertainties:

- The search results do not explicitly state whether the FiveThirtyEight website remains accessible or if it has been completely taken offline
- There is no information about whether any transitional arrangements might allow for final updates to the FiveThirtyEight site
- The exact nature of the shutdown (whether it's a complete cessation of operations or a gradual wind-down) is not fully detailed

However, the fact that The New York Times has already begun collecting polling data independently, rather than in partnership with FiveThirtyEight, strongly indicates that FiveThirtyEight's operations have ceased entirely[4].
