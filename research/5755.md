## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- China’s GDP has grown much faster than the US since 1980, with the China-to-USA nominal GDP ratio increasing from 0.11 (1980) to approximately 0.69 in 2020[2].
- The US economy remains larger in nominal terms as of 2020, but forecasts widely expect China to close or surpass the gap by 2050, depending on assumptions about growth and exchange rates[1][5].

## 2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- Demographic changes: China’s working-age population, which grew by 1.7% annually between 1980 and 2010, is projected to shrink by 0.9% per year through 2050, likely slowing economic growth[5].
- No major policy shifts or shocks as of 2020-11-25 have fundamentally altered long-term economic trajectories, though ongoing US-China tensions and global trade uncertainties remain as background risks.

## 3. Authoritative Sources and Reference Cases

- Metaculus community forecasts (late 2020) estimate the median China-to-USA GDP ratio in 2050 at about 1.16, with a 25%-75% quartile range from 0.84 to 1.54[2][4].
- The Brookings/Lowy study models scenarios where, with 2% real growth in both countries, the US remains ahead in 2050; with 5% Chinese growth, China could be 58% larger, implying a ratio up to ~1.6[5].
- PwC’s “World in 2050” report projects China overtaking the US in GDP, but does not specify the ratio in the excerpt[1].

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- Projections depend heavily on uncertain variables: future growth rates, demographic changes, exchange rates, and potential surprises (technological, geopolitical, etc.)[5][3].
- Official GDP statistics, especially from China, may be subject to future revision or dispute[2][3].
- Forecasts generally assume no major disruptive shocks (pandemics, wars, financial crises) between 2020-2050.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

- The most credible probabilistic range for the China-to-US GDP ratio in 2050 is a median of 1.16, with an interquartile range from 0.84 to 1.54[2][4][5].
- There is a non-negligible chance (roughly 1%-2%) of extreme outcomes below 0.35 or above 5, but these are considered outliers by most forecasters[2][4].
- The balance of evidence suggests China will likely match or modestly exceed the US in total nominal GDP by 2050, but large uncertainties remain.
