## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The Artemis Accords have grown steadily since their launch in 2020, expanding from an initial handful of signatories to 55 as of May 15, 2025[1][2][5].
- Recent signings: Bangladesh (April 8, 2025) and Norway (May 15, 2025), showing a pace of roughly one new signatory per month in 2025 so far[1][2][5].
- The 2023–2024 period saw large surges, with more than 20 countries joining in under 18 months[2][4].
- This growth trend suggests ongoing diplomatic engagement and a sustained appetite for participation.

## 2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- No public announcements or scheduled signings for June 2025 are cited in available sources.
- The US, NASA, and other stakeholders continue to promote the Accords, as evidenced by regular ceremonies and outreach activities[1][2].
- The Accords’ integration with existing international space law and their broadening inclusion appear to be attracting new members, especially from regions previously underrepresented.

## 4. Limitations or Uncertainties

- No explicit indication of a pending signature for June 2025 exists in the public record.
- Diplomatic processes can be unpredictable; last-minute delays or changes in government priorities could slow the pace.
- The pool of potential new signatories is shrinking as more countries join, though many remain eligible.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the average pace in 2025 (one signatory per 1–1.5 months), recent momentum, and ongoing diplomatic activity—but absent any concrete announcements—it is **probable** (estimated 60–70% chance) that a new country will sign the Artemis Accords in June 2025.
