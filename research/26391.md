# Israel-Hamas Ceasefire Forecast Analysis

As of mid-July 2024, several developments suggest potential progress toward a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas that could meet the criteria of lasting at least 30 days and being agreed to before August 31, 2024.

## Current Status of Ceasefire Negotiations

As of early July 2024, Hamas had given initial approval for a U.S.-backed proposal for a phased cease-fire deal in Gaza, notably dropping a key demand that Israel provide an up-front commitment[1]. This represents a significant shift in Hamas's negotiating position that could facilitate progress toward an agreement.

The United Nations Security Council adopted Resolution 2735 (2024) on June 10, 2024, with 14 votes in favor, which endorsed a ceasefire proposal with specific phases[2]. According to the U.S. representative at the UN, Israel had already agreed to this deal, and the Council sent "a clear message to Hamas â€“ accept the ceasefire deal on the table"[2].

## Structure of Proposed Ceasefire Agreements

The ceasefire framework that has been under discussion has several important characteristics:

1. **Phased Implementation**: The proposed agreement consists of three related and interconnected stages, each lasting 42 days (6 weeks)[3]. This duration exceeds the 30-day minimum required by the resolution criteria.

2. **First Phase Elements**: The initial 42-day phase would include:
   - Temporary cessation of mutual military operations
   - Withdrawal of Israeli forces from densely populated areas to positions along the border
   - Halt to military and reconnaissance air operations (10 hours daily, 12 hours on prisoner release days)
   - Return of displaced persons to their areas of residence[3]

3. **Hostage and Prisoner Exchange**: The framework aims to release all Israeli detainees in Gaza (both civilians and military personnel, alive or deceased) in exchange for the release of agreed-upon numbers of Palestinian prisoners[3].

## International Mediation Efforts

The ceasefire negotiations have involved significant international mediation:

- The United States has played a central role in backing the proposal that Hamas initially approved in early July[1].
- Egypt and Qatar have been serving as mediators, with the U.S. noting that these countries "have assured her country that they will help ensure that Hamas engages constructively"[2].
- The UN Security Council's strong endorsement (14 votes in favor) demonstrates broad international support for the ceasefire framework[2].

## Factors That May Influence Resolution

Several factors could influence whether a ceasefire agreement is reached before August 31, 2024:

1. **Continued Negotiations**: The U.S. representative at the UN stated that "if Hamas does the same [as Israel in agreeing to the deal], the fighting can stop today"[2]. This suggests that the primary remaining obstacle as of June 10 was Hamas's formal acceptance of the terms.

2. **Implementation Timeline**: Even if an agreement is reached before August 31, the resolution criteria require that it take effect by September 29, 2024, and last at least 30 days (until October 29, 2024) to resolve as "Yes."

3. **Ceasefire Duration**: The proposed framework specifically states that "if negotiations take longer than six weeks in phase one, the ceasefire will continue 'as long as negotiations continue'"[2]. This provision could help ensure the ceasefire lasts beyond the required 30 days.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

The available information has several limitations:

1. The most recent data in the search results is from early July 2024, and negotiations may have evolved since then.

2. While both sides have shown some willingness to accept ceasefire proposals at different points, final agreement requires resolving remaining differences and formal acceptance by both parties.

3. The search results do not provide detailed information about potential sticking points that could delay or prevent an agreement.

4. Even if an agreement is reached, implementation could face challenges that might affect the timing or duration of the ceasefire.

## Conclusion

Based on the available information as of early July 2024, there appears to be a framework for a ceasefire agreement that would satisfy the resolution criteria if implemented. Both Israel and Hamas have shown some level of acceptance to proposals at different points, and international mediation efforts continue. However, final agreement and implementation remain uncertain, with negotiations ongoing.
