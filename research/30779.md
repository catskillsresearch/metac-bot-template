## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Yoon Suk Yeol is the incumbent President of South Korea as of December 5, 2024.
- On December 3, 2024, Yoon declared emergency martial law, citing threats from "North Korean communist forces" and "antistate forces." This was the first such declaration since 1980[1][2].
- The declaration was met with immediate and broad opposition, including from the opposition Democratic Party, the leader of Yoon’s own People Power Party, and the majority of his cabinet[2].
- The National Assembly responded within hours, with 190 out of 300 members voting unanimously to annul martial law. Yoon complied and lifted martial law early on December 4, 2024[1][2].
- All cabinet members, including the prime minister, reportedly tendered their resignations in protest, though Yoon has the authority to accept or reject these resignations[2].
- Yoon’s approval rating is reported to be around 10%, and there is widespread speculation about his ability to remain in office amid mounting protests and political turmoil[1].

## Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- The martial law declaration and its rapid annulment have triggered a political crisis, with the president’s authority and legitimacy under intense scrutiny[1][2].
- The mass resignation of the cabinet signals a severe loss of political support for Yoon within the executive branch[2].
- There are indications of potential mass protests and further political instability, which could impact Yoon’s ability to remain in office[1].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) analysis of the martial law declaration and its aftermath[1].
- Carnegie Endowment for International Peace analysis of the political crisis and cabinet resignations[2].
- Local South Korean press, such as the *Chosun Ilbo*, reporting on cabinet resignations and political developments[2].

## Limitations or Uncertainties in Measurement

- As of December 5, 2024, Yoon Suk Yeol remains President of South Korea, but his political future is highly uncertain due to:
  - Extremely low approval ratings.
  - Mass cabinet resignations.
  - Potential for large-scale protests and further legislative action.
- There is no public information as of the cutoff date indicating that Yoon has resigned, been impeached, or otherwise removed from office.
- The situation is fluid, and rapid developments could occur after December 5, 2024, which are not covered by the available data.

## Summary

As of December 5, 2024, Yoon Suk Yeol is still President of South Korea, but his hold on power is precarious due to a failed martial law declaration, mass cabinet resignations, and widespread political opposition. Whether he will remain president on December 31, 2024, cannot be forecast with certainty based on information available before the cutoff date, but there are significant risks to his continued tenure.
