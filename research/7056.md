## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of May 2025, McDonald's has not announced or piloted a cultivated meat product in any market. There is no public indication that any top global QSR (including KFC, Burger King, Subway, Pizza Hut, Domino’s, Taco Bell, Wendy’s, Hardee’s, or Hunt Brothers Pizza) has featured cultivated meat on their menu[5].
- McDonald's has focused recent innovation on chicken products and improvements to core beef offerings, not on introducing new categories like cultivated meat[2][3].
- Their most prominent alternative protein trial, the McPlant (a plant-based burger), was discontinued in the US due to low demand, with executives stating there are no current plans to relaunch in the US market[5].
- McDonald's has a record of cautious sustainability innovation, exemplified by a slow, small-scale trial of “sustainable beef” over the past decade, indicating an incremental, risk-averse approach to major sourcing changes[4].

## 2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- In 2024, McDonald's US leadership publicly stated that plant-based products like the McPlant “were not successful in either market” tested and that the company is doubling down on chicken instead[5].
- There are no public commitments, pilot programs, or regulatory filings from McDonald's or its major QSR peers regarding cultivated meat menu launches as of May 2025.
- McDonald’s ongoing responsible sourcing and sustainability initiatives focus on incremental improvements to existing supply chains, not disruptive new technologies like cultivated meat[1][4].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- McDonald's official corporate site for responsible sourcing and sustainability updates[1].
- Food industry news sites on McDonald's menu innovation and public statements[2][3][5].
- Industry analysis of McDonald's approach to sustainable beef as a proxy for pace of innovation in protein sourcing[4].

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- Regulatory approval for cultivated meat is advancing but remains limited to a few jurisdictions (notably Singapore and, as of 2023, the US for select products). QSR adoption will likely depend on broader regulatory acceptance in major markets.
- Consumer demand for novel proteins in QSR settings is unproven, as demonstrated by the McPlant’s underperformance in the US[5].
- Competitive dynamics: While McDonald's is the sector leader, other QSRs (especially KFC, which has piloted cultivated meat in Asia with partners) or regional players could move first, but no such launches are reported as of this analysis.
- Potential for rapid change exists if regulatory or consumer environments shift, or if a QSR pursues a limited launch in a permissive market.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given McDonald's slow and cautious track record with new protein categories, lack of current cultivated meat pilots, and recent shift away from even plant-based proteins in major markets, it is unlikely that McDonald's will be the first top global QSR to feature a cultivated meat product before 2027. The probability is further reduced by the absence of any global QSR planning a cultivated meat launch as of May 2025. There is a moderate probability that another QSR or a smaller chain could make a limited launch first if regulatory conditions allow, but based on available evidence, the chance of McDonald's being first is low—estimated below 10% barring unforeseen developments.
