# S&P 500 Index Forecast for December 2024

Based on available information as of November 12, 2024, here's an analysis of whether the S&P 500 index is likely to increase in December 2024.

## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

The S&P 500 has been the subject of various forecasts throughout 2024, with most Wall Street analysts predicting growth by year-end. Goldman Sachs, in their most recent forecast from October 2024, projected that the broad stock market index could increase by 4% through December 2024[4]. This represents one of the more recent and optimistic outlooks for the final month of 2024.

Earlier in 2024, RBC Capital Markets revised their year-end S&P 500 price target to 5,300, representing an 11% gain versus the December 2023 close[5]. This was a modest upgrade from their previous forecasts of 5,150 and 5,000, indicating increasing confidence in market performance as 2024 progressed.

## Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the S&P 500

Several factors have been identified as potential drivers for S&P 500 performance in late 2024:

1. **Federal Reserve Policy**: Goldman Sachs analysts expected the Federal Reserve to implement its first rate cut in the last quarter of 2024, which could positively impact equity markets[2]. The resolution of this monetary policy shift would likely support market gains in the latter part of the year.

2. **Economic Growth**: RBC Capital Markets noted that environments with 2-4% real GDP growth tend to be strong for stocks, with a median annual gain of 11.8%[5]. Their models suggested this economic backdrop would support the S&P 500 being above 5,300 by year-end.

3. **Post-Election Market Dynamics**: Goldman Sachs predicted that the resolution of election uncertainty would lift U.S. equity prices in the latter part of 2024[2]. With the U.S. elections occurring in November, December could potentially benefit from reduced political uncertainty.

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

Several reputable financial institutions have provided forecasts for the S&P 500 in 2024:

- **Goldman Sachs Research**: Their October 2024 forecast suggested a 4% increase through December 2024[4].

- **RBC Capital Markets**: Their April 2024 analysis used five different models to arrive at a year-end target of 5,300[5].

- **Fundstrat Advisors**: Tom Lee, Head of Investments, called for a year-end target of 5,200[1].

- **CNBC**: Jim Cramer forecasted the S&P 500 to reach 5,000 by the end of 2024[1].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors could impact the accuracy of these forecasts:

1. **Valuation Concerns**: Goldman Sachs noted earlier that the S&P 500's price-to-earnings ratio was trading in the 87th percentile since 1976, suggesting potentially limited upside due to high valuations[2].

2. **Forecast Variability**: RBC Capital Markets acknowledged a range in their forecast models from 5,075 to nearly 5,400, highlighting the inherent uncertainty in market predictions[5].

3. **Timing of Fed Policy Changes**: While analysts expected Fed rate cuts in late 2024, the exact timing and market reaction remain uncertain[2].

4. **Economic Data Dependency**: Market performance would likely be influenced by economic data releases and corporate earnings reports in the final months of 2024[1].

Based on the available information as of November 12, 2024, most analysts were forecasting growth for the S&P 500 through the end of 2024, with specific mentions of expected gains in December. However, market performance remains subject to various economic, monetary policy, and geopolitical factors that could influence the actual outcome.
