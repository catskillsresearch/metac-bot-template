# Forecasting Analysis: Will Kwasi Kwarteng Become Conservative Party Leader Before 2030?

As of August 4, 2022, I'll analyze the available information to assess the likelihood of Kwasi Kwarteng becoming the Conservative Party leader before 2030.

## Current Political Context

The UK Conservative Party is currently in the midst of a leadership contest following Boris Johnson's resignation. The race has narrowed to two final candidates: Rishi Sunak (former Chancellor) and Liz Truss (current Foreign Secretary)[1]. Voting among party members is taking place between July 13 and September 2, 2022, with results expected on September 5[1].

Kwasi Kwarteng currently serves as Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, a position he has held since 2021. He has been an MP for Spelthorne since 2010. There is speculation in July 2022 that if Liz Truss wins the leadership contest, she may appoint Kwarteng as Chancellor of the Exchequer[2].

## Historical Pathways to Leadership

Recent history shows that holding a Great Office of State significantly improves one's chances of becoming Conservative Party leader:

- Theresa May was Home Secretary before becoming leader in 2016
- Boris Johnson was Foreign Secretary before his 2019 leadership win
- Liz Truss is currently Foreign Secretary and is the frontrunner to become the next leader

The Chancellorship, which Kwarteng may soon occupy, is one of these Great Offices of State and has historically been a stepping stone to party leadership.

## Factors Favoring Kwarteng's Prospects

1. **Potential Appointment as Chancellor**: If appointed Chancellor under a Truss government, Kwarteng would immediately gain higher visibility and credibility within the party[2].

2. **Ideological Alignment with Truss**: Kwarteng and Truss have previously collaborated on the 2012 book "Britannia Unchained," suggesting ideological alignment that could position him favorably in a Truss administration.

3. **Professional Background**: His experience as a financial analyst and newspaper columnist provides him with economic credentials that could be valuable for future leadership considerations.

## Factors Limiting Kwarteng's Prospects

1. **Competition**: The Conservative Party has numerous ambitious figures who could seek leadership before 2030.

2. **Political Volatility**: Conservative Party leadership changes have been frequent in recent years (Johnson followed May who followed Cameron), but this pattern might not continue.

3. **Electoral Cycle**: The next general election must be held by December 2024. If Conservatives lose power, internal party dynamics would change significantly.

4. **Uncertain Performance**: As a potential new Chancellor, Kwarteng's performance would significantly impact his future prospects. Poor economic management could damage his leadership chances.

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on the limited information available as of August 4, 2022, I estimate the probability of Kwasi Kwarteng becoming Conservative Party leader before 2030 at approximately 15-20%.

This assessment considers:
- The significant but not guaranteed possibility of his appointment as Chancellor
- The historical precedent of Great Office holders becoming leaders
- The multiple contingencies required (successful Chancellorship, continued Conservative governance, timing of leadership contests)
- The competitive field of potential future leaders

This probability could increase substantially if:
- He is appointed Chancellor and performs exceptionally well
- He builds a strong support base within the parliamentary party
- He successfully navigates economic challenges

Conversely, the probability would decrease if:
- He is not appointed to a Great Office of State
- His performance in government is poorly received
- The Conservative Party loses power for an extended period

## Conclusion

While Kwarteng has a plausible path to Conservative Party leadership before 2030, particularly if he becomes Chancellor under Truss, multiple contingencies and uncertainties make this outcome far from assured. His prospects should be reassessed after the current leadership contest concludes and cabinet appointments are made.
