### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Since 2000, FBI NICS background checks have generally trended upward, with a dramatic surge in 2020 (over 21 million checks for the year), reflecting heightened demand during the pandemic and election year[2][3].
- After peaking in 2020, monthly background check numbers trended downward, but starting in July 2024, year-over-year monthly numbers began to rise again, with July 2024 showing a 4% increase over July 2023[2].
- Despite this uptick, the July 2024 numbers remained below the record levels seen in 2020 and 2016, indicating a recovery but not a return to peak demand[2].
- November 2024 saw a 2.2% year-over-year decline, suggesting the upward trend may have plateaued or reversed slightly[2].

### Recent Announcements and Policies

- There are no major new federal policies or regulatory changes reported that would significantly affect NICS background check volumes as of January 2025.
- The FBI has previously received supplemental funding to address processing capacity, but no recent announcements indicate a change in reporting or processing that would affect February 2025 numbers[4].

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The definitive source for monthly NICS background check data is the FBI’s official NICS Firearm Checks report, available on the FBI website[2][3].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- NICS background checks are not a direct proxy for firearm sales: one check can cover multiple firearms, and some checks may be for permit renewals or other non-purchase reasons[3].
- Delays or incomplete checks can affect monthly totals, though the FBI has worked to improve processing capacity[4].
- Seasonal variation: February is typically a lower-volume month compared to January and March, but year-over-year comparisons are most reliable for forecasting.

### Forecasting February 2025

- In recent years, February NICS checks have typically ranged between 1.8 million and 2.8 million, depending on broader trends.
- Given the July 2024 increase (+4% YoY) but a November 2024 decline (-2.2% YoY), and considering February’s usual position as a lower-volume month, it is reasonable to expect February 2025’s total to fall within the historical range, likely between 1.8 million and 2.5 million.
- The most authoritative and up-to-date figure will be published in the FBI’s NICS Firearm Checks report for February 2025.
