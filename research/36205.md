## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Since the escalation of the Russo-Ukraine conflict in February 2022, multiple rounds of peace talks and ceasefire attempts have failed to produce a lasting agreement. Early negotiations in Belarus and Turkey stalled over irreconcilable demands, such as Russia's insistence on Ukrainian neutrality and recognition of occupied territories, and Ukraine's demands for full Russian withdrawal and security guarantees[3].
- Temporary truces or limited ceasefires have occasionally been agreed upon, but none have held for a significant period. The most substantial attempt at a comprehensive agreement in 2022 collapsed after the Bucha massacre and disagreements over security guarantees[3].
- As of early 2025, renewed negotiations have taken place, with the US, Saudi Arabia, and European leaders playing mediating roles. However, Russia continues to demand full Ukrainian capitulation as a precondition for peace, while Ukraine seeks restoration of its territory and security assurances[2][3].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- In March 2025, Ukraine agreed to a US proposal for an unconditional 30-day ceasefire. However, as of early May 2025, Russia has not reciprocated, and the ceasefire has not taken effect[1].
- US officials have threatened to withdraw from peace talks if Russia is perceived to be negotiating in bad faith, indicating a lack of confidence in Russia's commitment to any agreement[4].
- European leaders have floated the idea of a "coalition of the willing" to enforce a ceasefire, but there is no indication this has materialized into a binding security guarantee[3].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The Atlantic Council, Institute for the Study of War, and major news agencies (Reuters, BBC) provide ongoing assessments of the conflict and negotiations[1][2][3][4].
- Wikipedia's summary of peace negotiations offers a comprehensive timeline and summary of positions[3].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- Russia's refusal to accept anything short of Ukrainian capitulation, and its history of escalating military operations, make any ceasefire fragile and likely short-lived[1][2].
- Even if a bilateral ceasefire is agreed, the lack of mutual trust, unresolved territorial disputes, and the absence of robust enforcement mechanisms increase the risk of rapid breakdown.
- The US and European willingness to enforce or guarantee a ceasefire remains uncertain, and their withdrawal from mediation could further destabilize any agreement[4].
- Measurement of the ceasefire's duration will depend on official declarations and the assessment of international observers, but minor violations will not necessarily end the ceasefire under the question's criteria.

## Forecast

Given these factors, if a bilateral ceasefire or peace agreement goes into effect in 2025, the most likely scenario is that it will be short-lived, potentially lasting only the minimum 30 days proposed, or less, before breaking down due to unresolved core issues and lack of trust. The historical pattern of failed or brief ceasefires, Russia's current maximalist demands, and ongoing military escalation all point toward a high risk of early collapse[1][2][3][4].

### Most Supported Duration Option:
- **'Less than 30 days'** or **'30 days'** are the most plausible outcomes, with a lower probability for longer durations unless there is a dramatic shift in the positions of the parties or robust international enforcement.
