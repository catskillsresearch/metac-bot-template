## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The Transnistrian conflict has been a "frozen conflict" since 1992, with Russian troops stationed in the region and de facto separation from Moldova[1].
- Transnistria remains strongly dependent on Russia, both economically and militarily, while Russia maintains a consulate and a military presence in the territory[2].
- The conflict is internationally recognized as a territorial issue of Moldova, but no significant progress toward reintegration has been realized in decades[2][1].
- The 5+2 negotiation format (Moldova, Transnistria, Russia, Ukraine, OSCE, EU, US) is now dormant due to Russia's full-scale war in Ukraine, making diplomatic resolution less likely[4].

## 2. Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Metric

- Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Moscow's ability to reinforce or directly support Transnistria has been sharply reduced, as Ukraine has blocked any land corridor from Russia to the region[2].
- Moldovan leadership, under President Maia Sandu, is not prioritizing a rapid resolution of the Transnistria conflict and is pursuing EU integration even with the conflict unresolved[4][5].
- Brussels has relaxed its previous policy of requiring conflict resolution before EU accession talks, opening the door for Moldova's integration without resolving the Transnistria issue[2][4].
- Dialogue between Chisinau (Moldova) and Tiraspol (Transnistria) persists on economic matters, but neither side is pushing for a decisive change in the territorial status quo[4].
- Russian influence in Moldovan domestic politics persists, including alleged attempts to destabilize pro-EU leadership[2][5].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- International media (Reuters, BBC, Euractiv) regularly report on the status of the conflict and any changes in control.
- Official statements from the Moldovan government and international organizations (UN, OSCE) provide updates on negotiations and troop presence.
- Think tank and academic analyses (Carnegie Endowment, Georgetown Journal of International Affairs) track changes in regional security and political dynamics[3][4][5].

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- Russia’s unpredictability in the region, especially as its military situation evolves in Ukraine, introduces significant uncertainty.
- Internal Moldovan politics could shift, but as of the latest credible reporting, there is no sign of a policy change toward a forcible reintegration.
- Transnistria’s own internal dynamics and relations with other Moldovan regions (e.g., Gagauzia) could affect future developments but are unlikely to make Moldovan control more probable in the short term[5].
- Measurement is based on credible, sustained de facto control by Moldova, not just temporary incursions or shifting front lines.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given:
- The continued Russian troop presence (albeit isolated),
- Absence of Moldovan political will or military capability to forcibly retake Transnistria,
- Diminished but persistent Russian influence,
- Lack of international momentum to resolve the conflict,

**The probability that Moldova will control more than half of Transnistria continuously for at least 30 days before 2028 is low—likely below 10%.** A sudden shift (e.g., Russian military collapse in Ukraine or major internal upheaval in Moldova) could change this, but as of April 2022 and through to 2025, no such drivers are evident in the factual record[2][4][5].
