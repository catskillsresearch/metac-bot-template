### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of October 2024, Wikipedia lists Twitter (now officially known as X) as currently blocked in eight countries: China, Iran, Myanmar, North Korea, Pakistan, Russia, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela[1].
- These bans are part of longstanding government policies aimed at controlling information and restricting access to Western social media platforms.
- There have been no significant policy reversals or credible announcements from these governments indicating a move toward unblocking Twitter/X as of January 2025[1].

### Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- No recent (up to January 2025) government statements or policy changes have been reported that would suggest any of the eight countries are planning to restore access to Twitter/X[1].
- The Wikipedia page on "Censorship of Twitter" is regularly updated and reflects current global blocking status as of the last available update[1].

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The primary source for this metric is the Wikipedia page "Censorship of Twitter," specifically the section on current blocks[1].
- Additional verification can be found in related Wikipedia articles on internet censorship in the Americas and Twitter features, but these do not indicate any change in the blocking status for the listed countries[2][3].

### Limitations or Uncertainties in Measurement

- Wikipedia pages can be subject to rapid edits, especially around high-profile topics, but censorship status for major platforms is typically well-monitored and consensus-driven.
- Unexpected geopolitical events or sudden policy changes could theoretically alter the blocking status, but there is no evidence of such developments as of January 2025.
- Edit wars or lack of consensus on Wikipedia could delay or complicate updates, but this is considered a rare outcome for straightforward censorship status listings.

### Conclusion

Based on all available information as of January 24, 2025, it is highly likely that Wikipedia will still list Twitter/X as "currently" blocked in China, Iran, Myanmar, North Korea, Pakistan, Russia, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela at the end of March 2025[1].
