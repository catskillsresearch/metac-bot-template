## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Global wealth per adult experienced a significant recovery in 2023, growing by approximately 4.2% after a contraction in 2022[4][5].
- The contraction in 2022 was largely due to currency effects, particularly a strong US dollar, but the rebound in 2023 more than offset these losses[5].
- Real (inflation-adjusted) global wealth grew by nearly 8.4% in 2023, outpacing nominal growth as inflation slowed[5].
- Since 2008, global wealth per adult has been on a steady upward trajectory, though the pace of growth has slowed in most markets[2][5].
- In 2023, adults in EMEA were the wealthiest on average (USD 166,000), followed by APAC (USD 156,000), and the Americas (USD 146,000)[5].

## Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Metric

- No major global policy shifts or economic crises have been reported that would suggest a reversal of the upward trend in 2024.
- Upward wealth mobility is expected to become more pronounced by 2030, with continued horizontal wealth transfer anticipated[5].
- The convergence of emerging economies with mature markets continues to drive growth, especially in the Asia-Pacific region[2].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The UBS Global Wealth Report 2024 provides comprehensive data and analysis on global wealth trends[2][3].
- The BCG Global Wealth Report 2024 corroborates the recovery and ongoing growth in global net wealth[4].
- The World Inequality Database (WID) remains the definitive source for the specific metric in question and will provide the final figures for 2024.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- The precise WID figures for 2024 are not yet published; forecasts rely on trends and projections from other authoritative reports.
- Currency fluctuations and inflation can significantly impact nominal wealth figures, though recent data suggest real growth is robust[5].
- Regional disparities and wealth concentration may affect the distribution, but the global average is expected to rise barring unforeseen shocks.

## Conclusion

Based on the strong recovery in 2023, the ongoing upward trend in global wealth per adult, and the absence of major negative shocks or policy changes, it is likely that the global average wealth per adult will increase in 2024 compared to 2023. However, the final resolution depends on the publication of 2024 data by the World Inequality Database.
