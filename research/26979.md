## Key Factual Information for Forecasting 2024 Atlantic ACE by October 7

**Historical Trends and Current Status**
- The Atlantic hurricane season typically sees the majority of ACE accumulate between August and September, with many active years surpassing 100 ACE by early October.
- As of early August 2024, the Atlantic basin had already reached 39 ACE units, about 40% of the normal full-season total, before the climatological peak of hurricane activity[2].
- The 2024 season is forecast to be well above average, with projections of 150–245% of the median ACE for the full season, and the lower end of the predicted ACE range was recently increased due to early activity[2][3].

**Recent Forecasts and Announcements**
- NOAA’s August 2024 outlook gives a 90% chance of an above-normal season, with a predicted ACE range of 150–245% of the median (well above the 100 ACE threshold)[2].
- Colorado State University’s early August forecast estimates 2024 ACE will be “well above the 1991–2020 average,” with all statistical predictors indicating above-average activity[3].
- Allianz and other risk analysts echo expectations for a highly active season, citing record-warm Atlantic sea surface temperatures and a developing La Niña as major drivers[1][4][5].

**Authoritative Sources for Verification**
- Colorado State University’s real-time ACE tracker and seasonal forecast reports[3].
- NOAA’s National Hurricane Center and Climate Prediction Center updates[1][2].
- Our World In Data and historical ACE datasets for context.

**Limitations and Uncertainties**
- ACE is a cumulative metric and depends on both the number and intensity/duration of storms; a lull in activity or weaker storms could slow accumulation.
- Forecasts are probabilistic and subject to change as the season progresses, but the consensus for 2024 is unusually strong for high activity[2][3].
- The ACE value on October 7 will not represent the full season, but given the early accumulation and strong forecasts, surpassing 100 by that date is highly likely in an above-normal or extremely active year.

## Conclusion

Based on the historical pace of ACE accumulation, the early-season ACE already observed, and the strong consensus among major forecasting agencies for a highly active 2024 season, the available evidence as of August 8, 2024, strongly supports the likelihood that the Accumulated Cyclone Energy of the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season will be greater than 100 on October 7, 2024[2][3][5].
