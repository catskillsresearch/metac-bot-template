### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- **First Attempt at Recovery:** The Galileo Project led by Avi Loeb is the first to systematically attempt recovery and laboratory analysis of physical material (metallic spherules) from an object (IM1) hypothesized to be interstellar and possibly artificial in origin[1].
- **Precedent of Null Results:** Previous high-profile claims of alien technology (e.g., ‘Oumuamua’s anomalous behavior, meteorite “microfossils,” UAP fragments) have, after scrutiny, either failed to meet extraordinary evidence standards or were explained by natural phenomena[2][4][5].
- **Ongoing Analyses:** As of early 2024, spherules recovered near the IM1 site are under analysis in three independent laboratories, but no peer-reviewed publication has yet presented evidence of non-terrestrial, artificial origin[1].

### Recent Announcements and Policies

- **Public Claims, No Peer Review Yet:** Loeb continues to claim new evidence suggestive of alien technology as of February 2024, but these claims have not passed peer review or met the strict criteria required for this question’s resolution[1].
- **Transparency and Multi-Lab Analysis:** The Galileo Project is sharing regular updates and involving multiple labs, which increases transparency and the likelihood that any extraordinary claim would be scrutinized by the wider scientific community[1].

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Direct updates from Avi Loeb’s project, reported in science outlets and major university news[1].
- Peer-reviewed journals in astrophysics and planetary science (where any definitive evidence would be published).

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- **Chain of Evidence:** The physical connection between the recovered spherules and IM1 is indirect; it relies on the recovery location and hypothesized dispersion, not direct observation of the impact[1].
- **Extraordinary Claims, Extraordinary Evidence:** The requirement for 95% confidence in both non-terrestrial and artificial origin, peer-reviewed by multiple labs, is an unprecedentedly high evidentiary bar.
- **Historical Skepticism:** No previous claim of alien technology in space material has survived peer review to date[2][4][5].
- **Time Constraint:** The peer-reviewed publication must appear before January 2026.

### Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the lack of historical precedent, the extraordinary evidentiary standards, ongoing but unpublished lab results, and the high skepticism in mainstream science, the probability that peer-reviewed evidence of alien technology (meeting all specified criteria) will be recovered from the IM1 crash site before 2026 is **very low**—likely **below 5%**.
