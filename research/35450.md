### Key Factual Information Relevant to the Forecast

- Donald Trump has been invited to address a joint session of Congress on March 4, 2025, and is expected to accept, but as of February 25, 2025, there is no official confirmation or transcript of the speech[1][2][3][4][5].
- The invitation and related news coverage emphasize broad policy themes such as "America First," legislative priorities, border security, energy, and taxes. There is no mention of artificial intelligence or technology policy in the invitation or in public statements about the speech[1][2][4].
- There are no public announcements, leaks, or authoritative previews indicating that Trump intends to discuss "AI" or "artificial intelligence" in this address as of the knowledge cutoff.
- The resolution criteria require that Trump must explicitly say "AI" or "artificial intelligence" during the speech, as verified by credible transcripts. Discussion of related topics without using these terms does not count.
- If the speech does not occur, or if the terms are not used, the answer resolves as "No."

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The American Presidency Project and other credible transcript repositories will be used to verify the presence of the required terms in the speech transcript, per the resolution criteria.

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- There is no transcript or advance text of the speech available as of February 25, 2025.
- The subject matter of the speech is not fully known, and while AI is a prominent policy topic, there is no evidence Trump will address it directly in this context.
- The answer cannot be determined with certainty until the speech is delivered and transcripts are reviewed.

### Summary

As of February 25, 2025, there is no factual basis to forecast that Donald Trump will say "AI" or "artificial intelligence" in his March 4, 2025, address to Congress. The available information does not indicate a focus on AI in the planned speech, and the resolution depends strictly on the use of those exact terms in the official transcript.
