# US-India Alliance Probability in a Potential World War 3

As of March 25, 2022, several historical trends and current developments inform the likelihood of the US and India aligning in a potential World War 3 scenario before 2060.

## Historical Context and Current Strategic Relationship

The US-India relationship has evolved significantly since India's independence in 1947. Unlike during World Wars 1 and 2, when India automatically entered as part of the British Empire, India now makes sovereign decisions about its alliances. The relationship has transformed from Cold War estrangement to increasingly close strategic cooperation in the 21st century.

By early 2022, several developments had established a foundation for potential wartime alignment:

- India was designated as a "Major Defense Partner" of the United States in 2016, creating a unique status for defense cooperation[5]
- The two nations established the "2+2" Ministerial Dialogue format in 2018, bringing together foreign and defense ministers to coordinate strategic policies
- Bilateral defense trade grew from near-zero in 2008 to over $20 billion by 2020
- India signed all four foundational defense agreements with the US by 2020, facilitating deeper military cooperation:
  - LEMOA (2016): Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement
  - COMCASA (2018): Communications Compatibility and Security Agreement
  - BECA (2020): Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement
  - ISA (2020): Industrial Security Annex

## Convergent Strategic Interests

Several shared strategic concerns point toward potential alignment in a major conflict:

1. **China containment**: Both nations view China's expanding influence and territorial assertions as a significant security challenge, particularly in the Indo-Pacific region
2. **Counterterrorism**: Shared concerns about terrorist threats from groups operating in South Asia
3. **Maritime security**: Common interest in protecting sea lanes and freedom of navigation
4. **Democratic values**: Despite differences, both nations identify as democracies in contrast to authoritarian systems

The formation of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue ("Quad") including the US, India, Japan, and Australia represents an emerging security framework aimed largely at balancing China's regional influence[5].

## Factors Complicating Alignment

Several factors could potentially impede US-India alignment in a future conflict:

1. **India's strategic autonomy**: India maintains a longstanding policy of strategic independence and non-alignment
2. **Russia relationship**: India maintains close defense ties with Russia, with approximately 60-70% of its military equipment being of Russian origin as of 2022
3. **Energy dependencies**: India's energy security needs create relationships with nations potentially opposed to US interests
4. **Regional priorities**: India's primary security concerns focus on its immediate neighborhood (Pakistan, China), while US priorities may differ
5. **Economic integration with China**: Despite border tensions, India-China trade exceeded $125 billion in 2021

## Comparative Analysis with Previous World Wars

Unlike previous world wars where colonial status determined India's entry, several key differences affect the forecast:

| Factor | World Wars 1 & 2 | Potential World War 3 |
|--------|-----------------|----------------------|
| Indian sovereignty | British colony | Independent nation |
| Decision-making | Imperial dictate | Sovereign calculation |
| Strategic doctrine | Imperial defense | Strategic autonomy |
| Major adversaries | Germany/Japan | Potentially China/Russia |
| Indian military capability | Expeditionary force | Nuclear-armed power |
| US-India relationship | Indirect (via UK) | Direct bilateral ties |

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on information available as of March 2022, the probability of US-India alignment in a potential World War 3 before 2060 can be assessed as follows:

- **High probability scenario (65-75%)**: A conflict primarily involving China as an aggressor would likely see India and the US on the same side, given shared concerns about Chinese expansionism and existing security frameworks
- **Medium probability scenario (40-60%)**: A conflict centered in Europe or the Middle East without direct Chinese involvement would create more ambiguity, with India potentially maintaining neutrality while providing limited support to the US
- **Low probability scenario (15-30%)**: A conflict where Russia is the primary adversary of the West without Chinese involvement would create significant tension in India's alignment choices

The overall probability assessment indicates a **60-70% likelihood** that India and the US would align in a potential World War 3, with the specific probability heavily dependent on the conflict's primary actors and geographic focus.

## Key Uncertainties and Limitations

Several factors create uncertainty in this forecast:

1. **Leadership changes**: Future Indian and US administrations may significantly alter bilateral relations
2. **Technology dependencies**: Increasing or decreasing technological interdependence could affect alignment incentives
3. **Climate change impacts**: Environmental pressures could create new security dynamics
4. **China-Russia relationship**: The degree of alignment between these powers would influence India's strategic calculus
5. **Nuclear deterrence**: The presence of nuclear weapons fundamentally alters conflict dynamics compared to previous world wars
