### Key Factual Information for Forecasting Dallas, TX Rent Growth (November 2024, Zillow ZORI)

**1. Historical Trends and Current Status**
- As of October 2024, Zillow reports that rent growth has slowed considerably nationwide, with high levels of concessions and slow year-over-year rent growth expected to persist into November. This slowdown is attributed to a surge in new rental supply and increased vacancy rates, which are giving renters more bargaining power[1].
- Nationally, rental price inflation is declining to pre-pandemic levels. The Zillow Observed Rent Index (ZORI), which tracks new lease rent growth, has shown a significant deceleration in recent quarters[5].
- While the slowdown is clear, there is no explicit indication that year-over-year rent growth in Dallas has turned negative as of October 2024. The trend is toward very low, but still positive, growth rates.

**2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric**
- There are no Dallas-specific policy changes or announcements in the available sources that would uniquely affect November 2024 rents.
- The broader context is one of increased rental supply and higher vacancies, which generally suppress rent growth but do not guarantee outright declines[5].

**3. Authoritative Sources for Verification**
- The definitive source for this metric is Zillow's Housing Data page, specifically the ZORI (Smoothed): All Homes Plus Multifamily Time Series for "Dallas, TX" (RegionName in the CSV)[1][2].
- The year-over-year change is calculated by comparing the ZORI value for November 2024 to November 2023.

**4. Limitations and Uncertainties**
- The most recent data available is for October 2024, and while it forecasts continued slow growth, it does not provide the actual November 2024 figure for Dallas.
- The forecast is based on national and regional trends, which may not perfectly match Dallas's local dynamics.
- The actual resolution will depend on the data released by Zillow on or after December 12, 2024.

**Summary Forecast**: 
Based on the most recent data and trends, it is likely—but not certain—that the year-over-year increase in rent in Dallas, TX for November 2024 will be greater than or equal to 0.0% according to Zillow. The growth rate is expected to be very low, possibly close to zero, but available evidence does not indicate a negative value as of the last update[1][5].
