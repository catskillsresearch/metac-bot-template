## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of May 21, 2022, there were no federal, state, or local U.S. laws restricting the amount of computational hardware or compute capacity an individual, corporation, or other entity could own or operate.
- AI regulation efforts in the U.S. have focused on ensuring safety, preventing discrimination, and promoting transparent deployment. Federal initiatives, such as the Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights (2022), outline principles for safe, effective, and fair use of AI, but do not propose limits on compute capacity[1][3][4].
- State-level legislative efforts have been largely aimed at defining and regulating high-risk AI systems, mandating disclosure, or preventing algorithmic discrimination—not restricting compute per se[2].
- U.S. regulatory philosophy has generally prioritized innovation and R&D leadership in AI, with a fragmented approach between federal and state levels[1][3].

## 2. Recent Announcements and Policies

- As of 2022, there were no announced plans at the federal or state level to impose compute capacity restrictions.
- The focus of major policy documents, including the 2022 AI Bill of Rights, was on guidelines for ethical and safe AI, not hardware or compute quantity limits[3][4].
- Post-2022 developments (for context): In 2025, the U.S. House passed a budget with a 10-year moratorium on states enacting their own AI regulations, signaling a preference for federal-only action and potentially less regulatory fragmentation[5].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- U.S. AI Bill of Rights (White House, October 2022)[4]
- Summaries of federal and state AI regulatory trends (Naaia, IAPP)[1][3]
- Legislative snapshots of state AI laws (BCLP)[2]

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- No existing or pending legislation as of May 2022 directly targets compute capacity.
- The rapid pace of AI development, emergence of new risks, or unforeseen events (e.g., AI-driven crises, major security incidents) could alter political will and regulatory strategies.
- Enforcement and measurement of compute capacity caps present significant technical and practical challenges, potentially deterring such regulation.
- Recent (post-2022) federal moves to preempt state-level regulation suggest a desire for unified, not fragmented, policy—potentially reducing the likelihood of piecemeal or extreme measures[5].

## Probabilistic Assessment

Given the absence of any precedent or movement toward compute capacity restrictions in U.S. law as of May 2022, and considering the U.S. regulatory philosophy favoring innovation and risk-based governance, the probability that the U.S. will impose legal limits on general compute capacity before 2050 appears low. However, this assessment must remain sensitive to the potential for policy change in response to future perceived crises or technological shifts.

**Estimated probability (as of 2022-05-21):**
- Likelihood of U.S. placing legal restrictions on compute capacity before 2050: **Low (~10–20%)**, barring extraordinary events.
