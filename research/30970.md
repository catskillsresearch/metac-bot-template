## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of May 2025, the Alternative for Germany (AfD) has been officially designated as a far-right extremist party by Germany’s Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), following a four-year investigation. This designation allows for extended surveillance and operational measures and is the highest level of classification for extremism in Germany[2][3][4].
- The AfD has achieved strong electoral results, becoming the second largest party in the Bundestag after the February 2025 federal election, and has maintained significant support, particularly in eastern German states[3][4].
- Historically, Germany’s Federal Constitutional Court has rarely banned parties since World War II. Previous attempts to ban far-right parties (notably the NPD) failed due to insufficient evidence or concerns about infringing democratic rights[3].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- In May 2025, a cross-party group of Bundestag lawmakers announced their intention to seek a ban on the AfD and have met the threshold (at least 5% of parliament) to bring the matter to a parliamentary vote, which is a necessary step before an application can be filed at the Federal Constitutional Court[1][4].
- The AfD has filed a lawsuit against the BfV’s extremist classification, arguing it is politically motivated. The party’s legal challenge is ongoing[2][4].
- Outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz and other leaders have cautioned against rushing a ban, highlighting the risks of political polarization and the potential for the ban to fail in court, which could strengthen the AfD’s position[4].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- BfV’s official classification and court rulings upholding the agency’s assessment[2][4].
- Statements and actions by Bundestag lawmakers and procedural requirements for filing a ban application[1][4].
- Reporting on the political and legal context by major news outlets[3].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- While procedural hurdles to filing have been lowered and momentum has increased, as of May 2025 no formal application to ban the AfD has yet been filed at the Federal Constitutional Court.
- Political leaders remain divided on the wisdom and timing of such a move, fearing backlash and further radicalization of AfD supporters if the ban attempt fails[3][4].
- The AfD’s legal challenges and its strong electoral base complicate the forecast.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the unprecedented step of officially classifying the AfD as an extremist party, the initiation of a parliamentary process by a qualified group of lawmakers, and the ongoing political debate, the probability that an application to ban the AfD will be filed at the Federal Constitutional Court before January 1, 2026, is **substantially higher than in previous years**. A reasonable estimate, accounting for both momentum and political caution, is **60-70%** that such an application will be filed before the deadline.
