### Key Historical Trends and Current Status  
Brazil’s labor laws traditionally allow flexible work schedules, including overtime up to two hours daily beyond the standard eight-hour workday[4]. The 6x1 schedule, while not explicitly prohibited, operates under negotiated terms or sector-specific agreements.  

### Recent Announcements and Policies  
- **2024 Reforms**: Focused on equal pay compliance, mandatory electronic labor/domicile systems, and mental health protections[1][3].  
- **2025 Outlook**: A proposed constitutional amendment (PEC) aims to modernize working hours, potentially introducing a 4×3 workweek, but no direct ban on 6x1 schedules is mentioned[1].  
- **Pay Transparency**: Mandatory biannual reports for companies with 100+ employees, emphasizing gender/racial pay equity[3][5].  

### Authoritative Sources  
- **Legal500**: Highlights 2024 labor law updates and the 2025 PEC proposal[1].  
- **Mayer Brown**: Details equal pay law requirements effective from 2023[3].  
- **Littler**: Confirms September 2024 deadlines for pay transparency reports[5].  

### Limitations and Uncertainties  
- **PEC Ambiguity**: The proposed work-hour amendment lacks specificity on 6x1 schedules, leaving its future uncertain[1].  
- **Enforcement Gaps**: Existing laws prioritize collective bargaining, which may perpetuate non-standard schedules like 6x1 without explicit bans[2][4].  

**Conclusion**: As of November 2024, Brazil has not announced a ban on the 6x1 work schedule, and no evidence suggests such a ban will occur before 1 January 2025.
