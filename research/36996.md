## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program continues to operate as of May 2025, with no immediate changes announced or implemented[1][5].
- A March 2025 executive order directed the Department of Education to propose changes to PSLF eligibility, focusing on excluding organizations with “substantial illegal purpose,” but did not terminate the program or change the law[2][5].
- The process for any substantive change—including termination—would require a negotiated rulemaking process, which is procedurally lengthy and unlikely to conclude before July 1, 2025[5].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- March 7, 2025: Executive order calls for regulatory revisions to PSLF, but explicitly does not enact immediate changes[2][5].
- April 4, 2025: Department of Education announced public hearings and plans for negotiated rulemaking to consider changes to PSLF, with a focus on refining employer eligibility definitions—again, not immediate termination[5].
- Federal Student Aid site (as of May 2025) confirms PSLF is unchanged and open to qualifying applicants[1].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Federal Student Aid website: Latest official status of PSLF[1][3].
- White House and Department of Education: Executive orders and regulatory announcements[2][5].
- National Council of Nonprofits: Advocacy updates and regulatory analysis[5].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- The Project 2025 Tracker spreadsheet is a community-maintained resource and may not instantly reflect official policy changes, particularly given the procedural lag and reliance on observable, documented policy terminations.
- Even if the federal process to terminate PSLF were rapidly accelerated, it is highly unlikely that all legal, regulatory, and administrative steps would be completed before July 1, 2025.
- The resolution depends not only on actual PSLF termination but also on the Project 2025 Tracker community marking the objective as "complete," which introduces additional delay and subjectivity.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given:
- The slow pace and high procedural hurdles for terminating a federal program like PSLF,
- The lack of any official announcement of termination as of May 14, 2025,
- The requirement for both legal termination and public documentation for the Project 2025 Tracker to update its status,

**The likelihood that the Project 2025 Tracker spreadsheet will have the objective to terminate PSLF marked as complete before July 1, 2025, is very low.**

**Probabilistic assessment: Less than 10%.**
