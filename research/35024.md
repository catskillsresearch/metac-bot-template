# Nvidia Stock Price Forecast for End of 2025

As of May 24, 2025, I've analyzed current market data and analyst projections to assess whether Nvidia stock will close 2025 above $134.29.

## Current Market Status and Historical Trends

Nvidia's stock is currently trading at $132.87, showing a strong technical position with the price above both the 50-day SMA ($114.44) and 200-day SMA ($125.99)[2]. The company has demonstrated positive momentum with 57% green days over the past month and a 14-day RSI of 70.64, indicating strong buying pressure[2].

The stock has experienced notable volatility (10.16% over the last 30 days), which is characteristic of high-growth technology stocks, particularly those heavily involved in the AI sector[2].

## Analyst Projections

Multiple financial institutions have published forecasts for Nvidia stock through the end of 2025:

- The consensus price target from 44 Wall Street analysts is $164.84, with projections ranging from a high of $220.00 to more conservative estimates[3].
- Alternative analyst compilations show similar targets: $161.82 (TradingView)[4] and $164.51 (TipRanks)[5].
- Near-term projections suggest a price of $143.78 by June 23, 2025, representing a 9.51% increase from current levels[2].

Some models predict potential volatility, with price targets for mid-2025 showing a range between $113 (minimum) and $192 (maximum)[1].

## Key Factors Influencing the Forecast

1. **AI Market Growth**: Nvidia continues to benefit from expanding demand for AI technologies, with its specialized GPUs remaining central to AI infrastructure development.

2. **Market Sentiment**: Current sentiment indicators show a neutral position overall, with the Fear & Greed Index at 39 (Fear)[2], suggesting potential upside if market confidence improves.

3. **Technical Indicators**: With the stock trading above key moving averages but showing an elevated RSI, some consolidation may occur before further advances.

4. **Quantitative Models**: Financial models suggest potential for significant returns, with one projection indicating a 28.42% ROI for investors by December 31, 2025[2].

## Probability Assessment

Based on the aggregated analyst forecasts and technical indicators, there is approximately a 75-80% probability that Nvidia will close 2025 above $134.29. This assessment is supported by:

1. The majority of price targets ($164.84, $161.82, $164.51) significantly exceed the threshold price[3][4][5].
2. Even accounting for potential volatility and more conservative estimates, the consensus remains bullish.
3. The company's continued leadership in AI chip technology provides fundamental support for price appreciation.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors could impact this forecast:

- Potential market corrections in the technology sector
- Competition in the AI chip market intensifying
- Macroeconomic factors including interest rate changes
- Supply chain disruptions affecting production capacity

While analyst consensus strongly suggests Nvidia will close 2025 above $134.29, investors should monitor quarterly earnings reports and market conditions for any significant changes to this outlook.
