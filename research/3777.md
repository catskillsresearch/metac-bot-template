# Forecasting Wild Animal Suffering as a Mainstream Moral Issue

As of April 14, 2020, the concept of wild animal suffering as a moral issue remains relatively niche in American society, though there are early indicators that could help forecast its potential trajectory toward mainstream recognition by 2200.

## Current Status and Key Indicators

Wild animal suffering is currently understood as the suffering experienced by nonhuman animals in nature through various causes including malnutrition, disease, predation, and environmental factors. Current evidence suggests that suffering often outweighs happiness in the lives of wild animals[1]. However, as a moral issue for human consideration and intervention, this concept remains primarily confined to philosophical and specialized effective altruism circles rather than mainstream American moral consciousness.

As of early 2020, there are several organizations working in this space:

- **Wild Animal Initiative**: A dedicated organization focusing on research related to wild animal suffering, which has received funding from effective altruism sources. In 2019, they received a transfer of $137,881 from the Effective Altruism Foundation (Wild-Animal Suffering Research) as part of a merger[4].

- **Academic Research**: Limited but emerging academic interest in the field sometimes referred to as "welfare biology," though not yet established in American universities as dedicated courses.

## Comparative Analysis for Forecasting

When forecasting whether wild animal suffering will become a mainstream moral issue before 2200, we should consider:

1. **Historical precedents**: Other moral concerns about animals (factory farming, animal testing) took decades to gain mainstream recognition. Factory farming concerns have achieved greater prominence than wild animal suffering, indicating a significant gap to overcome[3].

2. **Institutional infrastructure**: As of early 2020, there are organizations like Wild Animal Initiative with modest but dedicated funding[4], suggesting early-stage institutional development.

3. **Conceptual challenges**: Wild animal suffering intervention may conflict with traditional environmental values around biodiversity and non-interference with natural processes, creating potential resistance to mainstream adoption.

4. **Competing moral concerns**: Human-caused animal suffering (such as factory farming) receives significantly more attention than wild animal suffering, suggesting that wild animal suffering remains highly neglected as a cause area[3].

## Potential Pathways to Mainstream Recognition

For wild animal suffering to become a mainstream moral issue by 2200 (meeting the resolution criteria), several developments would need to occur:

1. **Academic establishment**: Expansion from philosophical discussions to established academic fields, eventually leading to dedicated university courses on welfare biology.

2. **Public awareness**: Significant increase in public recognition of wild animal suffering as a moral issue worthy of human intervention.

3. **Policy development**: Evolution from conceptual proposals to concrete policy recommendations and eventual legislation addressing wild animal suffering.

4. **Political integration**: Movement from fringe advocacy to inclusion in political platforms of major parties.

## Limitations in Current Assessment

The current forecasting assessment is constrained by:

1. **Limited polling data**: As of April 2020, there appears to be no reliable polling specifically measuring American public attitudes toward wild animal suffering intervention.

2. **Early organizational development**: Organizations focused on wild animal suffering are still in early stages with limited resources compared to other animal welfare organizations.

3. **Conceptual novelty**: The idea that humans should intervene to reduce suffering in nature challenges deeply held intuitions about natural processes.

## Conclusion

Based on available information as of April 14, 2020, wild animal suffering remains a highly neglected moral issue with limited mainstream recognition. While dedicated organizations exist and some academic interest is developing, the concept has not yet approached the thresholds described in the resolution criteria. The 180-year timeframe until 2200 provides substantial opportunity for evolution in moral attitudes, but current indicators suggest wild animal suffering would need to overcome significant conceptual and practical barriers to achieve mainstream moral status in America.
