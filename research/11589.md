## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Historically, major domestic armed conflicts in Russia (e.g., the 1905 Revolution, Russian Civil War, Chechen Wars) followed severe military defeats, state incapacity, and widespread popular or elite discontent.
- As of mid-2025, Russia has suffered significant losses in Ukraine and faces economic headwinds from sanctions and war expenditures. Still, the Kremlin has maintained control through increased mobilization, repression, and adaptation of its defense industry[1][3][5].
- Russia is actively rebuilding its military, aiming for a force of 1.5 million with significant reserves by 2030. The pace of reconstitution has been faster than many Western analysts predicted, and the state retains the capacity to suppress large-scale organized dissent[1][2][5].
- Unlike 1905 or 1917, there are no signs of mass, organized, and armed opposition movements capable of challenging the state at a scale that would produce a conflict meeting the question’s criteria.

## 2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- The Russian government is prioritizing military rebuilding, with efforts focused on sustaining and expanding defense production, even amid economic constraints[1][3][5].
- No major policy shifts indicate regime instability; rather, the state is further centralizing authority and increasing surveillance and repression to prevent organized domestic unrest[3].
- The defense industry has not yet undergone full wartime mobilization (such as mass conversion of civilian factories), which could be a warning sign if observed[3].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Oxford Analytica, RAND Corporation, and the Atlantic Council have published analyses detailing Russia’s military posture and domestic stability outlook through 2030[1][4][5].
- The Carnegie Endowment and Meta-Defense.fr provide context on the constraints and strategic decisions facing Russian leadership through the end of the decade[2][3].

## 4. Limitations or Uncertainties in Measurement

- The forecast assumes current trends continue; sudden shocks (e.g., a catastrophic military defeat, elite schism, or economic collapse) could rapidly alter the risk profile.
- Large-scale conflicts sometimes emerge unpredictably from elite power struggles or regional unrest, which may not be fully visible until shortly before an event.
- Measurement is limited by the lack of open-source evidence for clandestine opposition or coup plotting, and by the regime’s ability to suppress nascent movements before they reach the scale required by the question.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Based on available evidence as of June 28, 2022, through mid-2025, and compared to historical precedents, the likelihood of a large-scale armed conflict (per the defined criteria) occurring in Russia before 2030 appears low, barring drastic and currently unforeseen developments. The Russian state’s capacity for repression, its ongoing military rebuilding, and the absence of organized armed opposition are key differences from prior periods of revolutionary instability[1][2][3][5].
