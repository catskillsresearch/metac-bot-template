# Nikola Corporation Bankruptcy Risk Assessment

As of December 2024, Nikola Corporation faces significant financial challenges that have raised concerns about its potential bankruptcy. This analysis examines available information to help forecast whether Nikola will file for bankruptcy before January 1, 2025.

## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

Nikola Corporation has experienced substantial financial deterioration over recent years. The company lost almost 95% of its value over the three years leading up to early 2024[1][3]. As a former meme stock that went public through a SPAC merger in 2020, Nikola's market capitalization once surpassed that of Ford Motor, despite not having delivered any vehicles at that time[1].

The company's financial distress indicators are concerning:

- Nikola's probability of bankruptcy was assessed at over 82% according to Macroaxis analysis, indicating a "very high probability of going through financial distress in the upcoming years"[2]
- The company's market capitalization was expected to decline to approximately $663.4 million[2]
- Enterprise value was projected to fall to about $491.4 million[2]

## Recent Developments Affecting Bankruptcy Risk

Several factors have influenced Nikola's bankruptcy risk:

1. **Industry Context**: Multiple EV startups that went public through SPAC mergers have already declared bankruptcy, including Arrival, Bird Global, Lordstown Motors, Electric Last Mile Solutions, and Proterra[1][3]. This pattern raises concerns for Nikola, which shares a similar business model and market entry strategy.

2. **Delisting Concerns**: In May 2023, Nikola received a delisting warning from Nasdaq because its share price traded below $1 for 30 consecutive days[4]. This regulatory challenge added pressure to the company's already precarious financial position.

3. **Capital Raising Efforts**: Despite the negative outlook, analysts noted in early 2024 that Nikola "might not go bankrupt for at least a few quarters, thanks to the massive capital raise and the lower expected cash burn"[1][3]. This suggests the company had taken some measures to extend its runway.

4. **Production Strategy Shifts**: Nikola paused production while reconfiguring its plant in Coolidge, Arizona, to build fuel cell trucks on the same line with battery-powered models[4]. The company shifted focus to hydrogen fuel cell-powered Class 8 trucks with customer deliveries planned for Q4 2023, while reducing its battery-powered truck production to special orders only[4].

## Authoritative Assessment

Financial analysis platforms have provided quantitative assessments of Nikola's bankruptcy risk:

- Macroaxis calculated Nikola's odds of financial distress at above 80%, analyzing items from the company's balance sheet, cash flow, and income statements[2]
- The company's fundamental indicators, including Probability of Bankruptcy, were part of a valuation analysis that suggested Nikola was trading at prices inconsistent with its real value[2]

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors create uncertainty in forecasting Nikola's bankruptcy risk:

1. **Market Volatility**: As a former meme stock, Nikola has experienced significant price volatility that may not always reflect fundamental business performance[1][3]

2. **Capital Raising Potential**: The company's ability to raise additional capital could significantly impact its short-term survival prospects, though this becomes increasingly difficult as financial conditions deteriorate

3. **Production Timeline Execution**: Nikola's ability to successfully transition to fuel cell truck production and generate revenue remains a critical variable

4. **Competitive Landscape**: The broader EV market conditions and competitive pressures continue to evolve rapidly

## Conclusion

Based on available information, Nikola Corporation faced severe financial challenges as of December 2024, with quantitative models suggesting a high probability of bankruptcy. While the company had taken measures to extend its runway through capital raising and operational adjustments, the overall financial trajectory remained concerning, with multiple similar companies in the sector having already filed for bankruptcy. The question of whether Nikola would file for bankruptcy before January 1, 2025, remained uncertain but represented a significant risk given the company's financial indicators.
