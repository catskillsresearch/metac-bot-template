**Key Historical Trends and Current Status**
- Anthropic has released major Claude versions on an approximately annual cycle: Claude 2 in July 2023 and Claude 3 in March 2024[1]. 
- The most recent official release, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, was in February 2025, indicating that iterative updates continue but not yet a "Claude 4"[5].
- As of May 16, 2025, there is no official announcement or confirmed date for the public release of Claude 4[2][3][4].

**Recent Announcements/Policies**
- Industry speculation and rumors point to an anticipated debut of Claude 4 in early to mid-2025, but these remain unverified and have not been substantiated by Anthropic[2][3].
- There is no indication that public, unrestricted access (without a waitlist or early access program) has been enabled as of the current date.

**Authoritative Sources for Verification**
- Metaculus and PromptLayer track official and unofficial updates and both report no confirmed release as of mid-May 2025[1][2].
- Wikipedia and other aggregator sites also show the most recent release as Claude 3.7 Sonnet, with no mention of Claude 4 availability to the general public[5].

**Limitations and Uncertainties**
- Anthropic could announce and release Claude 4 on short notice, potentially enabling public access before July 1, 2025. 
- The lack of official communication creates uncertainty; however, all credible sources agree that as of now, Claude 4 is not accessible to the general public[2][3][4].
- Measurement is limited by Anthropic's communication policies and the lag in public reporting.

**Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment**
- Given the historical release cadence, industry expectations, and absence of an official release or public access as of May 16, 2025, the probability that Claude 4 will be available to the general public before July 1, 2025, appears moderate but uncertain.
- If Anthropic follows prior patterns, a release in the next six weeks is possible but not guaranteed. A reasonable forecast might estimate the probability at around 40â€“60%, weighted toward "No" absent imminent official announcements.
