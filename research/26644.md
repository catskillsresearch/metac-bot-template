The Spanish Wikipedia had 1,968,552 articles as of June 24, 2024. Historical growth rates show an increase of about 7,000 to 8,500 articles per month over the past two years. To reach 2 million articles, it needs approximately 31,448 more articles from that date.

At the current pace of roughly 8,000 articles per month, it would take nearly 4 months from late June 2024 to surpass 2 million articles, placing the milestone around late October 2024. Therefore, it is unlikely that the Spanish Wikipedia will first exceed 2 million articles between September 15 and October 1, 2024. It will probably reach that milestone shortly after this period.

The official Spanish Wikipedia statistics page (Especial:Estad√≠sticas) will provide the definitive count for verification when the milestone is reached. No known changes in article counting methodology or policies affecting article creation have been reported that would significantly alter this forecast[1][2][4].
