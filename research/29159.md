# Will at least 200 Benin Bronzes go from the British Museum to Nigeria before January 1, 2025?

Based on available information as of October 2024, it appears highly unlikely that at least 200 Benin Bronzes will be transferred from the British Museum to Nigeria before January 1, 2025.

## Current Status of Benin Bronzes at the British Museum

The British Museum has maintained a firm position against returning the Benin Bronzes in its collection. Despite formal requests from Nigeria dating back to March 2002 and diplomatic discussions, including a visit by the British Museum's director to Nigeria in 2018, the institution "hasn't returned any of the Benin Bronzes" as of mid-2023[1]. The museum has cited legal constraints as the primary reason for its reluctance to repatriate these artifacts.

The British Museum reportedly holds more than 900 Benin Bronzes in its collection, making it one of the largest repositories of these artifacts outside Nigeria. Despite increasing international pressure and changing attitudes toward colonial-era acquisitions, the museum has consistently maintained that it is "bound by law not to give away its collections."

## Recent Developments in Repatriation Efforts

While the British Museum has not made concrete moves toward repatriation, other institutions have begun returning Benin Bronzes:

- In July 2024, the University of Iowa's Stanley Museum of Art became the first U.S. institution to return Benin Bronzes directly to the Oba of Nigeria in a ceremony at the Benin Palace[3].
- The Smithsonian Institution's Board of Regents voted in 2022 to deaccession 29 Benin Bronzes in its collections for return to Nigeria[4].
- Several British university and regional collections have been "pushing ahead with plans to return their Benin artifacts to Nigeria" as of April 2023[5].

These developments indicate a shifting landscape regarding the repatriation of Benin Bronzes, but they do not suggest that the British Museum will follow suit with a large-scale return before January 2025.

## Challenges and Considerations

Several factors complicate the potential return of Benin Bronzes:

1. **Legal Constraints**: The British Museum operates under the British Museum Act of 1963, which generally prohibits the deaccessioning of items in its collection except under very specific circumstances.

2. **Internal Nigerian Debates**: There are ongoing discussions within Nigeria about where returned artifacts should be housed and how they should be used, which could affect repatriation negotiations[2].

3. **Museum Standards Concerns**: Some Western institutions have expressed concerns about "present museum standards in Nigeria," citing historical thefts that occurred between 1980 and 2000[5].

4. **Political Transitions**: Changes in Nigerian leadership, such as the transition from President Buhari to President-elect Tinubu (as of the information available), may impact ongoing negotiations regarding cultural heritage returns[5].

5. **Institutional Resistance**: The British Museum has consistently maintained its position against returning the Benin Bronzes, even as other institutions have begun repatriation efforts.

## Verification Sources

The most authoritative sources for tracking this issue would include:

1. Official statements from the British Museum regarding its Benin Bronzes collection
2. Announcements from Nigeria's National Commission for Museums and Monuments (NCMM)
3. British government policy statements on cultural heritage repatriation
4. Reports from international cultural organizations such as UNESCO

## Limitations and Uncertainties

There are several limitations to consider when forecasting this outcome:

1. The British Museum could theoretically change its position rapidly in response to political pressure or policy changes.
2. Loan arrangements rather than permanent returns might be negotiated as an intermediate step.
3. Legal interpretations of the British Museum Act could evolve to permit returns under certain conditions.
4. International agreements or treaties could potentially override existing legal constraints.

However, given the British Museum's consistent position against returning these artifacts, the legal frameworks currently in place, and the absence of any announced plans for large-scale returns, it appears highly unlikely that 200 or more Benin Bronzes will be transferred from the British Museum to Nigeria before January 1, 2025.
