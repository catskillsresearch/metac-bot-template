# US Federal Interest Rate Forecast: End of 2025

As of May 13, 2025, I'm analyzing the likelihood that the US federal interest rates at the end of 2025 will be lower than the end of 2024 benchmark of 4.33%.

## Current Situation Assessment

The Federal Reserve has maintained the federal funds rate at 4.25%-4.50% for three consecutive meetings through May 2025[2]. This represents a period of rate stability following the tightening cycle that began in 2022 and the subsequent rate cuts initiated in September 2024 as mentioned in the question description.

The most recent Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting in May 2025 resulted in no change to the target rate, as officials have adopted a cautious "wait-and-see" approach amid economic uncertainties[2]. Chair Powell indicated during the press conference that the Fed "does not need to rush into adjusting interest rates" and "can afford to be patient, monitoring incoming data"[2].

## Key Factors Affecting the Forecast

Several critical factors will influence the trajectory of interest rates through the remainder of 2025:

### 1. Inflation Concerns

The Fed projects elevated inflation due to tariff policies, with Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) inflation expected to end 2025 at 2.7%[5]. This remains above the Fed's long-term target of 2%, creating tension between inflation control and economic growth objectives.

### 2. Economic Growth Projections

Real GDP growth is projected to slow from 2.3% in Q4 2024 to 1.7% for 2025[5]. This slowdown could potentially prompt the Fed to implement rate cuts to stimulate economic activity.

### 3. FOMC Dot Plot Projections

The March 2025 Fed dot plot projects a 50 basis point reduction in the fed funds rate during 2025[5]. If implemented as projected, this would reduce the target range from the current 4.25%-4.50% to approximately 3.75%-4.00% by year-end.

### 4. Policy Uncertainty

The Fed has noted "heightened uncertainty about the economic outlook" and that "the risks of higher unemployment and higher inflation have risen"[2]. Chair Powell specifically mentioned that "it's too early to determine whether inflation or unemployment will emerge as the greater concern"[2].

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on the available data and projections as of May 2025, there is a strong likelihood that the Effective Federal Funds Rate will be below 4.33% by December 31, 2025. This assessment is supported by:

1. The March 2025 FOMC projections explicitly forecast a 50 basis point reduction in 2025[5]. If implemented, this would bring the target range to 3.75%-4.00%, with the effective rate likely falling below the 4.33% threshold.

2. Market expectations align with the Fed's projections, anticipating potential 25 basis point rate cuts in upcoming FOMC meetings[4].

3. The slowing economic growth forecast (1.7% for 2025) creates conditions that typically prompt monetary easing[5].

However, several factors could delay or prevent rate cuts:

1. Persistent inflation concerns, with PCE inflation projected at 2.7% by end of 2025[5], may require maintaining higher rates to control price pressures.

2. The Fed's explicit "wait-and-see" approach indicates they are not committed to a predetermined rate path and will remain data-dependent[2].

## Conclusion

The preponderance of evidence suggests the Federal Reserve will implement rate cuts sufficient to bring the Effective Federal Funds Rate below 4.33% by December 31, 2025, in line with their own projections from March 2025. However, this outcome remains contingent on inflation trending toward target levels and economic conditions evolving as expected.

The most significant risk to this forecast is the potential for inflation to remain stubbornly above target due to tariff impacts and other factors, which could prompt the Fed to maintain higher rates for longer than currently projected.
