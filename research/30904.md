# Forecasting US Federal Interest Rates: End of 2025 vs. End of 2024

As of May 25, 2025, I'll analyze whether US federal interest rates at the end of 2025 will be lower than at the end of 2024 (specifically, below 4.33%).

## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

The Federal Reserve has maintained a steady interest rate policy in early 2025, keeping the federal funds rate at 4.25%â€“4.50% for three consecutive meetings through May 2025[2]. This follows the March 2025 Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting where rates were also held steady at 4.5%[1]. The Fed has adopted a cautious "wait-and-see" approach amid economic uncertainty, particularly concerning the potential impacts of tariff policies on inflation and economic growth[2].

The US economy experienced an unexpected contraction of 0.3% in Q1 2025, primarily attributed to a surge in imports as businesses and consumers stockpiled goods ahead of anticipated tariff increases[2]. Despite this contraction, the Fed has noted that "economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace" overall[2].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

### Federal Reserve Projections

The March 2025 Fed dot plot (released March 19, 2025) projects:

- A 50 basis point reduction in the fed funds rate during 2025[5]
- Another 50 basis point reduction in 2026[5]
- A target range falling from the current 4.25%-4.50% to eventually reach 3.25%-3.50% by year-end 2026[5]

These projections remain unchanged from those made in the December 2024 Fed dot plot[5].

### Market Expectations

Financial markets are currently pricing in multiple rate cuts throughout 2025:
- 25 basis point cuts anticipated in July, September, and October 2025[2]
- This aligns with broader market anticipation of the Federal Reserve maintaining steady rates through the next few FOMC meetings before implementing potential 25 basis point cuts[4]

### Economic Factors Influencing Rate Decisions

Several economic factors are influencing the Fed's approach to interest rates:

- **Inflation concerns**: While inflation indicators such as CPI and PCE show easing price pressures, the Fed projects PCE inflation to end 2025 at 2.7%, with concerns that tariff-related costs may reverse the downward trend[2][5]
- **Economic growth**: Real GDP growth is projected to slow from 2.3% in Q4 2024 to 1.7% for 2025[5]
- **Labor market**: Despite current labor market strength, investors anticipate potential softening in coming months[2]
- **Balance sheet reduction**: The Fed has reduced its securities holdings by $2.2 trillion since April 2022 and will slow this reduction beginning April 1, 2025[5]

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on the available data, there is a high probability that US federal interest rates at the end of 2025 will be lower than at the end of 2024:

1. **Current trajectory**: The Fed's own projections indicate a 50 basis point reduction during 2025, which would bring the target range to 3.75%-4.00% by year-end if fully implemented[5].

2. **Market expectations**: Financial markets are pricing in three 25 basis point cuts in 2025 (July, September, and October), which would result in a 75 basis point total reduction[2].

3. **Economic indicators**: While inflation remains a concern, the economic contraction in Q1 2025 and projected slower GDP growth may necessitate rate cuts to support economic activity[2][5].

The resolution criteria specify that the question resolves as "Yes" if the Effective Federal Funds Rate on December 31, 2025, is lower than 4.33%. Given that the current rate is 4.25%-4.50%, and both Fed projections and market expectations point to multiple rate cuts in 2025, there is a strong probability (approximately 75-80%) that rates will indeed be lower than 4.33% by year-end 2025.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors could alter this forecast:

- **Inflation persistence**: If tariff-related inflation proves more stubborn than expected, the Fed might delay or reduce planned rate cuts[2][5].
- **Economic performance**: Further economic contraction might accelerate rate cuts, while unexpected growth might delay them[2].
- **Policy changes**: New fiscal policies or international economic developments could shift the Fed's priorities.
- **Fed leadership decisions**: The Fed has emphasized its data-dependent approach, meaning actual rate decisions will respond to evolving economic conditions rather than following a predetermined path[2].
