# Will the World Remain "Normal" Through April 1, 2025?

Based on available economic forecasts and global situation assessments as of February 2025, I can provide the following analysis regarding whether the world will remain "normal" through April 1, 2025, according to the specified criteria.

## Global Economic Growth Projections

The most robust data available relates to global economic growth forecasts, which directly addresses the criterion about a 30% GDP increase in one year:

Multiple authoritative economic institutions have published growth projections for 2025, all indicating modest growth far below the 30% threshold that would constitute an "abnormal" world:

- The International Monetary Fund (IMF) projects global growth at 3.3% for both 2025 and 2026, which is actually below the historical (2000-2019) average of 3.7%[1]
- EY's global economic outlook indicates that global economic activity is expected to maintain modest momentum with real GDP growth remaining stable at 3.1% in 2025[3]
- The United Nations' February 2025 economic briefing projects global growth at 2.8% in 2025, unchanged from 2024, and 2.9% in 2026[4]
- The OECD projects global GDP growth of 3.3% in 2025, up slightly from 3.2% in 2024[5]

These consistent projections from major economic institutions strongly suggest that a 30% increase in global GDP by April 1, 2025 is extremely unlikely. The world economy is characterized by "subdued global outlook amid persistent uncertainties" according to the UN's February 2025 briefing[4].

## Geopolitical Situation

While specific details about potential world conflicts are limited in the available data, the UN's February 2025 economic briefing notes that "ongoing conflicts, geopolitical tensions and potential trade restrictions, as well as climate risks pose significant challenges going forward"[4]. However, these challenges are presented in the context of economic growth forecasts rather than as imminent threats of world war or nuclear conflict.

## Other "Abnormal" World Criteria

The available economic and geopolitical data as of February 2025 does not provide specific information about:

- Progress toward artificial general intelligence development
- Population trends indicating potential for sudden 10% reduction
- Discovery of alien technosignatures
- Explanations for Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAPs)
- Imminent world war or nuclear weapon use

## Limitations and Uncertainties

The economic forecasts available represent projections based on current trends and known factors. As the UN notes, the global economy has "shown remarkable resilience" despite challenges[4]. However, these projections are subject to significant uncertainties:

- The EY outlook mentions "persistent services and wage inflation in several parts of the world" and notes that "risks to the global inflation outlook will be tilted to the upside given the prospects of increased protectionism, geopolitical tensions, derisking and demographic constraints"[3]
- The UN briefing acknowledges "ongoing structural challenges such as weak investment, slow productivity growth, high levels of debt, and demographic pressures"[4]

## Conclusion

Based on the available economic forecasts and global situation assessments as of February 2025, there is no indication that any of the specified criteria for an "abnormal" world will be triggered before April 1, 2025. The most robust data relates to economic growth, which is projected to remain modest and far below the 30% threshold. While geopolitical tensions exist, there is no specific evidence in the available data pointing to imminent world war or nuclear conflict.

The primary limitation of this assessment is the lack of specific information about technological developments (AGI), extraterrestrial discoveries, UAP explanations, or detailed conflict assessments in the available data.
