## Key Historical Trends and Current Status (as of June 2020)

- The FTSE Global All Cap Index represents large, mid, and small cap stocks worldwide and is a widely used benchmark for global equity performance[1][2].
- Historically, global equities have delivered real (inflation-adjusted) returns in the range of 4–7% per annum over long periods, though with significant decade-to-decade variation.
- As of early June 2020, the world was in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, which caused sharp economic contractions, unprecedented policy responses, and significant market volatility.
- Valuations (e.g., price-to-earnings ratios) were above historical averages for many developed markets, notably the US, but lower in some emerging markets. Interest rates were at historic lows, with central banks engaging in large-scale asset purchases ("quantitative easing") and many governments launching stimulus programs.

## Reference Cases and Comparisons

| Period           | Avg Annual Real Return | Key Context                         |
|------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1980s–1990s      | ~6–8%                 | Disinflation, global growth, tech boom |
| 2000–2009        | ~0–2% ("lost decade") | Dotcom bust, GFC, low starting yields|
| 2010–2019        | ~4–6%                  | Recovery from GFC, low rates, tech surge |

- As of 2020, the global market had partially recovered from the March crash, but uncertainty was high regarding the pace of economic and earnings recovery.

## Key Differences Affecting the 2022–2031 Forecast

- **Starting Valuations**: In 2020, valuations were not as extreme as in 2000 but higher than in 2009, suggesting moderate headwinds for future returns versus some past decades.
- **Interest Rates**: Ultra-low global interest rates support higher equity valuations but also limit future bond returns, making stocks relatively more attractive.
- **Economic Recovery**: The post-pandemic recovery trajectory is uncertain; potential for both strong rebound (pent-up demand, stimulus) or prolonged weakness (debt, scarring).
- **Policy Environment**: Unprecedented monetary and fiscal support, but also higher government debt and potential for future policy tightening.
- **Innovation/Disruption**: Continued technology sector growth and digital transformation could boost productivity and earnings, but also risk of bubbles or regulatory backlash.
- **Geopolitical Risks**: Rising US-China tensions, populism, and climate-related policies introduce additional uncertainties.

## Recent Forecasts and Community Assessments

- As of mid-2020, expert and community forecasts for real global equity returns over the next decade generally clustered in the 3–6% range.
- The Metaculus forecasting community (as of 2020) put the median forecast for 2022–2031 at about 5.2% real annual return, with the 25th to 75th percentile range between ~0.7% and ~9.6%[4].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- Forecasts are highly sensitive to unpredictable macro shocks (e.g., pandemics, wars, regulatory changes).
- Real returns depend on both nominal returns and realized inflation, which can diverge substantially from expectations over a decade.
- Index composition (e.g., tech sector weight), corporate earnings growth, and global capital flows may shift in unexpected ways.
- The FTSE Global All Cap Index methodology may change over time, though it is designed to broadly represent global equities[1].

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

- **Median 10-Year Real Return (2022–2031):** ~5% per annum, geometric mean, inclusive of dividends.
- **Interquartile Range:** ~1% to ~9% per annum (reflecting elevated uncertainty in the aftermath of the pandemic and policy responses).
- This aligns with both historical experience and aggregated expert/community forecasts as of 2020[4].
