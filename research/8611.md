## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- **Formalized Border and Cooperation Treaty**: Since the 1991 demarcation of their border and the 2001 Treaty of Good-Neighborliness and Friendly Cooperation, China and Russia have institutionalized friendly relations and resolved major territorial disputes[1][4].
- **Strategic Partnership, Not Alliance**: The relationship is characterized by what both sides call a “special relationship,” involving political, economic, and military cooperation, but falls short of a formal alliance[1][2][5].
- **Military Collaboration**: China and Russia have expanded military cooperation through joint exercises, high-level defense visits, and arms trade. These activities have increased since 2022, with joint exercises becoming more frequent and complex[3][4][5].
- **Shifting Power Dynamics**: China is increasingly the senior partner. Chinese analysts now emphasize the PLA’s growing qualitative advantages, and China has begun to lead some joint exercises, such as Zapad/Interaction 2021[5].

## 2. Recent Announcements and Policies

- **Reaffirmation of Partnership**: As of early 2025, both sides have reaffirmed their strategic partnership. Despite the strains on Russia from the war in Ukraine, neither side has indicated a move toward confrontation[2].
- **Expanding Interoperability**: Joint exercises are building interoperability and signaling deterrence to the U.S. and its allies, rather than preparing for bilateral conflict[3].
- **Potential Friction Points**: Russian commentators express concern over China’s growing influence in Central Asia and the Russian Far East, while the Middle East is emerging as a new area of potential friction[2].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Reputable analyses from The Diplomat and the Council on Foreign Relations provide up-to-date summaries of the evolving relationship[1][2].
- The ChinaPower Project and MERICS offer data and analysis on military exercises and strategic shifts[4][5].
- Official government statements and major news outlets will be crucial for verifying any future conflict events.

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- **Measurement Challenges**: The threshold for “war” is high (1,000 battle-related deaths in a year), excluding low-level skirmishes and proxy conflicts.
- **Geopolitical Shocks**: Leadership changes, economic crises, or shifts in U.S. policy could significantly alter the bilateral relationship.
- **Opaque Decision-Making**: Both countries’ internal policy processes are non-transparent, making long-term forecasts inherently uncertain.

## Probabilistic Assessment

Given the sustained strategic partnership, deepening military cooperation (albeit with shifting power dynamics), and the lack of territorial disputes or explicit military posturing against each other, the probability of a China-Russia war (as defined by the 1,000 death threshold) by 2035 appears low. Persistent friction points do exist, particularly in Central Asia and the Russian Far East, but current evidence suggests both sides prioritize cooperation and deterrence of the West over confrontation with each other. Barring major unforeseen geopolitical disruptions, an adjusted probabilistic assessment would put the likelihood of a China-Russia war before 2035 at under 5%.
