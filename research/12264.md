## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The thylacine (Tasmanian Tiger) was declared extinct in 1936, with no confirmed sightings since[2][5].
- De-extinction efforts globally have yet to produce a self-sustaining population of any extinct mammal. The most advanced cases (e.g., Pyrenean ibex, woolly mammoth) have produced only short-lived clones or are still in pre-embryo phases.
- As of October 2024, the University of Melbourne’s TIGRR Lab and Colossal Biosciences have achieved major technical milestones:
    - Completion of the most accurate and contiguous ancient genome for any extinct species (>99.9% accuracy)[2][5][3].
    - Successful editing of over 300 genetic markers into fat-tailed dunnart cells, the closest living marsupial relative and proposed surrogate[2].
- No live thylacine embryo or animal has yet been created or gestated, and scientific publication of key methods/results is still pending[3].

## 2. Recent Announcements and Policies

- The partnership between TIGRR and Colossal was announced in 2022, establishing a large-scale, well-funded effort specifically targeting thylacine de-extinction[1][5].
- In 2024, the team publicized the completion of the thylacine genome and progress in cell line engineering, both critical technical steps[2][5][3].
- Project leaders express confidence, with public statements forecasting the possibility of producing live thylacines within a decade[3].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- University of Melbourne TIGRR Lab and Colossal Biosciences official releases[1][5].
- Peer-reviewed publications anticipated but not yet released as of October 2024[3].
- Mainstream media coverage and scientific news outlets (e.g., Phys.org, Smithsonian Magazine)[2][3].

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- The main remaining technical barriers are in marsupial cloning, embryo development, and gestation—fields where no successful marsupial de-extinction has occurred.
- Claims of near-term success are based on genome and cellular milestones, not yet on viable embryos or live births.
- There is precedent for technical setbacks and delays in similar projects, particularly in de-extincting complex mammals.
- Absence of published, peer-reviewed evidence for creation of thylacine embryos or animals limits external assessment of feasibility and timeline[3].

## Probabilistic Assessment (As of August 2022–October 2024)

While the thylacine de-extinction project has made record-setting progress in genome sequencing and gene editing, the biological and reproductive challenges of marsupial cloning remain unsolved. Given the lack of precedent for successful de-extinction of any mammal via these methods, and particularly of a marsupial, the probability that a fully reconstructed Tasmanian Tiger will be born and survive at least three months before 2035 remains **low to moderate**.

**Estimated probability: 10–25%** that the criteria for a “yes” resolution will be met by January 1, 2035, barring unforeseen breakthroughs or setbacks. This estimate is higher than for most previous de-extinction projects at similar stages, due to the exceptional progress in genome accuracy and cell line development, but remains limited by the major unproven steps ahead.
