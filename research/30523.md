### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of April 2025, the global public health risk of H5 avian influenza remains "low" for the general population and "low to moderate" for occupationally exposed individuals, according to the most recent joint assessment by FAO, WHO, and WOAH[5].
- From December 2024 to March 2025, only 17 new human cases of H5 infection have been reported worldwide, with the majority directly linked to animal exposure and no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission[5].
- The CDC confirms there is no unusual influenza activity among people, including H5, and no sign of community transmission in the US[2]. The first US death linked to H5 occurred in early 2025, but without evidence of onward spread[4].
- The virus continues to circulate extensively among birds and has been detected in mammalian populations (notably US dairy cattle), but without the genetic changes necessary for efficient human transmission[5].

### Recent Announcements and Policies

- The WHO, FAO, and WOAH are maintaining heightened surveillance and regularly updating their public risk assessments, but they continue to judge the situation as not meeting the threshold for a PHEIC[5].
- H5 is recognized as a priority pathogen for research under the WHO R&D Blueprint for Epidemics, but no emergency-level interventions have been triggered[3].
- Candidate vaccines exist for pandemic preparedness, but no specific H5 human vaccine has been approved or deployed[5].

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The WHO's official Disease Outbreak News, the CDC's situation summaries, and the joint FAO/WHO/WOAH assessment provide the most up-to-date and authoritative information on H5 events and risk levels[1][2][4][5].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- The risk assessment could change quickly if there is evidence of efficient human-to-human transmission or a significant increase in severe human cases.
- Surveillance and reporting gaps remain, especially in lower-resource settings, which could delay detection of a shift in risk profile.
- The threshold and process for declaring a PHEIC involve expert judgment and political considerations, introducing some unpredictability.

### Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the current situation—characterized by rare, animal-linked human cases, no sustained human-to-human transmission, and official risk assessments remaining "low"—the probability that the WHO will declare any H5 avian influenza a PHEIC before 2026 appears modest, likely well below 20%. However, this probability could shift significantly if new evidence emerges of adaptation for human transmission or a surge in severe, unexplained human cases. The situation requires ongoing monitoring, but as of May 2025, a PHEIC declaration for H5 before 2026 is unlikely barring major epidemiological changes.
