# Forecasting Analysis: 2025 NYC Democratic Mayoral Primary Margin

The upcoming New York City Democratic mayoral primary on June 24, 2025 (with early voting starting June 14) presents a unique forecasting challenge due to the ranked-choice voting system and a crowded field of candidates[4]. Based on current data as of May 28, 2025, I'll analyze the potential margin of victory between the first and second-place finishers.

## Current Status and Polling Data

The most recent polling from Marist College (conducted in early May 2025 and released on May 14) shows former Governor Andrew Cuomo with a substantial lead in the Democratic primary race:

- **First round results**: Cuomo (44%), Mamdani (22%), Adams (11%), Lander (10%)[1]
- **Final round after ranked-choice tabulation**: Cuomo (53%), Mamdani (29%), Lander (18%)[1]

This indicates a current projected margin of victory of 24 percentage points for Cuomo over Mamdani in the final round of ranked-choice voting[1]. With less than a month remaining until the primary, this polling data represents our most reliable indicator of the potential outcome.

## Key Factors Affecting the Forecast

### 1. Ranked-Choice Voting Dynamics

New York City uses a ranked-choice voting system where voters can rank up to five candidates. If no candidate receives more than 50% in the first round, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated, and their votes are redistributed according to voters' next preferences[2]. This process continues until one candidate secures at least 50%.

The Marist poll shows Cuomo falling short of the 50% threshold in the first round (44%) but eventually reaching 53% after eliminations and vote transfers[1]. This suggests that while Cuomo has strong first-choice support, he also receives meaningful second and third-choice support from voters who initially preferred eliminated candidates.
