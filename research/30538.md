# Historical Temperature Trends and Forecast Analysis for Anchorage vs. Chicago: December 2024

To forecast whether Anchorage's lowest December 2024 temperature will be lower than Chicago's, we need to examine historical patterns, recent trends, and relevant climate factors.

## Historical Temperature Patterns in Anchorage

Anchorage has experienced extreme cold temperatures throughout its recorded history. The all-time record low temperature for Anchorage was -38°F (-39°C), recorded on February 3, 1947[3]. This was part of the most intense cold snap in the Anchorage area in the past century, when the Weather Bureau at Merrill Field recorded 12 consecutive days with low temperatures of -30°F or lower from January 24 to February 4, 1947[5].

Other historically significant low temperatures in Anchorage include:
- -37°F on February 4, 1947[3]
- -36°F on multiple dates (December 5, 1916; December 24-25, 1917)[3]
- -34°F on January 5, 1975, and multiple dates in January 1947[3]

More recently, in January 2024, Anchorage recorded a low temperature of -26°F, which was significantly below the historic average low of 10.3°F for that time of year[4].

## Recent Cold Events (2024)

The early 2024 cold snap in Alaska brought notable low temperatures to the Anchorage area:
- JBER/Ft. Richardson recorded -34°F (-36.7°C), which was the lowest reported temperature in the Anchorage area during this event[5]
- JBER/Elmendorf reached -24°F (-31.1°C), the lowest since January 2009[5]
- Campbell Creek Science Center recorded -30°F (-34.4°C)[5]

It's worth noting that climate observations have been available at Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport (the resolution criteria location) since Spring 1952, and the National Weather Service does not use the earlier Merrill Field observations when reporting daily records for Anchorage[5].

## Comparative Historical Data

The question provides two recent comparison points:
1. December 2017: Chicago's lowest temperature was -3°F, while Anchorage's was 5°F (Chicago was colder)
2. December 2022: Chicago recorded -9°F on December 23, while Anchorage reached -12°F on December 20 (Anchorage was colder)

This indicates significant variability in the comparative winter extremes between these cities, with either location capable of experiencing the lower temperature in a given December.

## Factors Affecting December 2024 Forecast

Several factors will influence whether Anchorage experiences lower December temperatures than Chicago:

1. **Arctic Oscillation and Polar Vortex**: The strength and position of the polar vortex significantly impacts winter temperatures in both locations. A weakened polar vortex can send Arctic air further south, potentially making Chicago colder than Anchorage.

2. **Pacific Weather Patterns**: Anchorage's temperatures are influenced by Pacific Ocean conditions, which can moderate coastal Alaska temperatures even during winter.

3. **Continental Effects**: Chicago's inland location makes it susceptible to extreme temperature swings, while Anchorage's proximity to water bodies can have a moderating effect.

## Measurement Considerations and Limitations

The resolution criteria specifies using data from specific weather stations:
- Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport for Anchorage
- Chicago Midway Airport for Chicago

It's important to note that microclimate effects can cause temperature variations within each city. For example, during the 2024 cold snap, different locations within the Anchorage area recorded temperatures varying by as much as 10°F[5].

## Conclusion

Based on historical data, Anchorage has demonstrated the capacity for extreme cold, with temperatures well below -30°F in its recorded history. However, recent December comparisons show variability in whether Anchorage or Chicago experiences the lower temperature. The early 2024 cold snap demonstrated that Anchorage can still experience significant cold events, with temperatures in the -30s°F in the greater Anchorage area.

A comprehensive forecast would require additional data on Chicago's historical winter temperature patterns and current climate projections for both regions for December 2024, which is not fully available in the provided information.
