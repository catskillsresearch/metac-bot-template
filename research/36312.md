# Forecasting the 2025 Reconciliation Bill's Deficit Impact (FY 2025-2034)

Based on the most recent available data as of May 26, 2025, I'll provide a comprehensive assessment of the projected deficit impact of the 2025 reconciliation bill over the ten-year budget window from FY 2025 to FY 2034.

## Current Situation Analysis

The House reconciliation bill is currently projected to increase the federal deficit by approximately **$3.3 trillion** over the ten-year budget window from FY 2025 to FY 2034, according to estimates from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB)[1]. The Penn Wharton Budget Model (PWBM) has recently updated its estimate to $3.175 trillion based on newer information provided by three authorizing committees[2].

This reconciliation bill contains several temporary tax provisions and spending increases that are scheduled to sunset within a few years of enactment. If these temporary provisions were made permanent, the deficit impact would be substantially higher:

- CRFB estimates the permanent deficit impact at **$5.2 trillion** through FY 2034[1]
- PWBM projects a permanent deficit impact of **$4.8 trillion** over the same period[2]

## Key Differences Affecting the Forecast

Several factors significantly influence the deficit projections:

**1. Temporary vs. Permanent Provisions**

The current legislation as written includes numerous temporary tax provisions and spending increases set to expire within the budget window. This approach artificially reduces the apparent ten-year cost, though historically such temporary tax provisions have often been extended[1][2].

**2. Baseline Assumptions**

The reconciliation instructions may be using a "current policy" baseline rather than the "current law" baseline typically used by CBO. This difference in baseline assumptions can significantly affect deficit projections.

**3. Committee Allocations**

The reconciliation bill includes both deficit-increasing and deficit-reducing provisions across different committees. According to CRFB, approximately $4.1 trillion of new borrowing from committees with deficit-increasing instructions is partially offset by nearly $1.5 trillion of deficit reduction from other committees[1].

**4. Interest Costs**

The CRFB estimate includes approximately $570 billion in additional interest costs resulting from the increased borrowing[1]. This is an important component of the total deficit impact that must be accounted for.

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on the available information, I assess the following probability distribution for the deficit impact of the 2025 reconciliation bill:

1. **Most Likely Outcome (70% probability)**: $3.1-3.3 trillion deficit increase
   - This range represents the current consensus between the CRFB and PWBM estimates for the bill as written[1][2]
   - CBO has released scores of individual titles but not yet provided a comprehensive estimate with interactions[1]

2. **Higher Deficit Scenario (20% probability)**: $3.3-4.0 trillion deficit increase
   - If some temporary provisions are extended but not all, or if economic feedback effects are worse than anticipated
   - The bill could add $2.9 trillion to annual deficits by 2034 (6.9% of GDP)[1]

3. **Maximum Deficit Scenario (10% probability)**: $4.0-5.2 trillion deficit increase
   - If all temporary provisions are ultimately extended or made permanent
   - This would increase annual deficits to $3.3 trillion (7.8% of GDP) by 2034[1]

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors could significantly alter these projections:

1. **Final Bill Content**: The reconciliation bill is still developing, and final provisions may differ from current estimates[1][2].

2. **Economic Feedback**: These estimates may not fully account for macroeconomic feedback effects.

3. **Implementation Timeline**: The actual timing of revenue and spending changes could shift the deficit impact within the budget window.

4. **Interaction Effects**: CBO has not yet released a full cost estimate with interactions between different provisions[1].

The current estimates indicate that by 2034, the reconciliation bill as written would increase debt to 125 percent of GDP, or 129 percent of GDP if temporary provisions are made permanent[1]. This represents a substantial increase in the federal debt burden that would have long-term implications for fiscal sustainability.
