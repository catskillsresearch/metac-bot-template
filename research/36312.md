## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The 2025 reconciliation process is primarily focused on extending expiring tax cuts (costing about $4.5 trillion over 10 years) and making changes to major spending programs, especially Medicaid[5][3].
- Both the House and Senate have passed separate budget resolutions with widely differing allowable deficit increases: the House version allows for up to $2.3 trillion in deficit increases (with $1.7 trillion in required spending cuts), while the Senate version allows for up to $5.8 trillion (with only $4 billion in required cuts)[5][4].
- Recent precedents, such as the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, produced a net deficit decrease, but the 2025 proposals are structured to enable a large deficit increase, especially if tax cuts are extended without full offsets[3][4].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- As of April 10, 2025, both chambers have passed budget resolutions and issued reconciliation instructions[5].
- President Trump has endorsed the Senate version, but significant intra-party disagreement remains, particularly over the size of spending cuts and deficit increases[5].
- The reconciliation instructions are based on a “current policy” baseline, which differs from the CBO’s “current law” baseline and may overstate allowed deficit increases[5][1].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) will provide the official cost estimate for the enacted reconciliation bill(s), which will determine the question’s resolution amount under a current-law baseline[1][3].
- The Bipartisan Policy Center and Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget are tracking committee proposals and estimated impacts[1][2].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- The final reconciliation bill(s) have not been enacted as of April 2025; negotiations may alter the mix of tax cuts and spending reductions.
- The CBO’s scoring rules, particularly the use of current-law baseline and treatment of sunset provisions, can materially affect the final deficit estimate[1][4].
- If the House and Senate cannot agree on a single reconciliation bill, or no bill is enacted before FY 2025 ends, the question will be annulled.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

- The most likely outcome is that the 2025 reconciliation bill will increase the deficit by between $2.8 trillion (House allowable cap) and $5.8–$6 trillion (Senate ceiling) over FY 2025–2034, with a central estimate in the $4.5–$5.7 trillion range[5][3][4].
- The deficit increase will be determined by the CBO score for the enacted bill(s) under a current-law baseline, and could be lower if significant offsets are included or higher if more tax cuts are extended without offsets.
