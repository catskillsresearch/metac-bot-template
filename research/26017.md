### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- SpaceX’s Starship program has seen rapid development, but actual flight cadence has been slower than public goals. As of March 14, 2024, only three integrated test flights (IFTs) had occurred, with IFT-3 reaching 234 km altitude[5].
- Elon Musk stated an aspiration for “at least 6 more flights this year” after IFT-3, indicating an aggressive target for 2024, but this is not a guarantee[5].

### Recent Announcements and Policies

- As of July 11, 2024, there are no officially confirmed Starship launches scheduled between July 1 and September 30, 2024, on SpaceX’s official launch page or major launch tracking sites[1][2][3][4].
- Launch manifests are often updated close to launch dates, and Starship flights are subject to regulatory and technical delays.

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- Launch manifests are dynamic and may not reflect last-minute scheduling or delays.
- SpaceX’s history with Starship includes frequent schedule slips due to technical and regulatory hurdles.
- The lack of a confirmed launch as of July 11, 2024, does not preclude a launch being scheduled or occurring later in the window, but there is no public evidence for a specific launch in that timeframe.
- If more than one launch occurs, or none, the resolution would be “No.” If exactly one occurs and reaches 160 km, the resolution would be “Yes.”

### Summary

As of July 11, 2024, there is no confirmed factual basis to forecast with confidence that exactly one Starship launch will reach 160 km between July 1 and September 30, 2024. The intent and infrastructure exist, but no scheduled launch is publicly listed for that window. The situation is highly uncertain and subject to rapid change as new information becomes available.
