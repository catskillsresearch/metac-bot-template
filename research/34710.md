## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Donald Trump’s approval and favorability ratings have historically been low. Gallup reports that his initial 2025 approval rating is similar to his first term, reaffirming his position as the lowest-rated new president since 1953[1].
- 538 continues to track Trump’s polling averages, with a new average unveiled in late January 2025[2]. However, there is no indication from available sources that his net favorability has become positive.

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- Trump’s administration has focused on immigration enforcement and economic messaging, but these have not led to a significant improvement in public opinion. Polling suggests widespread anxiety over his trade policies and skepticism about his ability to address economic issues[1][3].
- While some Americans are optimistic about his ability to control immigration, most are pessimistic about his ability to heal political divisions or address economic concerns[1].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- 538’s polling averages are the primary source for net favorability ratings[2][3].
- Gallup provides historical context and recent approval ratings[1].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- The exact net favorability number for February 28, 2025, is not available in the search results.
- Polling averages can shift rapidly in response to major events, but no such event is indicated in the available sources.
- 538’s methodology and reporting could change, but as of early February 2025, they continue to publish favorability averages.

## Conclusion

Based on all available factual information as of February 9, 2025, Donald Trump is unlikely to have a positive net favorability rate on February 28, 2025, according to 538. His ratings remain historically low, and there is no evidence of a recent surge that would push his net favorability into positive territory[1][2][3].
