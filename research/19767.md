## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- No US aircraft carrier has been destroyed in combat since World War II. The last time a US carrier was sunk in combat was during the battle of Iwo Jima in 1945[2].
- Since then, the US Navy has made major investments in carrier survivability. Modern US carriers, especially the Nimitz and Ford classes, are exceptionally well-protected through layered defenses—missile interceptors, electronic warfare, point-defense systems, and advanced damage control[5].
- Live-fire tests (such as the 2005 scuttling of the decommissioned USS America) demonstrated that even older carriers could withstand sustained attacks from modern weapons for weeks before being sunk, and that was without active defenses or damage control teams operating[5].

## 2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- The US Navy continues to double down on carrier capability, with ongoing investment in new Ford-class carriers that feature stealthier profiles, modernized combat systems, and electromagnetic launch systems[2][4].
- New defensive technologies are being integrated, such as the HELIOS (High Energy Laser with Integrated Optical-dazzler and Surveillance) system, designed to counter advanced missile and drone threats[5].
- The Navy has demonstrated the ability to conduct sustained high-intensity operations from carriers, suggesting continued operational relevance and resilience even in contested environments[3].

## 3. Differences from Reference Cases

- The primary difference from the post-WWII era is the rise of credible anti-ship threats from near-peer competitors, notably China and Russia, which possess sophisticated anti-ship ballistic and cruise missiles (such as China’s DF-21D “carrier killer”).
- Modern wargaming and think-tank analyses indicate that in a major conflict—especially in the Western Pacific—US carriers could be at risk if faced with saturation attacks that overwhelm their defensive systems[2].
- However, no open-source evidence exists as of late 2023 or mid-2025 showing a successful attack that has come close to sinking or forcing the decommissioning of a US carrier[2][3].

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- While US carriers are extremely resilient, scenarios such as a major US-China conflict over Taiwan could present unprecedented risks[2].
- The fog of war, rapid technological change (e.g., hypersonic weapons), and potential surprise tactics by adversaries introduce uncertainty.
- Any probabilistic estimate must also consider US operational doctrine, which emphasizes risk mitigation—carriers are unlikely to be deployed within the highest-risk areas unless absolutely necessary.

## 5. Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the historical record, ongoing technological advancements in both offensive and defensive systems, the high survivability of modern carriers, and the US Navy’s risk-averse deployment patterns, the probability of a US aircraft carrier being destroyed in combat before 2030 remains low but is not zero. Most expert public estimates (as of late 2023) placed this likelihood well below 10%, but acknowledge that risk is rising, especially if a high-intensity peer conflict occurs.
