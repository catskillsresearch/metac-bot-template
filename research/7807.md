**1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status**

- Most civil wars since 1945 have occurred in countries with median ages well below 30, often in the teens or early 20s. Examples include Syria, Afghanistan, Libya, Iraq, and most of sub-Saharan Africa[1][3][5].
- Research consistently associates a "youth bulge"—a disproportionately young population—with an increased risk of civil war and political instability. The logic: large young adult cohorts can strain job markets, increase competition, and raise the potential for mobilization in times of crisis[1].
- Countries with median ages above 30—such as those in Europe, East Asia, and North America—have generally avoided large-scale civil conflict in recent decades[1][2][4].
- Sri Lanka provides an instructive reference: its decades-long civil war ended as the country’s median age passed 30, suggesting a possible demographic threshold for conflict risk[1].

**2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric**

- There have been no major recent policy changes or announcements (as of January 2022) that dramatically alter the link between median age and civil war risk.
- Global median age continues to rise, particularly in developed and some middle-income nations, due to declining birth rates and increasing life expectancy[3].
- Some regions are experiencing increased polarization or instability (e.g., political polarization in the US, protests in Europe), but these have not escalated to civil war in high-median-age countries.

**3. Authoritative Sources for Verification**

- United Nations and CIA World Factbook provide authoritative, regularly updated data on median age by country[1][2].
- World Population Review and Statista offer accessible rankings and summary statistics for cross-checking demographic data[3][4].
- Historical civil war records and academic literature substantiate the association between youth bulges and conflict.

**4. Limitations and Uncertainties in Measurement**

- Demographics are not the only determinant of civil war: political, economic, social, and environmental factors can also drive conflict, especially over a long forecast horizon.
- Median age data are subject to revision and may not perfectly align between sources, but both CIA and UN figures are specified in the resolution criteria[1][2].
- The definition of "civil war" is based on reporting by major international outlets, which could introduce subjectivity in borderline cases.

**Probabilistic Assessment (Adjusted Forecast)**

- Given the historical rarity of civil war in countries with median age above 30, and ongoing demographic aging, the probability of such an event before 2070 is low—likely well under 10%.
- However, the risk is not zero: unforeseen crises, institutional breakdowns, or unprecedented shocks could override demographic trends in rare cases.
