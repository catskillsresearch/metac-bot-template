# Will at least 200 Benin Bronzes go from the British Museum to Nigeria before October 1, 2024?

Based on the available information as of August 13, 2024, it appears highly unlikely that at least 200 Benin Bronzes will go from the British Museum to Nigeria before October 1, 2024.

## Current Status of Benin Bronzes at the British Museum

The British Museum has maintained a firm position regarding the Benin Bronzes in its collection. As of mid-2023, the British Museum had not returned any of the Benin Bronzes to Nigeria[1]. This cautious approach is primarily attributed to legal constraints that the museum claims prevent it from deaccessioning items in its collection.

Despite diplomatic efforts, including a visit by the British Museum's director to Nigeria in 2018 to discuss opportunities for sharing and displaying objects from the Kingdom of Benin, no actual returns have materialized from the British Museum[1]. The museum continues to cite legal barriers that prevent it from giving away its collections.

## Recent Developments with Other Institutions

While the British Museum has not returned any Benin Bronzes, other institutions worldwide have begun the process of restitution:

1. The University of Iowa's Stanley Museum of Art returned two Benin Bronzes to Nigeria in July 2024, becoming the first US museum to complete such a return[3][4].

2. The Smithsonian Institution's Board of Regents voted in 2022 to deaccession a group of 29 Benin bronzes to Nigeria's National Commission for Museums and Monuments[4].

3. Several British university and regional collections have been pushing ahead with plans to return their Benin artifacts to Nigeria, though these initiatives do not include the British Museum[5].

## Challenges and Complications

Several factors complicate the potential return of Benin Bronzes from the British Museum:

1. **Legal Constraints**: The British Museum operates under legislation that restricts its ability to deaccession items from its permanent collection.

2. **Nigerian Internal Debates**: There are ongoing discussions within Nigeria about where returned artifacts should be kept and how they should be used, which could potentially slow the repatriation process[2].

3. **Museum Standards Concerns**: Some Western institutions have expressed concerns about museum standards in Nigeria, citing thefts that occurred between 1980 and 2000[5]. These concerns have influenced negotiations regarding repatriation.

4. **Political Transitions**: Changes in Nigerian leadership, such as the transition from President Buhari to President-elect Bola Tinubu (as of the 2023 information), may affect cultural policy directions and negotiations[5].

## Conclusion

Given the British Museum's consistent position against returning any Benin Bronzes, the legal constraints it cites, and the absence of any announced plans for large-scale returns, it is highly improbable that at least 200 Benin Bronzes will go from the British Museum to Nigeria before October 1, 2024. While other institutions are making progress with returns, the British Museum appears to be maintaining its long-standing position.

The timeline (less than two months from mid-August to October 1, 2024) further makes such a significant transfer logistically impractical, especially considering the absence of any public announcements or preparations for such a major repatriation effort.
