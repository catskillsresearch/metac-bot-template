## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- **Jeanne Calment's record** of 122 years, 164 days set in 1997 remains the longest verified human lifespan as of 2018, and no other individual has been verified to reach even 120 years[1][2][5].
- The top ten verified lifespans all cluster tightly between 117 and 122 years, showing a strong plateau effect; the oldest verified men have not exceeded 116 years[1][2].
- The oldest living person as of December 2018, Kane Tanaka, was 115 years, 338 days old; even if she survived to 2050, her age would far surpass all precedent (146 years), an event with an astronomically low probability[1].

## Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- **No major breakthroughs** in anti-aging or longevity science had been announced as of 2018 that would plausibly raise the maximum verified lifespan by 2050.
- Verification standards for maximum age remain strict, with organizations like the Gerontology Research Group and LongeviQuest requiring extensive documentation[1][2].
- There is ongoing scientific interest in longevity, but no evidence of practical increase in the maximum lifespan plateau over the last several decades.

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- **Gerontology Research Group**, **LongeviQuest**, and **Guinness World Records** maintain and periodically update lists of verified oldest people[1][2][3].
- Wikipedia and other research databases regularly compile and cross-check supercentenarian records[1][2][5].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- There is a very small possibility that an unrecognized supercentenarian could be discovered and verified, or that future changes in verification standards or technology could alter the record, but such cases are exceedingly rare[1][2].
- Advances in medicine, biotechnology, or public health between 2018 and 2050 could, in theory, increase the maximum human lifespan, but no such breakthrough was evident as of 2018.
- Verification is subject to the availability and reliability of documentation, especially for cases predating modern record-keeping.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

- The **most probable outcome** is that Jeanne Calment's record of 122 years, 164 days will remain the longest verified human lifespan on January 1, 2050.
- There is a **low probability** (under 1%) that the record will be broken by 2050, either by a newly verified historical case or a current/future supercentenarian achieving a greater age.
- Therefore, the **forecasted value** for the longest verified human lifespan on January 1, 2050 is **122 years, 164 days**.
