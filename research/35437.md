### Key Factual Information for Forecasting Monster Hunter Wilds’ Simultaneous Online Players on March 21, 2025

**1. Historical Trends and Current Status**
- Monster Hunter Wilds is scheduled for release on February 28, 2025, making March 21, 2025, roughly three weeks post-launch[3].
- During the second open beta in February 2025, the game reached a peak of 180,372 concurrent players, with an all-time beta peak of 463,798 from an earlier event, indicating strong pre-release engagement[5].
- As of early May 2025, Monster Hunter Wilds was ranked #4 on Steam’s concurrent player charts, with 164,464 concurrent players[4]. However, this figure is after the forecast date and likely reflects some post-launch decline.
- On April 29, 2025, the game’s player count peaked at 110,715, showing a continued but declining player base as time passes from launch[1].
- In March 2025, Monster Hunter Wilds was listed with 68,667 concurrent players on Steam’s charts, though it is unclear if this is a daily average, a specific snapshot, or a peak[4].

**2. Recent Announcements and Policies**
- Capcom ran multiple open beta events, with the most recent in February 2025, available across all platforms simultaneously, which likely contributed to high engagement and anticipation for the full release[5].
- No major policy changes or announcements affecting player counts have been reported as of the knowledge cutoff.

**3. Authoritative Sources for Verification**
- The official Steam “Most Played” chart, sorted by “Current Players,” is the resolution source for the contest[3].
- Third-party aggregators such as SteamDB and ActivePlayer provide supporting data and historical trends[4][5].

**4. Limitations and Uncertainties**
- Player counts typically peak at or near launch and decline over time; the exact decay rate for Monster Hunter Wilds is not yet established.
- The “Current Players” metric at 4:00 PM ET may not coincide with global peak hours, potentially resulting in a lower count than the daily maximum.
- If the game does not appear in the top 100 or if Steam data is unavailable at the specified time, the question will be annulled per contest rules.
- Data from after the forecast date (e.g., May 2025) should be used cautiously, primarily as an upper bound or to illustrate post-launch trends.

### Conclusion

As of February 24, 2025, Monster Hunter Wilds is expected to have a strong but declining concurrent player base in the weeks following launch. The most relevant data points suggest that, at three weeks post-release, the simultaneous player count on Steam at 4:00 PM ET on March 21, 2025, will likely be between 68,000 and 180,000, with the most authoritative recent snapshot being 68,667 concurrent players in March 2025[4][5]. However, actual numbers may vary depending on player retention, time-of-day effects, and unforeseen factors.
