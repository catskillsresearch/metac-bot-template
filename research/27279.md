### Key Factual Information for Forecasting

**1. Historical Trends and Current Status**
- As of December 31, 2024, the CDC reported a total of 285 measles cases in the United States for the year[1].
- The CDC reported 167 cases as of July 15, 2024 (per your description).
- The pace of new cases accelerated in 2024 compared to previous years, with 97 cases in Q1 and 121 cases by April 11, 2024[2][5].
- The total number of cases in 2023 was 59, indicating a sharp increase in 2024[1].

**2. Recent Announcements and Policies**
- The CDC and public health experts have expressed concern about the 2024 surge, attributing it to increased outbreaks and lower vaccination rates in some communities[4][5].
- There is no evidence of new policies or interventions that significantly reduced case numbers between July and September 2024.

**3. Authoritative Sources for Verification**
- The CDC's Measles Cases and Outbreaks page is the definitive source for case counts and outbreak information[1].
- The CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) provides detailed epidemiological updates[2].

**4. Limitations and Uncertainties**
- CDC case counts are updated biweekly and may be subject to reporting delays.
- Outbreaks can cause sudden spikes in case numbers, making short-term forecasts uncertain.
- The December 31, 2024, total of 285 cases suggests that the number of cases reported by September 30, 2024, was likely below 300, unless there was a significant reporting lag or late-year surge.

### Conclusion

Based on the available data:
- The total number of measles cases reported in the United States in 2024 was 285 as of December 31, 2024[1].
- It is therefore unlikely that the number of cases reported by September 30, 2024, was more than 300 and less than or equal to 400.
- The best estimate, given the data, is that the number of cases on September 30, 2024, was below 300.
