## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of early 2025, coordinated teams of top human forecasters (such as those on Metaculus or Good Judgment) continue to outperform even the best large language model-based AI systems in rigorous, head-to-head forecasting tournaments. The first iteration of the Metaculus AI Benchmark tournament in 2024 saw every AI entrant—including advanced LLMs like GPT-4o—score below the human median, with distinct shortcomings in scope sensitivity and calibration[1].
- Despite this, the performance gap between AI and humans has been narrowing more quickly than many predicted. By April 2025, forecasters expected most of the gap between 2024-era AIs and human teams to close by the end of 2025, citing rapid advancements in AI capabilities and benchmarking surprises across several domains[1][4].
- Historically, AI systems have repeatedly surprised experts by achieving human parity on complex benchmarks earlier than projected. Recent years have seen AI match or exceed human performance on tasks once thought difficult, although forecasting complex real-world events remains a stubborn last mile[4].
- The general consensus among experts is that AI will have a positive and transformative impact over the next two decades, with a majority expecting continued rapid progress[2].

## 2. Recent Announcements and Policies

- The launch and results of the Metaculus AI Benchmark tournament in 2024-2025 have set a new standard for evaluating AI forecasting skill versus human teams. Its rigorous structure and transparent scoring have become a reference point for future comparisons[1].
- AI forecasting tool adoption has accelerated in business and finance, but these often target narrower, less ambiguous domains than societal forecasting tournaments[3].
- There is no indication of regulatory or institutional barriers that would prevent further AI-human forecasting competitions before 2030.

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The LessWrong retrospective on 2025 AI forecasting outlines current performance gaps and the rapid rate of AI progress, as well as expert expectations for the near future[1].
- Carnegie Endowment analysis highlights the frequency with which AI benchmarks have been surpassed faster than anticipated, emphasizing that forecasting remains among the hardest challenges[4].
- Pew Research summarizes expert sentiment on AI's trajectory and impact[2].

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- The main uncertainty is whether AI systems will overcome remaining weaknesses—especially in handling ambiguity, scope sensitivity, and open-ended questions—in time to beat top human teams in a sufficiently rigorous and well-audited tournament before 2030[1][4].
- Another uncertainty is whether enough such tournaments will be conducted with the required transparency, team-based human participation, and statistical rigor to provide a valid test within the 2028–2029 window, as required for question resolution.
- Human teams benefit from sharing reasoning, context, and calibration strategies in ways that current AI systems still struggle to emulate.
- There is also uncertainty in how "single AI system" will be interpreted if AI ensemble or tool-augmented approaches emerge.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

- Given the rapid pace of AI improvement, the narrowing gap in forecasting skill, and the expectation of continued progress, but recognizing the stubborn challenges and strict resolution criteria, the probability that an AI system will beat a team of human pros in a qualifying forecasting tournament before 2030 is estimated at **60%** (with a plausible range of 50–70%).
- This assessment is higher than it would have been in 2023 due to observed acceleration in AI capability gains and benchmarking surprises, but still reflects meaningful uncertainty about the timing and completeness of the remaining progress needed[1][4].
