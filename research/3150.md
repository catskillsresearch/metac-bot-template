## Historical Trends and Current Status

- Only two non-test nuclear detonations have occurred: Hiroshima and Nagasaki (1945)[1][2][5].
- Since then, over 2,000 nuclear tests have occurred, but all were controlled and for development or peaceful engineering purposes, not offensive use[3][4].
- The last known non-test detonation was in 1945; accidental or unauthorized detonation has never occurred, despite several “close calls” during the Cold War and afterward[2].
- The proliferation of nuclear weapons has increased the number of states with nuclear capabilities, but usage remains deterred by mutually assured destruction and international norms[2][4].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- The Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) outlaws nuclear explosions for testing, though not all nuclear states have signed or ratified it[4].
- Major powers have reaffirmed nuclear restraint, but modernization of arsenals and regional tensions (e.g., India-Pakistan, North Korea, US-Russia/China) add complexity.
- International efforts to secure nuclear material and improve command-and-control systems have reduced (but not eliminated) the risk of accidental or unauthorized use.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- Secrecy around military programs means some risks may be underestimated.
- Technological change (e.g., cyberwarfare, AI command systems) introduces new, poorly quantified risks.
- Political shocks (collapse of nuclear-armed states, unanticipated conflicts, or proliferation to non-state actors) are inherently unpredictable.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given 74 years (as of 2019) without a non-test detonation and ongoing (though imperfect) improvements in safety, control, and international norms, the base rate of such events is extremely low. However, the growing number of nuclear states, technological uncertainties, and persistent regional tensions mean the risk is not zero. 

A reasonable forecast, adjusting for new risks but also for historical restraint, would place the probability that no non-test nuclear weapon is detonated before 2035 at moderately high—likely in the 85–95% range. This reflects continued deterrence and restraint, but acknowledges nonzero risks from accident, miscalculation, or terrorism.
