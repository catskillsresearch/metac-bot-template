## Euro Area Annual Inflation Rate Forecast for July 2025

**1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status**
- After peaking at over 10% in late 2022 due to energy shocks and supply chain disruptions, Euro Area inflation has steadily declined through 2023 and 2024.
- By April 2025, annual inflation was reported at 2.2%[1][2]. 
- The latest flash estimate for May 2025 from Eurostat places annual inflation at 1.9%[1][2].
- The decline is driven by negative energy inflation (–3.6% in May) and easing services inflation, despite food inflation staying above 3%[1].

**2. Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Metric**
- The European Central Bank’s (ECB) June 2025 projections forecast HICP inflation for 2025 at 2.0%, a slight downward revision from prior forecasts[3].
- No major new monetary policy changes or external shocks have been reported as of June 2025; policy remains oriented toward maintaining inflation at the ECB’s 2% target[3][4].
- Consensus among major economic forecasters (e.g., IMF, Statista) expects Euro Area inflation to remain between 2.0% and 2.2% for 2025 as a whole[5].

**3. Authoritative Sources for Verification**
- Eurostat is the primary source for official HICP inflation data and will publish the July 2025 figure per the resolution criteria[1].

**4. Limitations and Uncertainties**
- Flash estimates may be revised, but such revisions are typically small.
- Seasonal factors (e.g., summer travel boosting services inflation, volatility in food or energy prices) could cause minor deviations in July.
- Core inflation (excluding food/energy) remains slightly above headline, indicating some persistence, but overall trends point to continued price stability[3][4].
- The forecast assumes no major geopolitical or economic shocks before July.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Based on the current downward trend, official forecasts, and absence of new shocks, the most probable outcome for the Euro Area annual inflation rate in July 2025 is **2.0%**. There is a moderate chance it remains at 1.9% if disinflation continues, but upward movement to 2.1% or higher is less likely barring unexpected developments.

**Most likely choice (with approximate probabilities):**
- 2.0 (**60%**)
- 1.9 or less (**25%**)
- 2.1 (**10%**)
- 2.2 or higher (**5%**)
