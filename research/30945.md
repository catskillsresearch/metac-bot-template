# Nvidia vs S&P 500: 2025 Performance Forecast

As of May 26, 2025, Nvidia continues to be a dominant force in the technology sector, particularly in AI and accelerated computing. To assess whether Nvidia (NVDA) will outperform the S&P 500 for the remainder of 2025, I'll analyze current market conditions, recent financial performance, and growth projections.

## Current Market Position

Nvidia currently trades around $132.87 with a substantial market capitalization of approximately $3.31 trillion[5]. The company's stock shows a bullish sentiment with 57% green days over the past month, though the Fear & Greed Index indicates some market caution at 39 (Fear)[4]. Technical indicators show Nvidia trading above both its 50-day SMA ($114.74) and 200-day SMA ($126.12), suggesting positive momentum[4].

Nvidia completed its fiscal year 2025 (which ended January 2025) with impressive results:
- Revenue of $130.5 billion, representing 114% year-over-year growth
- GAAP earnings per diluted share of $2.94, up 147% from the previous year[3]

These results demonstrate Nvidia's continued strong performance in the first part of calendar 2025.

## Growth Projections for Remainder of 2025

Analysts project continued growth for Nvidia throughout calendar 2025:

- Price forecasts suggest Nvidia could reach $143.78 by June 24, 2025, representing a 9.51% increase from current levels[4]
- Some forecasts indicate potential for Nvidia to reach $192 at the high end by June 2025[2]
- The company is expected to see quarterly revenue growth through its fiscal 2025, with projections of:
  - Q2 2025 (ending July 2024): $3.67 billion
  - Q3 2025 (ending October 2024): $5.42 billion[1]

However, analysts also note that Q2 may be "choppy" before accelerating in the second half of the year[1].

## Key Performance Drivers

Several factors support Nvidia's potential to outperform the S&P 500:

**AI Infrastructure Dominance**: Nvidia remains the critical provider of GPUs powering AI and machine learning infrastructure, positioning it to benefit from continued AI adoption[5].

**Diversified Revenue Streams**: Beyond AI, Nvidia has strong positions in gaming, data centers, and autonomous vehicles, providing multiple growth vectors[5].

**Data Center Growth**: The data center segment has seen explosive growth as cloud providers and enterprises invest heavily in Nvidia chips for AI workloads[5].

**Technical Indicators**: With 57% green days in the past month and trading above key moving averages, Nvidia shows technical strength[4].

## Risk Factors

Several challenges could limit Nvidia's ability to outperform the broader market:

**Valuation Concerns**: With a P/E ratio around 46.14, Nvidia trades at a premium valuation that may limit further multiple expansion[5].

**Market Expectations**: The high expectations already priced into Nvidia's stock may make it difficult to deliver positive surprises.

**Competitive Pressures**: Increasing competition in the AI chip space could pressure margins or market share.

**Market Volatility**: The "choppy" Q2 predicted by analysts could impact performance in the near term[1].

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on the available data, Nvidia appears well-positioned to outperform the S&P 500 for the remainder of 2025. The company continues to show strong revenue growth, maintains its leadership position in AI infrastructure, and demonstrates positive technical indicators.

Price forecasts suggesting 9.51% growth by late June alone would represent significant outperformance if realized[4]. The projection that investors could make a potential profit of 27.61% by the end of 2025 further supports this outlook[4].

While the historical difficulty of individual stocks outperforming the S&P 500 must be acknowledged, Nvidia's central position in the ongoing AI revolution provides it with exceptional growth potential that may allow it to continue its pattern of market outperformance.

The most significant risks to this forecast are Nvidia's already premium valuation and the possibility that market expectations have become too ambitious. However, the company's continued ability to exceed expectations on revenue growth suggests it may continue to justify its valuation through actual business performance.
