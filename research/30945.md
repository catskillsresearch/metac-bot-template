**Key Historical Trends and Current Status**

- Nvidia has dramatically outperformed the S&P 500 over the past decade, with a 75.6% average annualized return since 2015, compared to 13% for the S&P 500[5].
- In 2024, Nvidia returned 171.2%, while the S&P 500 (via SPY) returned 24.9%.
- Nvidia's 2025 fiscal year revenue was $130.5 billion, up 114% year-over-year, fueled by explosive growth in its data center segment and the launch of its Blackwell GPUs[2][4].
- As of early 2025, Nvidia’s market cap stands near $2.74 trillion, and its stock price hovers around $112.20 (split-adjusted), with a P/E ratio of approximately 38[5].

**Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric**

- Nvidia’s Blackwell GPU launch and rapid adoption have exceeded management’s expectations, with commercial shipments generating $11 billion in sales during the initial quarter and demand remaining high among major customers[2].
- The broader AI and accelerated computing boom continues to support Nvidia’s growth prospects, but there are concerns about sustainability, valuation, and potential competitive threats[5].

**Authoritative Sources for Verification**

- Yahoo Finance historical data for Nvidia (NVDA) and SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) will be used for official return calculations.
- Company financials and forward guidance from Nvidia’s official investor relations and press releases[4].
- Analyst forecasts from Benzinga, Nasdaq, and other financial media[2][3][5].

**Limitations and Uncertainties in Measurement**

- Forecasts for Nvidia’s 2025 performance vary widely, with price targets for year-end ranging from $107 to $521, reflecting significant uncertainty about earnings growth, competition, and market sentiment[3][5].
- Nvidia’s high valuation (P/E ~38) means any disappointment in growth or a rotation away from AI stocks could sharply impact returns.
- The S&P 500’s 2025 return is also uncertain; historically, two consecutive years of 20%+ gains are rare, but the index’s heavy tech weighting could support continued strength if AI enthusiasm persists.
- Most individual stocks underperform the S&P 500 over time; Nvidia’s probability of outperformance is higher than average, but mean reversion and risk of a pullback are meaningful[5].

**Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment**

Given Nvidia’s dominant position in AI, outstanding recent growth, and strong product pipeline, the probability that Nvidia will outperform the S&P 500 in 2025 is higher than for most large-cap stocks. However, elevated expectations, extreme valuation, and potential for mean reversion or sector rotation suggest the probability is lower than in prior years. A reasonable adjusted probability estimate is in the 50–60% range: modestly better than a coin flip, but with substantial downside risk if sentiment shifts or results disappoint.
