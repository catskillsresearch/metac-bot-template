## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Edward Snowden, a former NSA contractor, leaked classified information in 2013 and has since lived in Russia, where he holds citizenship[3].
- During Donald Trump’s first term, there was public debate about a possible pardon, but Trump ultimately chose not to act, stating he was "very close" but preferred to let the courts handle the matter[4].
- Snowden remains under indictment in the U.S. and would face prosecution if he returned[1][3].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- As Trump’s second term approaches, there is renewed advocacy among some of his advisers and political allies for a Snowden pardon. Matt Gaetz, a prominent Trump ally, has stated there is "pretty broad support for a pardon" among those close to Trump, though he has not discussed it directly with Trump himself[2].
- Tulsi Gabbard, Trump’s nominee for Director of National Intelligence, previously sponsored legislation to drop charges against Snowden[2].
- Robert F. Kennedy Jr., nominated for Health and Human Services Secretary, has also publicly supported a pardon for Snowden[2].
- Vice President-elect JD Vance has not taken a public position, but sources suggest he may be sympathetic to Snowden’s situation[2].
- Despite this support, Trump has not made a definitive public statement or commitment to granting a pardon as of the latest available reporting[2][4].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Official White House press releases or statements
- Major news outlets such as The Washington Post, Politico, and SAN News, which have reported on the evolving discussion around a potential pardon[2][4]
- Public records of presidential pardons

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- The decision to grant a pardon rests solely with the president and can be made at any time, often without advance notice.
- Political dynamics may shift rapidly, especially in the early months of a new administration.
- As of the knowledge cutoff (February 20, 2025), there is no public record of a pardon being issued to Edward Snowden, nor a definitive statement from Trump committing to such action.
- The question resolves only if a public, official pardon is reported before April 1, 2025.

## Summary Table

|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Snowden’s location/status     | In Russia, Russian citizen, indicted in US[3] |
| Trump’s prior action          | Did not pardon in first term[4]          |
| Current advocacy for pardon   | Renewed push from some Trump allies[2]   |

## Conclusion

As of February 20, 2025, there is significant advocacy within Trump’s circle for a Snowden pardon, but no public record or official announcement of a pardon being granted. The outcome remains uncertain and depends on Trump’s personal decision, which has not been publicly communicated.
