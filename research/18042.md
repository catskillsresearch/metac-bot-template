## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- No previous technological revolution has produced a singleton; instead, power has diffused among multiple actors. The internet, for example, has enabled both concentration (large tech companies) and fragmentation (open-source, state actors)[2].
- As of 2023-2025, AI development is distributed across several leading labs and nations. The most advanced models (such as OpenAI's o3, announced in December 2024) have demonstrated major leaps in general reasoning but have not resulted in a single entity controlling most of the world’s economic output[5].
- The global AI landscape is characterized by both state and commercial competition, with significant efforts in the US, China, and the EU, and increasing open-source participation[2][5].

## 2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- The launch of advanced models like OpenAI’s o3 in late 2024 marks significant technical progress toward AGI but has not resulted in economic dominance by a single system[5].
- Policymakers in major economies are increasingly regulating AI, which could slow or fragment the deployment of transformative systems and make singleton outcomes less likely in the short term[2].
- No credible reports suggest a near-term transition to a singleton; Metaculus community forecasts as of late 2023 put the probability of a singleton outcome after transformative AI deployment under 50%[4].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Metaculus forecasting questions and community discussion provide up-to-date probabilistic assessments based on expert and crowd input[1][4].
- Recent academic analysis (2025 arXiv preprint) reviews the economic and technical landscape, concluding that while transformative AI could accelerate growth, there are no current signs of a shift toward singleton control[3][5].
- Policy and economic research (F1000Research 2022) predicts continued multipolarity due to rapid diffusion and the commercial nature of AI[2].

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- Attribution of economic output to a single AI system is methodologically difficult, especially as AI systems are copied, forked, and integrated into global supply chains.
- Hardware constraints (compute, energy, chip production) and regulatory restrictions may slow or fragment deployment, but breakthroughs could change this landscape rapidly[3][5].
- The initial context of transformative AI deployment (whether military, commercial, or open-source; regulatory environment) will heavily influence the odds of a singleton outcome.
- Timelines for transformative AI remain highly uncertain, and major unanticipated breakthroughs or geopolitical events could rapidly alter the forecast[5].

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given these factors, the current forecast as of November 2023 is that transformative AI is **more likely to result in a multipolar world than a singleton**, at least within five years of its deployment. The probability of a singleton outcome—defined as a single AI system or lineage controlling >50% of world economic output within five years of transformative AI—appears to be *significantly less than 50%*, in line with Metaculus and academic assessments[2][4].
