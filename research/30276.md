# Forecasting FBI Firearms Background Checks for November 2024

To forecast whether FBI firearms background checks will exceed 2.4 million for November 2024, we need to examine historical trends, current patterns, and factors that might influence firearm purchases in the coming month.

## Historical Trends and Current Status

The National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) has shown significant growth since its inception. When NICS first began operation in 1998, it processed 892,840 firearm background checks in its first complete month. By 2022, this number had grown dramatically to approximately 2.6 million checks per month, totaling 31.6 million checks for the year[1].

Recent data shows that approximately 16.7 million firearms were sold in 2023, with Americans purchasing nearly 1.4 million firearms per month in 2024[3]. The firearms market has demonstrated consistent strength, with December 2023 recording 1.7 million NSSF-adjusted FBI NICS verifications for gun purchases. This continued a remarkable streak of more than 1 million firearm sales per month for 53 consecutive months[4].

The fourth quarter of 2023 (October, November, and December) saw more than 4.7 million background checks, representing a 4.6% increase over the same period in 2022[4]. This is particularly noteworthy as it reversed a years-long downward trend in gun-related background checks that had been observed following the 2020 surge[4].

While 2023's total of nearly 15.9 million firearm sales was slightly lower than 2022's 16.4 million, it still ranked as the fourth highest year on record since the FBI's NICS system was implemented, trailing only 2020, 2021, and 2022[4].

Importantly, the query notes that starting in July 2024, year-over-year monthly numbers have begun trending upward again, suggesting a potential new growth phase in firearm sales.

## Factors Potentially Affecting November 2024 Numbers

Several factors could influence the November 2024 background check numbers:

1. **Seasonal Patterns**: Historically, October, November, and December are typically the busiest months for gun sales[5]. This seasonal pattern suggests November 2024 could see higher numbers than other months of the year.

2. **Presidential Election**: America's relationship with firearms is "poised to take center stage as the November election approaches"[3]. The two major presidential candidates have significantly different stances on firearm rights, which could drive increased purchases among those concerned about potential policy changes. Elections have historically influenced firearm sales patterns.

3. **Continuing Upward Trend**: With the noted reversal of the downward trend in late 2023[4] and the specific mention of year-over-year monthly numbers trending upward since July 2024, there appears to be momentum that could carry into November.

## System Capacity and Limitations

The FBI's ability to process background checks efficiently is a relevant consideration. In 2020, during a period of unprecedented demand, the FBI failed to complete over 316,000 background checks in just the first nine months of the year[5]. This raises questions about system capacity during high-volume periods.

The NICS database itself has known limitations. Despite containing nearly 30 million active records on prohibited possessors as of 2023, states and court staff struggle to keep NICS records up to date, and there can be substantial gaps in the underlying database[2].

To address these challenges, the FBI's FY 2024 budget request included an additional 27 positions and $8.4 million specifically for NICS operations[1], which may improve processing capacity by November 2024.

## Conclusion

Based on the available data, several factors suggest November 2024 could exceed the 2.4 million threshold for background checks:

1. The typical seasonal increase during Q4 months
2. The presidential election in November 2024
3. The recent upward trend in year-over-year monthly numbers since July 2024
4. The historical precedent of November being among the busiest months for firearm sales

However, uncertainties remain, including the exact impact of the election and the continuation of the upward trend observed since July 2024.
