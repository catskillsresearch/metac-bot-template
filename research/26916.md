# Forecasting Kamala Harris's Net Favorability Rating by October 1, 2024

To assess whether Vice President Kamala Harris's net favorability rating will exceed -8 by October 1, 2024, I'll analyze historical trends, comparative data, and factors that may influence public opinion in the coming months.

## Historical Trends in Harris's Favorability

Vice President Harris has historically struggled with favorability ratings during her tenure. According to a June 2023 NBC News poll, Harris recorded a net-negative rating of -17 (32% positive, 49% negative), which NBC News reported as the lowest for a vice president in the history of their poll.[4] This represented a significant challenge for her political standing.

FiveThirtyEight's polling averages from June 2023 showed Harris with 39.4% approval and 52.3% disapproval, resulting in a net favorability of approximately -12.9.[2] The Los Angeles Times tracking data indicated that Harris's net favorability was lower than several former vice presidents, including Mike Pence, Joe Biden, Dick Cheney, and Al Gore.[1]

Harris's favorability reportedly began declining in June (likely 2021) after she was tasked with addressing immigration issues, which has been a challenging policy area for the administration.[1]

## Comparative Context with Other Vice Presidents

Harris's negative ratings stand in contrast to historical data for previous vice presidents:

- Mike Pence (October 2019): -4 net favorability (34% positive, 38% negative)
- Joe Biden (December 2010): +1 net favorability (34% positive, 33% negative)
- Dick Cheney (May 2003): +23 net favorability (47% positive, 24% negative)
- Al Gore (March 1995): +15 net favorability (42% positive, 27% negative)[4]

This historical comparison suggests that Harris's negative ratings have been unusually pronounced compared to her predecessors at similar points in their vice presidencies.

## Factors That May Influence Harris's Favorability by October 2024

Several factors could impact Harris's favorability trajectory toward October 2024:

**Potential Headwinds:**

1. **Gender and Racial Dynamics**: Some analysts have suggested that racism and sexism may contribute to Harris's low approval numbers. FiveThirtyEight noted that women politicians, especially women of color like Harris, are often held to different standards than men.[1] The Los Angeles Times data showed Harris had a particularly high unfavorability margin among men (17 percentage points).[1]

2. **Association with Administration Policies**: Harris's approval ratings have been somewhat tied to President Biden's overall job approval.[1] Immigration policy, which Harris has been associated with, remains a contentious issue that could continue to affect her ratings.

**Potential Tailwinds:**

1. **Campaign Positioning**: As the 2024 election approaches, Harris will have opportunities to define herself independently and potentially improve her public image through campaign messaging and direct voter engagement.

2. **Changing Political Landscape**: FiveThirtyEight noted that "a lot will likely change between now and the 2024 presidential election."[1] Political dynamics can shift rapidly, particularly in election years.

## Limitations in Forecasting

The available data presents several limitations for making accurate forecasts:

1. **Dated Information**: Most polling data in the search results is from 2023 or earlier, which may not reflect current trends or future developments.

2. **Unpredictable Events**: Major policy achievements, crises, or other significant events between now and October 2024 could substantially impact Harris's favorability in ways that cannot be predicted.

3. **Polling Volatility**: Favorability ratings can fluctuate significantly, especially during campaign seasons when public attention intensifies.

## Conclusion

Based on the available historical data, Harris would need to overcome significant negative perceptions to achieve a net favorability rating better than -8 by October 1, 2024. Her past ratings have been consistently more negative than this threshold, with her most recent recorded net favorability at approximately -12.9 to -17 in 2023.

However, the dynamics of a presidential campaign and changing political circumstances could create opportunities for substantial shifts in public perception. The historical precedent of other vice presidents maintaining better favorability ratings suggests that improvement is possible, though Harris faces unique challenges related to gender, race, and policy associations.

Given the limitations of the available data and the time remaining until October 2024, any forecast comes with substantial uncertainty.
