**Key Historical Trends and Current Status**

- For decades, the leading candidates for dark matter have been undiscovered elementary particles (e.g., WIMPs, axions), with primordial black holes (PBHs) considered a natural but less favored alternative[2][5].
- Interest in PBHs as dark matter rose with the detection of gravitational waves from black hole mergers and new theoretical models suggesting PBHs could explain both dark matter and the rapid formation of supermassive black holes[3][5].
- As of February 2021, no direct observational evidence has confirmed the existence of PBHs[2][3].

**Current Constraints and Differences Affecting the Forecast**

- Astrophysical and cosmological observations have imposed strong limits on PBHs making up the bulk of dark matter across most mass ranges, ruling out PBHs as a dominant component except in a narrow "asteroid mass window" (\(10^{14}\)–\(10^{19}\) kg), mainly due to the challenge of detecting such light objects[1][2].
- The lack of detection in most mass ranges and the success of non-PBH dark matter models in explaining observed phenomena (e.g., galaxy rotation curves, cosmic microwave background) maintain the scientific consensus against PBH-dominated dark matter.
- Some theoretical studies (e.g., Natarajan et al.) propose scenarios where PBHs could account for all dark matter, but these remain speculative and not widely accepted[5].

**Recent Announcements and Policies**

- No major observational breakthroughs or policy changes have occurred as of early 2021 to shift expert consensus toward PBHs as the main component of dark matter.
- Increasing experimental efforts aim to close the remaining mass windows for PBH dark matter, but results so far have only tightened constraints[1][2].

**Limitations and Uncertainties**

- Current detection methods are less sensitive to PBHs in the asteroid mass range, leaving this window unconstrained[1][2].
- The absence of direct detection of both PBHs and particle dark matter introduces uncertainty, but the weight of evidence and expert opinion leans against PBHs as the dominant form.

**Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment**

- Based on constraints and expert opinion as of early 2021, the probability that most dark matter will turn out to be primordial black holes is low.
- The most likely resolution is that the scientific consensus will continue to hold that PBHs, if they exist, make up less than 50% of dark matter in the observable universe.

> In summary: While PBHs remain a natural and intriguing candidate, the majority of current evidence and expert consensus as of early 2021 disfavors them as the main constituent of dark matter, except possibly in a narrow, poorly constrained mass range[1][2][5].
