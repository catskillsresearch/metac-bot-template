Based on the factual information available as of May 27, 2025, I'll assess whether GameStop's annual meeting will take place on June 12, 2025.

## Current Status and Official Announcements

GameStop Corp. has officially scheduled its 2025 Annual Meeting of Stockholders for Thursday, June 12, 2025, at 10:00 a.m. Central Daylight Time[2]. This date and time have been formally announced in GameStop's 2025 Proxy Statement, which was issued on April 24, 2025[2]. The meeting is planned to be held in a virtual-only format, meaning shareholders will not be able to attend in person[2][4].

The Computershare platform, which is hosting the virtual meeting, has already created a dedicated page for the "GameStop Corp Annual Meeting 2025" confirming the date of Thursday, June 12, 2025, at 10:00 AM Central Time[3]. As of May 27, 2025, the meeting page indicates that "The meeting is currently not open to attend online," which is expected since the meeting is still approximately two weeks away[3].

## Historical Context and Risk Factors

A significant historical precedent to consider is GameStop's experience with its 2024 annual meeting. On June 13, 2024, GameStop had to adjourn its virtual annual meeting without conducting any business due to technical difficulties with the third-party hosting site[5]. The company subsequently rescheduled the meeting for June 17, 2024[5].

This precedent raises a potential risk factor for the 2025 meeting. Given the resolution criteria specified that the meeting must be fully completed on June 12 to qualify as a "Yes" resolution, any technical difficulties that cause postponement would result in a "No" resolution.

## Agenda Items

According to the 2025 Proxy Statement, shareholders will vote on several matters at the annual meeting:

1. Election of five directors to serve until the next annual meeting
2. Advisory non-binding vote on executive compensation
3. Ratification of the audit committee[4]

## Assessment

Based on all available information as of May 27, 2025, GameStop's annual meeting is officially scheduled for June 12, 2025. Multiple official sources confirm this date, including the company's proxy statement and the Computershare meeting platform[2][3].

However, there is a moderate risk of postponement based on the precedent set in 2024 when technical difficulties forced a rescheduling. If GameStop experiences similar issues with high attendance or technical problems with the third-party hosting platform, there is a possibility that the meeting could be postponed again.

The company has had over a year since the previous technical difficulties to prepare for high attendance, which may reduce this risk. However, if there is extraordinary interest in the 2025 meeting similar to what occurred in 2024, the possibility of technical issues remains.

No information available as of May 27, 2025 indicates any change to the scheduled date or any anticipated problems with the meeting platform.
