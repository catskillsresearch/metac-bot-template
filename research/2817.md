## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The US nuclear weapons stockpile peaked at around 30,000 warheads in 1966 and has since undergone a consistent reduction, particularly after the Cold War[3][5].
- As of May 2024, the United States maintained an estimated stockpile of approximately 3,708 nuclear warheads, with about 1,770 deployed and the remainder held in reserve as a hedge[5].
- In September 2023, the official US government disclosure put the stockpile at 3,748 warheads, slightly up from previous years but still below the 3,800 threshold[3].
- Several hundred warheads are scheduled for retirement before 2030, continuing the downward trend[5].

## 2. Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Metric

- The US is engaged in a major nuclear modernization program, replacing delivery systems (missiles, submarines, bombers), but this is not expected to significantly increase the overall warhead count[4][5].
- The LGM-35A Sentinel ICBM program aims for initial deployment around May 2029, though delays are possible. This modernization focuses on delivery reliability, not stockpile expansion[4].
- The US government remains transparent about the stockpile size, regularly releasing data and responding to information requests, which aids independent verification[3].
- No current US policy or budgetary plan indicates intent to increase the nuclear arsenal above current levels. Congressional oversight and public scrutiny continue to act as checks on dramatic arsenal expansion[3][5].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists’ Nuclear Notebook provides detailed, credible annual estimates of the US stockpile[3][5].
- The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) periodically releases official figures[3].
- The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and Arms Control Association offer supplementary reports and analyses[1][2][4].

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- Stockpile numbers may fluctuate slightly year-to-year due to technical, operational, or political factors.
- Retired warheads awaiting dismantlement are excluded from the official count per the resolution criteria.
- Major, unforeseen geopolitical crises or a significant shift in US nuclear policy could change the trend, though no such change is currently anticipated in official planning[5].
- Future US administrations could theoretically reverse reductions, but current modernization is not forecast to result in net stockpile growth[4][5].

## 5. Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the steady reduction over decades, the 2024 stockpile at 3,708 warheads (already below 3,800), and plans for further retirements, the probability that the US will have 3,800 or fewer nuclear warheads in 2029 is very high—likely above 90% absent a dramatic and currently unforeseeable policy reversal.
