### 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Human presence aboard the ISS has been continuous since 2000, with a typical crew complement of seven[5].
- Recently, private missions such as those by Axiom Space have increased temporary orbital occupancy.
- On May 21, 2025, there were 10 people in space (per the resolution source).
- As of June 11, 2025, whoisinspace.com reports 13 humans in space, reflecting additional crewed missions and/or crew changes[3].

### 2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- The Axiom Mission 4 (AX-4), carrying four private astronauts, is preparing for a two-week stay aboard the ISS as of June 9, 2025[1].
- No major departures or end-of-mission announcements are reported for the period leading up to June 27, 2025[1].
- 2025 trends indicate a record pace of launches and more commercial crew activity, raising occupancy peaks[4].

### 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- whoisinspace.com provides live updates on humans in space[3].
- NASA's official blogs and news releases regularly update mission timelines and crew rosters[1][5].
- Space news aggregators and the Wikipedia "2025 in spaceflight" page track launch schedules and crewed missions[2][4].

### 4. Limitations or Uncertainties in Measurement

- Crew rotations and mission durations can change due to technical or operational reasons, which may affect the number of people in space on a specific date.
- Overlapping crew handovers and short private missions create temporary peaks in occupancy.
- The authoritative nature of whoisinspace.com is generally reliable, but real-time changes may introduce brief discrepancies.

### Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given current trends, the recent addition of four private astronauts, and no scheduled mass departures, it is highly probable that the number of people in space on June 27, 2025, will be **greater than ten**.

**Most probable answer: 'Greater than Ten'**
