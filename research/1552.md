## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- In 2010, about 1.1 billion people (16% of the global population) were religiously unaffiliated—atheists, agnostics, or people not identifying with any religion[1][3].
- The unaffiliated are the third largest global “religion” after Christianity and Islam[1].
- The majority of the unaffiliated are concentrated in the Asia-Pacific region (76% in 2010, projected 68% in 2050), with smaller but growing shares in Europe and North America[2].

## Projections for 2050

- By 2050, the unaffiliated population is expected to exceed 1.2 billion in absolute terms, but as a percentage of the world population, this group is projected to decline to around 13%[1][3][4].
- This relative decline is due to higher fertility and younger populations among religious groups, especially in developing countries, compared to the generally older and lower-fertility unaffiliated populations in developed countries[1][3].

## Regional Trends

- North America’s unaffiliated population is projected to nearly double by 2050 (an 89% increase), with growth also in sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America, but these increases are modest compared to overall population growth in those regions[2].
- The global share of unaffiliated will thus decrease despite regional increases, due to the rapid growth of highly religious populations in Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia[1][2][3].

## Recent Announcements or Policies

- As of November 2018, there were no major global policy changes or announcements expected to dramatically alter these demographic trends.
- Pew’s projections do not account for potential rapid secularization or religious revival in key countries like China, where evidence about links between affluence and religiosity is inconclusive[1].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Pew Research Center’s 2015 report remains the most robust and widely cited projection[1][3][4].
- Statista and Demographic Research provide corroborating quantitative summaries[4][3].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- Projections may not fully capture future cultural, political, or economic shifts (e.g., rapid secularization, major religious revivals).
- Self-reported identity may shift with social or political incentives, affecting survey reliability.
- The “religiously unaffiliated” category includes a wide range of beliefs, from atheism to “spiritual but not religious,” making definitions and cross-country comparisons complex[1].

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the available data and forecasts as of 2018, the most authoritative projection is that about **13% of the world’s population will identify as religiously unaffiliated in 2050**, with a plausible range of 12–14% to account for uncertainties.
