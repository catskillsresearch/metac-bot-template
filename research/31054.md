## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- December is part of Miami's dry season, with average rainfall typically between 43mm (1.7 inches) and 55mm (2.2 inches), spread over about 6 days with measurable precipitation[4][5].
- Since 1950, Miami has only recorded 0.00 inches of rain in December once, in 1968, making a completely dry December highly unusual.
- As of December 14, 2024, Miami had not received any measurable rain since November 10, and the area is classified as "Abnormally Dry" by drought.gov.

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- There are no recent policy changes or announcements that would directly impact rainfall amounts for December 2024.

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The official resolution source is the National Weather Service Miami, FL, which publishes monthly climate summaries[Resolution Criteria].
- The Iowa Environmental Mesonet provides historical and real-time precipitation data for Miami International Airport, which can be used for verification if needed.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- Long-range forecasts are inherently uncertain, especially for precipitation, and Miami's December rainfall can be highly variable due to the influence of cold fronts or isolated showers.
- While the first half of December 2024 has been completely dry, historical patterns suggest that even in dry years, some rain often falls in the latter half of the month.
- The statistical likelihood of 0.00 inches for the entire month is low, but below-average rainfall remains probable given the current trend.

## Summary Table: December Rainfall in Miami

| Statistic                | Typical Value        | December 2024 (to Dec 14) |
|--------------------------|---------------------|---------------------------|
| Average Rainfall         | 43–55 mm (1.7–2.2") | 0.00" (so far)            |
| Days with Rain           | 6                   | 0 (so far)                |
| Last 0.00" December      | 1968                | Possible in 2024          |

## Most Likely Range

Given the persistent dryness through mid-December and climatological trends, the most likely outcome is that Miami will finish December 2024 with below-average rainfall, but a total of exactly 0.00 inches remains unlikely. The most probable range is "0.30 inches or below" or "0.31-0.60 inches," with the possibility of a completely dry month being notable but rare[5][4].
