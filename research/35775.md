# US Government Net Outlays Forecast for FY 2028

As of May 2025, forecasting US federal government outlays for FY 2028 requires analyzing current CBO projections, recent policy initiatives, and economic trends. This analysis examines available data to generate a probabilistic assessment of net outlays in FY 2028.

## Current Projections and Baseline

The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) in January 2025 projected federal outlays at approximately 23.3% of GDP for 2025, with this percentage expected to remain stable through 2028[1]. According to Metaculus data, CBO specifically projects FY 2028 outlays at 22.9% of GDP, with projected GDP around $35.4 trillion, implying total outlays of approximately $8.11 trillion[3].

The baseline trajectory shows federal outlays growing from $6.5 trillion in 2024 to projected $10 trillion by 2034, representing a 54% increase over that decade[5]. This growth pattern suggests an average annual increase of roughly 4.4% if distributed evenly.

## Recent Policy Developments

Several significant policy developments since early 2025 may substantially impact this baseline forecast:

1. **Department of Governmental Efficiency (DOGE)**: Established by President Trump in January 2025, DOGE is led by Elon Musk with an ambitious goal of reducing annual expenditures by up to $2 trillion by 2026. As of May 2025, DOGE has documented $130 billion in savings.

2. **Republican Control of Congress**: Both houses of Congress are under Republican control and working on budget reconciliation, which typically focuses on deficit reduction.

3. **Interest Payments**: Net outlays for interest are projected to grow substantially, potentially tripling in nominal terms by 2028 compared to 2018 levels[2].

## Adjusted Forecast Analysis

To generate a probabilistic assessment for FY 2028 net outlays, we must consider several key factors:

### Economic Growth Projections

The CBO's GDP projection of $35.4 trillion for 2028 implies annual economic growth averaging approximately 3.2-3.5% from 2025 to 2028. This growth rate affects both revenue collection and certain expenditure categories tied to economic performance.

### DOGE Impact Assessment

DOGE's goal of $2 trillion in savings by 2026 represents approximately 29% of FY 2024 outlays. However, the current achievement of $130 billion (as of May 2025) represents about 6.5% of their stated goal. This suggests:

- The pace of efficiency gains may be slower than initially targeted
- Full achievement of the $2 trillion goal by 2028 appears unlikely based on current progress
- A more realistic efficiency gain by 2028 might be in the $500-800 billion range annually

### Mandatory vs. Discretionary Spending

Looking at the FY 2024 budget allocation, approximately 61% of outlays went to mandatory programs (Social Security, Medicare, portions of Health and Income Security). These programs are difficult to reduce significantly without major legislative changes:

- Social Security and Medicare expenditures will likely continue to grow due to demographic trends
- Interest payments, projected at $882 billion in FY 2024, will likely increase substantially as noted in CBO projections[2]
- Discretionary spending (Defense, Education, etc.) offers more realistic targets for DOGE's efficiency efforts

### Probabilistic Forecast for FY 2028

Based on the analysis above, I project the following probabilistic assessment for FY 2028 net outlays:

- **Baseline CBO Projection**: $8.11 trillion (22.9% of projected $35.4T GDP)[3]
- **Adjustments**:
  - DOGE efficiency savings: -$600 billion (median estimate)
  - Interest payment increases: +$300 billion above baseline projections
  - Legislative changes through reconciliation: -$200 billion

**Median Forecast**: $7.61 trillion

**Probability Distribution**:
- 10th percentile: $7.2 trillion (assuming greater success of DOGE initiatives and favorable economic conditions)
- 90th percentile: $8.3 trillion (assuming limited DOGE success and higher interest payments)

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors could significantly impact this forecast:

1. **Economic Performance**: Any recession or significant economic slowdown would impact GDP, tax revenues, and increase certain mandatory spending categories.

2. **Interest Rate Environment**: Future Federal Reserve policy and market conditions will affect interest payments on the national debt.

3. **Policy Implementation**: The actual implementation effectiveness of DOGE initiatives remains uncertain, with current progress suggesting challenges in achieving stated goals.

4. **Legislative Changes**: Major legislation affecting entitlement programs could substantially alter mandatory spending trajectories.

5. **International Events**: Geopolitical crises or conflicts could necessitate increased defense or emergency spending.

This forecast represents a point-in-time assessment based on information available as of May 30, 2025, and will require updating as new data becomes available and policy implementation progresses.
