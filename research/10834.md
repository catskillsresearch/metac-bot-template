## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of May 2022, nine US states had banned affirmative action in some form, primarily through ballot initiatives or executive orders[3][4]. This represented a slow but steady trend over several decades.
- Most bans up to 2022 focused on public higher education admissions rather than public employment, though some states' laws were broader.
- National polling showed conflicting attitudes: Gallup reported rising support for affirmative action (62% in 2021), while Pew found that 74% of Americans opposed race as a factor in college admissions in 2022[4].
- The Supreme Court’s 2023 decision in SFFA v. Harvard banned race-based affirmative action in higher education admissions nationwide, but did not explicitly address public employment[2].

## 2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- The 2023 Supreme Court ruling is a major inflection point, setting nationwide precedent against race-conscious admissions policies in higher education[2][5]. While not directly covering public employment, the decision may embolden legislative or further judicial efforts to extend similar bans.
- Some states, particularly those with divided or Democratic control, have not advanced such bans and in some cases have reinforced support for affirmative action in public employment.
- California’s long-standing ban (since 1996, via Proposition 209) and the failed 2020 attempt to repeal it demonstrate both the durability of such bans and the difficulty in reversing them once in place[5].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Detailed state-by-state status and legislative history can be found in academic reviews and policy briefs[1][4].
- Supreme Court decisions and legal analyses (e.g., Sidley’s overview of SFFA v. Harvard) provide authoritative context on judicial precedent[2].

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- The 2023 Supreme Court decision may not be the end of judicial involvement; future cases could extend the precedent to public employment or contract decisions, causing a rapid nationwide ban (thus resolving the question "Yes").
- State legislative activity is unpredictable, especially given demographic and political shifts.
- Some bans may have exceptions or be subject to legal challenges, and the definition of "ban" may vary in implementation.
- Changes in federal administration or Congressional action could also influence outcomes, though historically such federal action is rare and slow-moving.

## Probabilistic Assessment

Given the slow historical pace of state-level bans (nine states over several decades), but balancing the accelerating effect of the 2023 Supreme Court decision and the possibility of further judicial or legislative expansion, the probability of over half of US states (at least 26, including DC) banning affirmative action in public employment by 2035 is **moderately high**—likely in the 60%–75% range. If the Supreme Court or Congress extends the ban to public employment, the probability rises sharply toward certainty. Without further federal action, state-by-state adoption remains plausible but not guaranteed, as several populous states (including California, Texas, and Michigan) already ban affirmative action, and other large states are politically divided.
