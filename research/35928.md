**Key Historical Trends and Current Status**

- The Section 45Q carbon oxide sequestration tax credit has been repeatedly expanded since its creation, most recently by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which extended eligibility for new projects to 2033 and raised credit values for carbon capture and direct air capture, particularly for projects meeting labor standards[5].
- At least 226 projects currently qualify for 45Q, highlighting its importance as a carbon management incentive[5].
- As of May 2025, the House Ways and Means Committee’s draft legislative text for the budget reconciliation package preserves 45Q and its recent enhancements, though it proposes changes to the transferability of other clean energy credits[1][4].

**Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric**

- In March 2025, Rep. Scott Perry (R-PA) introduced H.R. 1946, the 45Q Repeal Act, which seeks to repeal 45Q effective January 1, 2026, without a safe harbor for existing projects[2][3].
- Republicans control Congress and the White House and are using budget reconciliation to advance tax priorities, including discussion of energy tax credits such as 45Q.
- Despite the repeal bill, current legislative momentum—reflected in the House Ways and Means Committee’s reconciliation draft—favors retaining 45Q in its enhanced form[1][4].

**Key Differences Affecting the Forecast**

- Unlike in previous years, there is now unified Republican control and an explicit repeal bill with no grandfathering for existing projects.
- However, the latest legislative draft from the House tax-writing committee does not include repeal or a sunset for 45Q, indicating internal division within the Republican caucus on the issue[1][4].
- The Perry bill marks a departure from past practice by omitting a safe harbor for ongoing projects, making its passage potentially more disruptive for the sector[2][3].

**Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment**

- The most likely outcome, as of late May 2025, is **No sunset reduction before 2026**: No repeal or phase-out of 45Q will be enacted before January 1, 2026, given the preservation of 45Q in the current House reconciliation legislation and the lack of clear consensus for immediate repeal[1][4].
- There is a meaningful but not dominant probability of a move toward "2025-2026 sunset w/o safe harbor" should the Perry bill or similar proposals gain traction in ongoing budget negotiations, especially if fiscal pressures intensify.
- The potential for last-minute amendments or political deals in the reconciliation process remains a source of uncertainty.

**Limitations and Uncertainties**

- The reconciliation process is fluid and can result in rapid legislative changes.
- Political dynamics may shift, especially if new budgetary or policy pressures emerge.
- The inclusion or exclusion of safe harbor provisions could change late in the process.
