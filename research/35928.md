# Forecasting EPA's Ranking on DOGE's Agency Efficiency Leaderboard by April 1, 2025

Based on information available as of March 13, 2025, here is an analysis to help forecast whether the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) will be ranked #1 in Most Total Savings on the Department of Government Efficiency's (DOGE) Agency Efficiency Leaderboard by April 1, 2025.

## Current Status and Historical Trends

As of February 25, 2025, the DOGE's efficiency leaderboard ranked the Department of Education (ED) highest in government-wide savings, followed by the General Services Administration (GSA), with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in third position[1]. This indicates that the EPA was already performing well in cost-cutting measures but was not yet in the top position.

By March 4, 2025, the leaderboard showed a change, with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) taking the #1 position in the "Most Savings" category[2]. This demonstrates that the rankings are dynamic and can change significantly within a short period (just one week in this case).

## Recent Announcements and Policies

A significant development that could impact the EPA's ranking is the announcement reported by USA Today on February 26, 2025, where it was stated that the EPA administrator was planning major cuts of "65 – or so – percent." This aggressive cost-cutting initiative, if implemented quickly, could substantially increase the EPA's total savings before April 1, 2025.

The DOGE has reported substantial overall government savings, claiming to have cut down $65 billion in wasteful expenditure as of February 25, 2025[1]. By March 4, 2025, the estimated savings had increased dramatically to $165 billion[2], showing rapid progress in the efficiency initiative across all agencies.

## Verification Sources

The primary authoritative source for verification is the DOGE's official website (doge.gov/savings), which maintains the Agency Efficiency Leaderboard[2]. This website is updated regularly, with plans to eventually provide real-time updates. As of March 4, 2025, the website was being updated weekly.

## Measurement Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors create uncertainty in forecasting the EPA's ranking by April 1, 2025:

1. The leaderboard rankings have already shown volatility, with significant changes occurring within a week (between February 25 and March 4, 2025).

2. The DOGE website acknowledges potential discrepancies between their posted numbers and other government databases like FPDS/USAspending, noting that their figures "originate directly from agency contracting and grant officials"[2].

3. The implementation timeline for the EPA's planned 65% cuts is not specified in the available information, making it difficult to determine if these cuts will be fully reflected in the leaderboard by April 1, 2025.

4. The methodology for calculating "Most Savings" is not fully detailed, leaving uncertainty about whether this is measured in absolute dollars, percentage of budget, or some other metric.

## Conclusion

Given the EPA's current third-place position as of February 25, 2025, combined with the announced plans for major cuts (approximately 65%), there is a reasonable possibility that the EPA could move to the #1 position by April 1, 2025. However, this would depend on:

1. The speed of implementing the announced cuts
2. Whether other agencies (particularly HHS, which was #1 as of March 4) continue their own aggressive cost-cutting measures
3. The specific metrics used by DOGE to determine rankings

The rapid change in rankings observed between February 25 and March 4, 2025, suggests that the leaderboard is quite dynamic, making it possible for significant position changes to occur within the remaining time before April 1, 2025.
