# Forecasting Analysis: Will President Trump Invoke the Insurrection Act Before 2026?

As of January 31, 2025, several factors suggest an increased probability that President Trump may formally invoke the Insurrection Act before 2026. This analysis examines the current situation, key indicators, and provides a probabilistic assessment.

## Current Status and Recent Developments

On January 20, 2025, President Trump issued an executive order declaring a national emergency at the southern border of the United States, claiming "America's sovereignty is under attack."[3] This executive order directed the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Homeland Security to submit reports within 90 days (by April 20, 2025) that include recommendations on whether to invoke the Insurrection Act of 1807.[2][3]

The Insurrection Act of 1807 gives the president authority to deploy the National Guard or federal armed forces to address "unlawful obstructions, combinations, or assemblages, or rebellion against the authority of the United States."[2] This represents a significant potential escalation in the administration's approach to border security and immigration enforcement.

## Comparative Analysis and Key Indicators

### Historical Precedent and Legal Framework

The Insurrection Act has been invoked relatively rarely in American history. While the Act provides broad authority, it exists in tension with the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878, which prevents the federal military from acting as a police force unless explicitly authorized by Congress or the Constitution.[2]

### Administration Signals and Rhetoric

Several indicators suggest an elevated probability of invocation:

1. **Direct Consideration in Executive Order**: The explicit mention of the Insurrection Act in the January 20 executive order demonstrates that invoking the Act is under active consideration at the highest levels of the administration.[2][3]

2. **National Emergency Declaration**: The declaration of a national emergency at the southern border creates a framework that could be used to justify more extreme measures.[3]

3. **Cabinet-Level Assessment**: The assignment of this assessment to the Secretaries of Defense and Homeland Security indicates serious consideration rather than merely rhetorical posturing.[2]

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on the information available as of January 31, 2025, I assess the probability of President Trump formally invoking the Insurrection Act before January 1, 2026, as follows:

**Probability: 55-65%**

This assessment is based on:

- The explicit consideration of the Insurrection Act in official executive actions
- The administration's characterization of the situation at the southern border as a crisis requiring extraordinary measures
- The formal process established to evaluate invoking the Act
- The administration's demonstrated willingness to use executive authority expansively

## Limitations and Uncertainties

This forecast faces several key uncertainties:

1. **Cabinet Recommendations**: The content of the recommendations from the Secretaries of Defense and Homeland Security, due April 20, 2025, will significantly influence the likelihood of invocation.

2. **Evolving Border Situation**: Changes in migration patterns or border security incidents could substantially shift the administration's calculus.

3. **Legal and Political Resistance**: Potential legal challenges or political opposition could affect the administration's decision-making.

4. **Alternative Policy Approaches**: The administration may find other policy mechanisms to achieve similar objectives without formally invoking the Insurrection Act.

This forecast should be updated as new information becomes available, particularly after the submission of the cabinet-level recommendations in April 2025.
