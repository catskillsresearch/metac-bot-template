# Forecasting UK PM Keir Starmer vs. Japanese PM Shiguru Ishiba Approval Ratings for July 1, 2025

As a forecasting analyst, I'll assess the available data to determine whether UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer will have a higher approval rating than Japanese Prime Minister Shiguru Ishiba on July 1, 2025.

## Current Status of Keir Starmer's Approval Ratings

Keir Starmer's approval ratings have reached historic lows as of late May 2025. Multiple polling organizations confirm this downward trend:

- **YouGov (May 16, 2025)**: Starmer's net favorability rating has plummeted to -46, his lowest ever recorded. Only 23% of Britons express a favorable view (down 5 points from April), while 69% hold an unfavorable opinion (up from 62% in April)[1].

- **Political Pulse (May 28, 2025)**: Reports confirm Starmer's approval rating is at its lowest point since the May 2024 elections, with the majority of the UK population dissatisfied with his performance as Prime Minister[2].

- **Statista (May 2025)**: Data shows Starmer's net favorability rating at -46%, compared to -39% for Conservative opposition leader Kemi Badenoch[3].

- **Ipsos (April 24, 2025)**: Even before the May polling, Ipsos showed Starmer's ratings deteriorating, with only 23% favorable views (down from 29% in March) and 52% unfavorable opinions, resulting in a net approval of -29[5].

A particularly concerning development for Starmer is that for the first time, he has recorded a net negative approval rating among Labour voters, with 50% now having an unfavorable view (a 17-point increase from mid-April)[1].

## Key Factors Affecting Starmer's Ratings

Several factors appear to be driving Starmer's declining popularity:

1. **Reform UK's Electoral Gains**: Reform UK exceeded expectations in local elections, creating political pressure on Labour[1].

2. **Immigration Policy Shift**: Labour has adopted a tougher immigration stance in an attempt to win over Reform voters, which may have alienated traditional Labour supporters[1].

3. **Comparison to Other UK Politicians**: While Starmer's ratings are declining, Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has seen rising positivity. Farage maintained a net favorability rating of -18 in April, significantly better than Starmer's current position[5].

## Limitations in Analysis

The most significant limitation in this analysis is the absence of current data on Japanese Prime Minister Shiguru Ishiba's approval ratings. Without this comparative information, it's difficult to make a direct forecast about whether Starmer will have higher approval ratings than Ishiba on July 1, 2025.

Additionally, approval ratings can be volatile and subject to rapid changes based on political events, policy announcements, or external factors that may occur between now and July 1, 2025.

## Forecast Assessment

Based solely on the available data regarding Keir Starmer:

1. Starmer's approval ratings are at historic lows and showing a consistent downward trend across multiple polling organizations.

2. The decline appears to be accelerating rather than stabilizing, with significant losses even among his party's own voters.

3. Without a major positive event or policy success, it seems unlikely that Starmer will experience a significant ratings recovery within the next month.

Without comparative data for Shiguru Ishiba, I cannot make a definitive probability assessment. However, given Starmer's extremely poor and deteriorating approval ratings, unless Ishiba is experiencing similar or worse approval challenges, it appears unlikely that Starmer would have higher approval ratings by July 1, 2025.

For a more accurate forecast, data on Ishiba's current and trending approval ratings would be essential, along with information about any major political events expected in both countries before July 1, 2025.
