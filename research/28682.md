1. **Key Historical Trends and Current Status**
   - The United Kingdom remains the only nation to have triggered Article 50 and begun the formal process to exit the EU[3].
   - Since Brexit, no EU member state has formally announced plans or initiated procedures to leave the Union[3].
   - Eurosceptic parties are active in multiple countries (e.g., National Rally in France, AfD in Germany, Party for Freedom in the Netherlands, Fidesz in Hungary)[3], but no mainstream ruling party currently supports withdrawal as official policy.
   - Notably, parties previously advocating exit (e.g., France’s National Rally) have moderated their positions; National Rally now supports reforming the EU from within, abandoning Frexit as a policy goal[3].

2. **Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric**
   - There have been no official government announcements or policy moves, as of October 2024, indicating intent to trigger Article 50 in any EU state[3].
   - Recent elections have strengthened some eurosceptic parties (AfD in eastern Germany, Party for Freedom in the Netherlands), but none have formed national governments with withdrawal as a mandate[3].
   - The EU faces challenges—climate policy disputes, migration, and geopolitical pressures—but these have generally reinforced calls for reform rather than outright exit[4][5].
   - New candidate states continue to seek EU membership, not withdrawal, suggesting the perceived value of membership remains high[1].

3. **Authoritative Sources for Verification**
   - Wikipedia’s overviews of both Article 50 and eurosceptic movements track current and historical positions, legislative procedures, and party manifestos[3].
   - Metaculus and similar forecasting platforms aggregate expert and public sentiment on the likelihood of EU exits before 2030[2].
   - Coverage of national climate plans and intra-EU disputes illustrate ongoing integration challenges but do not indicate imminent exits[4][5].

4. **Limitations and Uncertainties**
   - Political shocks, economic crises, or major EU scandals could rapidly shift dynamics, but as of October 2024, no state has initiated formal withdrawal proceedings[3].
   - Electoral cycles (e.g., upcoming national elections in France or Germany) could introduce risk if eurosceptic parties pivot to advocating exit and win broad support, but no clear path is visible now.
   - Public opinion remains largely pro-EU in most countries, and procedural hurdles (constitutional amendments, referendums) are significant even where anti-EU sentiment is high[3].

**Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment:**  
Based on current conditions, the probability that an EU member state will trigger Article 50 to leave the European Union before 2030 remains low. While there is a persistent undercurrent of euroscepticism, no country is poised to initiate the formal process in the next five years, barring major unforeseen disruptions. A reasonable range for this probability, given historical precedent and current political trajectories, is **5–15%**.
