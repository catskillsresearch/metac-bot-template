# Will a European Union Ban on Non-Commercial Internal Combustion Engines Take Effect Before January 1, 2025?

Based on the available information as of October 29, 2024, a European Union ban on non-commercial internal combustion engines will not take effect before January 1, 2025. The current timeline and political developments suggest a different trajectory.

## Current Status and Timeline

The European Union has established a regulatory framework aimed at phasing out new petrol and diesel cars, but this ban is scheduled to take effect in 2035, not before 2025. Specifically:

- The EU legislation stipulates that from 2035, all new cars that come to market cannot emit any CO2, effectively banning traditional internal combustion engines[1].
- This legislation was approved by the European Parliament in February 2023, adopted by the Council in March 2023, and entered into force in April 2023[1].
- The ban is part of the EU's broader strategy to reach climate neutrality by 2050, with intermediate targets of cutting emissions from cars by 55% and from vans by 50% by 2030, compared to 2021 levels[1].

## Recent Developments and Challenges

Rather than accelerating the timeline, recent political and industry developments indicate potential revisions or relaxations to the 2035 ban:

- As of October 8, 2024, the European People's Party (EPP) Group, which is a significant political force in the EU, has expressed intentions to tackle the "growing crisis in the European car industry by revising the planned ban on combustion engines set for 2035"[2].
- In September 2024, Italy and Germany began mustering support from other EU members to relax EU targets for reducing car CO2 emissions and reconsider the 2035 ban[3].
- Previously, in March 2023, the EU had already reached an agreement with Germany to step back from a complete ban of combustion-engine vehicles starting in 2035[4].

## International Context

Other European countries have their own timelines for phasing out internal combustion engines:

- The United Kingdom accelerated its proposed phase-out to 2035 from 2040, with plans announced in February 2020[5].
- France has set a 2040 goal for ending the sale of new passenger cars and light commercial vehicles using fossil fuels, according to their Mobility Guidance Law[5].

## Conclusion

Based on the available evidence, there is no indication that a European Union ban on non-commercial internal combustion engines will take effect before January 1, 2025. The current target date remains 2035, and there are ongoing discussions about potentially revising or relaxing this timeline rather than accelerating it.

The political landscape, including the positions of major EU member states like Germany and Italy, suggests that if any changes occur to the 2035 timeline, they would likely be in the direction of postponement rather than advancement.
