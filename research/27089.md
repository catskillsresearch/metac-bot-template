# Will any new iPhone model be announced supporting Wi-Fi 7 before October 1, 2024?

Based on available information as of August 2024, there is strong evidence suggesting that Apple will announce new iPhone models supporting Wi-Fi 7 before October 1, 2024. Let's examine the relevant data to forecast this outcome.

## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

Apple has historically followed a pattern of incrementally upgrading wireless connectivity in its iPhone lineup:

- iPhone 15 Pro models currently support Wi-Fi 6E, while standard iPhone models support Wi-Fi 6[1]
- Previous iPhone models (iPhone 11 through iPhone 14) supported standard Wi-Fi 6[1]
- Apple typically announces new iPhone models in September each year, with the iPhone 16 lineup expected to follow this pattern[1]

## Recent Announcements and Evidence

Multiple reliable sources indicate that Wi-Fi 7 support is coming to the iPhone 16 lineup:

- According to DigiTimes, the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max are "widely expected" to support Wi-Fi 7[1]
- Supply chain analyst Jeff Pu has previously reported that the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max will be the first Apple devices to support Wi-Fi 7[3][5]
- Apple's technical specifications for the iPhone 16 explicitly list "Wi‑Fi 7 (802.11be) with 2x2 MIMO" as a feature[4]
- Apple has conducted testing on preproduction iPhone 16 models in August 2024, with documentation noting "Wi‑Fi 7 available in countries and regions where supported"[2]

## Technical Benefits of Wi-Fi 7

The upgrade to Wi-Fi 7 represents a significant advancement in wireless connectivity:

- Wi-Fi 7 enables devices to send and receive data over the 2.4GHz, 5GHz, and 6GHz bands simultaneously[1]
- This results in faster Wi-Fi speeds, lower latency, and more reliable connectivity[1]
- Wi-Fi 7 offers peak theoretical data transfer speeds of over 40 Gbps, which is four times faster than Wi-Fi 6E[1]
- A key feature called Multi-Link Operation would enable the iPhone 16 Pro series to connect to multiple bands and channels at once[5]

## Verification Sources and Limitations

The most authoritative sources for verification include:

- Apple's own technical specifications documents, which already list Wi-Fi 7 as a feature for iPhone 16[2][4]
- Industry analysts with strong track records on Apple predictions, such as Jeff Pu[3][5]
- Supply chain reports from publications like DigiTimes that track component orders and manufacturing[1]

Limitations to consider:

- While technical specifications appear to be available, Apple has not yet made an official announcement
- There is some uncertainty about which specific iPhone 16 models will support Wi-Fi 7, though the Pro models are most consistently mentioned[1][3][5]
- Final product specifications can sometimes change before official announcement

## Conclusion

Based on the available evidence, it appears highly likely that Apple will announce new iPhone models (specifically the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max) supporting Wi-Fi 7 before October 1, 2024. Technical specifications already list this feature, testing has been conducted, and the expected September announcement timeline falls before the October 1 deadline.
