# Forecasting the 2025 GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Film - Wide Release

Based on the information available before March 17, 2025, I can provide the following analysis to help forecast the winner of the 2025 GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Film - Wide Release.

## Current Status

According to information released on January 22, 2025, "My Old Ass" (Amazon MGM Studios) has been announced as the winner of the Outstanding Film – Wide Theatrical Release category for the 36th Annual GLAAD Media Awards[1][2]. The official ceremony is scheduled to take place on March 27, 2025, in Los Angeles[4].

The full list of nominees in this category included:
- Cuckoo (Neon)
- Drive-Away Dolls (Focus Features)
- Love Lies Bleeding (A24)
- Mean Girls (Paramount Pictures)
- My Old Ass (Amazon MGM Studios) - Winner
- Problemista (A24)
- Queer (A24)
- Wicked (Universal Pictures)[1][2]

## Historical Context and Trends

The GLAAD Media Awards recognize and honor media for their fair, accurate, and inclusive representations of the LGBTQ community and the issues that affect their lives[1]. Looking at the previous year's awards provides some context:

For the 35th GLAAD Media Awards (2024), "Bottoms" (Amazon MGM Studios' Orion Pictures) won in the Outstanding Film – Wide Theatrical Release category[5]. This suggests that Amazon MGM Studios has established a strong track record in producing LGBTQ-inclusive content that resonates with GLAAD voters, as they've won this category two years in a row.

## Award Selection Process

The GLAAD Media Awards selection process involves over 700 GLAAD Media Award voters and volunteers. Nominees and winners are evaluated using four criteria:
1. Fair, Accurate and Inclusive Representations of the LGBTQ community
2. Boldness and Originality of the project
3. Significant Cultural Impact on mainstream culture
4. Overall Quality of the project

Results are then certified by a Review Panel who determine the final list of recipients based on voting results and their own expert opinions.

## Changes in Award Structure

Unlike previous years, the 36th GLAAD Media Awards will be presented in a single ceremony on March 27, 2025, in Los Angeles, rather than two separate ceremonies in Beverly Hills and New York City[4]. Additionally, the category of "Outstanding Blog" was renamed as "Outstanding Independent Journalism" to expand eligibility to more digital news and commentary outlets covering LGBTQ issues[4].

## Verification and Limitations

The announcement of "My Old Ass" as the winner was made in January 2025, well before the scheduled ceremony in March 2025[1][2]. This early announcement pattern differs from traditional award shows where winners are revealed during the ceremony itself. 

It's worth noting that the 36th GLAAD Media Awards also recognized other winners in different categories, such as "Hacks" (Max) for Outstanding Comedy Series and "9-1-1: Lone Star" (Fox) for Outstanding Drama Series[1][2].
