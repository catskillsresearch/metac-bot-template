## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- In May 2024, sunspot region AR3664 (now AR3697) produced numerous M- and X-class solar flares, resulting in intense geomagnetic storms and auroras visible at unusually low latitudes. During this period, Kp values reached extreme levels, with some storms classified as G4–G5 (Kp 8–9)[1].
- As of early June 2024, AR3697 returned to face Earth after merging with another active region, and space weather forecasters continued to monitor it for further significant solar activity[1].
- Sunspot regions with strong magnetic complexity, like AR3697, are known to produce solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs), which can trigger geomagnetic storms when directed toward Earth[1].

## Recent Announcements and Forecasts

- Long-range aurora forecasts are available but are inherently uncertain beyond a few days, as the occurrence and Earth-directed nature of solar eruptions cannot be predicted with high confidence weeks in advance[1].
- No authoritative source provides a deterministic Kp forecast for July 17–28, 2024, but the presence of AR3697 increases the likelihood of geomagnetic activity during its Earth-facing transit[1].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The German Research Center for Geosciences provides running 30-day Kp history data, which is the resolution source for this metric.
- NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center and other space weather agencies monitor and report real-time Kp values and issue alerts for geomagnetic storms[1].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- The Kp index is influenced by the timing, strength, and orientation of CMEs and high-speed solar wind streams, which cannot be forecast with precision more than a few days in advance.
- Even with an active sunspot region like AR3697, the actual Kp values during July 17–28, 2024, will depend on whether significant Earth-directed solar eruptions occur during that period.
- Long-range forecasts should be interpreted with caution, and real-time monitoring is essential for accurate assessment[1].

## Summary Table: Kp Index and Geomagnetic Storm Severity

| Kp Value | NOAA Storm Level | Description         |
|----------|------------------|---------------------|
| 0–4      | Quiet            | No storm            |
| 5        | G1               | Minor storm         |
| 6        | G2               | Moderate storm      |
| 7        | G3               | Strong storm        |
| 8        | G4               | Severe storm        |
| 9        | G5               | Extreme storm       |

## Conclusion

Based on the historical activity of AR3697 and its potential for producing significant solar eruptions, it is plausible that the strongest geomagnetic storm between July 17 and July 28, 2024, could have a Kp index greater than 4 and less than or equal to 6. However, due to the inherent unpredictability of solar activity and the lack of deterministic long-range forecasts, this cannot be stated with certainty. Real-time monitoring during the specified window will be necessary for definitive resolution.
