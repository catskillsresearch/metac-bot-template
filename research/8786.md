# Forecasting Analysis: Russian Annexation in the Baltic States by 2035

As a forecasting analyst examining the question of potential Russian annexation in the Baltic states by 2035, I'll analyze historical patterns, current trends, and key risk factors to develop a probabilistic assessment.

## Historical Context and Reference Cases

Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 and subsequent involvement in eastern Ukraine established a concerning precedent for territorial aggression against neighboring states. These actions demonstrate Russia's willingness to violate international norms when it perceives sufficient strategic incentive and favorable conditions.

The Baltic states (Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania) share several characteristics with Ukraine that make them potential targets:

- Geographic proximity to Russia with shared borders
- Significant ethnic Russian populations, particularly in eastern municipalities
- Historical incorporation within the Soviet Union
- Strategic importance to both NATO and Russia

However, crucial differences exist:

1. **NATO Membership**: Unlike Ukraine in 2014, the Baltic states are full NATO members, protected by Article 5 collective defense guarantees.
2. **EU Integration**: The Baltics are deeply integrated into European economic and political structures.
3. **Military Presence**: NATO has established enhanced Forward Presence (eFP) battlegroups in all three Baltic states.

## Current Situation Assessment

Russia considers the independence of the Baltic states and their active participation in NATO and the EU as direct threats to its security, sovereignty, and autonomy[3]. This perception forms the foundation of Russia's strategic approach to the region.

The most vulnerable areas appear to be those with high concentrations of ethnic Russians, particularly in eastern Estonia (Narva) and eastern Latvia. These regions mirror some of the demographic conditions that Russia used to justify intervention in Crimea and eastern Ukraine.

Current forecasting platforms estimate approximately a 27% probability that Russia will militarily seize Narva, Estonia before 2030[1]. This reflects significant uncertainty but acknowledges a substantial risk.

## Key Factors Affecting Probability

Several factors will influence the likelihood of Russian annexation in the Baltics:

**Factors Increasing Probability:**

- **Ethnic Russian Population**: The presence of approximately 1 million ethnic Russians across the Baltic states, with higher concentrations in eastern regions, provides Russia with potential justification for intervention.
- **Hybrid Warfare Capabilities**: Russia has demonstrated increasing sophistication in hybrid operations targeting Western states in the region, including infrastructure sabotage, GPS jamming, and drone surveillance[5].
- **Strategic Interest**: Control of Baltic territories would significantly enhance Russia's strategic position in the region and challenge NATO cohesion.

**Factors Decreasing Probability:**

- **NATO Deterrence**: Direct annexation would trigger Article 5, risking full-scale conflict with NATO.
- **Economic Costs**: Russia would face severe economic sanctions beyond those already in place.
- **Military Feasibility**: Successful annexation would require substantial military resources that may be constrained by other commitments.

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on the available evidence and comparative analysis with reference cases, I assess the probability of Russia annexing any part of a Baltic country by 2035 as follows:

- **Low Probability Scenario (15-25%)**: Limited to no annexation attempts, with Russia focusing instead on hybrid warfare and political influence.
- **Medium Probability Scenario (25-35%)**: Opportunistic seizure of small border territories with significant ethnic Russian populations during a period of NATO division or distraction.
- **High Probability Scenario (5-15%)**: Large-scale military operation to annex substantial Baltic territories.

**Overall Assessment**: I estimate a 30-40% probability that Russia will attempt to annex some portion of Baltic territory by 2035, with eastern Estonia (particularly Narva) representing the highest-risk area.

## Risk Indicators to Monitor

1. Increased Russian military buildup along Baltic borders
2. Escalation of hybrid warfare activities in the region
3. Political destabilization efforts targeting Baltic governments
4. Changes in NATO cohesion and commitment to Baltic defense
5. Domestic political developments within Russia affecting regime stability

## Limitations and Uncertainties

This forecast faces several significant limitations:

1. Unpredictable black swan events could dramatically alter the geopolitical landscape
2. Internal Russian decision-making processes remain opaque
3. Future NATO cohesion cannot be reliably predicted
4. The impact of economic, technological, and social changes over the forecast period is difficult to quantify

The forecast should be regularly updated as new information becomes available and conditions evolve.
