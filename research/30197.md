# iRobot Financial Health Assessment: Bankruptcy Risk Analysis

iRobot Corporation has faced significant financial challenges since its failed acquisition by Amazon in January 2024. Below is an analysis of the company's current financial position and factors relevant to assessing bankruptcy risk before January 1, 2025.

## Current Financial Status

iRobot reported mixed financial results in its most recent earnings release (Q3 2024):

- Revenue of $193.4 million in Q3 2024, representing a modest increase from $186.2 million in Q3 2023[5]
- Regional performance varied significantly with U.S. revenue increasing by 23%, while Japan declined by 20% and EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa) declined by 11%[1][4]
- The company improved its non-GAAP gross margin by 590 basis points year-over-year, attributed to restructuring and the "iRobot Elevate" initiatives[1]
- Cash position of $99.4 million as of September 28, 2024, down from $108.5 million at the end of Q2 2024[1]
- Additional $41.1 million in restricted cash set aside for future loan repayment, with $40 million drawn down at the close of Q3[1]

## Financial Outlook and Trajectory

For Q4 2024, iRobot has provided the following guidance:

- Revenue expected between $175 million and $200 million[5]
- Gross margin projected in the range of 24% to 27%, an improvement from 18.9% in Q4 2023[5]
- Operating loss expected to be between $31 million and $22 million[5]

For the full year 2024, the company projects:

- Total revenue between $685 million and $710 million[5]
- Gross margin in the range of 25% to 26%[5]
- Operating expenses between $274 million and $276 million (approximately 39% to 40% of revenue)[5]

## Historical Context and Trends

iRobot's current financial situation represents a significant decline from its peak performance:

- The company achieved record revenue of $1.56 billion in 2021[5]
- Has experienced operating losses in the years ending January 2022, December 2022, December 2023, and is projected to continue operating losses through 2024
- Q2 2024 showed substantial revenue declines across all regions (35.6% in U.S., 34.7% in Japan, and 21.6% in EMEA)[2]

## Restructuring and Turnaround Efforts

iRobot is actively implementing measures to improve its financial position:

- The company laid off an additional 105 employees as reported on November 6, 2024[5]
- Implementing a turnaround strategy called "iRobot Elevate"[5]
- CFO Julie Zeiler expressed caution about the macroeconomic environment but projected a return to year-over-year top-line growth for the full year of 2025[5]
- CEO Colin Angle emphasized the company's brand strength as the foundation for its turnaround strategy[5]

## Assessment of Bankruptcy Risk

Several factors are relevant when assessing iRobot's bankruptcy risk before January 1, 2025:

**Positive indicators:**
- Modest revenue growth in Q3 2024 compared to Q3 2023
- Improving gross margins
- Substantial cash reserves ($99.4 million plus restricted cash)
- Active restructuring and cost-cutting measures
- Strong brand recognition as noted by management

**Negative indicators:**
- Continued operating losses projected through Q4 2024
- Declining cash position quarter-over-quarter
- Significant revenue contraction from 2021 peak
- Ongoing layoffs suggesting continued financial pressure

## Limitations and Uncertainties

This assessment is subject to several limitations:

- The search results provide limited information about iRobot's debt structure, covenants, and maturity dates
- Detailed cash flow projections beyond Q4 2024 are not available
- The impact of holiday season sales (typically strong for consumer electronics) is uncertain
- Potential for additional restructuring or financing activities is not fully captured
