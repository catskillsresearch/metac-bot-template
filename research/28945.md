# Forecasting H5 Bird Flu Cases in the United States (2024-2025)

As of May 26, 2025, I can provide an analysis of the H5 bird flu situation in the United States based on current CDC reporting and historical trends to forecast the total number of human cases for 2024-2025.

## Current Situation Assessment

The H5N1 bird flu outbreak in the United States has shown significant progression since its detection in dairy cows in late March 2024[1]. According to CDC data, the situation has evolved as follows:

- As of October 21, 2024: 27 confirmed human cases in 2024
- As of January 6, 2025: 66 confirmed human cases since 2024 began[2]
- As of mid-April 2025: 70-71 human cases of influenza A(H5) identified for 2024-2025 combined[3][5]

This represents a significant increase from the initial outbreak, with approximately 43 new cases reported between October 2024 and April 2025. The first U.S. death from H5 infection was reported in January 2025[2].

## Key Factors Affecting the Forecast

Several important factors influence the projection for total cases through the end of 2025:

1. **Exposure Patterns**: Most human cases resulted from workplace exposures to infected dairy cows or poultry without proper protective equipment. A smaller number involved backyard poultry exposure, and in three cases, the source could not be determined[3].

2. **Absence of Human-to-Human Transmission**: No person-to-person transmission has been identified as of current reporting[2][5]. This significantly limits the potential for exponential growth in case numbers.

3. **Seasonal Considerations**: The CDC has specifically mentioned monitoring during summer months when seasonal influenza is typically low[3], suggesting potential seasonal patterns that could affect case rates.

4. **Case Growth Rate**: The rate of new cases appears to have slowed, with only about 4-5 new cases reported between January and April 2025 (from 66 to 70-71 cases).

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on the available data through April 2025 showing approximately 70 total cases and the current growth trajectory, I project the following:

**Most Likely Range (70-85 cases, 60% probability)**: 
The data shows case growth has significantly slowed in the first four months of 2025. If this pattern continues with only occasional new cases for the remainder of 2025, we can expect the final total to fall in this range.

**Moderate Growth Scenario (86-100 cases, 25% probability)**:
If control measures become less effective or the virus adapts to more easily infect humans from animal reservoirs, we could see a moderate increase in the case rate.

**Low Growth Scenario (71-75 cases, 10% probability)**:
If extremely effective containment measures are implemented and maintained, we might see very few additional cases beyond the current count.

**High Growth Scenario (>100 cases, 5% probability)**:
While there is no evidence of human-to-human transmission, the possibility of a significant mutation enabling easier transmission or a substantial increase in animal outbreaks could lead to higher case numbers.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors could significantly alter this forecast:

1. The potential emergence of human-to-human transmission would dramatically change the trajectory.

2. Mutations in the virus could affect transmissibility or virulence.

3. Changes in surveillance or testing protocols might affect case identification rates.

4. The extent of continued spread in animal populations, particularly dairy cattle and poultry, will influence human exposure opportunities.

5. Implementation and adherence to protective measures in high-risk settings.

Based on current evidence and trends, the most likely outcome is that the total number of H5 bird flu cases in the United States for 2024-2025 combined will be between 70-85 cases, with the possibility of moderate increases if conditions change.
