Based on information available through October 23, 2024:  
**Key factors supporting Daboll's retention**:  
- **Play-calling authority**: Daboll resumed offensive play-calling duties for 2024, indicating organizational confidence[5].  
- **Roster decisions**: The front office made multiyear commitments to players (e.g., Jon Runyan Jr.'s $17M guaranteed contract) aligned with Daboll's system[3].  
- **Contractual timeline**: No reports of ownership dissatisfaction or early termination clauses in Daboll's contract[4][5].  

**Limitations**:  
- **Performance volatility**: A catastrophic 2024 regular-season collapse could theoretically prompt midseason changes, but no such developments are documented pre-cutoff[2][5].  
- **Source timeliness**: The latest available reports (September 2024) show Daboll actively leading the team[5].  

**Verification method**:  
Monitor the [Giants' official coaching roster](https://www.giants.com/team/coaches-roster/) for updates[1].  

**Conclusion**:  
No pre-10/23/2024 evidence suggests Daboll will be removed before January 1, 2025. **Resolution**: **No**.
