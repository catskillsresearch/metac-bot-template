### 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Global burned area from wildfires has generally *declined* over the past two decades, largely due to reductions in burning of grasslands and savannas, primarily in Africa. However, the area of forest specifically affected by wildfires has remained relatively stable, with emerging signs of increase in some regions[1].
- By 2024, new data reveals that forest fires are burning *almost twice as much tree cover* as they did 20 years ago, indicating a reversal or at least a significant shift in trend since the early 2000s[4].
- U.S. wildfire data shows that in some years (e.g., 2015, 2017, 2020), more than 10 million acres (~4 Mha) were burned nationally, but this is only a portion of global forest fire activity[5].

### 2. Recent Announcements or Policies Affecting the Metric

- The 2019 Amazon fire surge in Brazil, with over 74,000 fires (an 83% increase year-on-year), brought renewed global attention and led to both international pressure and some short-term policy interventions aiming to reduce illegal deforestation and burning[4].
- However, the effectiveness and enforcement of these measures have varied, and climate change continues to increase risks of extreme fire years through higher temperatures and prolonged droughts.

### 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Global Forest Watch is the definitive source for global tree cover loss due to wildfires, providing annual updates and breakdowns by cause, region, and year[4].

### 4. Limitations and Uncertainties in Measurement

- Tree cover loss attributed to wildfires is subject to satellite detection limits and definitional challenges: distinguishing between wildfire loss and other human-driven deforestation can be difficult, especially in regions with mixed-use landscapes.
- Year-to-year variability in fire weather, El Niño/La Niña cycles, and reporting lag can further obscure real-time trends.
- Some sources track total burned area (including grasslands), but the resolution criterion specifies *tree cover*—a stricter, smaller subset.

### 5. Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

- As of 2019, *no single year* had yet seen wildfire-driven global tree cover loss exceeding 10 Mha, according to Global Forest Watch data.
- The increasing frequency and intensity of extreme fire years (notably in the Amazon, Siberia, and Australia) point to an elevated risk profile for the coming decade—especially as climate change accelerates[4].
- Given the near doubling of forest fire-driven tree loss over 20 years and considering the sharp upturn in mega-fire events, the probability of at least one year exceeding 10 Mha of wildfire-driven global tree cover loss by 2030 is **moderately high**.
- Adjusted forecast: There is an estimated **40–60% chance** that, before 2031, wildfire destruction of tree cover will exceed 10 Mha in at least one calendar year.
