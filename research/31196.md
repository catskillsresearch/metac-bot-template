# Forecasting Analysis: Israeli Governmental Control of Gaza in 2025

As of May 24, 2025, the situation in Gaza shows significant developments that directly impact the likelihood of Israel establishing formal governmental control over the territory.

## Current Situation

The Israeli military has significantly expanded its control in Gaza, with recent reports indicating that the IDF now controls over 50% of the Gaza Strip and is "on the way to controlling the vast majority" of the territory[4]. This represents a substantial increase in Israeli territorial control compared to previous months.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has explicitly stated that "at the end of this campaign, all of the territories of the Gaza Strip will be under Israel's security control"[2]. This statement was made on May 22, 2025, during discussions about the current military offensive codenamed "Operation Gideon's Chariots"[2].

Netanyahu has outlined specific conditions for ending the war, including:
- Return of all hostages
- Hamas disarming and leaving power
- Hamas leadership leaving Gaza
- Israeli assurance that Gaza remains free of weapons[2]

Most critically for this forecast, Netanyahu has indicated plans to implement what he referred to as "Trump's plan" for Gaza after these conditions are met[2]. While the search results don't provide complete details of this plan, they indicate it involves potential population displacement and significant changes to Gaza's governance structure.

## Indicators of Formal Governance Plans

Several factors suggest movement toward formal governance rather than just military occupation:

1. **Explicit statements about control**: Netanyahu's declaration about Israel controlling "all of the territories" goes beyond temporary military presence[2].

2. **Territorial threshold already crossed**: With IDF control reportedly exceeding 50% of Gaza's area, the territorial requirement for the forecasting question has been met, although military control alone does not satisfy the resolution criteria[4].

3. **Displacement plans**: Reports indicate Israeli plans to concentrate Gaza's population into a restricted area while controlling the remainder of the territory, which suggests preparation for a more permanent governance arrangement[3].

4. **Invocation of a specific plan**: Netanyahu's reference to implementing "Trump's plan" indicates the existence of a formalized approach to Gaza's future governance[2].

## Constraints and Countervailing Factors

Despite these indicators, several factors could prevent formal Israeli governance:

1. **International pressure**: Human Rights Watch and other organizations have condemned Israel's plans for Gaza as potential "crimes against humanity, ethnic cleansing, and acts of genocide"[3], which could generate significant international opposition to formal governance.

2. **Alternative governance proposals**: Previous reports (referenced in the question but not in search results) mentioned discussions about an international administration for Gaza involving the UAE.

3. **Distinction between security control and governance**: Netanyahu's statements emphasize "security control" rather than explicitly mentioning formal governance structures[2].

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on the available evidence as of May 24, 2025:

- The likelihood of Israel establishing formal governmental control of at least 50% of Gaza during 2025 appears **high (approximately 70-80%)**.
- This assessment is based on:
  - Netanyahu's explicit statements about controlling all Gaza territories[2]
  - The IDF already controlling over 50% of Gaza's area[4]
  - Concrete plans being discussed for Gaza's future governance[2]
  - The military offensive actively progressing toward complete territorial control[2][4]

The primary uncertainty is whether Israel will formalize this control through an established government rather than maintaining a purely military presence. Netanyahu's statements suggest formalization is likely, but the exact timeline and structure remain unclear.

## Key Monitoring Points

To track the progression toward resolution:
1. Watch for announcements about civilian administration in IDF-controlled areas
2. Monitor Israeli cabinet decisions regarding Gaza governance
3. Track international recognition or condemnation of Israeli governance moves
4. Note any legislation in the Knesset regarding Gaza's status

Given the current trajectory and explicit statements from Israeli leadership, formal governmental control of Gaza by Israel before the end of 2025 appears more likely than not, though significant uncertainty remains about the exact form and timing of such control.
