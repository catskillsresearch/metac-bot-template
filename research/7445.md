# Forecasting US State Psilocybin Decriminalization by January 1, 2027

As of July 1, 2021, the landscape of psilocybin decriminalization in the United States shows early signs of policy change, though widespread adoption remains limited. This analysis examines the factual information available as of mid-2021 that would inform a forecast of state-level decriminalization by January 2027.

## Current Status and Historical Trends

As of mid-2021, Oregon stands as the only state to have formally decriminalized psilocybin possession through Ballot Measure 110 in 2020. This pioneering move represented the first state-level action removing criminal penalties for possession of psilocybin and other drugs.

At the municipal level, several cities have implemented decriminalization measures:
- Denver, Colorado became the first U.S. city to decriminalize psilocybin in May 2019
- Oakland and Santa Cruz, California followed with similar measures
- Ann Arbor, Michigan and Washington D.C. have also enacted decriminalization policies

These city-level actions demonstrate growing local support for psychedelic policy reform, potentially indicating a bottom-up approach to broader decriminalization.

## Recent Developments and Policy Indicators

Several factors suggest potential momentum for state-level decriminalization:

1. **Legislative Activity**: As of mid-2021, lawmakers in New York, California, Vermont, and New Jersey are actively pursuing various forms of decriminalization legislation. While these efforts are preliminary, they indicate growing political willingness to consider reform.

2. **Medical Recognition**: The FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation to psilocybin-assisted therapy for treatment-resistant depression in 2018 and for major depressive disorder in 2019. This federal acknowledgment of psilocybin's therapeutic potential provides scientific legitimacy that may influence state policy decisions.

3. **Safety Profile**: Research available by mid-2021 indicates psilocybin has low toxicity and harm potential compared to many controlled substances, potentially lowering barriers to decriminalization.

## Measurement Considerations and Uncertainties

Several factors complicate forecasting state-level decriminalization:

1. **Definition Variability**: The resolution criteria define decriminalization as when possession is "de facto not prosecuted." This may occur through various mechanisms including legislation, ballot initiatives, or enforcement policies, making tracking and verification complex.

2. **Threshold Variations**: States may implement partial decriminalization with varying possession thresholds, creating a spectrum rather than binary status.

3. **Federal Policy Impact**: While the forecast focuses on state-level action, federal policy changes could accelerate or impede state efforts. As of mid-2021, psilocybin remains a Schedule I controlled substance under federal law.

4. **Measurement Lag**: Official confirmation of decriminalization status may trail actual implementation, particularly for non-enforcement policies rather than legislative changes.

## Conclusion

As of July 2021, only Oregon has implemented state-level psilocybin decriminalization, with several cities taking similar action. The growing scientific recognition of psilocybin's therapeutic potential, coupled with active legislative efforts in multiple states, suggests a trend toward broader decriminalization. However, the pace and extent of this movement remain uncertain given the early stage of these developments.
