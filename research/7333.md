## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The US stock exchanges, notably the NYSE, have operated nearly continuously since 1817. The longest closure was during World War I (July–December 1914, about four months)[2][5].
- Other notable closures include assassinations (e.g., Lincoln, one week), financial panics (e.g., 1873, ten days), terrorist attacks (e.g., 9/11, five days), and weather disasters (e.g., Hurricane Sandy, two days)[2][4][5].
- Even during the Great Depression, multiple wars, and crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic, markets remained open, sometimes with temporary halts but never for a full year[3][4].
- Modernization and digitization have made market operations more resilient to disruption.

## 2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- As of 2021, there were no announcements or policy changes indicating an intent to close all US stock exchanges for an extended period.
- Electronic and remote trading capabilities have increased, decreasing the likelihood of prolonged closure due to localized disasters or physical threats[2][4].

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- Long-term forecasting (over nearly a century) is inherently uncertain, especially regarding low-probability, high-impact events (e.g., nuclear war, existential cyber-attacks, systemic political collapse).
- Structural changes to global finance could alter the definition or necessity of "public US stock exchanges" as currently understood.
- The assessment assumes continuity in economic and political systems, which history suggests is highly probable but not guaranteed.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the historical resilience of US markets, technological advancements, and the central economic role of stock exchanges, the probability that there will be a full year with no open US stock exchanges before 2120 is extremely low—likely well under 1%. However, over a 99-year timeframe, the probability is non-zero due to the possibility of unforeseeable catastrophic events or systemic transformations.
