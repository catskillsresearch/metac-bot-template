# Will Iran Carry Out a Deadly Attack Within Israel Before October 1, 2024?

Following the assassination of Hamas Political Bureau Chairman Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran on July 31, 2024, and Hezbollah military leader Fuad Shukr in Beirut on July 30, 2024, tensions between Iran and Israel have escalated significantly. This analysis examines available information as of August 2024 to help forecast whether Iran will conduct a deadly attack within Israel's borders before October 1, 2024.

## Current Status and Historical Context

The Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) issued a statement on August 3, 2024, claiming that Israel killed Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran using a short-range projectile equipped with an explosive warhead. In this statement, the IRGC vowed to "retaliate severely against Israel at the appropriate time and place" for Haniyeh's killing[1].

This situation follows Iran's previous retaliatory action in April 2024, when Iran launched a barrage of drones and missiles at Israel in response to Israel's bombing of the Iranian consulate in Damascus. That attack caused injuries but no reported fatalities, suggesting Iran may have deliberately calibrated its response to avoid crossing certain thresholds that might trigger a full-scale war.

## Recent Announcements and Signals

Senior Iranian security officials, including Armed Forces General Staff Chief Major General Mohammad Bagheri and Supreme National Security Council Secretary Ali Akbar Ahmadian, have suggested that both Iran and the "Axis of Resistance" will retaliate against Israel[2]. Iranian leaders have met with senior Axis of Resistance officials to coordinate their combined attack, many of whom were already in Tehran for the inauguration of Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian[2].

Intelligence assessments indicate that Iran is planning its next attack to establish deterrence with Israel while still attempting to avoid a large-scale war. One of the most dangerous but increasingly likely scenarios is that Iran and the Axis of Resistance will launch a combined, large-scale drone and missile attack that incorporates lessons from the April 2024 attack[2].

The Wall Street Journal reported that the United States and Israel are preparing for an "unpredictable," broader, and more complex attack than Iran's April 2024 drone and missile strike on Israel[1]. Unlike the April attack, when Iranian officials warned Israel of their plans ahead of time, providing the United States and Israel with time to prepare, there are concerns that Iran may not provide such advance warning this time.

## Diplomatic Efforts and Constraints

The United States and its allies have been pursuing a three-pronged crisis management strategy to limit Iran's retaliation:
1. Seeking an immediate cease-fire in Gaza
2. Sending additional defensive capabilities to Israel
3. Working through back channels to urge Iran to limit its fire[3]

However, these efforts face significant challenges. Despite reported pressure from senior Israeli security officials and frustration in Washington, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu continues to reject a Gaza truce, which would be critical to easing wider tensions in the region. Furthermore, Iran appears intent on pushing forward with a large-scale offensive action despite diplomatic efforts[3].

Adding to the complexity, Iran and Lebanese Hezbollah have reportedly refused to speak with US and Arab diplomats who are trying to de-escalate tensions between Israel and Iran[1].

## Potential Scenarios and Implications

If U.S. efforts to cap the escalatory cycle fail, a worst-case scenario could include an Iranian-led attack causing significant casualties and damage in Israel. This could prompt Israel to make good on its threats of an all-out assault on Lebanon, expand the battlefield in Yemen by striking the Houthis, and further escalate by attacking Iran's command structure or key nodes in its nuclear program[3].

Such escalation might lead Tehran to conclude it has little left to lose, potentially expanding attacks by Iranian proxies on U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria, which have already resumed after a relative lull. At some point, these various hostilities could merge into a full-scale regional war with potentially devastating effects on global trade and energy supplies, with high rates of civilian casualties[3].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors complicate the forecast:

1. **Strategic Ambiguity**: Iran may deliberately maintain ambiguity about its intentions to maximize leverage and strategic flexibility.

2. **Multiple Actors**: The involvement of various proxy groups in the "Axis of Resistance" creates uncertainty about who might carry out attacks and how directly attributable they would be to Iran.

3. **Calibration Challenges**: Iran faces the difficult task of delivering a response significant enough to satisfy domestic audiences and deter future Israeli actions, while avoiding triggering a full-scale war.

4. **International Pressure**: Ongoing diplomatic efforts could influence Iran's calculus, though their effectiveness appears limited so far.

## Conclusion

Based on available information as of August 2024, Iran and its allies are clearly signaling intent to conduct a significant retaliatory attack against Israel following the assassinations of Haniyeh and Shukr. The attack is expected to be larger and potentially more damaging than Iran's April 2024 operation. While Iran likely wishes to avoid a full-scale regional war, the risk of miscalculation is high, and diplomatic efforts to constrain Iran's response appear to be facing significant challenges.

The likelihood of an attack meeting the specified criteria (at least five fatalities within Israel's borders, explicitly attributed to Iran, before October 1, 2024) depends significantly on Iran's ability and willingness to calibrate its response preciselyâ€”a challenging task given the high tensions and multiple actors involved.
