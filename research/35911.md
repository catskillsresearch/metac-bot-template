# Forecasting the Status of USCIS EB-5 Program Page on March 31, 2025

Based on available information as of March 12, 2025, here is an analysis to help forecast whether the USCIS EB-5 Immigrant Investor Program information portal will remain online at the end of March 2025.

## Current Status of the EB-5 Program

The EB-5 Immigrant Investor Program appears to be fully operational as of early 2025. As of February 12, 2025, there are 547 approved regional centers participating in the program[1]. This indicates active administration of the program by USCIS in the recent months.

The USCIS website continues to maintain and update EB-5 program information. In February 2025, USCIS published guidance on "When to File Your Adjustment of Status Application" which includes information relevant to employment-based preference visas, including EB-5[2].

## Recent Program Updates

The most recent significant update to the EB-5 program page was published on October 11, 2024, according to the "EB-5 What's New" section of the USCIS website[3]. This demonstrates ongoing maintenance of the program's online presence.

More recently, the March 2025 Visa Bulletin (published in February 2025) shows that all Reserved EB-5 categories remain "current," while the Unreserved EB-5 category maintains specific cut-off dates for applicants from China (July 15, 2016) and India (January 1, 2022)[5]. This indicates that the program is actively processing applications and managing visa availability as recently as March 2025.

## Analysis for Forecasting

Several factors suggest the EB-5 program page is likely to remain online through March 31, 2025:

1. **Recent Administrative Activity**: The program shows signs of active administration through February 2025, with updated regional center approvals[1].

2. **Current Visa Processing**: The March 2025 Visa Bulletin specifically addresses EB-5 visa availability, indicating ongoing processing of EB-5 applications[5].

3. **Website Maintenance**: USCIS has continued to maintain and update the EB-5 program information on its website, with content updates as recently as February 2025[2].

4. **No Announced Discontinuation**: Based on available information, there are no official announcements from USCIS regarding plans to remove the EB-5 program page or discontinue the program by the end of March 2025.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

The primary limitation in this forecast is the relatively short timeframe between the most recent data (February/March 2025) and the target date (March 31, 2025). While current evidence suggests continued operation, government programs and websites can change with limited notice.

Additionally, the visa bulletin for March 2025 does not include any warnings about potential program changes in the coming months[5], which might otherwise signal impending modifications to the program or its online presence.
