### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of late January 2025, Apple Maps continues to label the body of water west of Florida as the "Gulf of Mexico" when users view the map directly[1][2][3].
- If a user searches for "Gulf of America," Apple Maps overlays that name on the map, but the information sheet and details still refer to "Gulf of Mexico." This is a partial or stopgap measure, not a full renaming[1][2][3].
- There is no evidence that Apple Maps has fully adopted "Gulf of America" as the default or exclusive label for the region.

### Recent Announcements and Policies

- President Trump signed an executive order on January 20, 2025, directing all federal agencies to use "Gulf of America" and to update references within 30 days[2][4].
- The Geographic Names Information System (GNIS), the official US government source for place names, had not updated the name as of late January 2025[2][4].
- Both Apple and Google have indicated they typically wait for GNIS updates before changing map labels[2][4].
- Google has stated it will update Google Maps for US users once GNIS is updated, but Apple has not made any public commitment or timeline[1][2][4].

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Apple Maps itself, by searching for both "Gulf of Mexico" and "Gulf of America."
- GNIS database for official US government place names.
- News coverage from AppleInsider, MacDailyNews, and other tech news outlets[1][2][3][4].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- Apple has not publicly committed to a timeline or method for updating the name.
- The process depends on GNIS, which had not updated the name as of late January 2025.
- The partial solution (displaying "Gulf of America" only when searched) may persist, but this does not meet the resolution criteria unless "Gulf of America" becomes the default or both names are shown.
- Political and technical complexities may delay or alter the implementation.

### Conclusion

Based on all available information as of February 9, 2025, Apple Maps had not fully switched to displaying "Gulf of America" as the default label for the Gulf west of Florida. The most recent change is a partial workaround that only appears when searching for the new name, with the main label and information still showing "Gulf of Mexico." Unless Apple makes a full update before April 1, 2025, the answer would likely be **No**, unless further developments occur.
