## Key Factual Information Relevant to Forecasting Tech Crunch Layoff Reports for Meta, Facebook, or Instagram (Before October 1, 2024)

**1. Historical Trends and Current Status**
- Meta (including Facebook and Instagram) conducted major layoffs in 2022 and 2023, with the last widely reported round in May 2023, where 10,000 jobs were cut across two rounds[3].
- In January 2024, Instagram eliminated 60 technical program manager positions, but this event is outside the relevant forecast window and already reflected in Tech Crunch's tracker[5].
- As of August 27, 2024, there are no new entries for Meta, Facebook, or Instagram layoffs in the Tech Crunch 2024 layoff tracker for August or September[1].

**2. Recent Announcements or Policies Affecting Layoff Probability**
- Meta announced in May 2024 that it is shutting down Workplace, its enterprise communications business. However, as of the cutoff date, Tech Crunch has not listed any associated layoffs for Meta, Facebook, or Instagram in connection with this shutdown[4].
- There are no public announcements or credible reports of planned layoffs at Meta, Facebook, or Instagram for the remainder of Q3 2024.

**3. Authoritative Source for Verification**
- The sole resolution source is Tech Crunch’s “A comprehensive list of 2024 tech layoffs,” which is updated regularly and will be checked for explicit listings of Meta, Facebook, or Instagram layoffs in August or September 2024[1].

**4. Limitations and Uncertainties**
- Only layoffs explicitly listed for Meta, Facebook, or Instagram on the Tech Crunch tracker for August or September 2024 will count, regardless of subsidiary layoffs or other news sources.
- If Tech Crunch ceases to update the tracker after the launch of the question, the question will resolve as No, regardless of any layoffs reported elsewhere.
- The tracker’s regular update schedule means that any last-minute layoffs could be captured, but as of the cutoff date, no such events are listed.

## Conclusion
