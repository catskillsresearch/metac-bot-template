## Factual Information Relevant to Forecasting Removal of Revolut's UK Banking License Restrictions

**Key Historical Trends and Current Status**
- Revolut was granted a UK banking license with restrictions by the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) on July 25, 2024, entering the standard "mobilisation" phase required for new banks in the UK[1][2][5].
- During this phase, Revolut continues to operate as an e-money institution for UK customers, with no immediate changes to customer accounts or services[1][2].
- The mobilisation phase is designed to allow Revolut to complete the build-out of its UK banking operations and critical systems before launching as a full bank[1][2][5].

**Recent Announcements and Policies**
- Revolut's official communications and industry commentary confirm that the mobilisation phase is a common regulatory step, typically lasting up to 12 months[1][2][5].
- There have been no public announcements of regulatory setbacks or delays since the license was granted.
- Revolut's leadership and external analysts have expressed confidence in progressing through the mobilisation phase on schedule[2][5].

**Authoritative Sources for Verification**
- The Bank of England's Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) is the primary authority overseeing the licensing process.
- Revolut's official blog and press releases, as well as reputable financial news sources, provide updates on the status of the license and the mobilisation phase[1][2][5].

**Limitations and Uncertainties**
- The duration of the mobilisation phase can vary depending on the bank's operational readiness and the regulator's assessment.
- While the typical period is up to 12 months, unforeseen compliance or operational issues could cause delays.
- As of May 2025, there is no public information indicating that Revolut is experiencing such issues, but regulatory processes can be unpredictable.

## Conclusion

Based on the standard regulatory timeline, the absence of reported delays, and official statements, it is likely—but not certain—that the restrictions on Revolut's UK banking license will be removed before July 26, 2025. The process is subject to regulatory discretion, but all available evidence points to a timely conclusion of the mobilisation phase[1][2][5].
