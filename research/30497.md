### Limitations and Uncertainties

- While recent years have seen warmer Decembers, natural variability means that brief cold snaps below 0°F are still possible.
- Climate change has contributed to a general warming trend, but does not eliminate the possibility of subzero events in any given year.
- Measurement uncertainties are minimal, as the IEM data is sourced from official observing networks.
- The question will only resolve based on the IEM data; missing or unavailable data may delay or annul resolution.
