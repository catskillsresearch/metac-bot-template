# November 2024 Global Temperature Analysis

Based on available data as of December 2024, I can provide the following analysis regarding the November 2024 global temperature anomaly.

## Actual November 2024 Temperature Anomaly

The November 2024 global surface temperature was 1.34°C (2.41°F) above the 20th-century average of 12.9°C (55.2°F), making it the second-warmest November on record[1]. This confirms that the global temperature increase for November 2024 did exceed 1.31 degrees Celsius.

## Historical Context and Recent Trends

NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) maintains monthly climate reports that track global temperature anomalies[3]. These reports provide historical context for understanding how November 2024's temperatures compare to previous years.

The November 2024 temperature anomaly of 1.34°C represents a continuation of the warming trend observed in recent years. This places November 2024 as the second-warmest November in the historical record[1].

## Regional Temperature Patterns

While global averages provide the overall picture, regional patterns for November 2024 show significant variations:

- In the United States, temperature anomalies were elevated across much of the country, with 166 out of 191 analyzed cities experiencing warmer-than-normal conditions[5]
- The highest temperature anomalies stretched from the Rocky Mountains eastward[5]
- Fifteen U.S. cities, including all five cities monitored in Louisiana, recorded their hottest November ever, while an additional 38 cities experienced one of their top five hottest Novembers[5]
- The average temperature anomaly across all U.S. cities analyzed was 3.7°F above normal[5]
- 182 out of 191 ACIS stations analyzed had positive temperature trends for November[5]

## Influencing Factors

Several climate factors influenced the November 2024 temperatures:

### ENSO Conditions
As of mid-November 2024, there was a 57% chance that La Niña conditions would develop[4]. This is notable because:

- La Niña development was occurring unusually late in the year[4]
- Only two La Niñas in the 75-year historical record had formed in October-December[4]
- Forecasters predicted that if La Niña did develop, it would likely be weak, with a Niño-3.4 anomaly between -0.5°C and -0.9°C[4]
- Cooler-than-average water under the surface of the tropical Pacific had the potential to well up and affect surface temperatures[4]

### U.S. Climate Outlook
The Climate Prediction Center's outlook for November 2024, released on October 31, had favored:

- Well above average temperatures across the central and eastern parts of the United States, as well as in northern Alaska[2]
- Well above average precipitation in the Pacific Northwest, parts of the central U.S., and southern Alaska[2]
- Below-average precipitation along the East Coast from North Carolina to Maine and in extreme southern Louisiana[2]

## Verification Sources

The primary source for verification of global temperature anomalies is NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI), which publishes monthly climate reports[1][3]. The specific resolution criteria for this question references NOAA's "Climate at a Glance" global time-series tool, which provides official temperature anomaly data.

## Measurement Limitations and Uncertainties

When interpreting global temperature anomalies, several limitations should be considered:

1. Temperature outlooks provide information about the most likely outcome, but other outcomes are also possible, just less likely[2]
2. Regional variations can be significant, even when global averages show warming
3. Short-term climate patterns like ENSO (El Niño-Southern Oscillation) can influence year-to-year temperature variations
