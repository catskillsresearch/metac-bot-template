### 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The ACA has withstood multiple repeal attempts since 2010, including the high-profile 2017 effort that failed by a narrow Senate margin.
- Republican control of the presidency and Congress as of early 2025 has led to renewed calls for major ACA changes, but the party lacks a filibuster-proof Senate majority[4][5].
- Administrative moves, such as the March 2025 proposed rule, target regulatory tightening and aim to reduce improper ACA enrollments and subsidy spending, but do not by themselves repeal major statutory components[5].

### 2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- **Legislation:** H.R.114 has been introduced in the House, proposing a full repeal of the ACA. While introduction alone does not guarantee passage, it reflects renewed legislative intent to target the law[4].
- **Executive Action:** The Trump administration’s March 2025 proposed rule would restrict ACA Marketplace eligibility and reduce access to premium tax credits, with an explicit goal of decreasing improper enrollment. Public comments on this rule closed in April 2025, and its final implementation could impact enrollment and subsidies[5].
- **Budget Reconciliation:** Republicans can use the reconciliation process to pass budget-impacting changes to Medicaid, premium tax credits, and other ACA components with a simple majority, as attempted in 2017. However, the scope of what can be changed via reconciliation is limited by Senate rules and subject to the political will of moderate senators.

### 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- **Kaiser Family Foundation**: Tracks and analyzes all major ACA-related legislative and regulatory changes[1].
- **Congress.gov**: Repository for legislative proposals such as H.R.114[4].
- **CMS and Executive Branch Statements**: Announcements and analyses of regulatory proposals[5].

### 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- **Political Constraints:** While Republicans control both chambers and the presidency, Senate procedural rules and the need for party unity (especially among moderates) may limit the scope of changes.
- **Legislative vs. Regulatory Action:** Regulatory changes can reduce enrollment and limit subsidies but do not constitute statutory repeal; only passed legislation affecting at least three major ACA components would resolve the question as "Yes."
- **Pace of Legislation:** Legislative cycles, committee markup, and potential legal challenges could delay or dilute proposed changes.
- **Public Opinion:** Past efforts have shown that provisions like Medicaid expansion and pre-existing conditions protections are popular, creating resistance to full-scale repeal.

### Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given current trends, recent regulatory and legislative activity, and the political balance of power as of May 2025, there is a **moderate but not high probability** (estimated at 30–40%) that at least three major components of the ACA will be repealed or curtailed before January 1, 2026. The most likely avenues are through budget reconciliation targeting Medicaid expansion, premium subsidies, and eligibility tightening, but full statutory repeal or curtailment of multiple components faces significant procedural and political hurdles.
