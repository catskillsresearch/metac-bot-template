Based on the available information as of May 13, 2025, there are several significant developments that indicate substantial changes to the Affordable Care Act (ACA) are likely before 2026.

## Current Legislative and Administrative Actions

The 119th Congress (2025-2026) has introduced H.R.114, titled "Responsible Path to Full..." which explicitly aims to repeal the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010[2]. This bill represents a direct legislative attempt to dismantle the ACA framework entirely.

Simultaneously, the Trump Administration has taken administrative action through a proposed rule issued on March 10, 2025, which would significantly amend regulations governing insurance coverages subject to the ACA[5]. This proposed rule, which completed its public comment period on April 11, 2025, contains several provisions that would substantially curtail key ACA components:

1. It would reduce enrollment in ACA marketplace plans
2. It would reduce the number of people who access premium tax credits and cost-sharing reductions
3. It would limit benefits available to individuals, including specific coverage for certain health services[5]

The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has publicly supported these changes, citing a report from the Paragon Health Institute claiming "4 to 5 million people were improperly enrolled in subsidized ACA coverage in 2024, costing federal taxpayers up to $20 billion"[5].

## Potential Economic and Coverage Impact

A Congressional Budget Office (CBO) analysis released on May 10, 2025, warns that allowing ACA subsidies to expire would lead to millions of Americans losing healthcare coverage[3]. Despite this warning, "a growing number of Republicans have supported" letting these subsidies expire[3], suggesting political will exists to make substantial changes to the ACA's subsidy structure.

The impact analysis accompanying the Trump Administration's proposed rule explicitly acknowledges that it would:
- Reduce ACA plan enrollment
- Limit access to premium tax credits and cost-sharing reductions
- Restrict certain essential health benefits[5]

## Forecast Assessment

Given the concrete legislative and administrative actions already underway in 2025, there is a high probability that at least three major components of the ACA will be curtailed before 2026. Specifically:

1. **Premium tax credits**: Both the proposed rule and Republican support for letting subsidies expire indicate this component is likely to be curtailed[3][5].

2. **Marketplace enrollment and regulations**: The proposed rule explicitly aims to reduce enrollment and change marketplace regulations[5].

3. **Essential health benefits**: The proposed rule specifically mentions limiting benefits available to individuals[5].

4. **Full repeal potential**: H.R.114 represents a comprehensive repeal attempt that, if successful, would eliminate all ACA components[2].

The Trump Administration's characterization of its proposed rule as its "first major attempt to reform" the ACA suggests additional administrative actions may follow[5], potentially targeting other components like the employer mandate or medical underwriting restrictions.

While the full repeal bill (H.R.114) would face significant legislative hurdles, the administrative pathway through rule changes appears to be actively progressing, with the March 2025 proposed rule having already completed its public comment period[5]. This dual-track approach increases the likelihood that significant ACA changes will be implemented before 2026.
