# Spirit Airlines Bankruptcy Risk Assessment

As of August 2, 2024, Spirit Airlines faces significant financial challenges that raise questions about its potential bankruptcy filing before October 1, 2024. This analysis examines the available evidence to help forecast this possibility.

## Financial Status and Trends

Spirit Airlines' financial health has deteriorated significantly in recent periods:

- Fitch Ratings downgraded Spirit Airlines to 'CCC' on May 7, 2024, indicating substantial credit risk[1]
- This downgrade followed an earlier downgrade to 'B-' with a Negative outlook on January 23, 2024[3]
- Fitch expects Spirit's financial metrics to remain "well outside of levels supportive of a 'B-' rating at least through 2024 and likely 2025"[1]
- The airline faces a potential liquidity shortfall with more than $1.1 billion in debt maturities coming due in 2025[5]
- Spirit Airlines released its Q2 2024 financial results on August 1, 2024[4]

## Key Risk Factors

Several factors contribute to Spirit's financial distress:

- The blocked merger with JetBlue has eliminated a potential lifeline for the company[5]
- Ongoing cash burn continues to deplete the airline's financial resources[5]
- Spirit's probability of financial distress has previously been assessed at above 80%[2]
- The company has reportedly been "unprofitable from an operating standpoint since the start of the 2020 pandemic" (as noted in the question description)

## Creditor Positioning

Bondholders appear to be preparing for potential bankruptcy scenarios:

- A group of bondholders has organized with Akin Gump and Evercore to explore recovery options[5]
- These bondholders have raised a "triple dip" argument for recovery beyond the intangible assets backing their notes[5]
- Risk factors in offering memorandums warn that in a Spirit bankruptcy scenario, the parent company may be unable to perform its obligations[5]

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors limit the precision of any bankruptcy forecast:

- The detailed contents of Spirit's Q2 2024 results (released August 1, 2024) are not fully specified in the available information[4]
- The exact timeline of Spirit's cash runway is unclear from the available data
- Management may pursue alternative financing options or strategic alternatives not disclosed in the available information
- External factors such as industry conditions, fuel prices, and travel demand could influence the company's trajectory

## Conclusion

Based on the available information as of August 2, 2024, Spirit Airlines faces severe financial challenges that put it at high risk of bankruptcy. The credit rating downgrade to 'CCC', ongoing cash burn, blocked merger with JetBlue, and substantial debt maturities in 2025 all point to significant financial distress. However, the exact timing of any potential bankruptcy filing remains uncertain, and the company may explore alternatives to avoid or delay such an outcome.
