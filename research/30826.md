# Analysis of Biden's Executive Order Patterns for December 2024 Forecast

Based on available information as of December 6, 2024, I'll analyze whether President Biden is likely to sign 2 or more executive orders between Election Day (November 5, 2024) and January 1, 2025.

## Current Status and Recent Activity

As of early December 2024, President Biden has issued one executive order since Election Day. Specifically, on November 21, 2024, he signed an "Executive Order on Establishing a Second Emergency Board to Investigate a Dispute Between New Jersey Transit Rail Operations and Its Locomotive Engineers Represented by the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen."[5]

Throughout his presidency, Biden has issued a total of 143 executive orders up to early December 2024, averaging approximately 37 executive orders per year.[5] This represents the third-lowest average among presidents who have held office since 1981, with Barack Obama averaging 35 per year (the lowest) and Donald Trump averaging 55 per year (the highest in that timeframe).[5]

## Historical Patterns

Looking at Biden's historical patterns of issuing executive orders in December:
- December 2021: 6 executive orders
- December 2022: 2 executive orders
- December 2023: 3 executive orders

This shows a consistent pattern of issuing multiple executive orders in December, with an average of 3.67 orders in this month across his presidency.

It's also worth noting that Biden did not issue any executive orders in October 2024 and issued only one in November 2024.[5] This recent slowdown could indicate either a reduced pace of executive action or potentially a buildup of orders that might be released in December.

## Lame Duck Period Considerations

The period between Election Day and the inauguration of a new president (known as the "lame duck" period) often sees outgoing presidents using executive orders to cement their legacy or implement policies that might be difficult to reverse. This historical pattern across administrations suggests an increased likelihood of executive order activity during December 2024.

Given that December 2024 represents Biden's final full month in office, there may be increased incentive to use executive authority to finalize policy priorities before the transition to a new administration in January 2025.

## Forecast Factors

Several factors support the possibility of Biden signing 2 or more executive orders before January 1, 2025:

1. Historical precedent of issuing multiple executive orders in December (average of 3.67)
2. The "lame duck" period tendency for increased executive action
3. Potential backlog from October and November 2024, which saw reduced executive order activity

Factors that might reduce the likelihood include:
1. The recent slowdown in executive order issuance (none in October 2024, only one in November 2024)[5]
2. Potential focus on transition activities rather than new policy initiatives

## Limitations and Uncertainties

The forecast is limited by:
- Inability to predict specific policy needs that might arise in December 2024
- Lack of information about executive orders that might be in development but not yet announced
- Potential impact of political developments that could accelerate or decelerate executive action
