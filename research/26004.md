### Key Factual Information Relevant to Forecast

- As of July 5, 2024, Donald Trump led Joe Biden by +2.4 percentage points in FiveThirtyEight's national polling average[1].
- On June 27, 2024 (debate day), Trump's lead was only +0.2 points, indicating a significant post-debate swing in his favor[1].
- The polling average is updated daily and incorporates poll recency, sample size, methodology, and house effects[1].
- Biden's widely criticized debate performance and subsequent calls for him to drop out have contributed to the recent widening of Trump's lead.
- The Biden campaign has taken steps to counter negative perceptions and insists Biden will remain in the race, but internal reports acknowledge the need for rapid improvement in public opinion.
- The current polling trend shows Trump's lead stabilizing in the low-to-mid 2-point range as of July 9, 2024[1].
- Polling averages can change quickly in response to new events or polling releases, and the average is a lagging indicator, so sharp changes may not be immediately reflected.

### Authoritative Source for Verification

- FiveThirtyEight's national polling average for the 2024 presidential election is the definitive source for this metric and is updated daily[1].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- The polling average may fluctuate due to new polls or major campaign developments.
- The average smooths over recent polls, so sudden shifts may be delayed or muted.
- The political environment remains volatile, and further movement in either direction is possible before July 15.

### Summary Table

**Conclusion:**  
As of July 9, 2024, Trump's lead over Biden in 538's national polling average is within the 2â€“3 point range (+2.4). The trend suggests it is plausible, though not certain, that the lead will remain in this range on July 15, 2024.
