### Doomsday Clock Setting as of January 29, 2025

- **Current Status:**  
  As of the latest official announcement on January 23, 2024, the Doomsday Clock remains set at **90 seconds to midnight**—the closest it has ever been to symbolic apocalypse. This setting reflects ongoing concerns about nuclear risk, climate change, disruptive technologies, and biosecurity[3][4].

- **Upcoming Announcement:**  
  The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists has scheduled the next Doomsday Clock announcement for January 28, 2025, at 10:00 a.m. EST[1]. No information about a new setting has been released prior to this event.

- **Resolution Criteria:**  
  According to the question's fine print, if no new setting is announced before noon EST on January 29, 2025, the answer defaults to the current setting—**90 seconds to midnight**.

- **Recent Trends:**  
  The clock has remained at 90 seconds to midnight since 2023, reflecting heightened global risks, especially due to the war in Ukraine, climate crisis, and the breakdown of global norms[3][4]. No significant progress has been made to justify moving the hands back[3].

- **Limitations and Uncertainties:**  
  The only uncertainty is whether the January 28, 2025, announcement will change the setting. As of the knowledge cutoff (January 11, 2025), no such change has been announced. Any conflicting reports (such as a 100-second setting) are not supported by the Bulletin's official statements[5].

#### **Forecasted Answer**
**90 seconds to midnight (unchanged)**
