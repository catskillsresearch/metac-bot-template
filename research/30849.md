## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Russia has repeatedly rejected calls for a bilateral ceasefire, instead presenting extensive territorial demands as preconditions for any ceasefire agreement[1][2][3].
- The Russian delegation in recent talks (Istanbul, May 2025) insisted Ukraine must cede all of Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhia, Kherson, and Crimea, and that these be internationally recognized as Russian territory before any ceasefire would be considered[2][3].
- Russia has also threatened to expand its demands to include Kharkiv and Sumy oblasts, signaling a further hardening of its position[2].
- Ukraine and its Western allies, including the US and Europe, continue to insist that a ceasefire must precede peace settlement negotiations, a sequence Russia rejects[2].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- The Trump administration has proposed a peace plan that would offer US recognition of Russian sovereignty over occupied Crimea and de facto recognition of Russian control over currently occupied Ukrainian territories, with security guarantees for Ukraine. Russia has rejected these proposals as inadequate, maintaining maximalist demands[3].
- Russian officials, including those close to President Putin, have publicly reiterated that Ukraine must abandon its NATO aspirations, withdraw from all contested oblasts, and forgo any claims to war reparations before a ceasefire or peace talks can proceed[3].
- The Kremlin appears to be increasing its list of demands and is not engaging in good-faith negotiations for either a ceasefire or a broader peace settlement[1][2][3].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- The situation remains fluid, and a dramatic shift in battlefield dynamics, internal Russian politics, or Western policy could alter incentives for negotiation.
- Publicly reported demands and positions may not fully reflect private negotiations, though all available evidence points to entrenched positions on both sides.
- The Trump administrationâ€™s approach could change upon taking office, but as of May 2025, there is no sign Russia is prepared to accept any ceasefire short of major Ukrainian territorial concessions.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the current maximalist Russian demands, the lack of overlap with Ukrainian and Western positions, and the pattern of Russia using ceasefire talks as leverage rather than as a genuine step toward de-escalation, the probability of a comprehensive, bilateral ceasefire standing for 30 days before the end of 2025 is very low. Barring a dramatic and unforeseen shift, the likelihood is well below 20%.
