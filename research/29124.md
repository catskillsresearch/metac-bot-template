## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- **Current Law**: South Dakota bans abortion in nearly all cases, with exceptions only to save the life of the mother. There are no exceptions for rape or incest. This law took effect after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022[1][3][5].
- **Amendment G**: The proposed amendment would establish a constitutional right to abortion, using a trimester framework:
  - First trimester: No state regulation allowed.
  - Second trimester: State may regulate only for the physical health of the mother.
  - Third trimester: State may prohibit abortion except to preserve the life or health of the mother, as determined by her physician[1][3][5].

## Recent Polling and Public Opinion

- A scientific poll conducted in June 2024 of 500 registered South Dakota voters found:
  - 53% support Constitutional Amendment G
  - 35% oppose
  - 11% are undecided
- This represents a significant increase in support compared to a November 2023 poll (46% support, 44% oppose)[3].

## Arguments and Campaigns

- **Proponents** argue the amendment restores rights lost after Roe v. Wade was overturned and protects reproductive freedom[1].
- **Opponents** claim the amendment would allow late-term abortions, remove parental notification requirements, and deregulate abortion providers, raising concerns about safety and parental rights[4][5].

## Authoritative Sources

- Ballotpedia and the South Dakota Secretary of State provide official information on the ballot measure[2].
- Polling and analysis from South Dakota News Watch and the Chiesman Center for Democracy offer insight into voter sentiment[3].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- The most recent poll is from June 2024, several months before the election, and 11% of voters remain undecided[3].
- South Dakota is a conservative state, and ballot measure outcomes can shift due to late campaigning, turnout, or changes in public opinion.
- The measure’s opponents are actively campaigning on issues such as parental rights and late-term abortion, which could influence undecided voters[4][5].

## Summary

As of October 23, 2024, available evidence suggests that Constitutional Amendment G has a lead in public support, with 53% in favor and 35% opposed according to the latest poll. However, a significant portion of voters remain undecided, and the outcome could be affected by late-campaign dynamics and South Dakota’s conservative electorate. The result remains uncertain, but current data indicate the amendment is favored to pass if trends hold[3].
