## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- **Circle Internet Group, Inc. (CRCL) has filed to go public on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)**, with public filings showing an intended listing under the symbol CRCL[1][4].
- The company filed its S-1 registration statement on April 1, 2025, following a confidential SEC submission in December 2023[2][4].
- Industry and news sources indicate Circle was targeting an IPO in the first half of 2025, with some reports specifically suggesting the IPO "could launch by June"[3][5].
- Circle previously attempted to go public via a SPAC merger, but the deal was terminated in late 2022 due to SEC review delays[4][5].

## 2. Recent Announcements and Policies Impacting the Timeline

- As of mid-May 2025, Circle's IPO status is "Filed" with the NYSE, but **no official listing date, pricing, or SEC registration effectiveness has been announced**[1][4].
- Reports cite that Circle hired major investment banks (J.P. Morgan, Citi, Barclays, Deutsche Bank, Societe Generale) as underwriters[4].
- The company has not disclosed the IPO's final terms, underwriter allocation, or roadshow timing—steps typically completed within weeks of filing but occasionally delayed, especially for crypto firms[3][4].
- Regulatory and market conditions, as stated by Circle itself, could impact the IPO's timing[5].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- **NASDAQ.com IPO Overview** confirms the IPO filing status and intended NYSE listing[1].
- **Renaissance Capital** and **IPOScoop** provide filing history, estimated proceeds, and underwriter details[2][4].
- **Industry news from PYMNTS and Daloopa** discuss the expected "by June" timeline and recent filings, while also noting past delays and the lack of official confirmation[3][5].

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- **No official IPO date or pricing disclosed**: The final listing can only occur after SEC effectiveness, pricing, and public announcement—all pending as of May 14, 2025[1][4].
- **Crypto sector regulatory scrutiny**: Previous delays (notably the failed SPAC) and heightened SEC review for crypto firms could still impact the timeline[4][5].
- **Market conditions disclaimer**: Circle has stated the IPO is "subject to market conditions," leaving room for unforeseen delays[5].

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

- Given the advanced stage of filings, underwriter engagement, and repeated indications of a "by June" target, a **listing before July 1, 2025 remains plausible but not confirmed**.
- The lack of an official date or pricing, along with the SEC's history of close scrutiny for crypto IPOs, increases the risk of a delay into July or beyond.
- **Probabilistic estimate**: There is a moderate-to-high likelihood (60-75%) that Circle will be publicly traded on the NYSE before July 1, 2025, but this is not yet assured.
