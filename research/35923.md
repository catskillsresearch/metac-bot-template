### 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Since the enactment of the IRA in August 2022, the domestic content provision for the ITC has been structured as an elective *bonus*â€”offering an additional 10% tax credit for projects that meet specific domestic content thresholds for steel, iron, and manufactured products[1][2].
- As of May 2025, projects can qualify for this bonus by certifying compliance with domestic content requirements, but these requirements are *not mandatory* for obtaining the base ITC under Section 48E[1][3][5].
- IRS guidance, most recently Notice 2025-08 issued in January 2025, maintains the elective nature of the domestic content credit and updates safe harbor provisions for calculating compliance, but does not propose or implement any mandate making domestic content a condition for the ITC itself[3][5].

### 2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- The Republican-controlled Congress and White House are actively pursuing a budget reconciliation bill in 2025 that seeks to *reduce* or *phase out* green energy subsidies, not make them stricter[4]. There is no legislative text or public proposal from Congressional leadership to transform the domestic content bonus into a mandatory requirement for ITC eligibility.
- IRS Notices in 2023, 2024, and the latest in 2025 continue to clarify and refine how the bonus is calculated and certified, but always within the framework of an *optional* bonus, not a mandate[3][5].
- The House Republican caucus is divided, with some urging a phaseout rather than outright repeal of clean energy tax credits, but no coalition or public movement exists advocating for stricter mandatory domestic content requirements[4].

### 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- IRS guidance on the domestic content bonus credit (January 2025): Describes the elective, bonus nature of the credit and the latest safe harbor rules[1][3][5].
- Congressional Research Service and legislative tracking: No bills or amendments as of April 2025 to make domestic content a mandatory ITC requirement[2].
- Public statements by House leadership and Republican members confirm the focus is on reducing, not increasing, clean energy requirements[4].

### 4. Limitations or Uncertainties

- Congressional budget reconciliation is ongoing, and while the probability of significant changes to the ITC exists, the prevailing political incentive is to reduce green energy support, not to add new requirements.
- Legislative outcomes can be unpredictable, especially with a slim House majority and potential for individual defections or negotiations.
- No evidence as of April 2025 suggests an imminent shift toward making domestic content mandatory for the ITC.

**Probabilistic Assessment:**  
Based on current trends, authoritative guidance, and the political environment, the probability that domestic content requirements will become mandatory for Section 48E ITC eligibility before January 1, 2026, is *very low* (estimated <5%). The legal and regulatory framework as of April 2025, recent legislative signals, and public IRS guidance all point toward continued elective bonus treatment rather than a mandate.
