### 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Under the Inflation Reduction Act, the domestic content requirement for the Investment Tax Credit (ITC), including under Section 48E, is currently structured as a *bonus*. Projects that meet specific domestic content thresholds (certain percentages of steel, iron, and manufactured products made in the US) receive up to a 10% additional credit, but this is not required to access the base ITC[1][2][3].
- The IRS has issued ongoing guidance, most recently Notice 2025-08, refining safe harbors and calculation methods for the domestic content bonus but has not changed the underlying structure—domestic content remains a bonus, not a prerequisite for the base credit[3].
- There have been additional rules for some entities (e.g., nonprofits using direct pay), where failing to meet domestic content can reduce the credit, but this is not a universal mandate for all ITC recipients[5].

### 2. Recent Announcements and Policies

- As of April 2025, the IRS guidance (including for Section 48E) continues to treat domestic content as an optional bonus, not a mandatory prerequisite for ITC[1][3][4].
- The new Congress and White House, under Republican control, have discussed modifying or phasing out IRA clean energy incentives, with a focus on reducing, not expanding, requirements.
- A group of Republican representatives advocates for a “thoughtful phaseout” rather than elimination or expansion of green credits, and House Speaker Mike Johnson indicated a selective, not sweeping, approach to changes.

### 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- IRS official guidance on the domestic content bonus, most recently Notice 2025-08[1][3].
- Congressional Research Service and major tax advisory firms summarize the current requirements and updates[2][4].
- Industry advisories and IRS notices regarding elective pay and credit phaseouts for specific entities, not for all ITC recipients[5].

### 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- The reconciliation process remains ongoing and politically volatile; slim majorities and diverse caucus interests may limit the likelihood of major changes, as seen in past legislative efforts (e.g., the failed 2017 ACA repeal).
- No enacted or imminent federal legislation before April 10, 2025, makes domestic content requirements mandatory for all 48E ITC claims.
- The current structure allows for future changes, but as of this date, the requirement remains a bonus only.

### **Probabilistic Assessment**

Based on all available data as of April 10, 2025, the probability that domestic content requirements will become *mandatory* for obtaining the 48E Investment Tax Credit before January 1, 2026, is **very low**. The most likely scenario is continued bonus eligibility, with potential for phaseout or scaling back of credits rather than expansion of requirements.
