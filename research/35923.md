### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Deftones' last album, *Ohms*, was released in 2020. Since then, fans and media have anticipated a follow-up.
- In a December 2024 interview (published February 2025), Chino Moreno stated the new album was "getting very close" to completion and that the plan was to have it out "sometime around" their North American tour, which began February 25, 2025[2].
- As of March 13, 2025, there has been no official announcement of a new album release date, title, or pre-release campaign (such as singles, pre-orders, or cover art) from the band or their label[2][5].

### Recent Announcements and Policies

- The band kicked off a North American tour on February 25, 2025, with no new album released or officially announced at the start of the tour[2][4][5].
- Multiple reputable music news outlets (Consequence, BrooklynVegan) report that a new Deftones album is expected in 2025 but do not specify a release window before April 1, 2025[2][5].
- The band's official channels and tour promotions focus on live performances and do not mention a new album release[3].

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The primary resolution source is the Deftones' discography on Genius.com.
- Secondary verification comes from major music news outlets such as Consequence, BrooklynVegan, and Billboard Espa√±ol[2][4][5].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- While Chino Moreno's statements suggest the album is nearing completion, there is no concrete evidence (such as a release date or official announcement) that it will be released before April 1, 2025[2][5].
- Album releases can be delayed due to production, marketing, or strategic reasons, and no pre-release activities have been observed as of the cutoff date.
- The band's touring schedule is consistent with album promotion cycles, but this is not definitive proof of an imminent release.

### Conclusion

Based on all available information as of March 13, 2025, there is no factual basis to forecast that Deftones will release a new album before April 1, 2025. The album is expected later in 2025, but no evidence supports a release within the specified window.
