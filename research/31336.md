## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of early 2025, the Kalshi prediction market for "Which party will win the 2028 Presidential Election?" currently shows the Democratic Party contract trading at 52% (53¢) and the Republican at 48% (48¢)[3]. This implies that, at present, market participants see the Democrats as modest favorites for 2028.
- Prediction markets like Kalshi have grown in popularity and liquidity, especially during US election cycles, making them a significant barometer of collective expectations[1][5]. Historically, these markets have sometimes shifted in response to major political events or candidate announcements, but at this early stage, probabilities tend to be volatile.

## Recent Announcements or Policies Affecting the Metric

- No major new policy moves or candidate declarations have dramatically shifted market odds as of January 2025. The frontrunners for both parties remain speculative, with betting markets listing figures like Gavin Newsom and JD Vance as leading contenders for their respective parties[5].
- Non-American sportsbooks like BetMGM UK currently have the Republican Party favored (-162, 61.9% implied probability), highlighting a divergence between Kalshi and some international betting markets[5].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The Kalshi market page for 2028 Presidential Election party winner provides up-to-date, authoritative data on current market odds[3].
- Additional context and comparison can be found via coverage by Action Network and other betting odds aggregators[5].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- The 2028 election is still nearly four years away. The primary fields for both parties are not yet finalized, and significant events (scandals, economic changes, major candidate announcements) could shift probabilities quickly.
- Prediction markets at this stage reflect broad sentiment and strategic trading rather than concrete information about the candidates or issues that will define the 2028 race.
- The actual resolution for the forecasted week in December 2025 will depend on prices at that time; current trends are a useful indicator but far from determinative.

## Probabilistic Assessment

Given the current Kalshi market prices (Democrats at 52%), and barring a major political shock or a significant shift in candidate prospects, it is slightly more likely than not that Democrats will remain favored (i.e., have a higher median price) in the last week of 2025. However, the margin is narrow, and substantial volatility is expected as the political landscape evolves.

> "As of January 2025, the Democrats are modest favorites on Kalshi, but the odds are close, and significant shifts are possible before the end of the year."
