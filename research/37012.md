## Key Trends and Current Status

- As of May 16, 2025, the Project 2025 Tracker shows 101 objectives classified as "Done" out of a total of 313 objectives, representing 32% completion[2].
- 64 objectives are currently "In Progress" (20%), and 148 are "Not Started" (47%)[2].
- Recent reporting confirms that about one-third of the Project 2025 objectives have been completed in the first four months of the current administration, aligning with the tracker’s numbers[5].

## Recent Announcements and Policy Momentum

- The Trump administration has actively embraced the Project 2025 recommendations, with early executive orders and policy moves reflecting the agenda[4][5].
- Key personnel associated with Project 2025 have been appointed to influential roles, accelerating implementation[4].
- The pipeline of 60+ objectives "In Progress" suggests a strong likelihood of further completions in the next six weeks, potentially surpassing the 120 threshold by July 1, 2025[2][5].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The primary source for the number of completed objectives is the Project 2025 Tracker website, which provides real-time updates and public documentation of progress[1][2].
- Independent media and policy watchdogs have corroborated the tracker’s reported rates of completion and policy implementation[4][5].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- The tracker’s classification of "Done" relies on transparent but potentially subjective criteria; minor lags in updating or definitional disputes could affect the count near the threshold[2][5].
- No evidence currently suggests a slowdown or reversal in policy implementation, but unforeseen political or legal developments could impact the pace.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the current tally (101 "Done") and the large number of objectives "In Progress" (64), as well as the administration's demonstrated commitment to Project 2025, it is highly probable that the Project 2025 Tracker will classify at least 120 objectives as "Done" by July 1, 2025—barring an unexpected stall in progress.
