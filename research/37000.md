### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of May 15, 2025, Trump Golf Track reports Donald Trump has spent 24 of 114 days golfing in his second term, equaling 21.05% of his presidency[1].
- In his first term, Trump visited Trump Organization properties on roughly 30% of days (428 of 1,461 days), but played golf an estimated 261 times (one round every 5.6 days)[2].
- Media coverage and tracking sites suggest his golf activity continues at a similar rate in his second term, with a slight uptick in the early months[2][3].

### Recent Announcements and Policy Changes

- There have been no significant policy announcements or public scheduling shifts that would suggest a major change in Trump's golfing frequency[3][4].
- News reports highlight continued scrutiny of both the frequency and the cost of Trump's golf trips, but no evidence points to a reduction in outings[3][4].

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The primary resolution source is Trump Golf Track, which will display the "Percentage of Presidency" for golfing as of July 1, 2025[1].
- Supplementary verification can be found in contemporary news coverage and watchdog reporting[2][3].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- The metric is defined as "days spent golfing" divided by "days in office" in the second term, as reported by Trump Golf Track[1].
- The actual percentage may fluctuate if Trump's golfing frequency increases or decreases due to political, personal, or external events.
- Reporting relies on public scheduling and press coverage, which may not capture every outing.

### Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the current value of 21.05% after 114 days, if Trump maintains this frequency or slightly increases it (as is typical in summer months), the "Percentage of Presidency" spent golfing is likely to remain in the 20â€“25% range by July 1, 2025. This represents a slightly lower rate than the 30% of property visits in his first term, but aligns with observed golf activity and public tracking. The probability of the figure exceeding 25% by July 1, 2025, is moderate but not high unless there is a marked uptick in golfing days in the coming weeks.

> On July 1, 2025, Trump Golf Track will likely report that Donald Trump has spent between 20% and 25% of his second-term presidency golfing.
