## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of February 2025, the FATF "High-Risk Jurisdictions subject to a Call for Action" (black list) includes North Korea, Iran, and Myanmar[3][5].
- Changes to the black list are infrequent and typically foreshadowed by prior FATF warnings and monitoring activity[5].
- Myanmar remains under scrutiny; the FATF has explicitly stated that if "no further progress is made by June 2025, the FATF will consider countermeasures"[3][5].

## Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- The February 2025 FATF plenary highlighted Myanmar's continued deficiencies and set a clear deadline for progress by June 2025, implying potential escalation (e.g., stricter countermeasures), but not removal from the list[3][5].
- There have been several adjustments to the "grey list" (increased monitoring jurisdictions), but no public indications of new jurisdictions being considered for the black list as of May 2025[4].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- FATF official website, specifically the "High-Risk Jurisdictions subject to a Call for Action" and plenary updates[1][3].
- National financial intelligence authorities, such as the FIAU Malta, which relay FATF public statements[5].

## Limitations or Uncertainties

- Last-minute developments or confidential findings could alter the outcome, though such changes are usually telegraphed in advance.
- The FATF may escalate measures against Myanmar (e.g., stronger countermeasures) without technically adding or removing jurisdictions from the black list.
- No authoritative signals as of May 19, 2025, suggest imminent removal of any current blacklisted jurisdiction or addition of new ones.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

- **Probability of any jurisdiction being added to or removed from the FATF black list following the June 2025 plenary:** Low.
  - Most likely outcome: No change to the list.
  - Slight risk of escalated measures against Myanmar, but this would not constitute removal.
  - Very low likelihood of new jurisdictions being added or existing ones removed, based on current public information.
