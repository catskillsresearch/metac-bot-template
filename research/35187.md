# Will the US, EU, or Brazil formally recognize Alexander Lukashenko as the President of Belarus before April 1, 2025?

Based on available information as of February 19, 2025, I'll analyze the likelihood of the US, EU, or Brazil formally recognizing Alexander Lukashenko as the President of Belarus before April 1, 2025.

## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

Alexander Lukashenko has maintained power in Belarus for over 30 years and recently secured his seventh term in office through an election held on January 26, 2025[2][5]. According to official results, Lukashenko won with 86.82% of the vote with a reported turnout exceeding 85.7%[5].

The international community, particularly Western nations, has a history of not recognizing Lukashenko's legitimacy. Following the 2020 Belarusian presidential election:

- The European Union explicitly stated it did not recognize Lukashenko as the legitimate president of Belarus[4]
- The European Parliament recognized the coordination council as the "interim representation of the people" of Belarus[4]
- The EU declared that the 2020 elections were "neither free nor fair"[4]

This pattern of non-recognition has continued with the 2025 election, which Western governments have quickly criticized as dishonest[2].

## Recent Announcements/Policies

Several recent developments suggest continued non-recognition by the US and EU:

1. On January 26, 2025, Belarus held presidential elections that resulted in Lukashenko's reported victory with 87.6% of the vote according to state TV exit polls[3].

2. The EU has explicitly rejected the 2025 election results. High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Kaja Kallas and Commissioner for Enlargement Marta Kos issued a statement describing the election as a "sham" that was "neither free, nor fair"[5].

3. German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock remarked that "The people of Belarus had no choice. It is a bitter day for all those who long for freedom & democracy"[2].

4. As recently as August 9, 2024, the US, EU, UK, and Canada released a joint statement announcing new sanctions against Belarus, referring to "fraudulent presidential elections" that kept Lukashenko in power[1].

5. Opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, who remains in exile, publicly rejected the 2025 election results[2].

There is no specific information available about Brazil's position on recognizing Lukashenko based on the provided sources.

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

The most authoritative sources for verifying recognition status would be:

- Official statements from the US State Department or White House
- European Commission and European Council declarations
- Official communications from Brazil's Ministry of Foreign Affairs

Current statements from EU officials, including the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, clearly indicate non-recognition of the 2025 election results[5].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several limitations affect this analysis:

1. The search results do not contain specific information about Brazil's stance on recognizing Lukashenko.

2. While the current evidence strongly suggests continued non-recognition by the US and EU, diplomatic positions can change rapidly in response to geopolitical developments.

3. The search results do not include any statements specifically from US officials about the 2025 election, though the US joined sanctions against Belarus in August 2024 citing fraudulent elections[1].

4. The exact definition of "formal recognition" can vary, and diplomatic relations may continue at some level even without full recognition of leadership legitimacy.

Based on the available information, it appears highly unlikely that the US or EU will formally recognize Alexander Lukashenko as the legitimate President of Belarus before April 1, 2025, given their explicit rejection of both the 2020 and 2025 election results. There is insufficient information to make a determination regarding Brazil's position.
