# Forecasting US State Department Arms Sales in Q4 2024

The question asks whether the US State Department will approve more than 20 arms sales globally in the fourth quarter of 2024. Based on available information as of October 2024, I'll analyze relevant factors to help with this forecast.

## Historical Trends and Current Status

According to the data provided, the US State Department has already approved 9 arms sales in October 2024, the first month of Q4. This represents a higher monthly figure than the long-term average of 6.7 sales per month.

Several notable patterns emerge from the historical data:

- December tends to show increased activity in arms sales approvals compared to other months, with 17 approvals in December 2023 and 15 in December 2020.
- August 2024 saw an unprecedented 22 approvals, the highest monthly total in the dataset since records began in 2004.
- The overall trend for 2024 shows higher monthly averages than previous years, with significant spikes in August (22) and September (12).

The arms sales approval process involves both the State Department and congressional review. Under the Arms Export Control Act (AECA), the President must formally notify Congress 30 calendar days before concluding a government-to-government foreign military sale that exceeds certain thresholds ($14 million for major defense equipment, $50 million for defense articles or services, and $200 million for design and construction services)[1][2].

## Recent Policies and Factors Affecting Arms Sales

The formal notification process to Congress is a critical component of arms sales approvals. The State Department generally will not formally notify an arms transfer if a member of Congress raises significant concerns during the informal review stage, although the Department is not precluded from proceeding despite congressional holds[2].

The congressional review process includes:

1. An informal review period where Congress can raise concerns confidentially
2. A formal 30-day notification period during which Congress can review, modify, or block transactions
3. Congressional ability to block sales through joint resolutions of disapproval[5]

In exceptional circumstances, the President can declare an emergency to bypass the standard congressional review process, though this is infrequent[5].

## Verification Sources

The Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) maintains the official record of Major Arms Sales notifications on their website. This is the authoritative source for tracking State Department-approved arms sales, as mentioned in the resolution criteria.

The Congressional Research Service provides detailed information about the arms sales review process, including the formal notification requirements and congressional oversight mechanisms[1][4].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors create uncertainty in forecasting arms sales approvals:

1. **Political considerations**: The timing of the forecast period (November-December 2024) coincides with the post-election transition period in the US, which could affect the pace of approvals.

2. **Congressional review impact**: While the question focuses on State Department approvals rather than final sales, congressional concerns during the informal review stage can delay or prevent formal notifications[2].

3. **Threshold requirements**: Only sales exceeding certain monetary thresholds require congressional notification[3], meaning smaller sales might not be captured in the official counts.

4. **Emergency provisions**: The President has the authority to bypass standard review processes by declaring emergencies, which could potentially increase the number of approvals in certain circumstances[5].

Given that October 2024 already saw 9 approvals, and considering the historical pattern of increased activity in December, along with the generally higher approval rates in 2024 compared to previous years, there appears to be a reasonable possibility of exceeding 20 total approvals for Q4 2024. The record-setting month of August 2024 (22 approvals) demonstrates that such volumes are achievable within the current approval framework.
