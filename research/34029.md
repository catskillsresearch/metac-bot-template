## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Historically, the DOJ has seldom initiated criminal investigations or prosecutions against former or current presidents, vice presidents, or congressional leaders of the opposing party. Such actions are rare and typically require significant evidence, congressional referral, or media exposure.
- Under the Trump administration (2025), there has been a notable increase in DOJ activity targeting prominent Democrats. On May 21, 2025, the DOJ opened a criminal investigation into former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, after pressure from congressional Republicans, though Cuomo is not within the strict set defined by the question[1].
- The DOJ, as well as the FBI, have also initiated investigations into other high-profile Democratic state officials (e.g., New York Attorney General Letitia James), though they dropped a case against New York Mayor Eric Adams, citing a desire to enable his cooperation with federal priorities[1].

## Recent Announcements and Policy Shifts

- President Trump, during his 2024 campaign and subsequent administration, has repeatedly promised to investigate and prosecute political opponents, signaling a break from previous norms and raising expectations of increased federal law enforcement activity targeting Democrats[1].
- The DOJ under Attorney General Pam Bondi has shown responsiveness to congressional Republican requests for investigations, evidenced by the Cuomo probe[1].
- Public statements by Democratic leaders (e.g., Gov. Kathy Hochul) have characterized these actions as politicized and unprecedented[1].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- DOJ press releases, official statements, and major media coverage are considered credible sources under Metaculus rules.
- Spectrum News and other reputable outlets have reported on the DOJâ€™s recent investigations into high-profile Democrats at the state level as of May 2025[1].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- As of May 24, 2025, there is no public evidence or announcement of a DOJ investigation or prosecution targeting a Democratic president, vice president, congressional leader, whip, or impeachment manager.
- While the DOJ has shown increased willingness to investigate prominent Democrats, recent actions have focused on state-level officials, not those at the highest federal level defined by the question.
- The politicized climate and Trump's explicit campaign promises suggest an elevated probability of future action, but there remains substantial uncertainty due to the high-profile nature and legal complexity of such cases.
- Measurement is limited by the lack of transparent, advance information about DOJ deliberations and by the requirement that any qualifying action must be publicly and officially announced.

### Probabilistic Assessment (as of January 31, 2025)

Given:
- Recent DOJ actions against high-profile Democratic state officials,
- Public and political pressure from the Trump administration and congressional Republicans,
- No current evidence of announced investigations or prosecutions meeting the strict criteria as of May 2025,

**The probability that the DOJ will announce an investigation or prosecution of a Democrat who served as president, vice president, congressional leader, whip, or impeachment manager before January 1, 2026 is elevated compared to historical baselines, but remains uncertain and contingent on political developments and legal thresholds.**
