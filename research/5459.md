## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of October 2020, psilocybin was listed as a Schedule I substance under the Controlled Substances Act, denoting it as having "no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse." This placed it in the same category as heroin[1].
- Interest in the medical potential of psilocybin increased steadily over the preceding decade. In 2018, the FDA designated psilocybin as a "breakthrough therapy" for depression, expediting clinical research and signaling openness to future medical approval[1][5].
- Despite these developments, federal law maintained its Schedule I status, with only limited state or local decriminalization efforts.

## Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- From 2021 to 2025, state-level activity increased dramatically. States such as Illinois and West Virginia introduced bills to remove psilocybin from their own Schedule I lists; similar proposals have appeared in other states, often contingent on FDA approval of medical psilocybin[2][3][4].
- At the federal level, as of early 2025, House Bill 2218 sought to reschedule FDA-approved psilocybin compositions from Schedule I to Schedule IV—an unprecedented step for a psychedelic compound[1].
- The FDA continues to support psilocybin research, with expanded clinical trials for depression, PTSD, and addiction[1][5].
- The DEA has the authority to reschedule substances administratively, but typically acts only after FDA approval and a recommendation from the Department of Health and Human Services[5].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The status of psilocybin can be directly verified via the DEA's controlled substance schedules (see DEA publications or the official Controlled Substances Act schedule listings)[1][5].
- Legislative databases, such as those of the Illinois General Assembly and LegiScan, track state-level bills that may affect psilocybin's legal status[3][4].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- Federal rescheduling requires either an act of Congress or an administrative process following FDA approval; the latter is likely but not guaranteed to be swift.
- The timeline for FDA approval of psilocybin as a medicine depends on the outcomes of ongoing clinical trials, which could face delays.
- Political resistance within the DEA or Congress could slow or block rescheduling, as seen in the case of cannabis.
- The question will resolve ambiguously if the Controlled Substances Act is replaced with a similar system or if the DEA ceases classification.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the:
- Accelerated pace of clinical development,
- FDA's "breakthrough therapy" designation,
- Proactive state and federal legislative activity,
- Clearer pharmaceutical development pipeline (compared to cannabis),

The probability that psilocybin will be removed from Schedule I before 2036 is **high**—estimated in the range of 70–85%. However, uncertainty remains due to the potential for regulatory or political delays. The probability is significantly higher than it was in 2020, when such developments were only beginning to materialize.
