## Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of June 2021, Good Ventures was the dominant single donor in the EA space, donating an average of $246 million per year in 2019–2020[3]. 
- The total committed capital to EA causes was around $46 billion, with annual donations of approximately $420 million, but the vast majority of this was from a small number of donors, chiefly Good Ventures (via Open Philanthropy)[5].
- The growth in committed funds (~37% per year since 2015) and annual donations (~21% per year since 2015) underscores increasing resources, but not diversification among mega-donors[5].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- No public announcements or evidence from 2021–2025 indicate the emergence of a new, comparably large EA-aligned donor or foundation outside of Good Ventures/Open Philanthropy[4].
- New initiatives, like the Lead Exposure Action Fund, have been launched, but these remain within the Open Philanthropy ecosystem[4].
- Other EA-aligned organizations (e.g., Longview Philanthropy, The Life You Can Save) continue to grow, but have not reached comparable scale.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- Public disclosure is required for a donation to count, potentially excluding anonymous or less-publicized large donations.
- The EA alignment of a new donor would be subject to interpretation and community polling.
- Market volatility and the unpredictable emergence of new ultra-wealthy donors could affect the forecast, but as of June 2021, no such donor was evident.

## Key Differences Affecting the Forecast

- The absence of new EA-aligned billionaires publicly announcing large-scale giving.
- The continued dominance of Good Ventures/Open Philanthropy in funding scale.
- The high bar for both donation size and strict EA alignment as defined by the resolution criteria.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the above, the likelihood of a new donor (individual or foundation, other than Good Ventures) donating over $250 million (inflation-adjusted) to EA-aligned causes in a single year by 2026 is low—likely below 10%. This is due to the persistent concentration of funding, lack of public commitments from potential new donors at this scale, and the strict requirements for public disclosure and EA alignment[4][5].
