### Key Factual Information as of July 11, 2024

**1. ICC Prosecutor’s Application for Arrest Warrant**
- On May 20, 2024, ICC Prosecutor Karim A.A. Khan announced that he had filed applications for arrest warrants against several individuals, including Yoav Gallant, for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in Gaza[1].
- The Prosecutor stated there were “reasonable grounds to believe” Gallant bore criminal responsibility for these crimes[1].

**2. ICC Procedure and Status**
- The issuance of an arrest warrant is not automatic upon the Prosecutor’s application. The Pre-Trial Chamber must review the evidence and decide whether to grant the request[1].
- As of July 11, 2024, there is no official or public record that the ICC has issued an arrest warrant for Yoav Gallant. Only the application for such a warrant has been made public[1].

**3. Political and Diplomatic Context**
- There is significant international pressure, particularly from the US and G7 countries, to dissuade the ICC from issuing arrest warrants for Israeli officials, including Gallant, due to concerns about the impact on regional diplomacy and peace negotiations[1].
- This pressure may affect the timing or likelihood of the Pre-Trial Chamber’s decision but does not guarantee a specific outcome.

**4. Historical Precedent**
- The ICC has previously issued arrest warrants for high-profile leaders, such as Vladimir Putin, but the process from application to issuance can take weeks or months, depending on the complexity of the case and the evidence presented[1].

**5. Limitations and Uncertainties**
- The Pre-Trial Chamber’s deliberations are not public, and the timing of a decision is unpredictable.
- Only a public and official announcement of an arrest warrant for Yoav Gallant before September 30, 2024, would satisfy the resolution criteria.
- Secret warrants or anonymous reports do not meet the criteria unless officially disclosed before the deadline.

### Authoritative Sources for Verification
- The ICC’s official website and press releases are the primary sources for confirmation of any arrest warrant issuance[1].
- Major international news agencies and legal analysis from reputable organizations (e.g., Chatham House) provide context and updates[2].
