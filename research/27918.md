Based on the information available as of September 4, 2024, there is strong evidence that Boeing's Starliner spacecraft (Calypso) is scheduled to undock from the International Space Station before September 16, 2024.

## Current Status and Schedule

As of September 4, 2024, NASA and Boeing have officially scheduled the uncrewed Starliner spacecraft to autonomously undock from the International Space Station on Friday, September 6, 2024, at approximately 6:04 p.m. EDT[3][5]. After undocking, the spacecraft is expected to begin its journey back to Earth, with a targeted landing at White Sands Space Harbor in New Mexico at approximately 12:03 a.m. on Saturday, September 7, 2024[3][5].

NASA Kennedy Space Center's Commercial Crew Program Manager Steve Stich confirmed this timeline on September 4, 2024, stating that after undocking, Starliner will complete approximately a six-hour journey before reaching the landing zone[5].

## Mission Background

The Starliner "Calypso" capsule made history with the flight of the Crew Flight Test 1 (CFT) mission, which launched on June 5, 2024[4]. The mission brought astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams to the ISS, but due to technical issues with the spacecraft, including helium leaks and thruster malfunctions, NASA decided that the astronauts would not return on the Starliner.

## Return Operations

The return process will involve several key steps:

1. Starliner will autonomously undock from the space station's Harmony module at 6:04 p.m. EDT on September 6[2][5]
2. After undocking, there will be a "breakout burn" that will send the capsule over and away from the station[5]
3. NASA and Boeing teams will work together during the undocking and landing operations[5]
4. The deorbit burn, entry, and landing coverage is scheduled to resume at 10:50 p.m. EDT on September 6[3]

Both NASA and Boeing teams have been conducting simulations to prepare for the undocking and landing operations, according to Anthony Vareha, the International Space Station's flight director[5].

## Verification Sources

NASA is providing comprehensive coverage of the Starliner's departure and return to Earth. Live coverage will be available on NASA+, the NASA app, YouTube, and the agency's website[3]. Additionally, NASA has scheduled a pre-departure news conference and a post-landing news conference to provide updates on the mission[3].

## Conclusion

Based on the official statements from NASA and Boeing as of September 4, 2024, the Starliner Calypso spacecraft is scheduled to undock from the ISS on September 6, 2024, which is well before the September 16 deadline specified in the question. Unless there are unexpected delays or changes to the schedule after the knowledge cutoff date, the planned undocking should occur as scheduled.
