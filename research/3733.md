## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Satoshi Nakamoto’s coins—estimated between 600,000 and 1.1 million BTC—are distributed across more than 20,000 wallet addresses, most with the original 50 BTC block reward[1].
- None of these coins have moved since the initial mining period (2009–2010)[1].
- Satoshi’s identity remains unknown and no credible reports have ever confirmed any transfer of these coins[1][5].
- Occasionally, “Satoshi-era” coins from the same period have been spent, but these addresses have not been definitively linked to Satoshi[3].

## 2. Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Metric

- As of 2025, the main new risk is the theoretical threat posed by quantum computing, which could eventually compromise the cryptographic security of early wallet addresses[5].
- The CEO of Tether and other industry experts have warned that Satoshi’s coins could re-enter circulation if quantum computers become capable of breaking current cryptographic protections[5].
- No regulatory or technological policy has directly compelled or incentivized Satoshi or others to move these coins to date.

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Blockchain explorers confirm no movement from Satoshi’s known addresses, such as the genesis block wallet[1][4].
- Media and analytical reports continue to monitor these addresses for any signs of activity, and any movement would be widely reported[5].

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties in Measurement

- The precise list of Satoshi-owned addresses is estimated, not definitive. Estimates for the number of coins range from 600,000 to 1.1 million BTC[1][5].
- If Satoshi’s keys were lost, or if Satoshi is deceased, coins may never move. Conversely, lost keys might be recovered, or coins might be moved by heirs.
- If coins are spent for reasons unrelated to a hack (e.g., inheritance, gift, voluntary transfer), this would count as a positive resolution.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

- As of 2025, after 15+ years of total inactivity, the probability of Satoshi’s coins moving in the next 50 years remains low, but not zero.
- Technological risks, such as quantum computing, may increase the probability over time, especially toward the later decades of the period in question[5].
- Social, legal, or personal developments—such as a change in Satoshi's status or intentions—are unpredictable but possible.
- A reasonable forecast would place the chance of any Satoshi-linked bitcoin being spent by April 5, 2075 at roughly 10–20%, trending upward if quantum computing advances rapidly or new evidence about Satoshi emerges.
