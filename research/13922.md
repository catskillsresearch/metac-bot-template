## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Australia has historically been resilient to recessions, experiencing only one (during COVID-19) since 1991.
- As of 2022, inflation had surged, prompting the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) to raise interest rates, but the RBA signaled a cautious approach to tightening, prioritizing employment stability over aggressive inflation control[1].
- By late 2022, the yield curve had inverted, which is often interpreted as a warning sign for possible recession[1].

## 2. Recent Announcements and Policy Actions

- Economic growth has slowed: KPMG reports actual GDP growth of 1.0% in 2024 and forecasts 2.0% for 2025 and 1.8% for 2026; the IMF has downgraded Australia's 2025 growth outlook to 1.6%[1][3].
- The RBA cash rate peaked at 4.35% and is forecast to decline gradually through 2025–2026, with major banks expecting rate cuts to around 3.25–3.35% by mid-2026 as inflation pressures ease[1][5].
- The unemployment rate is projected to rise to about 4.5% in 2025, but not to levels commonly associated with deep recessions[4].
- Some finance experts warn of a possible 2025 recession due to weak household consumption and high living costs, but most bank economists expect a “soft landing” scenario—slower growth but not two consecutive quarters of GDP contraction[2][5].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) quarterly National Accounts for official GDP figures.
- KPMG, IMF, and major bank forecasts for forward-looking economic indicators[1][3][5].
- RBA statements and policy meeting minutes for monetary policy direction.
- Credible financial media (e.g., SBS, The Australian, Bloomberg).

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- GDP figures are subject to revision, and final determination will rely on the ABS’s official quarterly releases and any subsequent revisions.
- Yield curve inversion increases recession risk, but is not a definitive predictor, especially given Australia’s atypical recession history.
- External shocks (e.g., global trade disruptions, geopolitical events) could alter the outlook.
- Labor market resilience and policy flexibility (rate cuts) are key factors reducing recession risk, but household debt and cost-of-living pressures persist as downside risks.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the available data and forecasts as of early 2025, most authoritative sources project continued—albeit modest—GDP growth through 2025 and into 2026. While recession risks have increased compared to the past decade, the base case does not anticipate two consecutive quarters of GDP contraction before Q1 2026. The probability of Australia entering a technical recession before 2026 can be assessed as "elevated but less than 50%" based on mainstream forecasts[1][3][5].
