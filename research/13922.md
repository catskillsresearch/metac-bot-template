# Australia's Recession Risk Assessment: 2025-2026

As of May 2025, I've analyzed the latest economic forecasts to assess whether Australia will experience a technical recession (two consecutive quarters of GDP contraction) before Q1 2026.

## Current Economic Status

Australia's economy is currently experiencing a period of sluggish growth. The IMF recently slashed Australia's economic growth projection for 2025 to 1.6% from the previous forecast of 2.1% made in January 2025[2]. This downgrade comes amid increased global economic uncertainty, which the IMF attributes to U.S. President Trump's disruption of global trade patterns.

Deloitte Access Economics has made an identical growth projection of 1.6% for 2025[5]. The economy has been growing at its slowest rate since the 1990s (outside of the pandemic period) and has been experiencing what economists term a "per capita recession" for over a year[5]. This means that while overall GDP remains positive, GDP per person has been declining.

## Key Economic Indicators

**Unemployment Outlook**: The Reserve Bank of Australia forecasts the unemployment rate to increase to 4.3% over 2025 before stabilizing in early 2026 as GDP growth begins to accelerate[1].

**Inflation Trends**: According to recent assessments, underlying inflation is moving sustainably toward the RBA's target range of 2-3%[5]. This trend toward target inflation creates room for potential monetary policy adjustments.

**Monetary Policy Direction**: Deloitte expects the RBA to implement rate cuts totaling 75 basis points through the 2025 calendar year, followed by a further 75 basis points in 2026[5]. However, the RBA may remain cautious about cutting rates despite conditions that would typically support such action.

## Growth Forecasts for 2025-2026

Multiple economic forecasts indicate slow but positive growth through 2025 with acceleration expected in 2026:

- The IMF projects Australian GDP growth to pick up to 2.1% in 2026 from the reduced 1.6% in 2025[2]
- Aigroup forecasts GDP growth to recover to 1.75% in 2024-2025 and strengthen throughout 2025-2026 to 2.25%[4]
- Deloitte projects growth will increase from 1.6% in 2025 to 2.3% in 2026 and 2.7% in 2027[5]

## Recession Risk Assessment

Based on current economic forecasts, Australia appears unlikely to experience a technical recession (two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth) before 2026. While growth has been downgraded and remains sluggish, all major forecasts still project positive growth rates through 2025 and into 2026.

Several factors support this assessment:

1. **Projected Interest Rate Cuts**: The anticipated monetary easing cycle (expected 150 basis points of cuts through 2026) should provide stimulus to the economy[5]

2. **Resilient Labor Market**: Despite the economic slowdown, Australia's labor market has shown surprising resilience, which helps maintain consumer spending[5]

3. **Growth Acceleration in 2026**: All forecasts indicate strengthening growth momentum as we move into 2026[1][2][4]

However, several downside risks could challenge this outlook:

1. **Global Trade Disruptions**: The IMF notes that global uncertainty has reached unprecedented levels due to trade policy changes, which could further impact Australia's growth[2]

2. **Persistent Inflation**: While inflation is trending toward target ranges, any reversal could delay interest rate cuts[5]

3. **Rising Unemployment**: The projected increase in unemployment through 2025 could dampen consumer spending more than anticipated[1]

## Conclusion

While Australia's economy is currently experiencing its slowest growth since the 1990s (outside the pandemic) and is in a per capita recession, the consensus among economic forecasters is that Australia will maintain positive, albeit weak, GDP growth through 2025 and into 2026. This suggests Australia is likely to avoid a technical recession before 2026, though the margin for error is relatively thin given the reduced growth forecasts.

The expected interest rate cuts in 2025 and 2026, combined with forecasts of accelerating growth in 2026, provide a buffer against recession risks. However, the situation warrants close monitoring, particularly regarding global trade developments and domestic labor market conditions.
