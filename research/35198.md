## OpenAI IPO Forecast Before April 1, 2025

**1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status**
- OpenAI has been widely discussed as a potential candidate for a major IPO, especially given the surge in AI investment and its rapid revenue growth projections for 2024 and 2025[3].
- Despite this, OpenAI operates under a capped-profit model, which limits investor returns and complicates the traditional IPO pathway[5].
- As of February 20, 2025, OpenAI is not publicly traded, and there is no OpenAI stock available for purchase[5].

**2. Recent Announcements and Policies**
- There have been no official announcements from OpenAI regarding plans to go public or to file for an IPO as of the latest available information[5].
- Industry reports and financial news continue to speculate about a possible IPO, but all confirm that no formal steps have been taken[3][5].
- OpenAI’s News section and SEC filings do not show any IPO-related announcements or S-1 filings as of the cutoff date.

**3. Authoritative Sources for Verification**
- The OpenAI News page and SEC Form S-1 filings are the definitive sources for any IPO announcement.
- Financial news outlets and IPO tracking services (such as Renaissance Capital and Moomoo) confirm the absence of any such announcement[2][5].

**4. Limitations and Uncertainties**
- While OpenAI is frequently listed among the most anticipated IPOs, and market conditions are favorable for tech IPOs in 2025, the company’s unique structure and ongoing internal discussions introduce uncertainty[2][3][5].
- Announcements can occur with little notice, but as of February 20, 2025, there is no factual evidence of an impending IPO announcement.

**Conclusion:**  
Based on all factual information available as of February 20, 2025, OpenAI has not announced plans for an IPO, nor has it filed an SEC Form S-1 or made an announcement in its official News section. Therefore, unless new information emerges, the answer is **No**—OpenAI has not announced that it is planning an IPO before April 1, 2025[3][5].
