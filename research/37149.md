# Forecasting Analysis: Pilot UFO Reports from Africa in June 2025

As of May 22, 2025, I'll analyze available data to forecast whether a pilot will report a UFO sighting from an African country in June 2025 that will be posted on the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC).

## Current Status and Recent Trends

NUFORC continues to be active in 2025, with recent notable reports including "Octahedrons" and "Tic-Tac UAP" sightings from May and April 2025 respectively[1]. The center maintains an active reporting system, including a hotline (206-722-3000) specifically for recent UFO reports[4].

The most recent UFO reports in the NUFORC database as of May 22, 2025, include several entries from May 10, 2025, from various locations including Pompano Beach, Barlby, Beaumont, and Colorado[3]. However, none of these recent reports are specifically identified as coming from African countries or from pilots in the search results.

## Historical Context for African UFO Sightings

Historical data shows that UFO sightings have occurred across multiple African countries:

- **Algeria**: Multiple sightings during the Algerian War (1954-1962) and in March 1975[5]
- **Benin/Botswana**: Reported sightings in the Okavango Delta (June 25, 2016) and Gaberone (May 14, 2008)[5]
- **Morocco**: Multiple sightings in July 1952, including observations by policemen[5]
- **Rwanda**: A January 1, 2025 report of "4 craft inline formation" as mentioned in the question description

The Rwanda sighting from January 2025 is particularly relevant as it demonstrates that UFO reports from Africa are still being submitted to NUFORC in 2025.

## Comparative Analysis

When forecasting the likelihood of a pilot report from Africa in June 2025, several factors should be considered:

1. **Reporting Frequency**: The search results show ongoing UFO reports in 2025, with multiple reports from May 10, 2025[3]. This indicates active reporting continues.

2. **African Reports**: While historical data shows UFO sightings across Africa, recent reports (except the January 2025 Rwanda case) are not evident in the search results.

3. **Pilot-Specific Reports**: The search results mention a "Tic-Tac UAP Buzzes Homeland Security Flight" from April 30, 2025[1], indicating pilot/aircraft encounters are still being reported in 2025.

4. **Seasonal Patterns**: The search results don't provide clear seasonal patterns for African UFO sightings.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several limitations affect this forecast:

1. The search results provide limited recent data specifically about African UFO sightings.
2. We don't have information about the frequency of pilot-specific reports from Africa.
3. Reporting biases may exist - areas with better internet access and awareness of NUFORC may report more frequently.
4. The completeness of NUFORC's database for international sightings is unclear.

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on the available information, I assess the likelihood of a pilot reporting a UFO from an African country in June 2025 (that will be posted on NUFORC) as moderate-low. This assessment considers:

- Confirmed UFO reporting activity continues in 2025
- At least one African country (Rwanda) has submitted a report to NUFORC in 2025
- Pilot reports continue to be documented in 2025
- Historical precedent exists for UFO sightings across multiple African countries
- The relatively short timeframe (June 2025) and specific requirement (pilot report) constrain the probability

The key uncertainty is whether the Rwanda report from January 2025 represents an isolated incident or part of an ongoing pattern of African UFO reports that will continue through June.
