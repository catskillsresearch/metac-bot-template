## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- December is historically the wettest month in Brasília, with long-term averages ranging from about 207 mm to 253 mm of rainfall, and typically 21 rainy days in the month[3][1].
- Climatological data from multiple sources (including Weatherspark and Avionero) consistently place average December rainfall above 200 mm, with Weatherspark reporting about 215 mm and Avionero about 253 mm[3].
- The city just experienced a record-breaking drought, with 167 consecutive days without rain, ending only in October 2024[Description].
- September 2024 was the hottest September on record for the area, and INMET expects 2024 to be among the top five hottest years, contributing to increased wildfire risk and atmospheric instability[Description].

## Recent Announcements and Meteorological Context

- The end of the drought in October 2024 suggests the onset of the rainy season, which typically intensifies in November and peaks in December[Description].
- The combination of a delayed rainy season and accumulated atmospheric moisture can sometimes result in intense rainfall events once the rains begin, though the exact timing and distribution are uncertain.
- No official forecast for December 2024 rainfall in Brasília is available in the cited sources, so projections must rely on climatology and the current anomalous weather patterns.

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The National Institute of Meteorology (INMET) weather station [83377] BRASILIA - DF is the official source for measured rainfall and will provide the definitive data for December 2024.
- Historical averages and climate data are available from sources such as AccuWeather, Weather2Travel, and Weatherspark[1][3].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- The unprecedented drought and record heat in 2024 introduce uncertainty into typical rainfall patterns, as these anomalies could either delay the onset of the rainy season or lead to more intense rainfall events.
- Without a specific December 2024 forecast, the best estimate is based on historical averages, but the anomalous conditions of 2024 could result in deviations from the norm.
- Measurement will be resolved using INMET station data; if daily data are incomplete or unavailable by January 7, 2025, the question will be annulled per the resolution criteria.

## Summary Table: December Rainfall in Brasília

| Source         | Average December Rainfall (mm) | Rainy Days (avg) |
|----------------|-------------------------------|------------------|
| Weatherspark   | 215                           | ~21              |
| Avionero       | 253                           | ~21              |
| Weather2Travel | 207                           | 21               |

## Conclusion

Based on historical climatology, Brasília almost always receives more than 200 mm of rain in December, making it highly likely under normal conditions. However, the recent record drought and extreme heat in 2024 introduce some uncertainty, as they could either delay the rains or trigger intense rainfall events. The best available evidence as of November 1, 2024, suggests that rainfall exceeding 200 mm in December remains probable, but with elevated uncertainty due to the year's anomalous weather.
