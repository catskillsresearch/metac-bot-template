### Key Factual Information for Forecasting

**1. Historical Trends and Current Status**
- Venezuela has a longstanding pattern of internet censorship, particularly during periods of political crisis. Social media platforms, including Twitter/X, have been targeted for blocking during protests and elections[3][4].
- On August 8, 2024, President Nicol√°s Maduro announced a ten-day ban on Twitter/X amid anti-government protests, citing incitement of hatred and civil unrest. This ban was subsequently extended for an indefinite period[3][5].
- As of October 2024, Wikipedia's "Censorship of Twitter" page lists Venezuela as one of the countries currently blocking access to Twitter/X[3].

**2. Recent Announcements/Policies**
- The August 2024 ban was implemented by Venezuela's telecommunications regulator (Conatel) and publicly announced by President Maduro[5].
- The ban was extended indefinitely, with no official reports or credible news indicating that access to Twitter/X has been restored as of late October 2024[3][5].
- News reports and social media posts from within Venezuela confirm ongoing restrictions on access to Twitter/X[1][2].

**3. Authoritative Sources for Verification**
- The Wikipedia page "Censorship of Twitter" is the resolution source and, as of October 8, 2024, lists Venezuela as currently blocking Twitter/X[3].
- News outlets such as Euractiv and the Times of India have reported on the ban and its indefinite extension[2][5].
- Social media and user reports from Venezuela corroborate the continued inaccessibility of Twitter/X[1].

**4. Limitations and Uncertainties**
- Wikipedia pages can be edited, and their content may change between October 2024 and the resolution date in January 2025. However, unless there is a widely reported lifting of the ban, it is likely that Wikipedia will continue to list Venezuela as blocking Twitter/X.
- The possibility of an edit war or lack of consensus on Wikipedia is acknowledged in the resolution criteria but is expected to be a rare occurrence.
- Technical workarounds (e.g., VPNs) do not affect the formal status of a national block as reported by Wikipedia.

**Summary Table: Venezuela's Twitter/X Block Status (as of October 2024)**

| Factor                        | Status/Details                                               |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Official government ban       | Announced August 8, 2024; extended indefinitely             |
| Wikipedia listing             | Venezuela listed as "currently" blocking Twitter/X          |
| News/media confirmation       | Multiple outlets confirm ongoing block                      |
| Known reversals/unblocking    | None reported as of October 2024                            |
| Risk of Wikipedia edit war    | Low, unless major policy change or credible news emerges    |

**Conclusion:**  
Based on all available information as of October 25, 2024, it is highly likely that Wikipedia will still list Venezuela as "currently" blocking access to Twitter/X at the end of 2024, unless there is a significant and widely reported change in government policy before then.
