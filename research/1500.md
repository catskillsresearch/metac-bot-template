## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Human-made climate change is widely recognized as a growing global catastrophic risk, with IPCC estimates (as of 2018) projecting 2.6ºC–4.8ºC warming by 2100 under business-as-usual scenarios[1]. Such warming could cause severe weather, food crises, and health impacts, particularly affecting vulnerable populations.
- Catastrophic impacts are expected to be nonlinear; damages escalate sharply with higher temperatures, and there is a “fat tail” risk of much higher warming (beyond 4.8ºC), albeit at low probability[1].
- There is a non-negligible chance (estimated up to 10%) of extreme temperature increases, though a 12ºC rise in this century is considered highly implausible, but would be utterly catastrophic if it occurred[1].
- Geoengineering, especially Solar Radiation Management (SRM), is being researched as a rapid, potentially cost-effective intervention to offset warming. However, SRM remains largely untested at scale, and its principal existential risk is abrupt termination, which could trigger rapid, extreme warming over months to years[1].
- Global catastrophic risk frameworks classify both climate change and geoengineering as “current risks from human action,” with climate change being an active, escalating threat and geoengineering a potential future risk that could be triggered by policy or technological action[3].

## 2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- As of 2018, the Paris Agreement was in force, but global emissions continued to rise, indicating that mitigation efforts were not on track to meet targets needed to avoid high-end warming[1].
- No large-scale geoengineering deployment had occurred by 2018, though policy discussions and research into SRM were increasing, with calls for governance frameworks to manage future risks[1].
- Risk assessments increasingly recognized the interconnectedness and compounding nature of global risks, including the potential for cascading effects from both climate and technological interventions[5].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- IPCC Fourth Assessment Synthesis Report (2007), as referenced in the Ragnarök series[1].
- Global Catastrophic Risks 2018, Global Challenges Foundation[1][3].
- GiveWell’s review of extreme climate change risks and the “fat tail” literature[1].
- Global Catastrophic Risk Index (GCRI) and related global governance reports[5].

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties in Measurement

- Extreme climate outcomes (e.g., >10% sudden population decline) are highly uncertain and depend on complex, poorly understood feedbacks; most climate models do not project abrupt, near-term global population catastrophes solely from climate change by 2100[1][3].
- Geoengineering risks are speculative, as large-scale deployment has not occurred; abrupt termination risks depend on scale, governance, and technical execution, all of which are deeply uncertain[1][3].
- Both risks are interconnected with other systemic vulnerabilities, such as governance failure, conflict, or economic breakdown, which could amplify or mitigate direct impacts[5].
- Risk perception and resilience capacity vary across regions, complicating global risk assessments[5].

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

- As of October 2018, the risk that a global catastrophe (as defined: a >10% world population decline in 5 years) would be principally caused by human-made climate change is nonzero but still considered quite low within the century, though rising with continued emissions[1][3].
- The risk from geoengineering (via abrupt termination of SRM or unforeseen side effects) is also nonzero but contingent on future adoption, which remained speculative as of 2018[1][3].
- Overall, the probability that such a catastrophe before 2100 would be due to either human-made climate change or geoengineering is real but low, with climate change being the more immediate, cumulative risk and geoengineering representing a potential future risk that could exacerbate or mitigate climate impacts depending on governance and execution[1][3][5].
