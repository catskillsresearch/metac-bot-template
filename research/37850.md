## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- **Public Appearance Frequency:** Ali Khamenei has a long record of frequent public appearances, especially at major state and religious events. In the six weeks before June 13, 2025, he made at least five well-publicized appearances, including televised addresses and meetings with officials and the public[1].
- **Response to Crises:** In previous times of crisis (e.g., the 2009 protests, Soleimani’s assassination), Khamenei eventually appeared publicly to project stability and counter rumors about his health or leadership.

## 2. Recent Events and Announcements

- **June 13, 2025 Israeli Strikes:** The IDF struck high-level targets in Iran, including the private residences of top leaders. This escalated rumors regarding Khamenei’s status, including unverified reports that he was killed or fled the country[1][3].
- **Reports of Khamenei in Hiding:** Multiple sources, including The New York Times, report Khamenei is in a bunker or shelter, communicating with aides only via trusted intermediaries. Iran’s intelligence ministry has ordered senior officials to remain underground and avoid electronic communications[3].
- **Succession Planning:** Khamenei has reportedly nominated three clerics as potential successors, and the chain of command is said to remain intact[2][3].

## 3. Key Differences Affecting the Forecast

- **Unprecedented Security Threat:** Unlike previous crises, the June 13 strikes directly targeted the homes of Iran’s top leadership. Security protocols are at their highest, with leaders sheltering and avoiding public exposure[3].
- **Heightened Secrecy:** The regime is reportedly limiting all officials’ communications and movement, constraining opportunities for any public appearance[3].
- **Rumors and Disinformation:** Unconfirmed claims about Khamenei’s death or flight have increased uncertainty and may incentivize a public appearance if he is able, but also raise the possibility that he is incapacitated or deceased[3].
- **Regime’s Need for Stability:** Historically, the regime quickly produces evidence of Khamenei’s vitality when rumors surge, but the current environment may hinder such efforts.

## 4. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- **International News Agencies:** Reuters, BBC, The New York Times, and other major outlets are monitoring and would credibly report any verified public appearance.
- **Iranian State Media:** Live broadcasts or official releases with credible evidence of Khamenei’s location and timing.
- **Analyst Consensus:** Metaculus and other forecasting platforms track and update assessments with new information[1].

## 5. Limitations and Uncertainties

- **Information Control:** Iranian authorities have tightened control over information, making external verification of appearances more difficult.
- **Possibility of Staged or Pre-recorded Evidence:** The regime may attempt to use pre-recorded or ambiguous footage to dispel rumors, complicating verification.
- **Health and Leadership Transition:** If Khamenei is seriously ill or dead, the regime may delay acknowledgment, further obscuring the forecast window[2][3].

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given Khamenei’s recent history of frequent appearances and the regime’s past urgency to dispel rumors of his demise, there is precedent for a rapid public appearance. However, the unprecedented nature of the June 13 strikes, verified reports of Khamenei sheltering with extreme security, and the government’s current information lockdown significantly reduce the likelihood.

- **Estimated Probability:** As of June 24, 2025, the probability that Khamenei will make a public appearance in Iran before July 14, 2025 is assessed as **below 50%**, likely in the range of 20–40%. This reflects the high security risk, rumors of possible incapacity, and lack of evidence contradicting claims of concealment or worse. The probability could rise if credible footage or reporting emerges in the next two weeks.
