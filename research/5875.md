**1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status**

- As of December 2020, more than 10 real money online poker sites routinely had over 1,000 cash players online within a 24-hour period, with robust liquidity at various stakes[1].
- Superhuman AI bots—Pluribus (2019) and ReBel (2020)—demonstrated the ability to beat professional players at Texas Holdem using minimal computing resources[1].
- By 2025, AI-based strategy tools (solvers) have become central to player improvement and game analysis, available to both professionals and serious amateurs[1][4].
- The democratization of AI tools has led to a more sophisticated player base, but also heightened the risk of unauthorized bot use at online tables[4].

**2. Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Metric**

- In 2019, Morgan Stanley downgraded the long-term outlook for online poker due to the inevitability of superhuman bots entering the ecosystem, raising serious concerns about the sustainability of human-centric online poker[1].
- Major poker platforms have continued to invest in anti-bot detection, security, and regulation to preserve fair play, but the efficacy of these measures is continually challenged by evolving AI capabilities[4].
- As of 2025, there have been no widely reported collapses of major online poker sites or liquidity crises, suggesting ongoing adaptation, though the threat from bots remains a top industry concern[4].

**3. Authoritative Sources for Verification**

- PokerScout and similar aggregators regularly track online poker liquidity and active player counts (as of 2020)[1].
- Industry analyses and reports (e.g., Morgan Stanley, poker industry news) provide ongoing updates on sector health and threats[1].
- AI development and deployment updates are available from research teams (Facebook AI Research, Carnegie Mellon University)[1].

**4. Limitations and Uncertainties in Measurement**

- Active player counts and liquidity are only as reliable as the tracking and reporting tools/sites; market fragmentation or privacy concerns may reduce visibility by 2030.
- Bot detection technology and regulation may advance, but so may undetectable AI bots, making true human activity harder to verify in the future.
- Player migration to other forms of gambling or new platforms could affect liquidity independently of AI-related risks.
- Regulatory shifts (e.g., increased restrictions or legalization in new markets) could drastically alter the number of viable sites and player counts.
- There is uncertainty regarding the exact impact of AI: it could either destroy trust/liquidity or force a technological and regulatory renaissance that preserves online poker.

**Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment**

Based on the current trajectory:
- The risk of online poker being "dead" (i.e., fewer than two sites with >1,000 cash players at $10+ stakes) by January 1, 2031, has increased since 2020 due to advances in cheap, superhuman AI and growing bot threats[1][4].
- However, the industry has demonstrated resilience and adaptive capacity, with player bases and site liquidity remaining strong as of 2025, despite ongoing challenges[4].
- There remains significant uncertainty, but a total collapse appears unlikely barring a catastrophic loss of trust, regulatory suppression, or a breakthrough in undetectable botting.

**Forecast Probability (as of Dec 2020 context, adjusted for 2025 data):**
- Probability online poker is "dead" by Jan 1, 2031: **30-40%**
- Probability online poker remains above the threshold: **60-70%**

This reflects elevated but not overwhelming risk, acknowledging the sector’s adaptability and the persistent, unresolved threat from AI-powered bots.
