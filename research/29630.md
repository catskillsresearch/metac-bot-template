### Key Factual Information as of November 6, 2024

**1. Current Public Availability (as of late 2024):**
- Waymo's rider-only ride-hailing service is available to the general public in:
  - Arizona (Phoenix metro area, including Scottsdale and Mesa)[1][3]
  - California (San Francisco and Los Angeles)[3]
- This means only two states—Arizona and California—have full public access to Waymo's service by the end of 2024.

**2. Announced Expansions and Timelines:**
- Waymo and Uber announced in September 2024 that autonomous ride-hailing would launch in Austin (Texas) and Atlanta (Georgia) "beginning in early 2025," not before the end of 2024[4][5].
- Waymo's own blog and website confirm Austin is not yet available to the general public as of late 2024; the service is listed as "coming soon" or only available via Uber in the future[3][4].
- There are no credible announcements of public launches in any other US states before December 31, 2024.

**3. Authoritative Verification Sources:**
- Waymo's official "Where Can You Go?" page and blog posts are primary sources for current service areas[1][2][3].
- Press releases from Waymo and Uber, as well as major news outlets, confirm the timing of new city/state launches[4][5].

**4. Limitations and Uncertainties:**
- "Available to the general public" excludes cities/states where service is only in early access, via waitlist, or not yet launched.
- The Uber partnership in Austin and Atlanta is explicitly scheduled for early 2025, so Texas and Georgia do not count for December 31, 2024[4][5].
- No evidence suggests any other state will have public Waymo service by the end of 2024.

### Conclusion

Based on all available information as of November 6, 2024, exactly four US states will **not** have Waymo's rider-only ride-hailing service available to the general public on December 31, 2024. Only two states—Arizona and California—meet the criteria for public availability at that time.
