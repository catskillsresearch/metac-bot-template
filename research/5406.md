## 1. Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of 2018, world GDP doubled approximately every 16 years based on aggregate World Bank data.
- Historical global GDP growth rates since 2000 have hovered around 3–4% annually, but have slowed in the 2010s and early 2020s[3].
- As of 2025, the IMF and World Bank project global GDP growth at 2.7–2.8% for the near future, with a long-term trend toward further slowing due to aging populations and lower productivity increases[2][3][4].

## 2. Key Differences Affecting the Forecast

- **Growth Projections to 2050**: Long-term projections by institutions such as PwC, KPMG, and Goldman Sachs suggest global real GDP growth will average between 2% and 2.8% annually through 2050[1][2][4][5].
- **Regional Variations**: Some emerging markets (notably India, Bangladesh, Philippines) may achieve higher growth (3–3.5% per year), but their impact on the global aggregate is constrained by their share of world GDP[5].
- **AI and Technological Change**: While transformative AI could, in principle, enable much faster economic growth, no mainstream forecast assumes a near-term AI-driven explosion in global output. The possibility remains speculative and is not reflected in authoritative projections.
- **Downside Risks**: Policy uncertainty, geopolitical tensions, and climate events all present downside risks, not upside, to global growth[3][4].

## 3. Quantitative Assessment

- **Doubling in 4 Years**: To double in 4 years, the required compound annual growth rate is about 18% (\((1 + r)^4 = 2 \implies r \approx 18\%\)).
- **Forecasted Growth**: Projected annual growth rates (2–2.8%) are an order of magnitude lower than required.
- **Historical Precedent**: No period in modern economic history has seen sustained global real GDP growth at 18% per year over four years. Even the fastest-growing national economies rarely achieve this, let alone the world as a whole.

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- **Potential for Disruptive AI**: The main non-trivial uncertainty is the arrival of transformative AI capable of rapidly accelerating economic productivity. However, this is not part of mainstream economic forecasts and remains speculative.
- **Measurement Issues**: GDP measurement may vary, and future technological shifts could challenge existing methodologies, but the question specifies resolution by established credible assessments.

## 5. Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given:
- The gap between required and forecasted growth rates,
- Absence of precedent for such rapid growth,
- Lack of mainstream expectation for transformative AI by 2050,

The probability that world output will double in any 4-year interval before 2050 is extremely low on current evidence (well below 1%), barring unforeseen technological revolutions. A positive resolution would most likely require a scenario outside current consensus forecasts, such as an AI-driven economic explosion, which remains speculative.
