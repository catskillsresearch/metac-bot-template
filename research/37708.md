## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- At recent World Games, Germany has historically won the most medals, frequently topping the medal table. Italy and Russia have also been strong performers, with the United States and China often ranking highly but usually behind the leading European countries in non-Olympic sports[1].
- In Olympic contexts, the United States and China routinely dominate overall medal counts, with host countries often improving their medal haul substantially, as seen with France's expected boost in Paris 2024[2][4][5].
- The World Games emphasize sports where European nations, particularly Germany and Italy, have depth and tradition (e.g., artistic roller skating, lifesaving, tug of war), while China’s strengths are more pronounced in select sports (e.g., wushu, billiards)[1].

## Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Metric

- The 2025 World Games will be held in Chengdu, China, from August 7–17, featuring 34 sports, 60 disciplines, and 253 medal events—an expanded program compared to previous editions[1].
- As the host, China is expected to field full teams and benefit from home advantage, including larger athlete quotas, logistical support, and increased investment in athlete preparation.
- There are no major public announcements of changes to qualification or medal allocation that would significantly alter the traditional medal distribution, but the expanded event list may slightly favor the host and countries with broader participation across disciplines.

## Key Differences Affecting the 2025 Forecast

- **Host Country Effect**: China’s role as host is a major change from previous editions. Historically, host nations at multi-sport events see significant medal increases due to higher athlete participation rates, home support, and improved preparation resources.
- **Event Composition**: The expanded number of medal events (253) and inclusion of sports with Chinese strengths (e.g., martial arts, billiards) could boost China’s total compared to past World Games.
- **Geopolitical and Eligibility Factors**: Russia, previously a top performer, may not participate fully due to ongoing international restrictions, potentially shifting the balance further toward China and European nations.

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on recent trends, current sporting strengths, and the impact of hosting, the most likely scenario is a close contest between China, Germany, and Italy, with the United States also a top contender but historically less dominant in non-Olympic disciplines. The host advantage and expanded program are likely to push China to its best-ever medal count at the World Games.

**Adjusted Probabilistic Forecast (as of June 2025):**

| Country         | Estimated Probability of Winning Most Medals |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------|
| China           | ~45%                                        |
| Germany         | ~25%                                        |
| Italy           | ~15%                                        |
| United States   | ~10%                                        |
| France          | ~3%                                         |
| Ukraine         | <2%                                         |
| Other           | <1%                                         |

**Key uncertainties** remain due to the lack of recent comprehensive medal projections for the World Games, the non-Olympic focus favoring different nations, and potential surprises from the expanded event program.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- The World Games’ unique sport lineup makes historical Olympic medal performance less predictive.
- Detailed, event-by-event entry lists and athlete strengths are not yet public, so projections carry significant uncertainty.
- Shifts in international participation or late rule changes could materially affect outcomes.
