### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The Magnificent Seven (Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Nvidia, Meta Platforms, Tesla) have driven most of the S&P 500’s gains since 2023, reaching a combined market cap of $15.4 trillion by July 2024[3].
- After a strong run, the group experienced a notable selloff in early August 2024. Tesla and Nvidia both dropped over 14% in three days, and the Morningstar US Market Index fell 6.3% since the start of August[1].
- Despite this correction, the group’s valuations as of August 6, 2024, were only at a 3% discount to their five-year average P/E multiples, suggesting prices had normalized but not crashed[4].
- Microsoft and Amazon were trading below their fair value estimates, while Apple was considered overvalued. Most of the group had their fair value estimates raised after Q2 earnings, except Tesla, whose estimate was unchanged[1].
- The group’s average forward P/E ratio was 34, compared to 20 for the S&P 500, but analysts expected 29% profit growth for the group in the year ahead, versus 14% for the broader index[5].

### Recent Announcements and Policies

- No major policy changes or macroeconomic shocks affecting these stocks were reported as of late August 2024.
- Tesla has been the weakest performer, with earnings falling 40% year-over-year in late 2023, but other members reported strong earnings growth[2].

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Yahoo Finance provides daily closing share prices, adjusted for splits, for all Magnificent Seven stocks.
- Morningstar, Bloomberg, and Zacks Investment Research offer valuation and earnings data[1][3][5].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- Market sentiment can shift rapidly due to unforeseen events (e.g., regulatory action, geopolitical crises, or systemic financial shocks).
- While valuations are elevated, there is no evidence as of late August 2024 of an imminent catalyst likely to trigger a >50% drop in at least four of these stocks before September 30, 2024.
- The definition of a "bubble" popping here is strict: at least four stocks must close at least 50% below their all-time highs, which is a rare and severe event for mega-cap stocks.
