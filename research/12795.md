# Forecasting Taiwan's Independence Declaration by 2035

To forecast whether Taiwan will formally declare independence by 2035, I'll analyze historical trends, current policies, and key factors that could influence this decision.

## Historical Context and Current Status

Taiwan (officially the Republic of China) exists in a complex state of de facto independence without formal recognition from most countries. As of October 2022, only 13 UN member states recognize Taiwan diplomatically. This situation stems from the Chinese Civil War, which resulted in the Republic of China government retreating to Taiwan in 1949 while the Communist Party established the People's Republic of China (PRC) on the mainland.

Despite functioning as an independent democratic state with its own government, military, currency, and foreign relations, Taiwan has never formally declared independence from China. Many Taiwanese officials have stated that such a declaration is unnecessary since Taiwan already operates as an independent nation[3].

## US Policy Stance

The United States maintains a deliberately ambiguous position toward Taiwan. In May 2022, the US State Department temporarily removed language stating that it "does not support Taiwan independence" from its fact sheet on US-Taiwan relations, before restoring it a month later[2][4]. This brief change and subsequent reversal demonstrates the delicate balancing act in US policy.

The US adheres to the "one China" policy while maintaining unofficial relations with Taiwan through the Taiwan Relations Act, which commits the US to provide Taiwan with defensive arms. This strategic ambiguity is designed to deter both a Chinese invasion and a unilateral Taiwanese declaration of independence.

## Cross-Strait Relations and China's Position

The PRC considers Taiwan an inalienable part of its territory and has repeatedly stated that a formal declaration of independence would cross a "red line" that could trigger military action. Chinese President Xi Jinping has emphasized that "reunification" with Taiwan is a key component of his "Chinese Dream" and the "great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation."

China has increased military pressure on Taiwan in recent years, with record numbers of military aircraft entering Taiwan's Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ). This pressure serves as a clear signal against moves toward formal independence.

## Taiwan's Domestic Politics and Public Opinion

Taiwanese public opinion polls consistently show that most citizens prefer maintaining the status quo rather than immediate independence or unification. According to the Election Study Center at National Chengchi University, support for maintaining the status quo (either indefinitely or with a decision later) typically ranges between 50-60% of respondents.

Taiwan's major political parties have different approaches to cross-strait relations:
- The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) leans toward pro-independence positions but has moderated its stance when in power
- The Kuomintang (KMT) favors closer ties with China while maintaining the status quo

Neither major party has advocated for an immediate declaration of independence, recognizing the significant risks such a move would entail.

## Factors Affecting Declaration Probability

Several key factors will influence the likelihood of a formal independence declaration:

1. **Domestic political developments in Taiwan**: Future electoral outcomes and potential shifts in public opinion will be crucial. A sustained increase in support for formal independence would be necessary before any government would risk such a declaration.

2. **US-China relations**: The trajectory of US-China competition will significantly impact Taiwan's calculus. Increasing US support might embolden independence advocates, while US-China cooperation could constrain Taiwan's options.

3. **China's military capabilities and resolve**: China's growing military power increases the costs of a declaration. By 2035, China's ability to successfully invade Taiwan may be substantially greater.

4. **International support**: Taiwan would need significant international backing to withstand the consequences of a declaration. Current trends show limited appetite among major powers to risk conflict with China over Taiwan.

5. **Economic interdependence**: Taiwan's economy remains deeply integrated with China's, creating powerful disincentives for actions that would disrupt this relationship.

## Forecast Assessment

Based on the available information as of October 2022, a formal declaration of independence by Taiwan before 2035 appears unlikely, though not impossible. The combination of Chinese deterrence, international caution, economic interdependence, and Taiwanese preference for the status quo creates strong pressures against such a declaration.

However, several scenarios could increase the probability:
- A significant shift in US policy toward explicit support for Taiwanese independence
- A major change in Taiwanese public opinion following perceived threats to its democracy
- A weakening of China's economic or military position

The most likely trajectory remains a continuation of Taiwan's de facto independence without a formal declaration, as this approach minimizes risks while preserving Taiwan's practical autonomy.
