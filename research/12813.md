## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The deadliest tsunami in recorded history occurred on December 26, 2004, in the Indian Ocean, resulting in over 200,000 deaths. This event spurred global investment in tsunami detection, warning systems, and community preparedness[2][5].
- Since 2004, there have been no tsunamis approaching this fatality count. Most recent events have resulted in far fewer casualties, partly due to improved early warning and evacuation procedures[2].
- UNESCO and partners have developed a robust global tsunami warning system and are actively working to ensure that 100% of at-risk coastal communities are "Tsunami Ready" by 2030[1][2][5].
- The frequency of tsunamis globally is about seven per year, but mass-casualty events are rare[5].

## 2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- In April 2023, UNESCO launched a global program to ensure all at-risk coastal communities are "Tsunami Ready" by 2030, involving risk mapping, evacuation planning, public education, and drills[1][2][5].
- The UN Decade of Ocean Science (2021–2030) includes ambitious goals for tsunami preparedness and real-time detection via Deep-ocean Assessment and Reporting of Tsunami (DART) buoys and other advanced technologies[2].
- International standards for probabilistic tsunami hazard and risk assessment have been developed, further informing risk reduction strategies[3].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- UNESCO Global Tsunami Warning System and Tsunami Ready Programme[1][2][5]
- USGS Earthquake Hazards Program
- IOC (Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission)
- Peer-reviewed tsunami hazard modeling initiatives (e.g., AGITHAR)[3]

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- Despite improvements, tsunami risk cannot be eliminated. Rare, extreme events—especially those occurring close to shorelines with little warning time—remain difficult to fully mitigate[2][5].
- Regional disparities exist in preparedness and infrastructure, meaning some communities remain vulnerable.
- The measurement of fatalities may be complicated by missing persons and delayed reporting.
- Probabilistic models can estimate tsunami wave occurrence but are less precise at forecasting event severity and specific casualty numbers.

## Probabilistic Assessment

Given the substantial progress in detection, warning, and preparedness since 2004, the probability of a tsunami causing at least 50,000 fatalities before 2030 is **much lower than in previous decades**. While not impossible—if a large, near-field tsunami were to strike a densely populated, underprepared area—the likelihood is **well below 10%** based on recent trends and the global push to make all coastal communities tsunami resilient[1][2][5]. The most authoritative sources suggest that, barring a catastrophic failure of warning systems or an unprecedented event, a repeat of 2004-scale casualties is unlikely before 2030.
