# Forecast Analysis: IRA Tax Credit Adders (2025-2026)

As of May 2025, the future of tax credit adders established by the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) faces significant uncertainty with potential legislative changes looming before 2026. This analysis examines the current landscape and forecasts possible outcomes.

## Current Status of IRA Tax Credits

The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 established a system of base tax credits with conditional adders designed to incentivize clean energy development while promoting specific policy objectives. These include:

- Investment Tax Credit (ITC) - Section 48E: Base rate of 6% with potential increases up to 30%+ through various adders
- Production Tax Credit (PTC) - Section 45Y: Base rate of 0.5 cents/kWh with potential increases through qualifying adders[1]

Key adders that can increase these base amounts include:
- Prevailing wage & apprenticeship requirements
- Domestic content provisions
- Energy community siting
- Low-income community benefits[1]

## Recent Developments Affecting Forecast

Several significant developments have emerged that impact the forecast for IRA tax credit adders:

**1. Transition to New Credit Structures**
As of January 1, 2025, the IRA tax credits have transitioned to the technology-neutral 48E ITC and 45Y PTC structures, replacing the previous 45 ITC and 48 PTC frameworks while maintaining similar incentive levels[5]. These new structures govern projects beginning construction in 2025 and beyond[4].

**2. Budget Reconciliation Considerations**
Fiscal analyses estimate that repealing the IRA credits after the end of this year would reduce federal deficits by approximately $650 billion from FY 2026 forward[2]. This significant budgetary impact makes these credits a potential target for deficit reduction efforts.

**3. Industry Base Case Expectations**
Clean Energy Associates (CEA) has established a "base case" expectation that there will be a phase-out of both the 48E ITC and 45Y PTC tax credits by the end of 2025[5]. This assessment represents the industry's growing concern about the sustainability of these incentives.

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on the available information as of May 2025, I assess the following probabilities for each outcome:

### Outcome 1: Repealed Fully (50% probability)
There is substantial evidence pointing toward a complete repeal of IRA tax credit adders before 2026:

- Industry analysts have established a "base case" scenario of complete phase-out by the end of 2025[5]
- The significant budget impact ($650 billion) makes these credits an attractive target for deficit reduction[2]
- There are indications that the 48E ITC and 45Y PTC could be "repealed entirely and go away, even for those projects that start construction in 2025"[5]

### Outcome 2: Reduced Incentives (35% probability)
A partial reduction in incentives represents a compromise approach that might emerge from legislative negotiations:

- Rather than eliminating all adders, lawmakers might target specific ones (such as domestic content or energy community bonuses)
- A sunset provision might be implemented that gradually phases out adders rather than eliminating them immediately
- This approach would still achieve some budget savings while allowing for a more gradual transition

### Outcome 3: Neither Repealed nor Reduced (15% probability)
The scenario where adders remain intact through 2026 appears least likely given current signals:

- Industry forecasts already treat phase-out as the "base case"[5]
- The significant budget implications create strong incentives for modification
- The political climate appears to favor at least some changes to the existing structure

## Key Uncertainties and Limitations

Several factors could significantly alter this forecast:

1. **Construction Start Provisions**: Current rules allow projects that start construction before credit expiration to still qualify, potentially creating a rush of project starts in late 2025[5]

2. **Implementation Timeline**: Even if legislation is passed, the effective dates and implementation timeline remain uncertain

3. **Limited Data Availability**: The search results provide limited information about specific legislative proposals currently under consideration

4. **Political Dynamics**: The complex political landscape makes precise forecasting challenging

This analysis represents a point-in-time assessment based on information available as of May 12, 2025, and is subject to change as new developments emerge.
