# Forecast Analysis: IRA Clean Energy Tax Credit Adders (2025-2026)

As of May 2025, the clean energy tax credit adders established by the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) face significant legislative uncertainty. This analysis examines the current status, recent developments, and probabilistic assessment of potential outcomes before 2026.

## Current Status of IRA Tax Credit Adders

The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 established a framework of base tax credits with conditional adders that can substantially increase the value of both the Investment Tax Credit (ITC) and Production Tax Credit (PTC):

- The ITC starts at a base rate of 6% of project cost but can increase to 30% when prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements are met[2]
- The PTC begins at 0.5 cents/kWh but can be significantly enhanced through various adders[2]
- Additional 10% bonuses are available for domestic content sourcing, energy community siting, and low-income community benefits[3]

These adders remain active and available to qualifying projects as of mid-2025, with the IRA having extended the ITC of 30% and PTC through at least 2025[2]. The legislation also introduced innovative mechanisms for tax credit monetization through direct pay options (for tax-exempt entities) and transferability provisions (for taxable entities) for equipment placed in service between January 1, 2023, and December 31, 2032[2].

## Recent Legislative Developments

Several significant legislative developments in May 2025 suggest potential changes to the IRA tax credit structure:

1. **House GOP Tax Bill (May 12, 2025)**: The House Ways and Means Committee has released a Republican-sponsored tax bill that explicitly proposes phasedowns in both the ITC and PTC, along with limitations on the transferability provisions introduced by the IRA[5]

2. **Tax Credit Elimination Focus**: The bill prioritizes eliminating individual-side tax credits after the end of 2025, indicating a broader strategy that could affect energy-related credits[1]

3. **Implementation Status**: The IRS continues to work on implementing various aspects of the IRA, including the bonus incentive credits (adders) for low-income communities, energy communities, prevailing wage & apprenticeship, and domestic content[3]

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on the available information, here is my assessment of the likelihood of each potential outcome before January 1, 2026:

| Outcome | Probability | Key Factors |
|---------|------------|-------------|
| Repealed fully | 25% | Republican control of Congress; explicit GOP bill targeting IRA provisions |
| Reduced incentives | 60% | Current legislative proposals focus on phasedowns rather than full repeal; political compromise more likely than full repeal |
| Neither repealed nor reduced | 15% | Legislative gridlock; implementation already underway; industry momentum |

### Key Factors Influencing the Forecast

1. **Legislative Timeline**: With proposals already in committee as of May 2025, there appears to be sufficient time for legislation to pass before the January 1, 2026 deadline[5]

2. **Specific Targeting of ITC/PTC**: The House GOP bill explicitly mentions phasedowns of the ITC and PTC, suggesting targeted modifications rather than complete elimination[5]

3. **Focus on Transferability**: The proposed limitations on transferability indicate that the credit structure itself may be preserved while the mechanisms for monetization could be restricted[5]

4. **Implementation Status**: The IRS continues to develop guidance on IRA provisions, including bonus incentives, suggesting administrative momentum that would be difficult to completely reverse[3]

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors limit the precision of this forecast:

1. The search results provide limited detail on the specific adders targeted for modification or elimination in the proposed legislation

2. Political dynamics, including potential compromise legislation, could significantly alter the final outcome

3. The full text and provisions of the House GOP bill are not provided in the search results, limiting analysis of which specific adders might be targeted

4. The search results do not include information about the current political composition of Congress or the likelihood of the bill's passage

The most probable outcome based on available information is that at least some adders to the ITC and PTC will be reduced but not completely eliminated before January 1, 2026.
