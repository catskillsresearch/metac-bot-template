## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The United States has consistently spent significantly more on its military than any other nation since World War II. In 2017, U.S. defense spending was $610 billion, accounting for 35% of global military expenditures[3].
- By 2025, U.S. defense spending increased to an estimated $895 billion, maintaining its dominance as the world's largest military spender[5]. This is more than three times that of China, the next largest spender at $266.85 billion[5][3].
- The combined military budgets of the top five spenders (U.S., China, Russia, Germany, India) are about $1.635 trillion, with the U.S. alone representing more than 60% of the top five's expenditures[2][5].

## 2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- Both China and Russia have increased their military budgets in recent years, but not at rates sufficient to close the gap with the U.S. by 2030. Global military expenditure reached $2.72 trillion in 2024, with increases across all regions, particularly in Europe and the Middle East[2].
- The U.S. increase is partly driven by modernization, strategic competition, and heightened global tensions, while China's spending reflects its economic growth and regional ambitions[5].
- No significant reductions in U.S. military spending have been announced or projected as of 2025; rather, U.S. expenditure continues to rise in real terms[2][5].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) publishes annual, detailed military expenditure data[2].
- International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) provides comprehensive defense budget analysis[5].
- GlobalFirepower and FactoData compile and compare official and estimated defense budgets[1][4].

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- Military spending figures are sometimes subject to different accounting practices across countries, possible underreporting, or classification of dual-use expenditures—especially in authoritarian states like China and Russia.
- Exchange rate fluctuations can affect cross-country comparisons, but the three-year averaging specification in the resolution criteria helps mitigate this risk.
- Sudden geopolitical events or economic crises could theoretically prompt abrupt changes in spending, but there is no evidence as of 2025 to suggest a trajectory that would allow another country to overtake the U.S. before 2030.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the sustained and substantial lead of the United States in military spending, the lack of evidence for a dramatic increase in another country's budget, and the upward trend in U.S. expenditure, the probability that any country's military spending will exceed that of the United States before or in 2030 is extremely low—well below 1%.
