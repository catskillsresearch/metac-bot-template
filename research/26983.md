### Key Factual Information for Forecasting

**1. Historical Trends and Current Status**
- PLA incursions into Taiwan’s ADIZ have increased sharply since 2021, with monthly averages rising from 81 in 2021 to 178 by mid-2024[2].
- The highest daily total on record is 56 aircraft, recorded on July 10, 2024, which ties with the previous record from October 4, 2021[4].
- In June 2024, there were 325 violations (second-highest monthly total ever), and in May 2024, there were 289 (third-highest)[4]. The first ten days of July 2024 alone saw 232 violations, indicating a sustained high tempo[4].
- The record for most violations in a single month remains August 2022 (446), during a period of heightened tension after a major political event[3][4].
- The average daily number of violations rose to 10 in the 30 days after Lai Ching-te’s inauguration (May 20, 2024), compared to 6 before[3].

**2. Recent Announcements and Policies**
- The PRC has intensified military pressure on Taiwan since Lai Ching-te’s inauguration, which Beijing views as a separatist provocation[3][4].
- No major new exercises have been announced for August-September 2024 as of the latest available data, but the PLA has demonstrated a willingness to conduct large-scale incursions even outside of formal exercises[4].
- The PLA’s pattern includes both routine and reactionary surges, often triggered by political developments or perceived provocations[5].

**3. Authoritative Sources for Verification**
- The [PLATracker spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qbfYF0VgDBJoFZN5elpZwNTiKZ4nvCUcs5a7oYwm52g/edit?usp=sharing) is the primary source for daily ADIZ violation counts, specifically the "Total Aircraft Tracked in de facto ADIZ" column.
- Taiwan’s Ministry of National Defense (MND) publishes daily reports that are used to verify and supplement PLATracker data[3][4].

**4. Limitations and Uncertainties**
- The data excludes PLA activity around Taiwan’s outlying islands and only counts aircraft entering the de facto ADIZ, not those merely approaching or crossing the median line[3][4].
- The PLA’s operational tempo can change rapidly in response to political or military developments, introducing uncertainty.
- While the trend is upward, a sudden de-escalation or change in tactics could reduce the likelihood of a >30 aircraft day.

### Summary Table: Recent Daily Maximums

| Date           | Max Aircraft in ADIZ | Context                                 |
|----------------|----------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| July 10, 2024  | 56                   | Joint air-sea training, high tension[4] |
| May 23-24, 2024| 82 (over 2 days)     | Post-inauguration drills[3]             |
| August 2022    | 446 (monthly total)  | Pelosi visit, record surge[3][4]        |

### Conclusion

Given the recent record of multiple days with more than 30 violations, the elevated baseline since May 2024, and the PLA’s ongoing pressure campaign, there is strong factual support for the possibility that more than 30 Chinese aircraft will violate Taiwan’s ADIZ in a single day between August 15 and September 15, 2024. However, the outcome remains contingent on evolving political and military dynamics.
