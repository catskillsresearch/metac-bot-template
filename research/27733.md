## Key Factual Information as of August 28, 2024

**Current Status of the Debate**
- ABC News is scheduled to host a live, formal presidential debate between Donald Trump (Republican nominee) and Kamala Harris (Democratic nominee) on September 10, 2024, at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia[2][4][5].
- Both Trump and Harris have publicly agreed to participate in the debate. ABC News and multiple major outlets have confirmed that both campaigns have accepted the invitation[2][4][5].
- Trump, after initially expressing reluctance and criticizing ABC News, recommitted to the September 10 debate during a press conference and on social media[2][5].
- Harris has consistently stated her willingness to debate Trump on the scheduled date and has accused Trump of "backpedaling" but reaffirmed her own commitment[3].

**Recent Announcements and Developments**
- Trump’s campaign confirmed his participation in the September 10 debate, with Trump stating he would do three debates in September, including the ABC event[1][5].
- Harris has stated she will participate in the September 10 debate and will consider additional debates only after that[1].
- There have been disputes over debate rules (such as microphone muting), but as of the latest available information, these have not resulted in a formal withdrawal or cancellation by either campaign[3][5].

**Authoritative Sources for Verification**
- ABC News, Politico, CBS News, PBS, and the Associated Press have all reported on the scheduled debate and the candidates’ stated intentions to participate[2][3][4][5].

**Historical Trends and Uncertainties**
- Trump has a history of withdrawing from scheduled debates, including the October 15, 2020, presidential debate and a primary debate in March 2016. This introduces some uncertainty, as last-minute changes are possible[3][5].
- As of the cutoff date, there is no official announcement of cancellation, rescheduling, or withdrawal by either candidate.

**Limitations and Uncertainties**
- The debate is still subject to final agreement on rules and could be affected by unforeseen events or last-minute decisions by either campaign.
- The only way the debate would not occur as scheduled is if one or both candidates withdraw, the event is canceled or rescheduled, or either is no longer their party’s nominee as of September 10, 2024.
