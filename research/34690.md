### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The EGX 30 index experienced a significant rally in 2024, rising by 68% in local currency terms, reflecting strong bullish sentiment and robust market performance entering 2025[3].
- As of February 6, 2025, the Egyptian Exchange continued this positive momentum, with the benchmark index rallying and the EGX 40 up 0.93% for the first week of February, indicating a strong start to the month[2].

### Recent Announcements and Policies

- No major negative policy changes or macroeconomic shocks affecting the EGX 30 were reported in the immediate lead-up to February 2025.
- The market's positive momentum appears to be driven by continued investor confidence and favorable market conditions[2][3].

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The EGX 30's historical and current data can be verified via the Egyptian Exchange's official site, financial news outlets, and platforms such as Investing.com and Trading Economics[1][2][3].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- As of the knowledge cutoff (February 7, 2025), complete data for the entire month of February 2025 is not available. Only the first week’s performance is known, which shows a positive trend but does not guarantee the month's final outcome.
- Market volatility, unforeseen events, or policy changes later in February could alter the monthly return.
- The precise return category ('≥0% and <5%' or 'Greater than 5%') cannot be definitively determined without end-of-month data, but the evidence supports a positive return as the most likely outcome.

### Conclusion

Based on available information as of February 7, 2025, the EGX 30 index showed positive momentum in early February, following a strong 2024 performance. The most likely forecast for the EGX 30's return in February 2025 is a positive monthly return, with the probability leaning toward the '≥0% and <5%' or 'Greater than 5%' options, though the exact figure remains uncertain until full-month data is available[2][3].
