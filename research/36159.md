## Relevant Factors for Forecasting

Several factors may influence the podcast's ranking by March 31, 2025:

1. **Live Tour Impact**: The query mentions that Giggly Squad is currently on a live tour. Podcast rankings often experience temporary boosts during promotional periods and live tours as audience engagement increases.

2. **Comedy Genre Strength**: Comedy podcasts continue to dominate the podcasting landscape in 2024-2025, capturing "the largest U.S. weekly audience among listeners aged 13 and older" according to Edison Research's Q1 2024 report[2].

3. **Competitive Landscape**: As of December 2024 and into early 2025, the podcast charts have been dominated by shows like "Not Gonna Lie with Kylie Kelce" and "The Joe Rogan Experience"[1][2].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

The forecast faces several constraints:

1. **Ranking Volatility**: Podcast charts "change constantly" with "new shows coming out daily"[1].

2. **Platform Differences**: The podcast's performance varies across platforms. While it ranked #5 on Apple Podcasts' comedy category, its position specifically on Spotify is not clearly indicated in the available data.

3. **Limited Trend Data**: Without a time series of Spotify-specific rankings, it's difficult to establish a clear trajectory for the podcast's performance.

4. **Tour Impact Timing**: The effect of their live tour on rankings depends on timing, promotion effectiveness, and audience response, none of which can be precisely quantified from available data.

Based on the available information, Giggly Squad has demonstrated the ability to rank within the top 70 podcasts overall and the top 5 in the comedy category on Apple. However, its specific Spotify ranking trend remains unclear, creating significant uncertainty for the March 31, 2025 forecast.
