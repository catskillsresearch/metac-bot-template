## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- In 2022, the CDC reported approximately 246,000 COVID-19 deaths in the US[5].
- In 2023, this fell by about 69% to 76,000 deaths[5].
- As of early May 2025, COVID-19 accounts for only 0.6% of all US deaths, according to the CDC's COVID Data Tracker[1].
- Weekly deaths in early 2025 remain at low levels, consistent with the observed declines through 2023[3].

## Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Metric

- By 2023, vaccination rates were high, most of the population had some immunity, and most public health restrictions had been lifted.
- Ongoing CDC surveillance and reporting continue, but aggressive interventions have waned, and COVID-19 is treated more like an endemic respiratory disease.

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- US CDC COVID Data Tracker provides the official death counts[1][2].
- JAMA reports summarized CDC mortality data and trends[5].
- WHO COVID-19 dashboard offers international comparison and US-specific weekly death rates[3].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- Reporting lags and changes in cause-of-death attribution may affect the accuracy of annual death counts.
- Future variants or policy changes could disrupt the declining trend, but no such surge is evident in the latest data.
- Underreporting may increase as public and clinical focus on COVID-19 wanes.

## Probabilistic Assessment

Given the reported deaths for 2022 (246,000) and 2023 (76,000), and the marked downward trend with COVID-19 now causing less than 1% of all deaths, a reasonable estimate for 2024 and 2025 is that annual deaths remain at or below 76,000 per year.

Calculating the four-year average:
\[
\text{Average deaths per year (2022–2025)} = \frac{246,000 (\text{2022}) + 76,000 (\text{2023}) + 76,000 (\text{2024 est.}) + 76,000 (\text{2025 est.})}{4} \approx 118,500
\]

**Forecast:**  
The mean number of people reported to have died of COVID-19 per year in the United States during 2022–2025 is likely to be approximately **120,000 per year**, with the most probable range between 115,000 and 125,000, barring an unexpected resurgence[5][1][3].
