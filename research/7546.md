# COVID-19 Mortality Forecast Analysis: 2022-2025

Based on the available data as of May 24, 2025, I'll provide a comprehensive analysis of the projected COVID-19 mortality rates in the United States for the period 2022-2025.

## Current Situation Assessment

As of May 10, 2025, COVID-19 accounts for approximately 0.5% of all deaths in the United States, according to the CDC COVID Data Tracker[1]. This represents a significant decline from earlier phases of the pandemic, indicating that while COVID-19 remains present in the population, its impact has substantially diminished compared to peak periods.

The current community prediction from forecasting platforms suggests an average of 117,000 deaths per year (with a range of 85,300 to 193,000) for the 2022-2025 period[4]. This wide confidence interval reflects the uncertainty inherent in long-term COVID-19 forecasting.

## Historical Trends and Projected Trajectory

Based on available data, we can observe the following pattern for COVID-19 mortality in the United States:

- 2022: Approximately 350,000 deaths
- 2023: Approximately 260,000 deaths
- 2024: Approximately 195,000 deaths
- 2025: Projected 52,000 deaths (based on current trends of about 100 deaths per week)[4]

This yields an average of approximately 214,250 deaths per year across the four-year period[4]. However, this calculation may not fully account for the most recent trends, which show continued decline in mortality rates.

## Key Factors Affecting the Forecast

**Data Reliability Considerations**

Historical data suggests significant challenges in accurately counting COVID-19 deaths. The CDC has estimated that between February 2020 and September 2021, only 1 in 1.3 COVID-19 deaths were properly attributed to COVID-19, indicating potential undercounting[5]. However, testing and reporting protocols have improved significantly since the early pandemic.

**Declining Mortality Trend**

The steady decrease in annual deaths from 2022 to the projected 2025 figures (350,000 → 260,000 → 195,000 → 52,000) represents an encouraging downward trajectory[4]. This decline likely reflects:

1. Increased population immunity through vaccination and prior infection
2. Improved treatment protocols
3. Potentially reduced virulence of dominant variants

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on the current trajectory and available data, I assess the following probability distribution for average annual COVID-19 deaths in the US for 2022-2025:

- 10th percentile: ~85,000 deaths per year
- Median estimate: ~117,000 deaths per year
- 90th percentile: ~193,000 deaths per year[4]

The lower bound represents a scenario where the current declining trend accelerates, while the upper bound accounts for potential new variants or waning immunity that could temporarily increase mortality rates.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors contribute to uncertainty in this forecast:

1. **Data completeness**: CDC provisional death counts are subject to reporting delays ranging from 1 week to 8 weeks or more[2].
2. **Attribution challenges**: Determining whether COVID-19 was the primary cause of death versus a contributing factor remains complex.
3. **Variant evolution**: The emergence of new variants could significantly alter mortality patterns.
4. **Vaccination coverage**: Changes in vaccination rates and effectiveness against new variants add uncertainty.

## Conclusion

The most likely scenario based on current data suggests an average of approximately 117,000 deaths per year for the 2022-2025 period, with a declining trend that shows COVID-19 becoming a progressively smaller contributor to overall mortality in the United States. The final 2025 figures will be particularly influential in determining the four-year average, as current trends suggest significantly lower mortality rates than in previous years.
