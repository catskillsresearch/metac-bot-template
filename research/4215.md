**1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status**
- As of 2019, real world GDP was estimated at about $87 trillion (2020 USD)[1].
- Global GDP had been growing at an average annual rate of roughly 3% in the decade leading up to 2020.

**2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric**
- Prior to 2020, no new global economic policy or event was projected to fundamentally alter the long-term baseline growth rate, except for the COVID-19 pandemic, which caused a temporary contraction but is unlikely to transform the long-term trajectory compared to potential AI-driven acceleration.

**3. Authoritative Sources for Verification**
- Worldometers GDP estimate for 2019 provides the key reference value[1].
- Nick Bostrom’s work contextualizes economic growth as a proxy for technological progress and discusses the impact of advanced AI and automation on future productivity[1].
- Recent discussions highlight the possibility of a “post-work” or post-scarcity economy after AGI, where economic measurement may become conceptually challenging[5].

**4. Limitations and Uncertainties in Measurement**
- The timing of AGI deployment is uncertain and directly affects the GDP figure for the relevant year.
- If pre-AGI technologies accelerate growth as theorized, actual GDP at AGI deployment could significantly exceed naive extrapolations from current trends.
- Post-AGI, the traditional meaning and measurement of GDP could become obsolete if automation eliminates the need for most human labor[5].

**Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment**
- If AGI arrives within 20–40 years of 2020 and pre-AGI acceleration occurs, world real GDP at deployment could plausibly range from $150 trillion (baseline 2–3% growth) to several times higher (potentially $200–400 trillion or more) if acceleration is substantial.
- The precise figure depends on the actual year of AGI deployment (as resolved elsewhere) and whether the hypothesized acceleration in economic growth materializes.
- The main source of uncertainty is the extent—and onset—of pre-AGI productivity acceleration, as well as the challenge of measuring economic output post-AGI.
