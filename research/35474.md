### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The Gaganyaan-1 mission is India's first uncrewed orbital test flight as part of its human spaceflight program, using the human-rated LVM3 (HLVM3) launch vehicle[1].
- As of November 2024, the expected launch date for the Gaganyaan-1 uncrewed test flight was pushed to "no earlier than 2026" for the crewed mission, with the uncrewed test flight targeted for Q2 2025[1][2][4].
- ISRO has made significant progress on the crew module, emergency-escape system, and other critical systems, but has not announced a firm launch date for the uncrewed test flight[3].

### Recent Announcements and Policies

- As of January 2025, ISRO had not provided an official launch date for Gaganyaan-1. Local media and space news outlets suggested a tentative launch "early this year, perhaps as soon as February," but these were not confirmed by ISRO[3].
- Multiple launch tracking sites and ISRO's own schedule indicate the first uncrewed Gaganyaan test flight is now targeted for Q2 2025, which begins after April 1, 2025[2][4].
- There have been no credible reports or official statements indicating a launch before April 1, 2025.

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Wikipedia's Gaganyaan page (updated February 2025) and launch tracking databases (RocketLaunch.Live, RocketLaunch.org) all list the uncrewed test flight as "Q2 2025" or later[1][2][4].
- Space.com and other reputable outlets confirm that while ISRO has made technical progress, the agency has not committed to a launch date before April 1, 2025[3].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- ISRO has occasionally provided tentative dates in the past, but these have been subject to change due to technical, logistical, or policy reasons.
- The absence of a firm, public launch date from ISRO as of late February 2025, combined with multiple independent sources reporting Q2 2025 or later, strongly suggests the launch will not occur before April 1, 2025.

### Conclusion

Based on all available factual information as of February 28, 2025, there is no evidence that India's Gaganyaan-1 program will launch a flight test before April 1, 2025. All credible sources indicate the earliest possible launch is in Q2 2025, which begins after the resolution date.
