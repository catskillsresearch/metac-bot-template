## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

### Artificial Superintelligence (ASI)
- As of 2020, AI research is advancing rapidly, with milestones in deep learning, natural language processing, and reinforcement learning.
- Experts and prominent futurists (e.g., Ray Kurzweil) predicted the emergence of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) by 2029 and superintelligence (AI that vastly exceeds human capabilities across domains) possibly within 30 years after AGI[2][3].
- Sam Altman and other leaders in AI suggest timelines for ASI as soon as the 2020s-2030s, though these are acknowledged to be speculative and uncertain[4].
- Surveys of AI experts in the late 2010s commonly gave a 50% chance of AGI by 2050-2100, and about a 33% chance that superintelligence would follow within 30 years after AGI[3].

### Longevity Escape Velocity (LEV)
- No anti-aging therapy as of 2020 comes close to meeting the LEV criterion: i.e., extending 70-year-old lifespans by 50+ years for most recipients.
- Progress in life extension is incremental, with most therapies in early research or clinical trials and no near-term expectation of therapies achieving LEV.
- Ray Kurzweil and a minority of futurists anticipate LEV by the 2030s-2040s, but this is not mainstream scientific consensus[2].
- Mainstream gerontology considers LEV speculative, citing biological complexity, ethical concerns, and regulatory hurdles.

## 2. Key Differences Affecting the Forecast

- **Scientific Bottlenecks:** AI progress primarily depends on advances in algorithms, hardware, and data, while anti-aging breakthroughs rely on much more complex biological systems and extensive human trials.
- **Regulatory Environment:** AI can be developed and tested rapidly in silico, while anti-aging therapies require long, expensive, and uncertain human trials, delaying progress.
- **Funding and Talent:** AI attracts larger investment and talent pools due to its broad applicability in industry, while anti-aging research is more niche and controversial.
- **Uncertainty and Black Swan Events:** Both fields are subject to unpredictable breakthroughs or setbacks, but AI progress has been more consistent and visible.

## 3. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric (as of 2020)

- **AI:** Increasing investment from tech companies and governments, establishment of AI ethics boards, and new research labs focused on general intelligence.
- **Anti-Aging:** Launch of new biotech startups, some increased interest in aging research funding, but no regulatory breakthroughs or approved therapies for radical life extension.

## 4. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Ray Kurzweilâ€™s predictions on AGI and LEV timelines[2].
- Survey of AI expert opinion on AGI and ASI timelines[3].
- Public statements from AI industry leaders such as Sam Altman[4].
- Wikipedia and scientific literature on longevity escape velocity and anti-aging research.

## 5. Limitations and Uncertainties

- Both fields are highly speculative with long-range timelines.
- Timelines for ASI and LEV are based on expert opinion and extrapolation, not empirical data.
- Black swan breakthroughs could accelerate or delay either field unexpectedly.
- Ethical, societal, and regulatory responses could significantly alter trajectories.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the relative pace of progress, expert forecasts, and bottlenecks in each field as of 2020, it appears substantially more likely that artificial superintelligence will precede the achievement of longevity escape velocity, if either occurs by 2300. While both events are uncertain and may not occur by 2300, the forecasted timelines and current status favor ASI arriving first[2][3][4].
