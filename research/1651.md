**Key Historical Trends and Current Status (as of December 17, 2018):**

- **Protein Structure Determination:** For decades, scientists have struggled to predict the 3D structure of proteins from amino acid sequences, known as the “protein folding problem.” Experimental methods (cryo-EM, NMR, X-ray crystallography) are slow and expensive, prompting the search for computational alternatives.
- **Benchmarking Progress:** The Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP) has been the gold standard since 1994, held every two years, allowing objective assessment of prediction methods. More than 100 groups regularly participate, with results closely watched by the scientific community.
- **Recent Results (CASP13, 2018):** In the latest CASP, Google DeepMind’s AlphaFold achieved a major advance, correctly solving 25 out of 43 protein structures (58.1% success rate). The next-best group solved just 3 (7%). However, even AlphaFold’s top predictions did not reach the 90 mean GDT-TS accuracy threshold required for the forecast’s “breakthrough” definition.
- **Acceleration by AI:** AlphaFold’s leap in performance signals that AI methods are accelerating progress in protein structure prediction, outpacing traditional approaches. This suggests a trend toward eventual breakthroughs if progress continues at this pace.

**Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric:**

- **AI’s Emergence:** The 2018 AlphaFold result is a landmark, widely reported in both scientific and popular media. No new policies or funding changes directly affecting the CASP process or protein prediction efforts were announced as of late 2018, but the breakthrough has galvanized further research and competition.
- **CASP’s Role:** CASP continues to serve as an authoritative, ongoing benchmark, with future rounds expected.

**Authoritative Sources for Verification:**

- CASP official website and reports provide detailed, transparent data on each round’s results and methodologies.
- DeepMind’s blog and peer-reviewed publications document AlphaFold’s methods and achievements.
- Coverage in major scientific and general media (e.g., The Guardian, IEEE Spectrum) corroborates the significance of these advances.

**Limitations and Uncertainties:**

- **Measurement:** CASP’s GDT-TS metric and double-blind evaluation ensure accuracy and comparability, but only cover proteins selected for each round.
- **Continuity:** If CASP ceases before 2031, the forecast becomes ambiguous per the resolution criteria.
- **Generalization:** AI’s performance may not generalize equally well across all protein classes, especially larger or more complex proteins.
- **Pace of Progress:** While recent gains are dramatic, it is uncertain whether such improvements will continue linearly or plateau before reaching the 90 GDT-TS threshold.

**Summary Table: Key Trends and Metrics**

| Year | Top Group (CASP) | Structures Correctly Predicted | Mean GDT-TS ≥ 90? | Notable Advances |
|------|------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| 2018 | AlphaFold        | 25/43 (58.1%)                 | No                | Major AI leap    |
| 2018 | Next-best group  | 3/43 (7%)                     | No                | -                |

**Conclusion:**  
As of December 2018, significant progress—especially by AI—suggests a breakthrough is increasingly plausible before 2031, but the 90 GDT-TS threshold has not yet been met. The field is advancing rapidly, but uncertainties remain regarding the pace of further improvement and the continuity of CASP as the definitive benchmark.
