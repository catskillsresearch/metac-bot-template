# Analysis of UP Products, LLC Sausage Recall Status

As of February 10, 2025, I've analyzed the available information regarding the USDA recall of sausage products by UP Products, LLC to help forecast whether this recall will be closed before April 1, 2025.

## Current Status of the Recall

On January 13, 2025, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced that UP Products, LLC, doing business as Meyer Wholesale, recalled approximately 400 pounds of sausage products due to misbranding and an undeclared allergen (soy)[1]. The recall affects:

- 5" x 8" vacuum-sealed packages of "Otto Meyer's Premium Sausage POLISH SAUSAGE" with lot codes 24304, 24318, 24326, 24346
- Bulk packed 12" x 24" clear bags containing "Otto Meyer's Premium Sausage POTATO SAUSAGE" with handwritten dates 1/6/25 and 1/7/25[1][3]

These products were distributed to a restaurant and retail locations in Michigan, and a retail location in Wisconsin[1]. The products bear establishment number "EST. M1733" inside the USDA mark of inspection[1].

## Key Factors Relevant to Recall Duration

The recall was classified as a misbranding issue with an undeclared allergen, rather than a contamination or foodborne illness concern[3]. This is significant because allergen-related recalls may potentially be resolved more quickly than those involving pathogens or foreign material contamination, as the remediation process primarily involves correcting labeling issues rather than addressing production contamination.

The relatively small volume of affected product (approximately 400 pounds) may also be a factor that could expedite the recall process[1][3]. Smaller recalls can sometimes be resolved more quickly as there are fewer products to track and recover.

## Comparative Context

For context, another recent recall announced on January 31, 2025, involved DJ's Boudain recalling over 17,000 pounds of sausage products due to foreign material contamination (pieces of pen)[5]. This recall is significantly larger in volume and involves a different type of safety concern (foreign material vs. allergen), making direct comparison difficult.

## Limitations in Forecasting

Several important pieces of information are not available in the current data:

1. No information is available about the typical duration of USDA recalls for allergen-related issues
2. No updates have been provided on the status of the recall since its initial announcement
3. No data is available on the percentage of affected products that have been recovered
4. No information on whether any allergic reactions have been reported

## Conclusion

Based on the limited information available as of February 10, 2025, it is difficult to make a confident forecast about whether this recall will be closed before April 1, 2025. The relatively small volume of the recall (400 pounds) and the nature of the issue (undeclared allergen rather than contamination) could potentially favor a quicker resolution. However, without historical data on typical USDA recall durations or updates on the current status of recovery efforts, significant uncertainty remains.

For verification purposes, the official USDA FSIS recall notice and subsequent updates to the recall status page would be the authoritative sources to monitor[1][2].
