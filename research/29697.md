# Will Thomas Massie be announced as the nominee for Secretary of Agriculture before January 1, 2025?

As of November 7, 2024, there are several key pieces of information relevant to forecasting whether Thomas Massie will be announced as the nominee for Secretary of Agriculture before January 1, 2025.

## Current Status

Representative Thomas Massie (R-KY) is currently being discussed as a potential candidate for Secretary of Agriculture in the incoming Trump administration. However, his actual status in the selection process remains unclear due to conflicting reports:

- On November 6, 2024, Joel Salatin (a prominent figure in sustainable agriculture) wrote that "My favorite congressman, Thomas Massie from Kentucky, has agreed to go in as Secretary of Agriculture."[1]

- However, on November 7, 2024, Rep. Massie himself stated on social media: "I stand ready and willing to help the President with any part of his bold agenda to focus on the health and well-being of Americans, but I have received no commitments or offers from President Trump's team, and any discussion of the transition are premature."[3]

## Massie's Background and Position

Thomas Massie is described as a "rebel House conservative" who most consider a "long shot choice" for the position.[2] He has served in the House of Representatives for more than a decade and secured another term during the 2024 election.[3]

Massie has previously indicated interest in the role, stating that he "could do some good for this country as Secretary of Agriculture."[3] This demonstrates his willingness to serve in this capacity if offered the position.

## Competing Candidates

Several other individuals are reportedly being considered for the Secretary of Agriculture position:

- Sid Miller, Texas Agriculture Commissioner (serving since January 2015)[2]
- Kip Tom, Co-Chair of Farmers and Ranchers for Trump[5]
- Former House Agriculture Chairman Mike Conaway[2]
- Ray Starling[2]

## Related Developments

Joel Salatin, a self-described "Christian libertarian environmentalist capitalist lunatic farmer," announced on November 6, 2024, that he has accepted one of six "Advisor to the Secretary" positions within the USDA.[4] This suggests that the Trump transition team is actively working on agricultural appointments.

Farm Action, an agricultural advocacy organization, noted on November 7, 2024, that "Rep. Massie has been a strong ally on many of our issues and we are glad to see his name in the mix" for the Secretary position.[5]

## Uncertainties and Limitations

The primary uncertainty stems from the contradiction between Joel Salatin's claim that Massie has "agreed to go in as Secretary of Agriculture" and Massie's own statement that he has "received no commitments or offers from President Trump's team."

Additionally, Massie's political history may be relevant to his chances:
- He endorsed Florida Governor Ron DeSantis for president before DeSantis launched his bid for the GOP presidential nomination.[3]
- DeSantis later dropped out and endorsed Trump in January 2024.[3]

## Conclusion

As of November 7, 2024, while Thomas Massie is being discussed as a potential Secretary of Agriculture and has expressed willingness to serve in the role, he has explicitly stated that he has not received any commitments or offers from the Trump transition team. His selection appears possible but uncertain, with several other candidates also reportedly under consideration.
