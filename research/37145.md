### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- In the first half of 2023, NYC recorded 2,236 rat sighting complaints; in the same period of 2024, this dropped to 2,124, showing a modest year-over-year decrease in reported sightings[1].
- The decrease in rat sighting complaints was observed in all rat mitigation zones except the Bronx Grand Concourse, which saw an increase[1].
- Overall rodent-related complaints (including other descriptors) increased citywide, suggesting possible shifts in complaint categorization or reporting behavior[1].

### Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Metric

- NYC implemented stricter trash storage rules, with 70% of trash now stored in bins rather than bags, which has led to reported declines in rat sightings in some neighborhoods[2].
- Rat mitigation zones, established in 2023, have reportedly seen up to a 68% decrease in rat sightings since their implementation[3].
- However, climate change and warmer temperatures may be increasing rat populations, with studies showing NYC among cities experiencing growth in rat reports due to favorable conditions for rat breeding and survival[4].

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- NYC Department of Health Rat Mitigation Zone Reports[1]
- NYC Open Data: Rat Sightings 311 Complaints (official resolution source)
- News coverage and scientific studies on urban rats and climate impacts[2][3][4]

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- Most available data aggregates complaints over six-month periods, limiting precision for monthly forecasts.
- Seasonal effects (warmer weather in June) typically increase rat activity, but recent mitigation efforts may offset this.
- Reporting behavior and complaint categorization may shift due to public awareness or changes in city services.
- Climate variability introduces additional uncertainty, as warmer, wetter conditions can boost rat populations[4].

### Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the downward trend in rat sighting complaints in 2024, the impact of new trash policies, and the potential upward pressure from climate factors, the most likely number of NYC rat sightings reported for June 2025 is estimated to be in the range of **2,000 to 2,200**. This reflects a modest decrease from June 2023, with a central estimate near **2,100** rat sightings.

#### Probability Distribution (subjective, based on available data):
- Below 1,900: 10%
- 1,900–2,100: 40%
- 2,100–2,300: 40%
- Above 2,300: 10%

This forecast should be revisited as June 2025 approaches and more granular monthly data becomes available.
