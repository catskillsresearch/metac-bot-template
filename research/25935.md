### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Q* (Q-Star) is an internal OpenAI project rumored to represent a significant advance in AI reasoning and math problem-solving, possibly linked to the events surrounding Sam Altman's temporary removal as CEO in November 2023[1][4].
- The existence of Q* was indirectly acknowledged by OpenAI in internal staff communications, but no public technical details or official descriptions have been released[1][4].
- Media reports and community discussions suggest that Q* could be a precursor to artificial general intelligence (AGI), but these claims remain unverified by OpenAI[1][2][4].

### Recent Announcements and Policies

- As of July 9, 2024, OpenAI has not published any official document (blog post, paper, or video) describing Q* or publicly acknowledged what Q* is, beyond confirming its existence in response to media inquiries[1][2][4].
- There are rumors of delays in any planned Q* release, possibly due to legal disputes (such as the Elon Musk lawsuit) or internal caution about the technology's implications[2].
- OpenAI has demonstrated increased caution in releasing information about sensitive AI research, especially following the internal turmoil of late 2023[4].

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The Reuters report and subsequent media coverage confirm that Q* exists as an internal project at OpenAI, but do not provide technical details or an official description[1][4].
- Community and third-party analyses speculate on Q*'s nature, but none are based on official OpenAI publications[2][3].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- All information about Q* comes from leaks, rumors, and indirect acknowledgments, not from official OpenAI sources.
- There is no evidence as of July 9, 2024, that OpenAI plans to publish information about Q* before September 30, 2024.
- OpenAIâ€™s history of caution with sensitive research suggests a low probability of imminent disclosure unless external circumstances change.

### Conclusion

As of July 9, 2024, there is no factual basis to expect that OpenAI will publish information describing Q* (Q-Star) by September 30, 2024. No official description or acknowledgment meeting the resolution criteria has been made public, and available evidence points to continued secrecy and caution regarding Q*.
