## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Spain has been a consistent participant in Eurovision, but its results over the past decade have generally been modest. The country's best recent result was a 3rd place finish in 2022, with a second-best of 17th place in 2023[5].
- For the 2025 contest, Spain is represented by Melody with the song "Esa Diva," which won the national selection, Benidorm Fest[5].

## Recent Announcements and Expert Predictions

- As of early May 2025, betting odds from multiple sources indicate that Spain is not among the favorites to win Eurovision 2025. Bookmakers assign Spain a roughly 1% chance of victory, with odds ranging from 100 to 201, placing them well behind leading contenders such as Sweden and Finland[1][4].
- Expert previews and predictions also suggest a mid-to-lower table finish for Spain. One notable preview predicts Spain will place between 16th and 20th in the Grand Final[5].
- There have been no major announcements or changes in Eurovision rules or Spain's selection process that would significantly impact their chances for 2025.

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Official Eurovision betting odds and expert commentary are available on Eurovisionworld and other betting analysis platforms[1][4].
- The European Broadcasting Union (EBU) will officially announce the winner on the night of the Grand Final, and results will be widely reported by accredited media outlets.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- Eurovision outcomes can be unpredictable due to the combination of jury and public votes, live performance factors, and potential for surprise moments.
- Betting odds and expert predictions are based on current information and trends, but do not guarantee outcomes.
- The final result will only be known after the Grand Final on 17 May 2025.
