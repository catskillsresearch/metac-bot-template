# Forecasting the 2025 Doomsday Clock Setting

The Doomsday Clock, maintained by the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, serves as a metaphorical representation of how close humanity is to self-destruction. As we approach the next announcement scheduled for January 28, 2025, at the United States Institute of Peace in Washington, DC, let's examine the available information that might help forecast the upcoming setting[1].

## Current Status and Recent History

As of January 2024, the Doomsday Clock remains set at **90 seconds to midnight** - the closest it has ever been to symbolic apocalypse in its history[3]. This setting was first established in January 2023 and maintained in the 2024 announcement, indicating the Bulletin's assessment that global existential threats remain at a critical level[3][4].

Prior to the 2023 adjustment, the clock had been set at 100 seconds to midnight since 2020[4]. The move to 90 seconds was attributed "largely but not exclusively to Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the increased risk of nuclear escalation"[4].

## Factors Influencing the Clock Setting

The Bulletin's Science and Security Board considers several key factors when determining the clock's position:

1. **Nuclear risk** - Including geopolitical tensions and arms control developments
2. **Climate change** - Assessment of global climate action and environmental threats
3. **Disruptive technologies** - Emerging technological risks
4. **Biosecurity** - Including pandemic threats and biological weapons concerns[1]

Rachel Bronson, President and CEO of the Bulletin, emphasized in the 2024 announcement that the decision to maintain the 90-second setting "is not an indication that the world is stable. Quite the opposite. It's urgent for governments and communities around the world to act."[3]

## Decision-Making Process

The Doomsday Clock is set by the Bulletin's Science and Security Board (SASB), "a select group of globally recognized leaders with a specific focus on nuclear risk, climate change, and disruptive technologies"[1]. The board includes experts in various fields and provides objective external perspectives on global threats. The SASB makes its determination with support from the Bulletin's Board of Sponsors, which includes 10 Nobel Laureates[4].

## Historical Context

The Doomsday Clock has fluctuated over the decades in response to global events:

- It was initially set at 7 minutes to midnight in 1947[2]
- The closest previous setting to our current position was 2 minutes to midnight, reached during the height of the Cold War following hydrogen bomb tests
- The furthest from midnight was 17 minutes, following the end of the Cold War

## Upcoming Announcement

The Bulletin has confirmed that the next Doomsday Clock announcement will take place on January 28, 2025, at 10:00 a.m. EST/1500 GMT[1]. This live, in-person news conference will reveal whether global conditions have improved, deteriorated, or remained stable according to the Bulletin's assessment.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors complicate forecasting the 2025 setting:

1. The Doomsday Clock is not updated on a fixed schedule but rather as global events dictate
2. The decision involves subjective assessment by the Science and Security Board
3. Multiple complex global factors are weighed simultaneously
4. Geopolitical developments between now and the announcement could significantly impact the decision

Given that the clock has remained at 90 seconds to midnight for two consecutive years (2023-2024), any change would likely reflect significant developments in global security, climate action, or technological threats.
