# 2025 Oscar Best Picture Race Analysis

As of February 2025, the race for the Academy Award for Best Picture remains competitive with several strong contenders vying for the top prize at the 97th Academy Awards scheduled for March 2, 2025[2]. Based on available information, there is no clear frontrunner yet, with industry publications describing it as "a Best Picture race in search of a frontrunner"[4].

## Leading Contenders

Based on critics' predictions, industry buzz, and precursor awards, the following films have emerged as the strongest contenders:

### Top Tier Contenders

1. **Anora** - Sean Baker's film has been consistently placed at or near the top of prediction lists following strong festival reception[1][4]. It appears on virtually all major prediction lists.

2. **The Brutalist** - Featuring Adrien Brody in a performance that won him the Golden Globe for Best Actor Drama[5], this A24 release has gathered significant momentum. Brody previously won an Oscar for "The Pianist" in 2002, which may add to the film's prestige factor[5].

3. **Conclave** - With Ralph Fiennes in a leading role, this film has been predicted to receive approximately 10 nominations according to some forecasts[2][4].

4. **A Complete Unknown** - Starring Timothée Chalamet, this Searchlight Pictures release has maintained a strong position in predictions[2][4].

### Additional Strong Contenders

- **Emilia Pérez** - This film has been predicted to potentially lead all films with 11 nominations[2]. It features Zoe Saldaña, who shared the Best Actress prize at Cannes and could be looking at her first Oscar nomination[1].

- **Wicked** - Predicted to receive around 8 nominations[2].

- **The Substance** - Consistently appearing on prediction lists[4].

- **Dune Part Two** - While some predictors have reduced their expectations for this sequel in certain technical categories, it remains a Best Picture contender[2][4].

## Precursor Awards and Indicators

The race has been shaped by several precursor awards and industry indicators:

- **Golden Globes**: Adrien Brody won for Best Actor Drama for "The Brutalist," potentially boosting that film's chances[5].

- **Critics Choice Awards (CCA)**: Both Adrien Brody and Timothée Chalamet received nominations, indicating strong support for their respective films[2].

- **Festival Reception**: "Anora" and "Emilia Pérez" received significant acclaim at film festivals, with "Sing Sing" winning an award at TIFF (Toronto International Film Festival)[1].

- **Guild Awards**: The PGA (Producers Guild of America) and WGA (Writers Guild of America) nominations were expected to provide further clarity to the race[4], though the search results don't include their final selections.

- **BAFTA**: The British Academy released their longlists on January 3, 2025, with nominations announced on January 15, 2025[2]. The BAFTA selections are noted to be sometimes difficult to predict and don't always align with Oscar outcomes[4].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors make predicting the eventual Best Picture winner challenging:

1. **No Clear Frontrunner**: Unlike some years where one film dominates precursor awards, the 2025 race appears more open with multiple viable contenders[4].

2. **Remaining Guild Awards**: At the time of the latest available information, some influential guild awards had yet to announce their winners, which could significantly impact momentum.

3. **Academy Voting Patterns**: The preferential ballot system used for Best Picture can sometimes lead to surprising results, favoring broadly liked films over more divisive ones with passionate support.

4. **Late-Breaking Momentum**: Oscar campaigns can gain or lose momentum in the final weeks before voting, which could alter the competitive landscape.

Based on the available information before February 25, 2025, the Best Picture race remains competitive among the top contenders, with "Anora," "The Brutalist," "Conclave," and "A Complete Unknown" all positioned as serious contenders, along with "Emilia Pérez" which has shown strong momentum in predictions.
