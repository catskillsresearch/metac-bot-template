# Will Florida Voters Approve Amendment 3 for Marijuana Legalization?

As of October 2024, Florida voters are considering Amendment 3, which would legalize recreational marijuana for adults 21 and older. This analysis examines available information to help forecast the likelihood of its passage in the November 2024 election.

## Current Status and Proposal Details

Amendment 3 would modify Florida's existing medical marijuana constitutional amendment to legalize recreational marijuana for adults 21 years or older[1]. If approved, the amendment would:

- Allow adults to possess up to three ounces of marijuana (approximately 85 grams), with up to five grams in concentrate form[2]
- Permit the purchase and use of marijuana products for non-medical personal consumption[2]
- Authorize existing Medical Marijuana Treatment Centers to sell recreational marijuana[2][3]
- Take effect six months after voter approval[3]

Importantly, the amendment requires 60% voter approval to pass, which is a higher threshold than many other states require for constitutional amendments[3].

## Historical Context and Trends

Several factors provide context for forecasting Amendment 3's chances:

- In 2016, Florida voters approved medical marijuana (Amendment 2) by a decisive 71% to 29% margin, showing strong historical support for cannabis reform[2]
- As of 2024, 24 states, two territories, and the District of Columbia have already legalized recreational marijuana[2][3]
- National support for marijuana legalization has doubled since 2000, with approximately 70% of Americans now favoring legalization in some form, according to PEW Research[2]

## Political Support and Opposition

The amendment has generated significant political division:

- Former President Donald Trump has expressed support for loosening federal marijuana restrictions and stated he will vote for the Florida initiative[4]
- Florida Governor Ron DeSantis opposes the amendment, arguing it would create "a drug cartel" in Florida's constitution by favoring existing medical marijuana companies[4]
- Unlike previous legalization efforts that included home-growing provisions, Amendment 3 is structured to benefit Florida's existing $2 billion medical marijuana industry, which has drawn criticism[4]

## Implementation Structure

If approved, Amendment 3 would create a regulated market for marijuana:

- The amendment would initially allow the state's existing medical marijuana companies to sell recreational cannabis[4][5]
- Future expansion of licenses would be determined by Florida's Republican-controlled Legislature[4]
- The amendment would establish regulations for quality control, advertising, and sales procedures[5]
- Tax revenue generated could potentially fund public services like education and healthcare[5]

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors create uncertainty in forecasting the outcome:

- The 60% approval threshold is significantly higher than a simple majority
- The amendment faces opposition from the sitting governor and some state officials
- The search results don't provide recent polling data specific to Amendment 3
- Voter turnout and demographic factors will likely influence the final result
- The amendment's structure favoring existing medical marijuana businesses has created some opposition even among pro-legalization advocates

## Conclusion

While Florida has previously shown strong support for medical marijuana and national trends favor legalization, the 60% threshold presents a significant hurdle for Amendment 3. The amendment has notable political support, including from former President Trump, but also faces opposition from Governor DeSantis and others concerned about its industry-favoring structure. Without current polling data, it's difficult to make a definitive forecast, but the historical context suggests substantial but not guaranteed support for the measure.
