**Key Historical Trends and Current Status**

- Since Russia’s 2022 invasion, all attempts at a durable bilateral ceasefire have failed, with neither side willing to make major territorial concessions.
- As of May 2025, the Trump administration is in the final stages of pushing for a Ukraine-Russia peace deal. There are modest signs of progress, including a US-Ukrainian agreement on mineral rights and a constructive Trump-Zelensky meeting[1].
- Russia appears willing to freeze the current front lines but insists on formal recognition of its control over Crimea and occupied eastern regions. Ukraine has repeatedly rejected such terms as unacceptable[2].

**Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric**

- The Trump administration has presented Ukraine with a “final offer” peace framework that would require Ukraine to accept Russia’s occupation of Crimea and much of Donbas and other eastern territories. The White House has signaled readiness to walk away if a deal is not reached soon[2].
- The US proposal is widely viewed as favoring Russian interests and offers Ukraine only vague benefits, increasing domestic political risks for Zelensky if he accepts[2].
- Any peace treaty reached under these conditions could be regarded as void under international law unless approved by the UN Security Council, potentially complicating enforcement and legitimacy[1].

**Authoritative Sources for Verification**

- Foreign Policy and Axios have both reported on the ongoing peace initiatives, the content of Trump’s proposals, and the reactions of the parties involved[1][2].

**Limitations and Uncertainties**

- Ukrainian leadership faces strong domestic opposition to territorial concessions, making acceptance of the proposed terms doubtful.
- Russia’s willingness to accept a front-line freeze may not translate into a durable bilateral ceasefire if Ukraine refuses to recognize Russian gains.
- International legal hurdles and the need for Security Council approval could delay or derail any agreement reached under duress[1].
- Even if a ceasefire is signed, its durability is uncertain given the lack of mutual trust and the risk of renewed hostilities.

**Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment**

Compared to previous years, the probability of a bilateral ceasefire before 2026 has increased due to direct US pressure and ongoing negotiations. However, the deep rift over territorial concessions, domestic constraints on Zelensky, and questions of international legitimacy mean the likelihood remains below 50%, likely in the 25–40% range as of May 2025.
