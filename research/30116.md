## Key Historical Trends

- Pantone's Color of the Year selections over the past decade have included red or red-adjacent hues several times (2015 Marsala, 2016 Rose Quartz, 2019 Living Coral, 2023 Viva Magenta), but these are interspersed with blues, greens, violets, and most recently, orange (2024 Peach Fuzz)[2][3].
- Pantone rarely repeats a color family in consecutive years, and after 2023's Viva Magenta (red) and 2024's Peach Fuzz (orange), a shift toward other hues is historically likely[2][3].

## 2025 Trend Forecasts and Announcements

- The 2025 color palettes highlighted by Pantone's Fashion Color Trend Reports and industry analysts focus on deep greens, earthy oranges, golds, purples, light blues, and especially warm browns[1][2][3][4].
- Pantone's 2025 selection, as reported by multiple sources, is "Mocha Mousse," described as a warm, muted brown, aligning with the broader trend toward comforting, earthy tones[3].
- Other predicted contenders include green ("White Grape"), yellow ("Yellow Jasper"), blue ("Deja Vu Blue"), and various browns and chocolates, but not red[4].
- No credible predictions or leaks suggest a red or magenta hue is under consideration for 2025[2][3][4].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Pantone's official Fashion Color Trend Reports and PANTONEVIEW Colour Planner for Spring/Summer 2025 provide direct insight into trending colors[1][5].
- Industry roundups and expert predictions (e.g., Young House Love, VeriVide, The Nordroom) consistently point to browns, greens, and blues as the dominant hues for 2025[2][3][4].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- Pantone's final decision is kept secret until the official announcement (expected December 5, 2024), so all forecasts are based on trend analysis and expert opinion, not inside information.
- The definition of "closest color" is strictly tied to the HSV hue value, so even a brownish-red could technically qualify if its hue falls within the specified range, though current predictions do not indicate such a shade.

## Conclusion

Based on all available evidence as of November 15, 2024, it is highly unlikely that "Red" will be the closest color to the 2025 Pantone Color of the Year. The consensus points to a warm brown ("Mocha Mousse") or potentially a green, blue, or yellow, none of which would resolve as "Red" under the specified criteria[2][3][4].
