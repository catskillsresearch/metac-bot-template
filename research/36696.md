# Forecasting the 2028 Democratic Presidential Nominee

As of May 2025, the race for the 2028 Democratic presidential nomination is already taking shape, with several key figures positioning themselves as potential candidates. This early jockeying for position is notable, as presidential contenders have historically been more discreet about their ambitions this far in advance.

## Current Political Landscape

The Democratic Party is currently in opposition following former President Trump's victory in the 2024 election. This position has created both challenges and opportunities for potential 2028 candidates. As veteran Democratic strategist Chris Moyer notes, "There was a sense of hopelessness earlier this year among Democrats, as Trump came in with his wrecking ball, and it seemed like there was nothing but futile opposition to him. So thinking about a presidential race with potential candidates is a way to get some hope back and look towards a future that doesn't include Trump."[1]

Unlike previous cycles, potential candidates are being unusually open about their presidential ambitions. According to recent reporting, Democrats are "saying the quiet part out loud about 2028," with former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg among those not hiding their interest in running.[5]

## Leading Contenders Based on Current Data

### Kamala Harris

The former Vice President has recently increased her political activities after maintaining a low profile immediately following the end of the Biden administration. She has headlined major DNC fundraisers in New York City and has another scheduled in San Francisco. Harris is reportedly considering either a 2026 run for California governor or another presidential bid in 2028.[1] Recent polling indicates she maintains the highest favorability rating among potential Democratic candidates.[4]

### Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez

Political analyst Nate Silver made headlines in April 2025 by predicting that Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is the most likely candidate to top the 2028 Democratic presidential ticket.[4] This assessment is based on several factors:

1. A Yale University poll showing AOC with the second-highest favorability rating among Democrats, just behind Kamala Harris[4]
2. Her "fervent support" base, which Silver and former FiveThirtyEight podcast host Galen Druke believe will be crucial in a crowded primary field[4]
3. Her recent activities, including the "Fighting Oligarchy Tour" with Sen. Bernie Sanders, which observers interpret as laying groundwork for a presidential run[4]

As Druke notes, "Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has broad appeal across the Democratic Party... equally important is the fact that she has very fervent support."[4]

### Other Notable Potential Candidates

Several current governors are positioned as possible contenders:

- **Tim Walz**: The Minnesota Governor, who served as the Democrats' vice presidential nominee in 2024, continues to build his national profile[1]
- **Wes Moore**: Maryland's Governor has been mentioned among potential candidates with rising national profiles[1]
- **Gretchen Whitmer**: Michigan's Governor remains influential within the party
- **Gavin Newsom**: California's Governor has long been considered a potential presidential candidate
- **Josh Shapiro**: Pennsylvania's Governor represents a crucial swing state

## Key Factors That Will Shape the Race

### 1. 2026 Midterm Elections

The results of the 2026 midterm elections will have a "major impact on the shape of the next White House race."[1] Governors and members of Congress who perform well or help their party make gains will be better positioned for 2028.

### 2. Candidate Positioning Within Party Factions

The Democratic Party contains multiple ideological wings, from progressives to moderates. The ability to appeal across these factions while maintaining enthusiastic support from a core base will be crucial. AOC's apparent broad appeal combined with fervent support represents a potentially powerful combination.[4]

### 3. Fundraising Capacity and Early Organization

Candidates who demonstrate fundraising prowess and build early organizational infrastructure will have advantages. Harris's headlining of major DNC fundraisers suggests she is maintaining and developing her donor network.[1]

### 4. Perceived Electability Against the Republican Nominee

With Trump ineligible to run in 2028, Democrats will be assessing which of their potential nominees matches up best against likely Republican contenders.

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on current information as of May 2025, here's a probabilistic assessment of the leading contenders:

| Candidate | Key Strengths | Key Challenges | Probability |
|-----------|---------------|----------------|------------|
| Kamala Harris | Highest favorability rating, VP experience, national network | Electoral defeat in 2024 | 25-30% |
| Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez | Strong favorability, fervent support base, generational change | May face electability questions in general election | 20-25% |
| Pete Buttigieg | Executive experience, articulate communicator | Limited electoral success beyond cabinet role | 10-15% |
| Governors (Whitmer, Newsom, Shapiro, etc.) | Executive experience, geographic diversity | Need to build national profiles | 25-30% combined |
| Other candidates | Diverse backgrounds and experiences | Lower name recognition | 10-15% |

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors create uncertainty in this forecast:

1. We are still more than three years from the nomination process
2. The political landscape could shift dramatically following the 2026 midterms
3. Unexpected candidates could emerge
4. Current polling reflects name recognition as much as genuine support
5. The Republican nominee will influence Democratic voters' priorities

The 2028 Democratic nomination remains fluid, with multiple viable contenders. While Harris and Ocasio-Cortez appear to have early advantages in polling and analyst predictions, gubernatorial success in 2026 could propel state executives into stronger positions. As Democratic strategist Moyer observed, the race is "wide open, and it won't be long before we see clear maneuvering from a litany of candidates."[1]
