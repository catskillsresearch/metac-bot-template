## Key Factual Information as of July 25, 2024

- **Russian Advances:** By early July 2024, Russian forces had advanced into the easternmost parts of Chasiv Yar, specifically capturing the Kanal district. Ukrainian forces confirmed a tactical withdrawal from this area due to untenable defensive positions and heavy destruction[3][4][5].
- **Ukrainian Defense:** Despite the loss of the Kanal district, Ukrainian forces maintain defensive positions in other parts of Chasiv Yar. The city remains strategically significant, and its complete capture would jeopardize Ukrainian control of larger hubs in Donetsk oblast[3][4].
- **Nature of Fighting:** The battle for Chasiv Yar is characterized by intense, attritional fighting. Russian forces are attacking from multiple directions, including from Toretsk in the south and Kalynivka in the north, but progress has been incremental[2].
- **Partial Control:** As of July 25, 2024, Russia controls only part of Chasiv Yar (the Kanal district), not the entire city. Ukrainian sources and independent assessments confirm that the remainder of the city is still contested[1][2][3][4][5].
- **Strategic Context:** The Russian military is attempting to press its advantage before Ukrainian forces receive substantial new Western military aid. However, the front remains fluid, and neither side has achieved a decisive breakthrough[1][2][3].
- **Verification Source:** The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) Ukraine Interactive War Map is the authoritative source for determining control at the specified coordinates.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- The situation is highly dynamic, and control of Chasiv Yar could change rapidly due to ongoing offensives, reinforcements, or shifts in operational tempo.
- The impact of new Western military aid to Ukraine, which is "trickling to the front line," could affect the balance of power in the coming months.
- As of July 25, 2024, there is no evidence that Russia has achieved full control of Chasiv Yar, but continued pressure and attritional tactics could alter the situation before October 1, 2024.

## Summary

As of July 25, 2024, Russia controls the eastern Kanal district of Chasiv Yar, but the remainder of the city remains contested. The outcome by October 1, 2024, will depend on the evolving front-line situation, the effectiveness of Ukrainian defenses, and the impact of incoming Western aid. The ISW map will provide the definitive status at the specified coordinates on the resolution date.
