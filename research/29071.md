# Forecasting the Resolution of Pork Dynasty Inc.'s Recall

Based on available information as of October 2024, I'll analyze factors relevant to forecasting whether the USDA recall of Pork Dynasty Inc.'s Ready-to-Eat Fried Pork Skin Products will be closed before December 31, 2024.

## Current Status of the Recall

The recall in question involves Pork Dynasty Inc., a Houston, Texas establishment, which recalled approximately 469 pounds of ready-to-eat fried pork skin products due to misbranding and an undeclared allergen (soy)[2]. The recall specifically affects:

- 3.5-oz. plastic bags containing "Texarones Born in The Philippines – Made in Texas Fried Out Pork Fat with Attached Skin Spicy"
- 2.5-oz. plastic bags containing "Texarones Born in The Philippines– Made in Texas Fried Pork Skin Spicy"[2]

This recall was initially issued in September 2024 but was subsequently expanded in October 2024 to include additional product distribution in Oklahoma that was not previously listed[2].

## Relevant Factors for Forecasting

### 1. Nature of the Recall

This recall falls under the category of "Misbranding/Undeclared Allergen"[2]. Allergen-related recalls are typically considered serious due to potential health risks to consumers with allergies, but they may be resolved more quickly than recalls involving pathogens or foreign materials if the company can effectively:
- Remove affected products from the market
- Correct labeling issues
- Implement proper controls to prevent recurrence

### 2. Scope and Distribution

The recall involves a relatively small quantity (469 pounds) of product[2]. The limited volume might facilitate a faster resolution compared to larger-scale recalls. However, the fact that the recall was expanded to include additional distribution points in Oklahoma suggests the company may still be identifying the full scope of affected product distribution.

### 3. USDA Recall Process

The USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) oversees recalls of meat, poultry, and egg products[1]. While specific timelines for closing recalls are not standardized, the process typically involves:
- Verification that affected products have been removed from the market
- Confirmation that appropriate corrective actions have been implemented
- Assessment of the effectiveness of the recall

## Limitations in Available Information

Several key pieces of information that would help forecast the resolution timeline are not available in the search results:

1. Historical data on the average duration of similar USDA recalls
2. Specific information about Pork Dynasty Inc.'s recall response capabilities
3. Any complications or challenges in the recall execution
4. FSIS's current assessment of the recall effectiveness

## Conclusion

Based on the limited information available, it's difficult to make a definitive forecast about whether this recall will be closed before December 31, 2024. The relatively small volume of product involved (469 pounds) and the nature of the violation (undeclared allergen) suggest that resolution could be achievable within a few months if the company acts promptly and effectively. However, the recent expansion of the recall to include additional distribution points indicates that the full scope may still be under investigation, which could potentially extend the timeline.

For more accurate forecasting, additional information about FSIS's typical timeline for closing allergen-related recalls and Pork Dynasty Inc.'s specific recall response would be valuable.
