### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Historically, major escalations between the U.S. and Iran (e.g., after the 2020 Soleimani killing) resulted in direct, attributable Iranian missile attacks on U.S. bases in Iraq. Iran publicly claimed responsibility for those attacks, which met the criteria for attribution.
- In June 2025, after U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, Iran retaliated with missile strikes on U.S. bases, but these were directed at Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar (publicly acknowledged by Iran). Initial reports suggested a missile also targeted the Ain al-Assad base in Iraq, but U.S. officials later denied such an attack had taken place[1][2].
- As of June 24, 2025, a ceasefire between Israel and Iran has been announced and is in effect[2].

### Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Metric

- The U.S. State Department and Pentagon have ordered and facilitated the evacuation of non-emergency personnel from Iraq and the region, reflecting a high perceived risk as of mid-June 2025[1].
- President Trump and U.S. officials have signaled both a readiness to respond to Iranian actions and a desire to de-escalate following the ceasefire[2][3].
- Iran’s public statements frame their retaliatory actions as concluded responses to U.S. strikes, and Iranian leadership has made statements indicating a preference not to widen the conflict further, barring new provocations[2].

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Le Monde: Reporting on Iran’s retaliation and missile attacks against U.S. bases in Qatar and claimed attacks in Iraq[1].
- Institute for the Study of War (ISW): Details on both the U.S. strike, Iran’s response, and the subsequent ceasefire[2].
- CSIS: Analysis of the strategic implications and possible future directions for the conflict[3].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- Attribution: The resolution requires either explicit Iranian acknowledgment or unequivocal attribution to Iranian forces—actions by proxies alone do not count unless clearly tied to Iran’s armed forces or intelligence.
- Ceasefire Durability: Ceasefires in the region are frequently violated, and sudden escalations are possible if a triggering event occurs.
- Reporting Discrepancies: Initial reports of attacks often differ from later official accounts, as evidenced by the Ain al-Assad incident, which was denied by U.S. authorities[2].

### Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the current ceasefire between Israel and Iran, Iran’s recent retaliatory actions being directed outside Iraq, and the lack of explicit Iranian attacks on U.S. sites in Iraq as of June 24, 2025, the probability of Iran conducting a direct, attributable kinetic attack on U.S. sites in Iraq before August 1, 2025, appears **lower than during the immediate post-strike crisis period**. However, risks persist due to the fragility of the ceasefire, the high alert status of U.S. forces, and the potential for rapid escalation if the ceasefire breaks down.

**Adjusted probability estimate:**  
- **20–30%** chance of an Iranian-attributed kinetic attack on U.S. sites in Iraq before August 1, 2025.  
This reflects a non-negligible but reduced risk compared to previous days, contingent on ceasefire stability and absence of new provocations.
