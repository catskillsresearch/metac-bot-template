## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- **Wildfire Liability and Financial Exposure:**  
  The August 2023 Maui wildfires resulted in over 100 deaths and extensive property damage. HECO has admitted that downed powerlines initially caused the fires. The company faces significant legal claims, with estimates of liabilities exceeding $4.9 billion—far surpassing its insurance and equity base[2][5]. The company’s stock price fell sharply after the fires, reflecting investor concerns about solvency[2].

- **Credit and Financing Constraints:**  
  HECO’s credit rating remains under negative watch, and it has lost access to commercial paper and unsecured financing markets[1][3]. In response, HECO is seeking to establish a “bankruptcy remote” special purpose entity (SPE) for its accounts receivable, a structure often used by companies at risk of bankruptcy to protect lenders[3]. However, experts note that such structures are not “bankruptcy proof” and are typically a sign of distress[3].

- **Legislative and Regulatory Developments:**  
  The Hawaii Public Utilities Commission approved a $190 million resilience program to harden the grid, but this is small compared to the wildfire liabilities[2]. Legislative efforts to provide a direct bailout or authorize special bonds to cover wildfire claims have stalled, leaving HECO without a clear public-sector backstop as of May 2024[3][5].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- **Settlement Negotiations:**  
  As of July 2024, reports indicate that a pending $4 billion settlement—including contributions from HECO, Charter Communications, and government agencies—could allow HECO to avoid bankruptcy[2]. The news of this tentative agreement caused HECO’s stock price to rebound by 30%[2]. However, the settlement is not finalized, and details remain confidential.

- **Company Statements:**  
  HECO’s leadership has publicly stated that “all of our strategies are to avoid going into bankruptcy,” and that bankruptcy is not considered the best outcome for Hawaii[4]. In its August 2023 8-K filing, the company emphasized its goal to remain financially strong and not to restructure via bankruptcy[4].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- **SEC Filings:**  
  The definitive indicator for bankruptcy would be an 8-K filing from HECO (CIK 46207) stating an intent to file for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 or Chapter 7[4].

- **News and Regulatory Reports:**  
  Bloomberg, Civil Beat, and Renewable Energy World have provided regular updates on settlement talks, legislative actions, and company statements[2][3][4].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- **Settlement Uncertainty:**  
  The $4 billion settlement is not finalized. If talks collapse or the settlement is insufficient, bankruptcy remains a possibility[2].

- **Legislative Inaction:**  
  The failure of bailout legislation increases HECO’s risk, but the company is actively pursuing alternative financing and settlements[3][5].

- **Precedent:**  
  Other utilities (e.g., PG&E, Brazos Electric) have filed for bankruptcy under similar circumstances, but HECO’s situation is complicated by its centrality to Hawaii’s grid and ongoing negotiations[2][5].

## Summary Table: Key Factors Affecting Bankruptcy Risk

| Factor                        | Status as of July 2024                | Implication for Bankruptcy Risk      |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Wildfire liability            | $4.9B+ (est.), far exceeds insurance  | High risk if not settled             |
| Access to credit              | Severely constrained                  | Increases bankruptcy risk            |
| Legislative bailout           | Stalled/failed                        | Increases bankruptcy risk            |
| Settlement talks              | $4B tentative deal in progress        | May avert bankruptcy if finalized    |
| Company statements            | Committed to avoiding bankruptcy      | Reduces risk if alternatives succeed |

## Conclusion

As of July 24, 2024, Hawaiian Electric Company faces severe financial distress due to wildfire liabilities, limited access to credit, and failed legislative bailouts. However, a pending $4 billion settlement could allow the company to avoid bankruptcy if finalized. The company’s leadership continues to pursue alternatives to bankruptcy, and no SEC filing has indicated an intent to file as of the knowledge cutoff. The situation remains fluid, with the final outcome dependent on the success of settlement negotiations and any last-minute legislative or regulatory interventions.
