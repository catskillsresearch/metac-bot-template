## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- **Pedro Sánchez (Spain):**
  - Sánchez’s approval rating has been relatively stable since 2019, never dipping below 42% according to Gallup data as of July 2023[4].
  - In February 2025, Spain’s state-run CIS poll showed Sánchez’s PSOE gaining 5.3 points since January, the largest monthly increase in a year, positioning his party as the leading force with 33.4% support[2].
  - Recent polling reflects a positive trend for Sánchez, with stable or rising support in early 2025.

- **Recep Tayyip Erdoğan (Turkey):**
  - As of March 2025, global leader approval ratings compiled by Statista, based on Morning Consult data, did not place Erdoğan among the leaders with notably high approval; top leaders such as India’s Modi had approval near 80%, but Erdoğan’s typical numbers in recent years have been lower, often in the 40% range or below[3].
  - No recent (2025) country-specific approval rating for Erdoğan is directly cited, but trends suggest a relatively flat or declining trajectory amid Turkey’s ongoing economic challenges and political polarization.

## 2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- **Sánchez:** 
  - Benefited from a recent surge in polling, attributed to his coalition’s resilience and the opposition’s struggles, particularly the declining support for PP and the rise of Vox consolidating the right-wing vote[2].
  - No major policy missteps or scandals have surfaced in early 2025 that would significantly erode public support.

- **Erdoğan:**
  - Turkey continues to face economic headwinds, including inflation and currency instability, which have previously affected Erdoğan’s popularity.
  - No major positive developments reported in the search results that would imply a sudden surge in Erdoğan’s approval heading into mid-2025.

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- **Morning Consult Global Leader Approval Tracker**: The official resolution source, providing updated monthly approval ratings for world leaders.
- **CIS (Centro de Investigaciones Sociológicas)**: Spain’s primary public polling body, referenced for local trends[2].
- **Statista**: Aggregates and presents Morning Consult’s global leader approval data[3].

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- **Polling Methodology**: Morning Consult uses a seven-day moving average among adults in each country; sudden events near the end of June could shift the numbers.
- **Comparability**: Public perceptions and polling environments differ between Spain and Turkey, potentially affecting direct comparison.
- **Data Gaps**: The latest available approval numbers specifically for Erdoğan in 2025 are not provided in the search results; inference is based on established trends and Statista’s summary.
- **Volatility**: Political environments can shift rapidly, especially in Turkey. A late-breaking event could alter the forecast.

## Probabilistic Assessment

Given Sánchez’s recent upward trend and stable approval, coupled with the lack of positive developments for Erdoğan and the latter’s generally lower international ranking, it is more probable than not that Sánchez will have a higher approval rating than Erdoğan in the Morning Consult tracker checked after July 1, 2025. However, the probability is not overwhelming due to the inherent uncertainties and potential for unforeseen events.

**Estimated probability: 65% Yes, 35% No.**
