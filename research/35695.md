### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Anthropic has rapidly increased its valuation, raising $3.5 billion at a $61.5 billion valuation in March 2025, up from $18.4 billion in May 2024[3].
- The company has attracted major investments from Amazon ($4 billion) and Google ($2 billion), but these are private funding rounds, not public offerings[1][5].
- Anthropic remains a private company, and its stock is not available to the public[1][3][5].

### Recent Announcements and Policies

- As of early March 2025, there have been no official announcements from Anthropic regarding plans to go public or initiate an IPO[1][3][5].
- IPO watchlists and industry analyses for 2025 explicitly state that Anthropic is not expected to IPO in 2025, and there is no indication of imminent plans[2].

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Anthropic’s official news section contains no announcement of IPO plans as of March 6, 2025.
- No S-1 filing for Anthropic is available in public SEC records up to this date.
- Multiple financial and industry news sources confirm the absence of IPO plans[1][2][3][5].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- The rapidly evolving AI sector means plans could change quickly, but as of the cutoff date, no public announcement has been made.

### Conclusion
