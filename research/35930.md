# Forecasting DOGE's Agency Efficiency Leaderboard Rankings for April 2025

Based on available information as of March 14, 2025, here is an analysis to help forecast whether the Department of State will be ranked highest in "Least Total Savings" on DOGE's Agency Efficiency Leaderboard by April 1, 2025.

## Current Status of DOGE's Efficiency Leaderboard

The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) launched its "Agency Efficiency Leaderboard" in February 2025 to track and compare cost-cutting measures across federal agencies[1][3]. As of late February 2025, DOGE claimed to have identified approximately $65 billion in total estimated savings across government agencies[3][5].

The leaderboard ranks federal agencies in two categories:
- **Most Savings**: Agencies that have achieved the highest cost reductions
- **Least Savings**: Agencies that have achieved the lowest cost reductions

According to the most recent available data (February 2025), the Department of State was ranked last in terms of total savings, placing it at the top of the "Least Savings" category[1]. The other agencies with low savings included the Department of Commerce (DOC), Department of Energy (DOE), Department of Transportation (DOT), and National Institutes of Health (NIH)[1].

## Department of State's Current Position

As of February 25, 2025, the Department of State was specifically identified as the federal agency with the least total savings on the DOGE leaderboard[1]. This means it was ranked #1 in the "Least Savings" category at that time. The leaderboard is publicly accessible at doge.gov/savings[2].

In contrast, the agencies with the most savings were:
1. Department of Education
2. General Services Administration (GSA)
3. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
4. Department of Labor (DOL)
5. Office of Personnel Management (OPM)[1][3][5]

The Department of Education reportedly achieved the highest savings, with nearly $900 million in canceled contracts and training grants[4].

## Factors That Could Affect Rankings by April 2025

Several factors could potentially influence whether the Department of State remains at the top of the "Least Savings" category by April 1, 2025:

1. **Ongoing Efficiency Initiatives**: DOGE has been actively identifying and terminating contracts across agencies. The leaderboard showed over 2,200 terminated contracts as of February 2025[1].

2. **Competitive Nature of the Leaderboard**: DOGE explicitly designed the leaderboard to create competition between agencies. As stated by DOGE on February 25, 2025: "Introducing the Agency Efficiency Leaderboard. The competition is on!"[1]

3. **Reporting Delays**: DOGE acknowledged that there may be discrepancies in reporting, noting that "the FPDS posting of final termination notices can have up to a one-month lag"[3]. This could affect rankings if recent terminations haven't been fully processed.

4. **Methodology Considerations**: A White House official stated they're using a "conservative methodology" for calculating savings, which could affect how agencies are ranked over time[5].

## Limitations in Forecasting

There are several limitations to consider when forecasting the April 1, 2025 rankings:

1. **Verification Challenges**: ABC News reported that it's "impossible to verify" DOGE's claimed savings figures independently[5].

2. **Rapidly Changing Situation**: The efficiency initiative is relatively new, having been launched in early 2025, and rankings could change quickly as more contracts are reviewed.

3. **Limited Historical Data**: With only a few weeks of leaderboard history available, it's difficult to predict trends in agency rankings.

4. **Potential Policy Changes**: Any new directives from the White House or changes in DOGE's approach could significantly impact agency rankings before April 1.

Based on the available information as of March 14, 2025, the Department of State was ranked at the top of the "Least Savings" category (meaning it had achieved the least cost reductions among federal agencies). Whether it will maintain this position through April 1, 2025 cannot be determined with certainty given the dynamic nature of the initiative.
