### 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The initial (advance) estimate for Q1 2025 real GDP showed a contraction at -0.3% annualized[2].
- The second estimate revised this slightly upward to -0.2%[3][5].
- The contraction in Q1 2025 follows a robust Q4 2024, which posted 2.4% growth[5].
- The last time the U.S. economy contracted before Q1 2025 was in Q1 2022[4].

### 2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- No new major fiscal or monetary policy changes have been announced between the second and third estimates that would materially alter the data for Q1 2025.
- The contraction was attributed to increased imports and decreased government spending, partially offset by improvements in investment, consumer spending, and exports[5].
- The largest positive surprise in the advance estimate was private inventory investment, which added more to GDP than expected[4].

### 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) is the definitive source for GDP data and releases[1].
- Advisor Perspectives and the Atlanta Fed provide detailed analyses and context for GDP revisions and the underlying economic dynamics[3][4][5].

### 4. Limitations and Uncertainties in Measurement

- The third estimate incorporates more complete and revised source data, but typically only makes modest adjustments unless there are significant late-arriving data, particularly in inventories or trade.
- The advance and second estimates already incorporated most major indicators; large positive revisions in the third estimate are rare unless a substantial misestimation is uncovered[5].
- There is some residual uncertainty due to the finalization of trade and inventory data, but no indications from recent reports suggest a substantial positive swing is in the pipeline[4].

### Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the current trajectory:
- Both the advance and second estimates are negative, with a trend toward slightly less contraction.
- The third estimate is more likely to result in a small further upward revision, but a swing from -0.2% to above 0% would be unusual without significant new data.
- The probability that the third estimate will show real GDP growth above 0% (and thus resolve "Yes") is low, likely in the 10-20% range based on historical revision patterns and the lack of evidence for a major positive adjustment.

### Conclusion

Based on all available information as of June 5, 2025, it is probable that the third estimate for Q1 2025 annualized real GDP growth will remain negative, though potentially slightly less so, and will not cross into positive territory.
