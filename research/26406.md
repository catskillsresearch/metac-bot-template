# Forecasting COVID-19 Hospitalizations: Summer 2024 Outlook

To forecast whether the maximum weekly rate of COVID-19 hospitalizations in the United States between June 1 and August 31, 2024, will exceed 3.5 per 100,000 people, I've analyzed available data and trends as of July 2024.

## Current Hospitalization Trends

As of late April 2024, the CDC reported 5,615 new hospital admissions related to COVID-19 in the United States for the most recent week of data, representing a 14.4% decrease from the previous reporting period[4]. This declining trend provides a baseline from which to project summer hospitalization rates.

The most recent hospitalization rate data available in the search results indicates a rate of 2.9 per 100,000 population, though this specific figure is from older CDC data and may not reflect current conditions[2].

## Comparative Disease Burden

Research published in May 2024 comparing COVID-19 and influenza hospitalizations during the 2023-2024 fall/winter season found that:

- COVID-19 resulted in nearly twice as many hospitalizations as seasonal influenza during this period[5]
- Patients hospitalized for COVID-19 had a higher risk of death compared to those hospitalized for influenza (adjusted death rate of 5.70% vs. 4.24% at 30 days)[5]
- The mortality risk for COVID-19 hospitalizations remained consistent before and during the JN.1-predominant era[5]

This data suggests that despite widespread vaccination and prior infection, COVID-19 continues to cause significant hospitalization burden compared to other respiratory illnesses.

## Emerging Variants

The emergence of the KP.2 variant (part of the "FLiRT" variant family) is a significant factor that could influence summer hospitalization rates. As of May 11, 2024, KP.2 represented approximately 28.2% of sequenced variants according to CDC's variant proportions Nowcast. These new variants have prompted concerns about a potential summer COVID surge.

## Data Collection Considerations

An important limitation to note is that as of July 2023, hospitals are no longer required to report data on COVID-19 hospital admissions and hospital capacity[3]. This change in reporting requirements may affect data quality and completeness for the summer 2024 period.

The CDC continues to monitor COVID-19 hospitalizations through its RESP-NET surveillance system, which covers approximately 8-10% of the U.S. population across multiple states. This system will be the source of the hospitalization rate data used to determine whether the threshold of 3.5 per 100,000 is exceeded.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors create uncertainty in forecasting summer 2024 hospitalization rates:

1. The impact of emerging variants like KP.2 on disease severity and transmissibility
2. Potential changes in population immunity from vaccination and prior infection
3. Seasonal behavioral patterns that may affect transmission
4. Changes in testing and reporting practices
5. Variations in healthcare-seeking behavior

## Conclusion

Based on available data, COVID-19 continues to cause significant hospitalizations in the United States, though recent trends showed a decline as of April 2024. The emergence of new variants like KP.2 presents a potential risk factor for increased transmission during summer 2024. Historical patterns and current data suggest that exceeding the 3.5 per 100,000 threshold is possible but would likely require a substantial increase from the declining rates observed in spring 2024.

Monitoring the CDC's RESP-NET dashboard will provide the authoritative data needed to track this metric through the summer months.
