## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The long-term real (inflation-adjusted) annual return for the S&P 500, including dividends, has averaged about 6-7% per year over the past century.
- As of June 2020, the S&P 500 was in the midst of a rapid recovery from the COVID-19 crash but remained at relatively high valuation levels by historical standards.
- U.S. monetary policy was extremely accommodative, with the Federal Reserve maintaining near-zero interest rates and engaging in large-scale asset purchases.
- Corporate profit margins were elevated, and the economic outlook was uncertain due to the ongoing pandemic.

## 2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- The U.S. government and Federal Reserve implemented unprecedented fiscal and monetary stimulus in response to COVID-19, supporting asset prices and economic growth.
- As of early 2022 (continuing trends from 2020), professional forecasters predicted higher returns on financial assets, with the S&P 500 expected to return an annual average of 6.73% over the next 10 years, up from previous estimates[5].
- Community and analyst forecasts for the S&P 500’s real return over 2022-2031 generally ranged from 3% to 6% per year, reflecting concerns about high valuations and lower expected returns compared to historical averages[1][4].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia's Survey of Professional Forecasters (Q1 2022) projected an annual-average total return (likely nominal, but in line with real return expectations after incorporating inflation) of 6.73% for the S&P 500 over the next decade[5].
- The Metaculus community forecast in early 2022 placed the median expected real return for 2022-2031 at about 4.85% per year, with a 25th-75th percentile range of roughly 0.8% to 9.2% per year[1].
- Finimize, reflecting the consensus among analysts, suggested a likely real return in the 3%-6% range[4].

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- The actual real return is highly sensitive to future inflation, which could deviate from current expectations.
- High starting valuations as of 2020 historically have been associated with lower subsequent real returns.
- Major macroeconomic or geopolitical shocks, changes in monetary or fiscal policy, or structural changes in market dynamics could dramatically affect realized returns.
- Measurement uncertainty exists due to potential revisions in Consumer Price Index methodology.

## 5. Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Based on the above, as of June 2020, the best probabilistic estimate for the S&P 500’s annual real return over 2022-2031 would be:

- Median (most likely): 4% to 5% per year (geometric mean, inflation-adjusted)
- Plausible range (interquartile): 3% to 6% per year

Returns significantly above or below this range are possible but less likely, given starting valuations and economic conditions.
