### Key Factual Information

- The most recent United Nations OCHA "Reported Impact Snapshot" for the Gaza Strip, published on March 4, 2025, reports **48,405 Palestinian fatalities** in Gaza since October 7, 2023[1][5].
- This figure is based on data from the Ministry of Health (MoH) in Gaza, as cited by OCHA[5].
- A subsequent UNRWA situation report dated March 11, 2025, cites a slightly higher figure (48,503 fatalities), but this is not an OCHA "impact snapshot" and thus does not meet the resolution criteria[4].

#### Historical Trends and Current Status
- Fatality numbers have steadily increased since October 2023, with OCHA regularly updating its impact snapshots based on MoH data.
- The March 4, 2025, snapshot is the last available before April 1, 2025, as no newer OCHA impact snapshot is found in the search results[1].

#### Recent Announcements/Policies
- No major policy changes or announcements affecting the reporting of fatalities are noted in the period immediately preceding April 1, 2025.

#### Authoritative Sources for Verification
- The OCHA "Reported Impact Snapshot" for Gaza (March 4, 2025) is the authoritative source for this metric[1][5].

#### Limitations and Uncertainties
- Fatality figures are based on the Gaza MoH as cited by OCHA and may be subject to later verification or revision.
- If OCHA resumes posting new impact snapshots after March 4 but before April 1, 2025, those would provide updated figures, but no such update is found in the available sources.

### Conclusion

**The cumulative number of reported Palestinian fatalities in Gaza, as stated in the most recent OCHA impact snapshot before April 1, 2025, is 48,405.**
