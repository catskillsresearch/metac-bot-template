## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- After the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza in 2005, there has been no formal Israeli government established in the territory. Since the October 2023 invasion, Israel has exerted significant military control over parts of Gaza, but this has remained de facto and not the establishment of a formal civilian government[2].
- As of May 2025, the Israeli government has approved plans to capture and potentially occupy all of Gaza for an indefinite period. These plans include a "sustained physical presence" and possible annexation, but do not yet constitute the formal establishment of a government or official annexation as defined by the resolution criteria[1][2].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- On May 5, 2025, Israeli cabinet ministers approved a plan to capture the entire Gaza Strip and remain in the territory indefinitely. The plan involves expanded military operations and possible forcible displacement of Palestinians[2].
- Amnesty International and other observers have reported that Israel's plans now include establishing a "sustained physical presence" and possibly annexing parts of Gaza, but these remain at the planning or approval stage and have not yet resulted in formal governmental structures or legal annexation[1].
- International actors, including the United Arab Emirates, have discussed provisional international administration for Gaza, indicating that Israeli direct governmental control is not the only scenario under consideration[1].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Amnesty International (May 2025) reports on Israeli plans for expanded military presence and possible annexation, but no confirmation of established civilian government[1].
- PBS/AP (May 2025) provides detailed coverage of Israeli cabinet decisions regarding the capture and indefinite occupation of Gaza, but no evidence of formal governmental establishment or annexation at this time[2].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- The Israeli government's intentions may change rapidly, especially in response to developments on the ground or international diplomatic pressure.
- Information on internal Israeli policy deliberations may not be fully available to the public.
- Formal annexation or government establishment could occur quickly if policy shifts.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the current trajectory—recent cabinet approval for capturing and remaining in Gaza, open discussion of annexation and prolonged occupation, but no formal government establishment or annexation as of May 2025—the probability that Israel will establish direct governmental control of the Gaza Strip (as defined by the resolution criteria) at some point in 2025 appears to be **moderate but less than 50%**. The likelihood is increased by recent political moves, but substantial international opposition, the complexity of governance, and lack of precedent since 2005 are significant dampening factors.

**Forecast:**  
- Probability Israel establishes direct governmental control of the Gaza Strip in 2025: **30-45%**.
