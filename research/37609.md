### 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Florida gubernatorial hopefuls generally announce campaigns well before the primary to build momentum, raise funds, and secure endorsements.
- Francis Suarez, Miami’s term-limited mayor, has repeatedly expressed interest in running for governor, but as of June 5, 2025, he has not formally announced a campaign[1][2][3].
- Suarez faces a significant obstacle in the form of Donald Trump's endorsement of Byron Donalds, a rival Republican, which has historically been decisive in Florida GOP primaries[1][2].
- Suarez has acknowledged the challenge Trump's support poses, stating Trump's involvement “makes it hard” for other Republicans[1][2].

### 2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- The most recent public statements (early May 2025) have Suarez still considering a run, but openly doubting its viability due to Trump’s endorsement of Donalds[1][2].
- No credible media outlet or official source has reported that Suarez has launched a gubernatorial campaign as of June 5, 2025[1][2][3][4][5].

### 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Axios, Florida Politics, and Wikipedia all confirm (as of June 2025) Suarez has not announced a gubernatorial candidacy[1][2][3].
- Fox News and YouTube interviews show Suarez continues to discuss the possibility but remains noncommittal and acknowledges the obstacles[4][5].

### 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- Suarez is not bound by any legal or political deadline before July 1, 2025, and could theoretically announce at any time.
- Unforeseen developments (e.g., withdrawal of endorsed rivals, sudden political shifts) could change the calculus.
- Public statements may not fully reflect private deliberations or strategic timing.

### Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given:
- No announcement as of June 5, 2025
- Repeated public hedging and acknowledgment of obstacles
- Strong, early Trump endorsement for a rival

**It is highly unlikely (estimated probability: <10%) that Francis Suarez will announce his candidacy for Florida governor before July 1, 2025.** However, the probability is not exactly zero due to the inherent unpredictability of politics and the possibility of late-breaking developments.
