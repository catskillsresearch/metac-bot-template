## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Since the introduction of the modern budget process in 1976, there have been 20 funding gaps, but only four major shutdowns that lasted more than one business day and resulted in significant furloughs[1].
- Shutdowns have occurred under both divided and unified government, with the 2018-2019 and early 2018 shutdowns happening during the previous Trump administration despite Republican control of Congress and the presidency. Intra-party divisions have played a critical role in triggering shutdowns even when one party holds legislative majorities[4].
- As of June 2025, the US government narrowly avoided a shutdown in March 2025 through a six-month continuing resolution that funds the government only until September 30, 2025. The deal was contentious, passing the House along party lines and only after difficult negotiations in the Senate[5].
- The current political landscape features a Republican trifecta, but deep ideological splits—especially within the House GOP and its Freedom Caucus—continue to pose challenges for stable budget negotiations[4].

## Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- The most recent continuing resolution (March 2025) avoided a shutdown but required cross-party support in the Senate and included notable spending reductions. This extension only delays, rather than resolves, underlying partisan disagreements over federal spending[5].
- Ongoing negotiations for the next fiscal year's appropriations will come to a head by September 30, 2025, and similar standoffs should be expected annually until the 2028 election unless there is a significant change in congressional dynamics[5].
- Forecasts as of late June 2025 estimate the chance of a government shutdown in 2025 at approximately 32%, reflecting persistent but not overwhelming risk[2].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB) provides in-depth background on the shutdown process and its history[1].
- The US House of Representatives History, Art & Archives maintains a record of past funding gaps and shutdowns.
- The US Office of Personnel Management (OPM) documents shutdown furlough guidance and maintains agency contingency plans.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- Annual budget negotiations introduce multiple risk points for a shutdown before the 2028 election.
- The outcome of the 2026 midterm elections could shift the balance of power in Congress, altering shutdown risk.
- Factors such as economic downturns, unforeseen crises, or shifts in party unity could significantly affect the probability of a shutdown.
- The technical definition for this forecast requires a shutdown that triggers federal employee furloughs, not just a brief funding lapse.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Taking into account the historical frequency, recent political dynamics, the unresolved nature of budget disputes, and current probabilistic forecasts (~32% for 2025 alone), it is reasonable to assign a moderate-to-high likelihood (estimated 55–65%) that at least one qualifying US government shutdown will occur before the 2028 presidential election, especially given that multiple budget deadlines will occur and current intra-party divides remain unresolved[2][4][5].
