# Forecasting Trump's Economic Approval Rating for June 25, 2025

As of May 28, 2025, I've analyzed available data to forecast President Trump's net approval on the economy by June 25, 2025, according to the Silver Bulletin tracker. This analysis examines current trends, recent economic policies, and historical patterns to inform our projection.

## Current Approval Ratings

President Trump's overall job approval has remained relatively stable in recent months, with Gallup reporting a 43% approval rating as of May 23, 2025, which has held steady for three consecutive months[1][4]. However, this overall figure masks significant variation in approval across different policy areas.

Specifically regarding economic issues:
- The Marquette Law School Poll indicates disapproval of Trump's handling of both tariffs and the economy[2]
- Gallup's May 2025 polling reveals most Americans believe the economy is worsening[4]
- Pew Research (from April 2025) reported 59% disapproval of the administration's tariff increases, with only 39% approving[5]

These indicators suggest Trump's net economic approval is currently in negative territory.

## Recent Economic Policies

Several recent economic policy decisions are likely influencing public opinion:

1. **Tariff Implementation**: On April 2, 2025, Trump announced sweeping new tariffs affecting nearly all U.S. trading partners, which triggered market volatility[5]

2. **Selective Tariff Adjustments**: On April 9, 2025, the administration paused tariffs on most countries but increased rates specifically on China[5]

3. **Gulf Region Agreements**: During May 2025, Trump announced trade and investment agreements during a diplomatic trip to the Arab Gulf region, which may positively affect economic sentiment[4]

## Partisan Divide

The approval ratings show extreme polarization:
- 90% of Republicans approve of Trump's job performance
- Only 4% of Democrats approve
- 33% of independents approve, down from 46% in January 2025[4]

This partisan divide is likely to persist through June, with economic approval following similar patterns.

## Projection Analysis

Based on the available data, Trump's net economic approval appears to be negative. The most specific economic policy polling shows 59% disapproval vs. 39% approval of tariffs (a -20% net rating)[5]. While the overall job approval has stabilized, economic concerns persist, with most Americans expressing pessimism about economic direction[4].

Without specific Silver Bulletin historical data to establish trendlines, I must extrapolate from available sources. The substantial disapproval of tariff policies, combined with general economic pessimism, suggests Trump's net economic approval is likely below -5% and potentially in the -10% to -15% range.

**Key factors that could shift this forecast before June 25:**
- New economic data releases (unemployment, inflation, GDP)
- Additional policy announcements or modifications to existing tariffs
- Market performance in June
- International economic developments

## Limitations and Uncertainties

This forecast faces several limitations:
- No specific Silver Bulletin historical data on Trump's economic approval
- Limited polling specifically on economic approval (vs. overall approval)
- Uncertainty about economic developments in the coming month
- Potential methodology differences between polling organizations

Given these constraints and the current data showing significant disapproval of Trump's economic policies, particularly tariffs, the most likely outcome appears to be a net economic approval rating in the negative range, with a substantial possibility of falling below -10%.
