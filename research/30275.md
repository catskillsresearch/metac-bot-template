### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- In October 2024, Kalshi’s CEO announced that the Kalshi app had surpassed Coinbase in the Apple App Store Finance rankings, following the launch of US election betting. At that time, Robinhood was ranked #22, highlighting Kalshi’s surge in popularity during the election cycle[3].
- Robinhood responded by launching its own presidential election contracts in late October 2024, quickly surpassing 100 million contracts traded in less than a week, indicating a substantial increase in user engagement and likely boosting its app ranking[4].

### Recent Announcements and Policies

- Kalshi remains the first federally regulated prediction market in the US, offering a broad range of event contracts and attracting both casual and serious traders, especially during high-interest events like the presidential election[3].
- Robinhood’s entry into the prediction market space, specifically with election contracts, has generated significant trading volume and media attention, further solidifying its position among top finance apps[1][4].

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The Apple App Store’s Finance category rankings, accessible at the specified link, are the definitive source for determining which app outranks the other on December 31, 2024.

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- App Store rankings are highly dynamic and can change rapidly based on user acquisition campaigns, product launches, and seasonal trends.
- The spike in downloads and engagement for both Kalshi and Robinhood is closely tied to the US presidential election, which will have concluded nearly two months before the resolution date. Sustaining high rankings post-election may be challenging, especially for Kalshi, whose core appeal is tied to event-based trading.
- Robinhood’s broader financial services and larger user base may help it maintain a higher ranking after the election cycle’s peak interest wanes.

### Summary

While Kalshi experienced a notable rise in the Finance app rankings during the 2024 election cycle, Robinhood’s rapid adoption of election contracts and its established presence in the finance sector make it challenging for Kalshi to sustain a higher ranking through December 31, 2024. The outcome remains uncertain due to the volatility of app rankings and the potential for post-election user engagement shifts.
