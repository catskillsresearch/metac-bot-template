### Key Factual Information for Forecasting Mauna Loa CO₂ Maximum Daily Average (March 1–25, 2025)

**Historical Trends and Current Status**
- The Mauna Loa Observatory has recorded steadily rising atmospheric CO₂ since 1958, with each March setting a new record high compared to the previous year[2][4].
- The monthly mean for February 2025 was 427.09 ppm (NOAA) and 427.01 ppm (Scripps), up from 424.55 ppm in February 2024, a year-over-year increase of about 2.54 ppm[4].
- Daily averages for early March 2025 (up to March 7) have reached 430.60 ppm, compared to 425.36 ppm on the same date in 2024—a year-over-year increase of 5.24 ppm[2].
- The seasonal cycle at Mauna Loa means CO₂ typically rises from September through May, with daily values in March often exceeding the monthly mean by 1–2 ppm due to short-term atmospheric variability[2][4].

**Recent Announcements and Policies**
- No major policy changes or announcements have been reported that would significantly alter the upward trend in atmospheric CO₂ as of early 2025.
- Despite some reports of fossil fuel emissions plateauing globally, the rate of CO₂ increase at Mauna Loa has accelerated in recent years, with 2023–2024 seeing the largest two-year jump in the record[5].

**Authoritative Sources for Verification**
- NOAA Global Monitoring Laboratory provides daily and monthly CO₂ data for Mauna Loa, updated regularly and available for download[1][3].
- Scripps Institution of Oceanography maintains an independent, parallel record of Mauna Loa CO₂ measurements[4].

**Limitations and Uncertainties**
- Measurement uncertainties at Mauna Loa are minimal due to the observatory’s remote location and rigorous protocols[2].
- Short-term weather patterns or volcanic activity can occasionally cause data gaps or anomalies, but these are rare and typically flagged in the data[2].
- The maximum daily value is subject to short-term atmospheric fluctuations, so the highest daily average in the March 1–25 window may be 1–2 ppm above the monthly mean.

**Summary Table: Key Recent CO₂ Data**

| Date         | Daily Avg CO₂ (ppm) | Year-over-Year Change (ppm) |
|--------------|---------------------|-----------------------------|
| Mar 7, 2025  | 430.60              | +5.24                       |
| Feb 2025 (mean) | 427.09           | +2.54                       |
| Mar 7, 2024  | 425.36              | —                           |

**Forecast Implication**
- Given the early March 2025 daily average of 430.60 ppm and the ongoing seasonal rise, the maximum daily average for March 1–25, 2025, is likely to be at least 430.6 ppm, and could plausibly reach 431.0 ppm or slightly higher, barring unusual short-term events.
