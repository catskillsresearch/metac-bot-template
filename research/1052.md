## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of Q2 2018, Tokyo was the world’s largest city with over 38 million people in its metropolitan area[1].
- The global population exceeded 7 billion in 2018 and was projected to keep growing, though at a declining rate[2][3].
- UN and other sources projected the world population in 2100 at between 10.4–10.9 billion, depending on fertility scenarios[1][2][4].
- Rapid urbanization has characterized the past century, with nearly all future population growth expected to be absorbed by urban centers, especially in Africa and Asia[2][3].

## Reference Cases and Demographic Projections

- No city has ever approached a population of 100 million; the current largest are in the 30–40 million range[1].
- Canadian demographers Hoornweg and Pope, in a 2016 paper, predicted that Lagos, Nigeria could potentially exceed 100 million by 2100 if current trends persist—primarily due to Nigeria’s explosive population growth and urbanization rate[1].
- The UN and Pew Research noted that more than half of global population growth to 2100 will come from just a handful of countries, five of which are in Africa, with Nigeria expected to become the world’s third-most populous country[2][3].

## Key Differences Affecting the Forecast

- **Slowing Global Growth**: Population projections have been revised downward in recent years, reflecting declining fertility rates worldwide[1][2][4].
- **Regional Concentration**: Future growth will be highly uneven, concentrated in parts of sub-Saharan Africa, increasing the likelihood that African cities will dominate future megacity rankings[2][3].
- **Urbanization Patterns**: While global urbanization is expected to continue, the rate and spatial manifestation (e.g., sprawling megaregions vs. hyper-dense single metropolises) remain uncertain[2].
- **Practical Constraints**: Infrastructure, governance, and resource limits could prevent any single city from efficiently absorbing 100 million or more residents[3].
- **Uncertainties in Measurement**: Definitions of metropolitan areas vary widely, and population counts can be sensitive to administrative, political, and methodological factors[5].

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

- The probability of any city exceeding 100 million inhabitants by 2100 is low but plausible, primarily contingent on Nigeria’s (and potentially other African nations’) population growth and urbanization trends continuing unabated.
- If current high-growth trends persist and infrastructure challenges are managed, Lagos or another African city could approach or surpass the 100 million mark, particularly if “city” is defined broadly as a continuous urban agglomeration[1][2][3].
- However, substantial uncertainties—especially regarding infrastructure, environmental constraints, and the possibility of new urban models (polycentric regions, planned cities)—mean this is far from certain. A reasonable forecast would place the probability in the low-to-moderate range, perhaps 10–30% as of 2018, with Lagos the most likely candidate.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- Urban area definitions and census methodologies can significantly affect population estimates[5].
- Projections are sensitive to changes in fertility, migration, economic development, and policy interventions[2][4].
- Environmental, political, or technological disruptions could dramatically alter urbanization trajectories.
