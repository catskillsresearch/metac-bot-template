## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Donald Trump made a state visit to China during his first presidency, but as of June 15, 2025, there is no record of him visiting China during his second term in 2025[1][5].
- The official list of international presidential trips for 2025 does not show a completed or scheduled trip to China before July 1, 2025[1][5].

## Recent Announcements and Policy Developments

- On May 7, 2025, Chinese and US officials met in Geneva, not in China, for high-level discussions, indicating that major diplomatic engagements are currently occurring in third-party countries[2].
- Both Trump and Xi have reportedly extended mutual invitations to visit, but no specific date or official schedule for a Trump visit to China has been announced[2].
- In late May and June 2025, Trump announced significant new tariffs on Chinese imports, escalating trade tensions rather than signaling warming relations that typically precede state visits[2][3][4].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Wikipedia’s up-to-date tracking of Trump’s 2025 presidential trips and his international travel history are the primary authoritative sources; as of June 15, 2025, no China visit is listed[1][5].
- News and government briefings (Xinhua, White House, China Briefing) confirm recent diplomatic meetings, locations, and the lack of a scheduled Trump visit to China[2][3].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- High-level diplomatic visits can sometimes be arranged on short notice, but such events are typically announced at least several days in advance due to logistics and security.
- Mutual invitations exist, which means a visit remains possible, but there is no public evidence of planning, travel, or scheduling for a Trump visit to China before July 1, 2025.
- The ongoing escalation in trade tensions and preference for neutral meeting locations suggest a low probability of a near-term state visit.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

- **Probability Trump visits China before July 1, 2025:** Low (estimated <5%), given no official schedule, ongoing tensions, and recent preference for third-party venues for talks.
- **Resolution:** As of June 15, 2025, all available factual information indicates Trump has not visited nor scheduled a visit to China, making a visit increasingly unlikely as the July 1 deadline approaches.
