# Forecasting the Percentage of IVF-Conceived Babies in the US by 2029

As we look toward 2029, analyzing current trends in assisted reproductive technology (ART) and demographic patterns provides valuable insights for forecasting the percentage of US babies that will be conceived through in vitro fertilization (IVF).

## Current Status and Historical Trends

As of 2021, approximately one out of every 42 babies born in the US (about 2.38%) was conceived using assisted reproductive technologies, with IVF accounting for over 99% of these procedures[1]. This represents 97,128 babies born from ART treatments initiated in 2021[1]. 

The trajectory shows consistent growth:
- From 2012 to 2021, the number of ART procedures more than doubled, with resulting births increasing by 49%[1]
- In 2022, IVF births increased to 91,771, up from 89,208 in 2021[5]
- Nearly 390,000 IVF cycles were performed in 2023, marking more than a twofold increase since 2011 when 163,000 ART cycles were conducted[4]

This growth has occurred despite an overall decline in US birth rates, with total births decreasing by approximately 2% annually from 2015 to 2020[5].

## Factors Driving IVF Growth

Several key factors are contributing to increased IVF utilization:

**Rising Infertility Rates**: Over 10% of women and around 9% of men in the US experience infertility issues[3]. Male infertility accounts for 30% of overall infertility cases and contributes to about one-fifth of all infertility instances in the US[3].

**Delayed Childbearing**: The average age for marriage and first childbirth is increasing, with more women freezing their eggs to focus on careers before having children later in life[3]. This demographic shift is significant because:
- Approximately 12% of couples have conception difficulties when women are under 30
- This percentage increases significantly when women are between 30 and 40[3]

**Success Rates**: For women 40 and younger using their own eggs, the success rate after embryo transfer ranges between 40% and 50%, while for women over 40, it's 24.4%[1]. These relatively high success rates encourage utilization.

**Market Growth**: The US in vitro fertilization market was valued at $5.28 billion in 2023 and is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.4% from 2024 to 2030[3].

## Forecast Analysis for 2029

Based on the data available, I can develop a forecast for 2029:

1. **IVF Growth Projection**: 
   - From 2011 to 2023, IVF cycles more than doubled (from 163,000 to 390,000)[4]
   - This represents an average annual growth rate of approximately 7.5%
   - If IVF births continue to grow at even a more conservative 5% annual rate from 2023 to 2029, we would expect approximately 122,000-130,000 IVF births in 2029

2. **Total Birth Projection**:
   - With US births declining at approximately 2% annually[5]
   - From a base of around 3.7 million births (estimated for 2023)
   - By 2029, total US births could be approximately 3.3-3.4 million

3. **Resulting Percentage**:
   - Dividing projected IVF births by projected total births
   - This would result in approximately 3.6-3.9% of US babies being conceived through IVF by 2029

## Probabilistic Assessment

Given the available data and trends, I estimate:
- **Most likely outcome (60% confidence)**: 3.7-4.0% of US babies will be conceived through IVF in 2029
- **Lower bound (20% confidence)**: 3.2-3.6% if technological adoption slows or economic factors limit access
- **Upper bound (20% confidence)**: 4.1-4.5% if technological advances, increased insurance coverage, or faster adoption occurs

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors could significantly impact this forecast:

1. **Policy Changes**: Potential legislation affecting IVF access or funding could dramatically shift utilization rates
2. **Insurance Coverage**: Expansion of insurance coverage for fertility treatments would likely increase IVF utilization
3. **Technological Advances**: Improvements in IVF success rates or cost reductions could accelerate adoption
4. **Economic Factors**: Economic downturns might reduce discretionary spending on fertility treatments
5. **Cultural Shifts**: Changing attitudes toward assisted reproduction could affect utilization rates
6. **Data Limitations**: Current projections rely on trends that may not continue linearly

This forecast should be periodically reassessed as new data becomes available from sources like the CDC's ART Success Rates reports and demographic data from national vital statistics.
