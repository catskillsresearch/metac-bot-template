Based on available information as of March 7, 2025, here's an analysis of whether Donald Trump will visit China between now and April 1, 2025:

## Current Status and Plans

Donald Trump began his second term as President of the United States in January 2025, being sworn into office on January 20, 2025[2]. Shortly after his election, Trump expressed intentions to visit China early in his presidency. According to reports from January 2025, Trump told his advisers that he wanted to travel to China after taking office[2].

Specifically, Trump has indicated a desire to visit China within 100 days of assuming office[2]. This timeline would place a potential visit around late April 2025, which falls outside the April 1, 2025 deadline specified in the question. The Wall Street Journal reported that Trump sought to deepen the relationship with China, which had been strained by his threats of higher tariffs on Chinese imports[2].

## Diplomatic Considerations

A visit by a U.S. president to China would be significant. If Trump's plan succeeds, he would be the first U.S. president to visit China so early in his term since George H.W. Bush in 1989[2]. However, diplomatic experts have noted potential challenges:

- Lu Xiang, a U.S.-China relations specialist at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, pointed out that a visit by a head of state to China typically requires six months or more of groundwork[2].
- The specialist did note that a visit could be arranged "as soon as possible" if both sides were less demanding in terms of protocol[2].

## Trade Relations Context

The diplomatic environment for a potential visit is complicated by Trump's trade policies. In February 2025, Trump imposed additional tariffs on imports from China, along with higher tariffs on Canada and Mexico[3]. Specifically:

- A 10% additional tariff was implemented on imports from China[3][4]
- Trump's administration cited concerns about illegal immigration and the flow of fentanyl and other drugs as justifications for these tariffs[3]

These trade actions are part of what appears to be a comprehensive trade policy shift in Trump's second term, as documented in a timeline tracking U.S. trade actions[1].

## Forecast Limitations

Several factors create uncertainty in predicting whether Trump will visit China before April 1, 2025:

1. While Trump has expressed interest in an early visit to China (and India)[5], no specific date has been officially announced in the available information.

2. The typical preparation time for state visits (six months) would suggest a visit might not occur until mid-2025, though expedited arrangements remain possible[2].

3. The 100-day timeframe mentioned would extend beyond April 1, 2025, as Trump took office on January 20, 2025.

4. Recent trade tensions, including the implementation of new tariffs in February 2025, could potentially affect diplomatic scheduling[3][4].

Based on the available information, while Trump has clearly expressed intent to visit China early in his second term, there is no concrete evidence that such a visit has been scheduled specifically before April 1, 2025. The expressed timeline of "within 100 days" would extend beyond the April 1 deadline.
