## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Since the escalation of the Russo-Ukrainian conflict in February 2022, multiple rounds of peace negotiations have failed due to disputes over territorial control, security guarantees, and alliance membership[1][2].
- In May 2025, prospects for renewed direct talks have emerged. President Putin has invited President Zelensky for negotiations in Istanbul, scheduled for May 15, 2025, with Turkish President Erdogan mediating[1][2].
- Ukraine and its allies have advocated for a full and unconditional 30-day ceasefire, but Russia has not agreed to this proposal. Instead, Putin seeks negotiations based on the 2022 Istanbul protocols, which involve terms widely seen as requiring Ukrainian capitulation[1][2].
- Despite ongoing talks, active combat operations continue. Both sides have reported military advances in recent weeks, indicating the absence of a de facto ceasefire[2].

## 2. Recent Announcements and Policies

- The U.S., Ukraine, and Europe proposed a general 30-day ceasefire, but Russia has not accepted it[1][2].
- President Zelensky’s willingness to meet Putin in person for talks marks a significant policy shift from his 2022 decree banning negotiations with Putin[1].
- Turkish President Erdogan and European leaders have called for a comprehensive ceasefire as a precondition for successful negotiations[2].
- Direct high-level talks are now scheduled, but their outcome remains uncertain given Russia’s continued maximalist demands[2].

- The Moscow Times: Reporting on the upcoming Istanbul talks and shifts in Ukrainian policy[1].
- Institute for the Study of War: Detailed assessments of military and diplomatic developments and current positions of both sides[2].

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- Russia’s acceptance of any ceasefire remains provisional and conditional; its demands for Ukrainian capitulation and recognition of “root causes” are unlikely to be met by Ukraine[2].
- Active combat persists, suggesting little willingness for an immediate halt to hostilities[2].
- Even if a bilateral agreement is reached, implementation may be delayed or undermined by further disputes or violations.
- The dynamic nature of the conflict and rapidly shifting geopolitical alliances introduce high uncertainty into any forecast.

## Probabilistic Assessment

| Period                           | Probability Assessment         |
|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| 1 January – 31 March 2025         | 0%    *(Past, no agreement)*  |
| 1 April – 30 June 2025            | 20%   *(Talks scheduled but major obstacles remain)* |
| 1 July – 30 September 2025        | 25%   *(Window for possible breakthrough if Istanbul talks yield progress)* |
| 1 October – 31 December 2025      | 20%   *(Delayed agreement possible, but risks of continued stalemate rise)* |
| Not before 2026                   | 35%   *(Continued deadlock or collapse of talks remains most likely)* |

**Rationale:**  
While the scheduling of direct high-level negotiations and shifts in Ukrainian policy increase the probability of a bilateral ceasefire agreement taking effect in 2025, Russia’s current demands and the absence of operational de-escalation make a rapid breakthrough unlikely. The most probable windows are Q3–Q4 2025, but the risk that no agreement is implemented before 2026 remains substantial given entrenched positions and ongoing military action.
