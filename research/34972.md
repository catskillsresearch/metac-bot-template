# Forecasting US Accusations of Venezuelan Invasion of Guyana

The territorial dispute between Guyana and Venezuela over the Essequibo region has seen significant escalation since 2023, with several developments that could potentially lead to a US accusation of Venezuelan invasion before April 1, 2025.

## Historical Context and Current Status

The Guyana-Venezuela crisis centers on Venezuela's claim to the Essequibo region, which constitutes approximately two-thirds of Guyana's sovereign territory[1]. This long-standing territorial dispute escalated significantly in 2023 when Venezuela organized a referendum on December 3, 2023, asking citizens to support its position in the dispute[1]. According to Venezuela's National Electoral Council, more than 95% of voters answered "yes" to all five questions on the ballot, though international analysts reported low turnout and suggested the results may have been falsified[1].

Following the referendum, Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro took concrete steps to assert control over the disputed territory:

- In December 2023, Maduro appointed personnel to handle the "incorporation of the Esequibo" and signed several decrees, stating this process would be completed "up until 2030"[1]
- In April 2024, Venezuela unilaterally declared that the disputed two-thirds of Guyana was officially part of Venezuela and that its Guyanese inhabitants were Venezuelan citizens[2]
- By December 2024, Venezuela completed and commissioned a bridge, which some observers characterized as an "outrage" against Guyana[2]
- Venezuela has announced plans to elect a "Governor of the Guayana Esequiba"[2]

## US Military Involvement and Diplomatic Responses

The United States has already demonstrated its support for Guyana in this dispute:

- In December 2023, the US Southern Command announced that its forces would participate in joint operations with the Guyana Defence Force (GDF) to improve collaboration on security measures[1]
- The US explicitly stated its commitment as "Guyana's trusted security partner" and its intention to promote "regional cooperation and interoperability"[1]
- Venezuela's defense minister, Vladimir Padrino Lopez, described these US actions as a "provocation"[1]

## Diplomatic Efforts and Their Failures

Despite attempts at diplomatic resolution, tensions have continued to escalate:

- On December 14, 2023, Guyanese President Ali and Venezuelan President Maduro met in Argyle, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, resulting in the "Declaration of Argyle for Dialogue and Peace"[3]
- The declaration committed both countries to not threaten or use force against one another and established a joint commission of Foreign Ministers[2][3]
- The first meeting of this joint commission was held on January 25, 2024, in Brazil, where both sides reiterated their opposing positions but committed to continued dialogue[3]

However, Venezuela has repeatedly violated the Argyle agreement:
- Satellite images reported by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) showed Venezuelan troop buildups and expansion of a military base on Ankoko[2]
- Guyana's Vice President Bharrat Jagdeo stated that his government was "preparing for the worst" and working with partners to strengthen "defence cooperation"[1]

## Economic Factors

The dispute has significant economic implications:
- The contested territory includes offshore areas where major oil and gas discoveries have been made since 2015[4]
- These discoveries have likely intensified Venezuela's interest in asserting control over the region

## Assessment of Invasion Likelihood

Several factors suggest an increased risk of actions that could be interpreted as an invasion:

1. Venezuela's escalating unilateral actions, including declaring the territory part of Venezuela and appointing officials to govern it
2. Military buildups observed near the disputed territory
3. The explicit rejection of the International Court of Justice's authority on this matter by Venezuela
4. The economic incentive provided by oil and gas discoveries in the region

The US has already demonstrated its security commitment to Guyana and has characterized Venezuela's actions as concerning. Given the US's stated position as "Guyana's trusted security partner," any significant military incursion by Venezuela into territory controlled by Guyana would likely prompt a strong US response, potentially including formal accusations of invasion.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors complicate this forecast:
- The exact definition of "invasion" may be subject to interpretation, particularly in a disputed territory
- Venezuela has indicated a long-term timeline (up to 2030) for incorporating the territory, suggesting they may prefer gradual encroachment over sudden invasion
- The search results do not provide information about the most recent developments in early 2025
- The role of regional organizations like CARICOM and CELAC in mediating the dispute could influence outcomes
