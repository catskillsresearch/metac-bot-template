## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Russia’s GDP in constant 2015 US dollars was $1.49 trillion in 2021. In 2024, the nominal GDP is reported at nearly $2.2 trillion, but this figure is not adjusted for inflation and is not directly comparable to the 2015 USD metric used for the 2030 target[1][4].
- Russia’s economy is heavily dependent on exports of natural resources, especially oil and gas. This has historically made its GDP growth highly sensitive to fluctuations in global commodity prices[4].
- From 2014 onward, Russia has faced rounds of international sanctions, which escalated sharply after its invasion of Ukraine in 2022, making it the world’s most sanctioned country. These sanctions target individuals, entities, and strategic sectors, aiming to restrict Russia’s access to global finance, technology, and markets[2].

## 2. Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Metric

- In response to sanctions, Russia has implemented policies to foster economic self-reliance, including import substitution and strengthening ties with non-Western economies[4].
- The Economic Development Ministry of Russia, as of 2023, projected two main scenarios for economic growth:
  - **Innovation-based scenario:** Annual GDP growth stabilizing around 3.8% by 2026-2030, with investment growth gradually declining[5].
  - **Conservative scenario:** Annual GDP growth rates declining to 2.5% by 2026-2030, with Russia’s share of global GDP marginally decreasing[5].
- Global institutions remain divided. The IMF revised its 2023 Russian GDP forecast upwards to show modest 0.3% real growth, indicating short-term resilience, but both the World Bank and OECD forecast a 3–5% GDP contraction for 2023, reflecting the lagging impact of sanctions and global economic headwinds[2].

## 3. Comparison to Reference Cases

| Reference Case | Key Similarities                      | Key Differences                        |
|----------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Iran (sanctions) | Commodity export dependence, severe sanctions | Iran’s economy is smaller, with less integration in global markets; Russia’s resource base is larger |
| Russia (2014–19) | Sanctions, lower oil prices         | 2022+ sanctions far broader, Western decoupling more pronounced, and military conflict ongoing      |
| Other commodity economies (e.g., Saudi Arabia, Brazil) | GDP volatility tied to global prices   | Russia faces unique geopolitical isolation and G7 technology/finance bans                         |

## 4. Key Differences Affecting the Forecast

- The scale and scope of post-2022 sanctions are unprecedented and structurally affect Russia’s ability to access Western capital, technology, and export markets. This is a fundamental difference from earlier sanction periods[2][4].
- Russia has pivoted towards Asia and the Global South, but these markets cannot fully compensate for lost Western demand or advanced technology imports in the medium term[4].
- Despite sanctions, high global energy prices in 2022–2023 cushioned the economic blow, but this is subject to change if prices fall, or if further restrictions (e.g., price caps, secondary sanctions) are enforced[4].
- Domestic policy responses—such as increased state intervention and support for key sectors—may support short-term stability but could hamper long-term productivity and growth[4][5].

## 5. Probabilistic Assessment

- As of early 2023, community and expert forecasts (e.g., Metaculus) placed the probability that Russia’s GDP (in 2015 USD) will be at least $1.50 trillion in 2030 at around 92%[2].
- Official Russian projections (even the conservative scenario) anticipate continued but moderate GDP growth, with the economy doubling from 2012 to 2030, implying a 2030 GDP at or above the 2021 level[5].
- Major uncertainties include the duration and enforcement of sanctions, the trajectory of global commodity prices, potential escalation or resolution of the conflict in Ukraine, and internal political/economic shocks.

## 6. Limitations and Uncertainties

- The GDP figures in constant 2015 USD depend on both real economic growth and the deflator used; nominal gains can be eroded by inflation and ruble devaluation.
- Forecasts are highly sensitive to unpredictable geopolitical developments, such as escalation or resolution of the Ukraine conflict or regime change in Russia.
- Sanctions’ effectiveness may evolve as Russia adapts and as Western policy shifts.

## 7. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The World Bank’s annual GDP dataset for Russia in constant 2015 USD will be the definitive source for the resolution of this question[2].

### Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given Russia’s demonstrated economic resilience, modest projected growth even under conservative scenarios, and market forecasts, there is a **high likelihood (80–90%)** that Russia’s GDP (in 2015 USD) will meet or slightly exceed $1.50 trillion in 2030, barring severe unforeseen shocks[2][5]. However, significant downside risks remain due to ongoing sanctions, commodity price volatility, and political uncertainty.
