## 1. Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of 2020, cryonics remains a niche practice in the United States. The leading organizations, Alcor and the Cryonics Institute, together have only about 1,500–2,000 members signed up for future cryopreservation, representing less than 0.0005% of the US population[4][5][1].
- Annual membership growth is slow: Alcor, for example, has increased from hundreds to just over 1,400 cryopreservation members over several decades[5].
- Public awareness of cryonics is limited, and it is often viewed with skepticism or as a speculative, fringe technology[2].

## 2. Reference Cases

| Case                         | US Participation Rate      | Notes                                    |
|------------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Cryonics (2020)              | <0.0005%                  | High cost, fringe status[4][5][1]         |
| Organ donation (opt-in)      | 54% (registered donors)   | Requires proactive sign-up                |
| Organ donation (opt-out)     | 85–95% (in other countries)| Defaults to participation                 |
| Advance directives/living wills | ~30%                   | Proactive end-of-life planning            |
| Cremation (adoption over time) | ~54% (2020)              | Cultural shift over decades               |

- Organ donation and advance directives provide relevant comparisons. Both require individuals to opt in, and have achieved participation rates of 30–54% over decades, with much higher rates in opt-out systems.
- Adoption of cremation, another practice once stigmatized, rose from <4% (1960s) to >50% (2020), but took decades of cultural change.

## 3. Key Differences Affecting the Forecast

- **Cost Removal**: Free cryonics would eliminate a major barrier, but not the only one. Social, religious, and scientific skepticism remain significant[2].
- **Cultural Acceptance**: Unlike organ donation, which has broad medical endorsement, cryonics lacks mainstream medical support and faces ethical and philosophical objections.
- **Default vs. Opt-In**: If cryonics is offered but requires proactive sign-up, participation will be lower than if it becomes a government-mandated or default service.
- **Awareness and Stigma**: Widespread participation relies on overcoming limited awareness and the perception of cryonics as unproven or fringe.
- **Logistics and Capacity**: A massive scale-up would be required to process millions of sign-ups, even if the procedure is free.

## 4. Recent Announcements/Policies (as of 2020-04-27)

- No major US government or large-scale private announcements indicated imminent changes to the structure or cost of cryonics as of 2020[1][4][5].
- Membership and patient numbers for cryonics organizations remained low and growth steady but slow[1][4][5].

## 5. Limitations and Uncertainties

- No historical precedent exists for a controversial, unproven end-of-life technology becoming universally available for free.
- The forecast must account for a wide range of plausible public responses, from continued skepticism to possible surges in adoption if social attitudes shift unexpectedly.
- Measurement would depend on tracking formal contracts or, in a government-run scenario, the scope of the official commitment.

## 6. Probabilistic Assessment

Given all factors:
- If cryonics is offered for free and requires proactive opt-in, the 10-year participation rate is likely to remain modest—potentially in the range of 1–5%, with a small probability of reaching 10% if social attitudes shift rapidly.
- If the government mandates cryonics as a default for all, participation could approach 100%, but this scenario is unprecedented and would require massive legal, social, and infrastructural changes.

**Best Estimate**:  
- For a plausible, opt-in free offering: **1–5% of Americans signed up within 10 years**
- For a mandated or default government program: **up to 100%, but probability is very low under current conditions**
