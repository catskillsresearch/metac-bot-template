## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Historically, US presidents have used executive authority to impose tariffs on specific goods or trading partners, but Congress has rarely passed bills imposing broad, across-the-board tariffs on nearly all imports[4].
- Trump’s first term saw significant tariff activity, particularly on steel, aluminum, and Chinese goods, but these actions were executed via executive authority and targeted specific sectors or countries, not all imports[4].
- As of May 2025, under Trump’s new administration, there have been expansions to existing tariffs (e.g., increasing rates on steel and aluminum, ending country exemptions, and imposing new tariffs on autos and auto parts)[4].
- Recent economic analysis estimates that imposed and scheduled tariffs in 2025 will reduce long-run US GDP by 0.7% to 0.9%, with an average cost of nearly $1,200 per US household[3][4].

## 2. Recent Announcements and Legislative Activity

- President Trump has made public statements reiterating his intent to impose sweeping tariffs, including a 25% tariff on all goods from Canada and Mexico and a 10% tariff on all goods from China[2].
- However, these actions have so far been implemented (or threatened) through executive orders or administrative action, not through congressional legislation[2][4].
- The latest legislative activity in Congress involves major tax cuts and budget resolutions, but there is no public evidence of a bill progressing through Congress that would implement a 10% or greater across-the-board tariff on nearly all imports[3].
- The current tariff expansions remain sectoral and do not meet the resolution’s definition of “across-the-board”[4].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Tax Foundation’s ongoing analysis and tariff trackers provide detailed breakdowns of current and proposed tariff measures, their scope, and economic impact[3][4].
- Trade Compliance Resource Hub tracks the latest effective tariffs and legislative changes[2].
- News outlets and economic research organizations continue to monitor congressional activity and executive actions related to tariffs.

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- There is a possibility that Congress could move quickly to pass such a bill later in 2025, especially if the administration exerts pressure or if geopolitical events escalate.
- However, as of late May 2025, there is no legislative movement or public reporting indicating imminent passage of an across-the-board tariff bill.
- The significant economic drawbacks and the unprecedented nature of such a bill (in terms of scope and potential violation of trade agreements) remain major obstacles.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the absence of legislative progress, historical precedent, and the economic and political challenges, the probability that Congress will pass a bill implementing a 10% or greater across-the-board tariff on nearly all imports in 2025 remains low as of May 2025. The most likely scenario is continued use of executive authority for targeted tariffs, with Congress refraining from enacting the sweeping tariff bill described in the resolution criteria.
