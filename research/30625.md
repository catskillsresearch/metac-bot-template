### Key Facts Supporting the Forecast

- **Recent Trend:** The Federal Reserve's overnight reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) facility usage has been in steady decline throughout 2023 and into 2024. As of March 2024, the FOMC noted the decline was ongoing, though at a slower pace than in late 2023[2].
- **Official Projections:** Federal Reserve staff projections as of March 2024 suggested that ON RRP balances could "stabilize in coming months at either zero or a low level," indicating a strong expectation that balances would remain well below previous highs[2].
- **Policy Context:** The Fed's September 2024 Implementation Note maintained the ON RRP facility at a 4.8% offering rate, with no indication of policy changes that would increase usage[4].
- **Regulatory Environment:** No new regulations affecting reverse repo operations are set to take effect before December 2024. The SEC's new central clearing requirements for repo and reverse repo transactions do not begin until 2025 and 2026[5].
- **Market Dynamics:** The FOMC minutes highlight that as ON RRP usage declines, further balance sheet reductions will more directly reduce reserve balances, reinforcing the expectation that ON RRP balances will not rebound sharply without a significant market event[2].

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The Federal Reserve's H.4.1 release is the definitive source for weekly balance sheet data, including the ON RRP balance, and will provide the official figure for the end of December 2024.

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- While the trend and projections strongly support a balance below $550 billion, unforeseen market stress or liquidity events could temporarily increase ON RRP usage. However, no such events are anticipated based on information available as of December 2, 2024.

### Conclusion

Based on the sustained downward trend, official projections, and lack of policy or regulatory changes before December 2024, all available factual information as of December 2, 2024, supports the forecast that the Federal Reserve's reverse repurchase agreements will be under $550 billion at the end of December 2024[2][4][5].
