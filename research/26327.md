# Measles Cases Forecast for the United States in 2025

Based on current data as of May 24, 2025, the United States is experiencing a significant measles outbreak that has already reached 1,046 confirmed cases across 30 states[5]. This analysis examines the current situation, historical comparisons, and provides a probabilistic forecast for total measles cases expected in 2025.

## Current Situation Analysis

As of May 23, 2025, the CDC has reported 1,046 confirmed measles cases across the United States[5]. This represents a substantial increase from the 800 cases reported on April 17, 2025[3], indicating that cases have increased by approximately 31% in just over a month. The outbreak has expanded from 25 jurisdictions in mid-April to 30 states by late May[5].

Key characteristics of the current outbreak include:

- About 96% of infected individuals are unvaccinated or have unknown vaccination status[4][5]
- Approximately 12% of cases have required hospitalization[5]
- Three deaths have been confirmed[3][4]
- The largest outbreak is centered in Texas, New Mexico, and Oklahoma, accounting for 82% of cases as reported in April[3]

## Comparison to Reference Cases

The current outbreak is already the second-highest case count in 25 years[5]. For context, the most relevant reference year is 2019, when the United States recorded 1,274 measles cases over the entire year[5]. The current trajectory suggests the 2025 outbreak will surpass this benchmark, as we've already reached 1,046 cases by late May.

Looking at the rate of increase, cases grew from 800 on April 17 to 1,046 on May 23, representing approximately 6.8 new cases per day. At this pace, the 2019 total would be exceeded by mid-June 2025.

## Key Differences Affecting the Forecast

Several factors distinguish the current outbreak from previous reference cases:

1. **Geographic Spread**: While the largest outbreak is concentrated in three states (Texas, New Mexico, and Oklahoma), cases have been confirmed in 30 states as of May 23, 2025[5], indicating widespread transmission.

2. **Vaccination Status**: The overwhelming majority (96%) of cases are occurring in unvaccinated individuals or those with unknown vaccination status[4][5], highlighting the importance of immunization gaps in driving transmission.

3. **Outbreak Dynamics**: Ten distinct outbreaks have been identified in 2025, with the largest accounting for 82% of cases[3]. The primary outbreak originated in Gaines County, Texas in January 2025 and has spread to multiple states[2].

4. **International Connections**: There is evidence of cross-border transmission, with an outbreak in Chihuahua, Mexico linked to cases in Texas[2], suggesting potential for continued importation of cases.

## Probabilistic Assessment for 2025

Based on the data available as of May 24, 2025, I provide the following probabilistic assessment for total measles cases in the United States by the end of 2025:

- **10th percentile (lower bound)**: 1,300 cases
- **25th percentile**: 1,500 cases
- **Median (50th percentile)**: 1,800 cases
- **75th percentile**: 2,300 cases
- **90th percentile (upper bound)**: 2,800+ cases

### Reasoning for this assessment:

1. **Current trajectory**: At the current rate of approximately 6.8 new cases per day, we could expect an additional 1,500+ cases over the remaining 7 months of 2025, bringing the total to 2,500+.

2. **Outbreak containment efforts**: Public health responses may intensify as case numbers grow, potentially slowing transmission in the latter half of the year.

3. **Seasonal factors**: Measles transmission can be affected by seasonal patterns, including school sessions and holiday travel.

4. **Vaccination response**: Outbreaks often trigger increased vaccination in affected communities, which could help limit the ultimate size of the outbreak.

5. **Geographic concentration**: With 82% of cases concentrated in a specific regional outbreak[3], effective containment of this primary cluster could significantly reduce the overall national total.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors could significantly impact the final case count:

1. **Reporting delays**: The CDC data reflects confirmed cases reported as of specific dates, and there may be lags in case identification and reporting.

2. **Vaccination campaigns**: Emergency vaccination efforts in response to outbreaks could alter transmission dynamics.

3. **New importations**: Additional importations of measles from international travel could spark new outbreaks.

4. **Community response**: The response of affected communities, particularly those with low vaccination rates, will significantly impact transmission rates.

The current data strongly suggests that 2025 will exceed the 2019 total of 1,274 cases, likely becoming the highest annual case count in recent decades. The concentration of cases among unvaccinated individuals highlights the critical role of vaccination coverage in determining the ultimate scope of this outbreak.
