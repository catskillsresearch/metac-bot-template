# Measles Cases Forecast for United States in 2025

As of July 17, 2024, we have several indicators suggesting that measles cases in the United States could increase substantially in 2025. This analysis examines historical trends, current status, and factors that may influence case counts in 2025.

## Current Situation and Historical Context

The United States has experienced 167 reported measles cases as of July 11, 2024, already exceeding annual totals for each year since 2019 (when 1,274 cases were reported). This represents a concerning upward trend in measles transmission.

Historical data shows that measles cases can fluctuate dramatically from year to year, with the potential for significant outbreaks when vaccination rates decline or importation events increase. The 2019 outbreak (1,274 cases) demonstrates how quickly cases can escalate when the virus enters under-vaccinated communities.

## Forecast Analysis for 2025

Based on current trends and historical patterns, we project that measles cases in 2025 could range between 800-1,200 cases, with several factors potentially driving this increase:

**Key Factors Affecting the Forecast:**

1. **Declining Vaccination Rates**: The CDC has noted that most current cases are among unvaccinated individuals. If this trend continues, we could see larger outbreaks in 2025.

2. **Outbreak Potential**: Measles is highly contagious, with each case potentially generating 12-18 secondary cases in susceptible populations. This means even small clusters can rapidly expand into large outbreaks.

3. **Global Situation**: Increasing global measles activity could lead to more importation events in 2025. The Americas region has historically been vulnerable to imported cases when global incidence rises.

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on current vaccination trends and case patterns in 2024, I estimate the following probability distribution for 2025 measles cases in the United States:

- 10% probability: <400 cases (containment of current trends)
- 30% probability: 400-800 cases (moderate increase)
- 40% probability: 800-1,200 cases (substantial increase)
- 15% probability: 1,200-2,000 cases (major outbreak scenario)
- 5% probability: >2,000 cases (widespread transmission)

The most likely scenario (800-1,200 cases) would represent a 5-7x increase from 2024 mid-year levels, but would remain below the 2019 peak. This forecast accounts for the possibility of multiple distinct outbreaks occurring in under-vaccinated communities.

## Measurement Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors create uncertainty in this forecast:

1. **Reporting Delays**: CDC data may be subject to reporting lags, meaning actual case counts could be higher than officially reported.

2. **Intervention Effectiveness**: Public health responses, including contact tracing and vaccination campaigns, could significantly alter outbreak trajectories.

3. **Vaccination Campaigns**: If current trends prompt aggressive vaccination campaigns in late 2024, this could reduce 2025 case numbers.

4. **Case Detection**: Not all measles cases are detected, particularly milder cases or those in areas with limited healthcare access.

The CDC currently updates its measles data on the second and fourth Friday of each month, which may affect the timeliness of final 2025 figures when resolving this forecast.
