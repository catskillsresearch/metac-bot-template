# Hickory Hollow Jerky Recall Analysis

Based on available information as of November 2024, here are the key facts that may help forecast whether the USDA recall of Hickory Hollow's ready-to-eat jerky products will be closed before December 1, 2024:

## Current Status and Background

Hickory Hollow Jerky, an establishment based in Eufaula, Alabama, initiated a recall of approximately 6,229 pounds of ready-to-eat jerky products on August 30, 2024[5]. The recall was necessary because the products were produced without the benefit of federal inspection[3][5].

The affected products include multiple varieties of beef jerky and bacon jerky produced between January 19, 2024, and August 21, 2024[5]. Specifically, the recall covers Hickory Hollow Beef Jerky products in various flavors including:
- Jamaican Jerked
- Original
- Hot Shot
- Peppered
- Jalapeno Original
- Sweet Heat BBQ
- Macho Nacho
- Honey Mustard Bacon Jerky
- Honey Original
- Teriyaki[5]

An important detail in this case is that the establishment underwent a change in ownership on June 11, 2024, though the name of the establishment and its products remained unchanged[5]. The recall covers products produced by both owners during the specified timeframe.

## Relevant Factors for Forecasting

Several factors may influence the timeline for closing this recall:

1. **Reason for Recall**: The products were recalled specifically because they were produced without federal inspection[3][5]. This is a procedural violation rather than a confirmed contamination issue.

2. **Health Impact**: As of early September 2024, there had been no confirmed reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of these products (according to the query description).

3. **Establishment History**: Hickory Hollow Jerky has been granted an establishment number (M34550) since May 19, 2011[1], suggesting it has been in operation for over a decade.

4. **Distribution Scope**: The products were distributed to retail locations across five states (Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, and Oklahoma) and sold online (according to the query description), which may affect the complexity of the recall process.

## Limitations in Available Information

The available information does not provide:

1. The typical duration of USDA recalls, particularly those related to production without federal inspection
2. Any updates on the recall status since its initial announcement
3. Information about remedial actions taken by Hickory Hollow Jerky
4. Any communication between the establishment and FSIS regarding resolution of the inspection issues

## Conclusion

Based solely on the available information, it is difficult to make a confident forecast about whether the recall will be closed before December 1, 2024. The recall was announced on August 30, 2024[5], which means that by December 1, 2024, it would have been active for approximately three months. Without historical data on similar recalls or specific updates on remediation efforts, the timeline for resolution remains uncertain.

The fact that no adverse health effects had been reported as of early September 2024 could potentially expedite the resolution process, but this would depend on whether Hickory Hollow Jerky has successfully addressed the underlying inspection issues that led to the recall.
