# Forecasting Potential Large-Scale Riots in the US (July-September 2024)

As of mid-2024, several factors suggest an elevated risk of civil unrest in the United States during the July-September 2024 period, though whether any incident would meet the specific criteria for a "large-scale riot" remains uncertain. Below is an analysis of relevant information available as of August 2024.

## Current Risk Factors

The 2024 election cycle has been characterized by heightened political tensions and polarization. Security experts and government officials have expressed concerns about potential political violence during this period[1][2]. The FBI Director Christopher Wray has indicated growing concerns about the "potential for a coordinated attack here in the homeland," while the Department of Homeland Security has warned that "threat actors" will likely "converge on 2024 election season"[1].

Several specific risk factors stand out:

### High-Profile Political Events

The period in question includes major political gatherings that could be potential flashpoints:

- The Republican National Convention in Milwaukee in July 2024
- The Democratic National Convention in Chicago in August 2024

These conventions represent "the largest collections of party members and leaders throughout the entire election cycle" and could therefore attract individuals or groups with grievances[3]. Such large gatherings have historically presented security challenges.

### Legal Proceedings Against Former President Trump

Dates associated with former President Trump's legal challenges could trigger reactions from extremists[3]. Trump and many of his allies have repeatedly warned that another election loss—coupled with forthcoming trial verdicts—could trigger civil unrest or even revolution in the United States[1]. A post shared by Trump on Truth Social suggested that 2024 might resemble 1776, "except this time the fight is not against the British, it's against communist Americans"[1].

### Election-Related Activities

As the November election approaches, there are concerns about violence and intimidation at polling places and against election workers[3]. In 2020, armed groups like the Oath Keepers gathered at polling places to "observe" for fraud, which could intimidate voters and disrupt the electoral process[3].

## Historical Context and Patterns

The 2020 presidential election provides important context, as it "occurred amid nationwide demonstrations and culminated with the 6 January assault on Capitol Hill"[2]. While the January 6 Capitol attack resulted in 5 deaths and over 100 injuries (as mentioned in the question description), it did not reach the threshold of a "large-scale riot" as defined in the question criteria.

In the years following 2020, there has been "a climate of increasing polarization" that has "stoked threats against several communities and prompted the mobilization of militias and militant social movements"[2].

## Expert Assessments

Experts offer mixed assessments about the likelihood of large-scale violence:

- Some warn that "gradually escalating attacks triggered by key events" could "increase polarization to a point of irreversibility"[4].
- Others suggest that while civil war is "unlikely," "political rhetoric and the proliferation of threats is almost certain to lead to some level of violence"[1].
- Geographic distinctions between potential warring factions today run urban-rural rather than north-south, which may limit the potential for nationwide conflict[1].

## Limitations in Forecasting

Several factors complicate efforts to forecast whether violence would reach the specific thresholds defined in the question:

1. The unpredictable nature of triggering events
2. The effectiveness of law enforcement preparation and response
3. The role of political leadership in either inflaming or calming tensions
4. The fragmented nature of extremist groups in the United States

## Conclusion

While there are clear warning signs of potential political violence during the July-September 2024 period, particularly around major political events, it remains difficult to assess whether any incident would reach the specific thresholds defined as a "large-scale riot" (50+ deaths, 10,000+ arrests, or $1 billion+ in damages within a 100km radius and 14-day period). Historical precedent suggests such large-scale riots are rare in the United States, but the current political climate presents unique risk factors that warrant close monitoring.
