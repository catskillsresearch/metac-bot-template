# Forecasting TSA Passenger Volume for Christmas-New Year's Week 2024

To forecast whether TSA passenger volume will exceed 19 million for December 25-31, 2024, I'll analyze historical trends, recent developments, and factors that could influence holiday travel.

## Historical Trends and Current Status

### Record-Breaking 2024 Travel

2024 has been a landmark year for air travel in the United States. On June 23, 2024, TSA screened nearly 3 million (2.99 million) individuals in a single day, setting a record at that time[1]. This record was broken again on July 7, 2024, when TSA screened more than 3 million people in a single day for the first time in its history[2][3].

The summer of 2024 saw unprecedented travel volumes:
- Between Memorial Day and August 21, 2024, TSA screened 239.8 million people, averaging 2.7 million passengers daily[3]
- All ten busiest travel days in TSA's history occurred between May and August 2024[3]

### Historical Holiday Period Data

Looking at the Christmas through New Year's Eve period (December 25-31) over recent years:

| Year | Total Passengers (7-day period) | Year-over-Year Growth |
|------|--------------------------------|----------------------|
| 2019 | ~17.11 million                 | Baseline             |
| 2020 | ~7.56 million                  | -55.8% (pandemic)    |
| 2021 | ~13.46 million                 | +78.0%               |
| 2022 | ~14.85 million                 | +10.3%               |
| 2023 | ~17.31 million                 | +16.6%               |

The 2023 total of approximately 17.31 million passengers represents a full recovery above pre-pandemic levels. To exceed 19 million in 2024, TSA would need to screen approximately 9.8% more passengers than during the same period in 2023.

### Recent Growth Patterns

TSA reported significant year-over-year growth during major travel periods in 2024:
- Independence Day travel (June 27-July 8) was projected to increase 5.4% over 2023[1]
- Labor Day travel (August 29-September 4) was expected to be 8.5% higher than 2023[3]

However, as of October 14, 2024, year-over-year growth had slowed, with the 7-day screening numbers down 1.4% compared to the same period in 2023.

## Factors Potentially Affecting 2024 Holiday Travel

### Economic Factors

Several economic factors could influence holiday travel volumes:
- Airfares were down 6% year-over-year as of July 2024 and below pre-pandemic prices[5]
- TSA Administrator David Pekoske noted that increased travel is "a sign of a healthy economy"[1]
- Lower airfares could stimulate additional holiday travel demand

### Consumer Behavior Shifts

Post-pandemic changes in consumer priorities may continue to drive travel demand:
- Industry experts note that Americans are prioritizing experiences over material goods
- Holiday travel represents an opportunity for family gatherings and experiences

### Operational Improvements

TSA has enhanced its capacity to handle larger passenger volumes:
- Reduced attrition rates by almost half and increased recruiting through improved compensation[1]
- Continued rollout of new checkpoint technology to improve efficiency and passenger experience[3]
- Secretary Mayorkas noted that TSA has demonstrated the ability to efficiently process high volumes of travelers (35 passengers per second) during peak periods[2]

## Forecast Considerations

To exceed 19 million passengers during December 25-31, 2024, TSA would need to screen an average of approximately 2.71 million passengers daily, compared to the 2023 average of 2.47 million for the same period.

Factors supporting potential growth above 19 million:
- Strong summer 2024 performance with growth rates of 5.4-8.5% over 2023
- Improved TSA staffing and operational capabilities
- Lower airfare prices compared to previous year
- Continued consumer preference for travel experiences

Factors suggesting potential challenges in reaching 19 million:
- Slowing growth trend observed in October 2024 (-1.4% year-over-year)
- The required 9.8% growth rate exceeds the Independence Day growth rate (5.4%)
- Economic uncertainties that could affect discretionary spending

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors could affect the accuracy of any forecast:
- Weather events during the holiday period could significantly impact travel volumes
- Economic conditions could change between now and December 2024
- Airline capacity decisions and pricing strategies for the holiday period
- The October slowdown could be temporary or indicate a longer-term trend

## Conclusion

Based on the available data through mid-2024, reaching 19 million passengers during the Christmas-New Year's week would require continued strong growth in air travel demand. While the summer 2024 growth rates (5.4-8.5%) suggest this is possible, the October slowdown indicates some uncertainty. The actual outcome will likely depend on economic conditions, airfare pricing, and operational factors as the holiday season approaches.
