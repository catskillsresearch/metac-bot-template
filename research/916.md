# Forecasting Analysis: Prevention of 9/11-Scale Attacks Through 2030

As of May 21, 2018, I've analyzed available information to forecast whether another 9/11-scale terrorist attack on U.S. soil will be prevented through 2030. This analysis examines current counterterrorism measures, funding trends, and security enhancements to assess the probability of prevention.

## Current Situation vs. Historical Context

Since the September 11, 2001 attacks, the U.S. government has significantly expanded its counterterrorism capabilities through increased funding, enhanced security procedures, and organizational restructuring. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has been allocated $55.6 billion for FY2018, representing a $6.3 billion increase above the FY2017 level[4]. This substantial funding supports a wide range of security functions including border security, maritime security, transportation security, immigration enforcement, and cybersecurity.

The current administration has implemented additional security measures through executive orders announced in January 2017, providing DHS with enhanced resources, tools, and personnel specifically focused on securing borders, enforcing immigration laws, and preventing individuals who pose national security threats from entering or remaining in the country[1].

## Key Differences Affecting the Forecast

Several factors distinguish the current security environment from previous periods:

1. **Enhanced Refugee Screening**: In January 2018, DHS announced additional security enhancements to strengthen the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program, implementing more intensive screening and vetting procedures for all persons seeking to travel to the United States[5]. These measures followed a 90-day review of procedures for nationals from 11 high-risk countries to address potential security vulnerabilities[5].

2. **Increased Border Security Funding**: The FY2018 Homeland Security Appropriations Bill includes $14 billion for Customs and Border Protection (CBP), representing a $1.8 billion increase above FY2017 levels[4]. This includes $1.571 billion specifically allocated for physical barriers and associated technology along the Southwest border, covering approximately 95 miles of "border wall system"[4].

3. **Counternarcotics Technology with Dual-Use Benefits**: The budget includes unprecedented funding for opioid detection equipment at ports of entry[4]. While primarily targeting drug trafficking, these technologies enhance overall screening capabilities that may detect other threats.

4. **Applied Research in Terrorism Prevention**: The Science and Technology Directorate (S&T) supports DHS's terrorism prevention mission through ongoing applied research[2], potentially developing new capabilities to identify and disrupt attack planning.

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on available information as of May 2018, the U.S. has implemented multiple layers of security enhancements that significantly increase the difficulty of executing a 9/11-scale attack. The substantial and increasing financial investments in homeland security ($55.6 billion in FY2018 alone)[4], combined with the long-term commitment suggested by proposals for multi-year funding (over $33 billion across ten fiscal years)[3], indicate sustained attention to counterterrorism priorities.

However, several limitations affect this assessment:

1. The evolving nature of terrorist tactics and technologies may present novel threats not addressed by current security measures.

2. The search results don't provide data on the effectiveness of implemented security measures or statistics on thwarted plots.

3. Long-term forecasting through 2030 involves considerable uncertainty due to potential changes in global geopolitics, terrorist group capabilities, and U.S. counterterrorism policies.

Given these considerations, while the U.S. has significantly enhanced its counterterrorism capabilities since 2001 and continues to invest heavily in prevention, a definitive forecast would require more comprehensive information about threat assessments, the effectiveness of current measures, and potential emerging threats.
