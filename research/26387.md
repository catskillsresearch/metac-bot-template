## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Tesla delivered 443,956 vehicles in Q2 2024, up from 386,810 in Q1 2024, marking a strong quarter-over-quarter rebound[2].
- The delivery trend since early 2023 has been volatile: 422,875 (Q1 2023), 466,140 (Q2 2023), 435,059 (Q3 2023), 484,507 (Q4 2023), 386,810 (Q1 2024), and 443,956 (Q2 2024)[2].
- Q2 2024 deliveries exceeded production (411,000 vehicles), indicating Tesla drew from inventory to meet demand[2].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- As of July 22, 2024, Tesla has not issued specific guidance for Q3 2024 deliveries[2][5].
- No major new product launches or factory openings are scheduled for Q3 2024 based on available information[5].
- Analyst commentary notes Tesla's annual production capacity is increasing, but there is skepticism about whether this will translate into higher quarterly deliveries without corresponding demand[5].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Tesla's official Investor Relations site is the primary source for delivery numbers and will report Q3 2024 deliveries, typically two days after quarter-end[2].
- Analyst and industry commentary provides context but is not definitive for quarterly delivery outcomes[5].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- Tesla has not provided forward-looking delivery guidance for Q3 2024 as of the cutoff date.
- Delivery numbers can be affected by supply chain disruptions, shipping logistics, regulatory changes, and macroeconomic factors.
- Historical data shows that Q3 deliveries are not always higher than Q2, so past trends do not guarantee future results[2][5].

## Summary Table: Tesla Quarterly Deliveries (2023â€“2024)

| Quarter   | Deliveries |
|-----------|------------|
| Q1 2023   | 422,875    |
| Q2 2023   | 466,140    |
| Q3 2023   | 435,059    |
| Q4 2023   | 484,507    |
| Q1 2024   | 386,810    |
| Q2 2024   | 443,956    |

## Conclusion

As of July 22, 2024, there is no definitive factual basis to forecast with high confidence that Tesla will increase its deliveries in Q3 2024 compared to Q2 2024. The Q2 rebound suggests possible stabilization, but the absence of new product launches, official guidance, or major capacity expansions for Q3 introduces significant uncertainty. The outcome will depend on demand, inventory management, and external factors, all of which remain unclear as of the cutoff date.
