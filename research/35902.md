### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The Washington Post's Political Appointee Tracker, in partnership with the Partnership for Public Service, is the authoritative source for tracking confirmations of "critical" executive branch leadership roles[1][2].
- As of early March 2025, confirmations are ongoing, with recent examples such as Jamieson Greer confirmed as U.S. Trade Representative on March 4, 2025[4].
- Historically, the pace of confirmations has varied. For instance, in early 2021, President Biden had 17 confirmed nominees after 50 days, but the total number of critical roles is much higher, and the process continues throughout the administration[2].

### Recent Announcements and Policies

- No major policy changes or announcements affecting the pace of confirmations have been reported as of March 11, 2025.
- The confirmation process continues at a steady pace, with individual confirmations being announced regularly[4].

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The Washington Post Political Appointee Tracker is the definitive source for the current number of confirmed "critical" leadership roles[1].
- The Partnership for Public Service provides additional context and updates on the confirmation process[1][2].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- The exact number of confirmed positions as of April 1, 2025, is not available in sources up to March 11, 2025.
- The number can change due to ongoing confirmations, resignations, or withdrawals.
- For the most accurate and up-to-date figure, the Political Appointee Tracker should be consulted directly on or after April 1, 2025, as specified in the resolution criteria.
