## Key Factual Information for Forecasting

**Current Price and Recent Trends**
- As of August 2024, the starting price for the 2024 Tesla Model Y Standard Range RWD is $43,990, which is below the $44,990 threshold required for a "Yes" resolution[5].
- Earlier in December 2024, the price was reported as $44,990, indicating a recent price reduction[5].
- Tesla has a history of adjusting prices, but there is no indication of an imminent price increase as of December 12, 2024.

**Recent Announcements and Policies**
- Tesla is offering a 0% APR financing promotion for new Model Y purchases ordered by December 15, 2024, with delivery by December 31, 2024. This promotion affects financing terms, not the sticker price[1][3].
- No official announcements have been made regarding a price increase or discontinuation of the Standard Range RWD trim before December 30, 2024.

**Authoritative Source for Verification**
- The official Tesla website (tesla.com/modely/design) is the only source that will be used for final price verification, as specified in the resolution criteria.

**Limitations and Uncertainties**
- Tesla has a history of sudden, unannounced price changes, which introduces some uncertainty.
- The price must be checked specifically for the U.S. market, excluding incentives and gas savings, as per the resolution criteria.
- The possibility of the Standard Range RWD trim being discontinued or repriced before December 30, 2024, cannot be entirely ruled out, but there is no evidence suggesting this as of December 12, 2024.

## Conclusion

Based on all available information as of December 12, 2024, the cheapest new Tesla Model Y is listed at $43,990, which is under $44,990. Unless Tesla unexpectedly raises the price or discontinues the base trim before December 30, 2024, the forecast is that the answer will be **Yes**.
