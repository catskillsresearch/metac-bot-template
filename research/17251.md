## Historical Trends and Current Status

- In 2012, 3.7% of U.S. adults identified as LGBTQ according to Gallup. This rose to 7.2% in 2022, and a 2025 Gallup poll now places the figure at 9.3%[5].
- The Williams Institute, using BRFSS data, estimated 5.5% for 2020-2021[2].
- Among Generation Z adults (born 1997–2012), nearly 20% identified as LGBTQ in 2022, suggesting a strong generational effect that could shape future adult identification rates[5].

## Recent Policies and Announcements Affecting the Metric

- Over the past decade, increasing legal protections (e.g., same-sex marriage, anti-discrimination laws) and a decline in religious affiliation[1] have likely reduced social stigma, allowing for more accurate self-identification.
- No significant national policy reversals as of 2023-2025 that would likely reduce LGBTQ self-identification rates.

## Authoritative Sources

- Gallup annual polls and BRFSS data provide the primary reference points for measurement[2][5].
- Pew Research projects continued social and demographic change, including religious disaffiliation, which may further encourage open self-identification[1].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- Survey methodology matters: Online/anonymous surveys tend to yield higher rates due to reduced social desirability bias[5].
- The rapid increase among Gen Z may partially reflect temporary cultural trends or social media influences, leading to some uncertainty about whether such high rates will persist as Gen Z ages.
- Saturation or plateau effects: As social acceptance becomes normalized, growth rates might slow or plateau below the current Gen Z peak.
- Demographic shifts, including immigration and religious change, could either accelerate or moderate the trend[1].

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

- Linear extrapolation of past growth (from 3.7% in 2012 to 9.3% in 2025) would suggest a very high rate by 2070, but this is likely unrealistic, as growth will probably decelerate.
- If Gen Z's ~20% identification is an upper bound and becomes the average for adults by 2070, the percentage could approach—but probably not exceed—15–18%.
- Given likely plateauing, measurement uncertainties, and potential generational stabilization, a central estimate for 2070 would be in the 13–17% range.
- A conservative probabilistic assessment: 80% chance the percentage falls between 12% and 18%, with a median estimate around 15%.
