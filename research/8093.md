## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The Free State Project (FSP) is the most prominent example of a modern, coordinated foot voting effort in the US. Founded in 2001, its explicit goal was to move 20,000 libertarian-leaning individuals to New Hampshire to influence state politics[1].
- By 2016, the FSP met its signatory goal, but by 2021, only about 5,000 of those had actually moved, and the organization stopped recruiting for a specific number[1].
- Other mass migrations in US history (e.g., Mormon pioneers, Great Migration) were not as tightly coordinated or recent, and no other modern project has matched the FSPâ€™s scale or intent in the context of explicit, political foot voting[1].
- As of October 2021, there is no public evidence of any other group or project that has intentionally coordinated and publicly claimed to have moved 10,000+ residents to a single state for political reasons[1].

## 2. Recent Announcements or Policies Affecting the Metric

- No significant new CFV initiatives comparable to the FSP have been publicly launched or reached large-scale traction by October 2021.
- The FSP remains the only reference case; it explicitly ended its push for a moving target number after meeting its signatory threshold in 2016[1].
- Technology improvements, remote work trends, and increasing state-level policy divergence could theoretically lower barriers for future efforts, but there is no evidence of such movements nearing the scale required[1].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Credible verification would require a public self-proclamation by the organizing group and confirmation by reputable media outlets.
- The FSP maintains self-reported mover numbers; however, these are not independently audited and tend to be optimistic[1].
- For resolution, corroboration from major media or independent investigation is necessary.

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- Self-reported numbers (such as those from the FSP) may not be fully reliable due to varying definitions of "mover" and lack of independent verification[1].
- New projects could emerge after 2021 and reach the required threshold before 2030, but such efforts would need to be both public and widely reported to meet the resolution criteria.
- Migration trends can be influenced by unforeseen political, economic, or social developments.

## Key Differences Affecting the Forecast

- The FSP had a long lead time and only managed to move about 25% of its most motivated signatories after 15+ years, indicating the difficulty of coordinated large-scale migration[1].
- Current trends (as of 2021) show no other active, comparably ambitious efforts.
- While technology and polarization may marginally increase feasibility, the logistical and motivational barriers remain high.

## Probabilistic Assessment

Given historical precedent, lack of new large-scale efforts as of October 2021, and the significant challenges faced even by the FSP, the probability that a coordinated effort will intentionally move 10,000+ residents to a single state by 2030 is low. An expert, evidence-based estimate would place the probability below 20% unless a new, highly organized and well-resourced movement emerges and is widely reported.
