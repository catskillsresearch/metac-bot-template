### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The Riemann Hypothesis is one of the original seven Millennium Prize Problems, announced in 2000 by the Clay Mathematics Institute. As of May 2025, only the Poincaré conjecture has been solved and officially recognized[4].
- The Riemann Hypothesis, first proposed in 1859, remains unproven. It asserts that all nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function have real part equal to \(1/2\), a result with deep implications for number theory and the distribution of prime numbers.
- Despite extensive efforts, no proof or disproof has been accepted by the mathematical community. The problem is central to analytic number theory, and many theorems are proven conditional on its truth.

### Recent Announcements and Policies

- The Clay Mathematics Institute continues to offer a $1 million prize for a correct solution, but the real value of the prize has diminished due to inflation, standing at about $565,000 in 2024 dollars[4].
- No credible announcements of a proof or disproof have been made as of 2025.
- AI research has advanced, with systems now capable of solving complex mathematical problems at the high school and undergraduate level, but there are no reports of AI independently solving any Millennium Prize Problem, including the Riemann Hypothesis[2][5].

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The Clay Mathematics Institute is the official adjudicator for any claimed solution.
- Forecasting platforms such as Metaculus and Manifold Markets track predictions about when a Millennium Prize Problem might be solved, with current consensus suggesting that solutions are unlikely before the late 2020s or later[1][3].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- The Riemann Hypothesis could be proved true, proved false, or shown to be undecidable within ZFC set theory, though the overwhelming consensus is that it is true if it is ever proved.
- The verification and acceptance process for such a proof is rigorous and may take several years, as evidenced by the Poincaré conjecture.
- Advances in AI may accelerate mathematical discovery, but as of now, no AI system has independently solved a problem of this magnitude[2][5].

### Conclusion

All available evidence as of early 2025 indicates that the Riemann Hypothesis remains unproven, with no credible claims of a solution. If it is eventually proved by 2100, the overwhelming expectation from the mathematical community and historical precedent is that it will be proved true, as this is the foundation for much of modern analytic number theory, and extensive computational evidence supports the conjecture. However, the possibility of a counterexample or undecidability cannot be entirely excluded, though these are considered unlikely.
