### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- South America, particularly Brazil, has a long history of UFO sightings, including multiple incidents involving pilots. Notable cases such as the 1996 Varginha incident and the Saragonha Island encounter involved pilot witnesses and official investigations[1].
- Argentina has also reported several UFO sightings, though pilot-specific reports are less frequent in publicized records[2].
- The National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC) remains an active clearinghouse for UFO/UAP reports, including those from international sources and pilots. As of May 2025, NUFORC has posted recent reports, indicating ongoing activity and submissions[3].
- South America is recognized for a "remarkable number of cases" and consistent documentation, including by pilots, though most recent waves of high-profile sightings have occurred elsewhere[5].

### Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- There are no publicly available announcements or policy changes in South American countries as of May 2025 that specifically encourage or discourage pilot reporting of UFOs to NUFORC.
- No major South American aviation authorities have issued new guidance on UAP reporting in 2025, unlike recent developments in the US and Europe.

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The official NUFORC database (https://nuforc.org/subndx/?id=x) is the resolution source for verifying whether a pilot report from South America is posted for June 2025[3].
- Wikipedia maintains a comprehensive list of notable UFO sightings, including pilot encounters, for context and cross-verification[1][4].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- NUFORC relies on voluntary reporting; not all pilot encounters may be reported, and some may be reported with delay or not categorized as "pilot" reports.
- The frequency of pilot-specific reports from South America is lower than general sighting reports, and there is no evidence of a recent increase in pilot reporting.
- The metric is sensitive to NUFORC’s categorization and publication practices, which may not always clearly identify pilot reports or attribute them to South American countries.

### Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the historical baseline of pilot UFO reports from South America, the ongoing activity at NUFORC, and the absence of recent policy changes or reporting surges, the probability of a pilot report of a UFO from South America being posted by NUFORC for June 2025 is moderate—likely in the range of 10-25%. This reflects a non-negligible chance due to the region’s history, but not a high likelihood in any single month without new evidence of increased reporting or incidents.
