## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of May 2025, Ukrainian General Staff estimates and UK Defence Intelligence assessments indicate that Russian personnel losses (killed and wounded) since February 2022 have reached approximately 950,000[4].
- The daily rate of reported Russian casualties has risen sharply in 2025, with April’s average exceeding 1,200 per day and a total of about 160,000 in the first four months of the year[4]. On several recent days, reported losses have topped 1,300[1].
- If this pace continues, Ukraine’s official tally will reach 1 million Russian personnel losses within the next 2–3 months, i.e., by July or August 2025, well before the January 2026 deadline.

## Key Differences and Factors Affecting the Forecast

- The current pace of casualties is the highest on record, reflecting the intensification of fighting in 2025[4].
- There have been no major ceasefire announcements, peace agreements, or reporting interruptions as of May 2025 that might prevent continued daily updates from the Ukrainian General Staff.
- While Ukrainian official figures may overestimate Russian losses, these are the numbers used for resolution, per the criteria.

## Authoritative Verification Sources

- Ukrainian General Staff daily reports on Facebook, Telegram, and X.com are the primary reference for the resolution of this question.
- Secondary independent trackers, such as russian-casualties.in.ua and Combat.FYI, broadly support the ongoing high-casualty trend, though their figures may lag official Ukrainian announcements[5].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- Ukrainian official casualty figures are widely considered to be estimates and may be inflated, but they are generally consistent with the reported intensity of fighting and independent OSINT trends.
- The situation could change if a ceasefire or peace deal is reached, or if the Ukrainian General Staff ceases or delays publication of daily reports for more than 30 days.
- Actual numbers may differ, but for the purpose of this forecast, only the Ukrainian General Staff's public reports are determinative.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the current pace of reported Russian losses, the lack of announced changes to reporting or major de-escalation, and the proximity to the 1 million threshold, it is highly probable (well above 90%) that the Ukrainian General Staff will report 1 million Russian personnel losses before 1 January 2026.
