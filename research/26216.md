## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Bitcoin has a history of volatile price cycles, with dramatic rises and corrections. Notably, after each halving event (which reduces new supply), Bitcoin has historically experienced significant price surges[4].
- The most recent halving occurred in May 2024, reducing the block reward and thus the rate of new Bitcoin entering circulation. Historically, such events have been followed by strong upward price momentum[4].
- As of early July 2024, Bitcoin’s price has fluctuated in the $55,000–$65,000 range, with some temporary dips but also strong rebounds[2][3].

## Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Metric

- The approval and launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US and other countries (including Thailand, Hong Kong, Australia, Singapore, and the UAE) have brought significant institutional capital into the market, fundamentally changing the investment landscape for Bitcoin[1].
- Major financial institutions such as BlackRock, JPMorgan, CME Group, and MicroStrategy have increased their exposure to Bitcoin, further legitimizing it as an asset class and increasing demand[1].
- Potential US Federal Reserve interest rate cuts in 2024 could weaken the US dollar and increase liquidity, which may drive more investment into alternative assets like Bitcoin[1].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Major cryptocurrency exchanges (e.g., Coinbase, Binance, Kraken) and financial news outlets (e.g., Bloomberg, Reuters, The Wall Street Journal) provide real-time and historical Bitcoin price data.
- Press reports from reputable sources and official exchange data will be used to verify if and when Bitcoin crosses the $100,000 threshold, as specified in the resolution criteria.

## Analyst and Expert Predictions

- Some analysts and industry leaders, such as Shivam Thakral (CEO of BuyUcoin), believe that $100,000 is more feasible than ever in 2024 due to institutional adoption, ETF inflows, and the recent halving[1].
- Other analysts predict that Bitcoin could reach as high as $150,000 by the end of 2024, citing similar bullish factors[3][4].
- However, some AI-driven forecasts and market models suggest a more conservative outlook, with stabilization around $62,000 by year-end 2024, reflecting ongoing macroeconomic and regulatory uncertainties[2].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- Bitcoin’s price is highly volatile and sensitive to macroeconomic conditions, regulatory developments, and investor sentiment.
- While historical patterns after halvings have been bullish, past performance does not guarantee future results.
- Unforeseen events (e.g., regulatory crackdowns, security incidents, or major macroeconomic shocks) could significantly impact price trajectories.
- Forecasts vary widely, and while several credible analysts see $100,000 as plausible in 2024, others urge caution and predict lower year-end prices.

## Summary Table: Key Factors Affecting Bitcoin’s Potential to Reach $100,000

| Factor                        | Bullish Impact                  | Cautious/Negative Impact           |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| 2024 Halving                  | Reduces supply, historically bullish | May already be priced in           |
| Spot Bitcoin ETF Adoption     | Increases institutional demand  | Regulatory risks remain            |
| Institutional Investment      | Adds legitimacy and capital     | Could reverse if sentiment sours   |
| Fed Rate Cuts                 | Increases liquidity, weakens USD| Not guaranteed, timing uncertain   |
| Macroeconomic Uncertainty     | Drives demand for alternatives  | Could also trigger risk-off moves  |
| AI/Analyst Price Predictions  | Some see $100k+ as feasible     | Others predict $60k–$70k range     |

## Conclusion

There is substantial factual support for the possibility that Bitcoin could reach $100,000 before September 15, 2024, based on historical trends, recent halving, institutional adoption, and ETF inflows. However, forecasts remain divided, and significant uncertainties persist. The outcome will depend on the interplay of these bullish and bearish factors over the coming months.
