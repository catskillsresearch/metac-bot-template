### 1. Key Historical Trends & Current Status

- Texas has historically maintained strict cannabis laws, with limited exceptions for low-THC medical use.
- In 2024-2025, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick prioritized a full ban on all THC products outside the medical program, introducing SB 3 to overhaul state hemp laws and potentially ban all forms of THC[4][5].
- The original version of SB 3 sought to ban all consumable hemp products containing THC[5].

### 2. Recent Announcements/Policies

- As of early May 2025, SB 3 has been heavily amended in the Texas House. The new version:
  - Bans vapes, vape shops, and all synthetic cannabinoids.
  - Allows continued sale of THC-infused drinks (up to 10 mg per serving) and certain low-THC products not resembling children's snacks.
  - Permits counties to opt out of the regulatory program via local vote[1][2].
- The bill does not impose a full statewide ban on all THC sales, which is required by the question’s resolution criteria[1][2][3].
- No other bills enacting a full ban have advanced as of May 14, 2025.

### 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The current status of SB 3 and its amendments are confirmed by Spectrum News and The Texas Tribune, which report the House's changes and the lack of a full ban[1][2].
- The Marijuana Policy Project and Texas Policy Research provide context on legislative priorities and the political landscape[4][5].
- The bill’s text and status can be tracked via LegiScan[3].

### 4. Limitations & Uncertainties

- The legislative session is still active; further amendments are possible, though increasingly unlikely so late in the process.
- The current compromise indicates strong political division and stakeholder pushback, reducing the likelihood of a last-minute shift to a full ban.
- The bill’s final passage, governor’s signature, or emergence of new legislation before July 1, 2025, remains a theoretical possibility, but is not strongly supported by current trends.

### Probabilistic Assessment (as of May 14, 2025)

Given the House's substantial amendments to SB 3 and the absence of any bill enacting a full ban on THC sales, the probability that Texas will enact a law fully prohibiting the sale of THC before July 1, 2025, is **very low**—estimated at under 10%.

> As of May 14, 2025, no law fully prohibiting the sale of THC statewide is poised for enactment in Texas, despite initial political momentum for a ban.
