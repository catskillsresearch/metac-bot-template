## 1. Key Historical Trends & Current Status

- The PRC has maintained a long-term goal of unification with Taiwan, emphasizing both peaceful means and the option of force if necessary[1][3]. 
- Chinese military modernization has intensified, with US intelligence reporting that China is building a military capable of taking Taiwan by 2030[4]. 
- Taiwan’s public overwhelmingly supports the status quo or independence: 70%+ see ROC as independent, while only 6.7% favor unification soon[Description].
- Beijing has increased military pressure and gray-zone activities (e.g., air incursions), but has not initiated a full-scale invasion or blockade as of mid-2025[5].

## 2. Recent Announcements & Policies

- President Xi Jinping has publicly asserted a strategic window for annexing Taiwan by 2030 if peaceful means fail[1].
- US and allied intelligence warn about China’s growing military capabilities but see major risks and obstacles to a successful invasion or occupation[4].
- Forecasters (Metaculus, Good Judgment Superforecasters) estimate a 20% probability of full-scale invasion by 2030 and 29% for a full-scale blockade[5].
- No credible reports exist of significant movement toward voluntary unification, and cross-strait relations remain tense.

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- US intelligence and defense analyses[4]
- Academic and think tank publications[1][3]
- Professional forecasting aggregators[5]
- Public opinion surveys (as referenced in The Diplomat and other reputable outlets)[Description]

## 4. Limitations & Uncertainties

- “Control” per the resolution requires not only military occupation but also political and economic integration—specifically, the removal of export/immigration barriers and multiple independent reliable sources confirming PRC administrative control over at least half of Taiwan’s population.
- Even if the PRC achieves a military breakthrough, sustaining political control and meeting the resolution’s criteria are highly challenging due to likely resistance, international response, and logistical hurdles.
- Forecasts can change rapidly with unexpected policy shifts, internal instability, or external interventions.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

- Given current trends, military trajectories, and especially the rigorous resolution criteria, the probability that the PRC will control at least half of Taiwan (by these standards) before 2030 is likely below 20%. 
- Forecasters estimate 20% for a full-scale invasion, but actual "control" (per the question) would require additional, less probable steps (e.g., stable administration, lifting of cross-strait restrictions, international recognition)[5].
- The baseline case remains continued PRC pressure without large-scale, successful annexation or the fulfillment of the integration conditions by 2030.
