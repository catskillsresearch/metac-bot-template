## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- In the past, elements like gallium, indium, hafnium, and zinc have been identified as at risk of running out, with warnings of exhaustion within decades[2]. However, these elements have not experienced long-term shortages; instead, the market has responded with increased recycling, substitution, and new production.
- As of 2018, the American Chemical Society listed 44 elements as facing supply risk, with several (helium, zinc, hafnium, gallium, germanium, arsenic, silver, indium, tellurium) "under serious threat" over the coming century.
- By 2025, demand for many of these elements is projected to rise sharply by 2040, particularly with the growth of clean energy and advanced electronics. For example, in high-tech scenarios, gallium and indium demand could be double or more the 2020s baseline, and tellurium demand could grow sevenfold[1].
- Historical price spikes for critical minerals (e.g., rare earths, indium, gallium) have occurred but were typically temporary, driven by supply chain disruptions or sudden demand, and resolved via market mechanisms or policy interventions[2][5].

## 2. Recent Announcements and Policies

- Governments and industry groups have prioritized critical mineral supply security, investing in recycling, alternative materials, and exploration to diversify supply sources[5].
- Clean energy transitions are accelerating demand for certain metals, but scenario analyses suggest primary supply will meet about 70% of requirements by 2040, with secondary sources and substitution expected to fill much of the gap[5].
- Some speculative technologies (e.g., asteroid mining) are unlikely to be commercially significant by 2040, so terrestrial supply and recycling remain critical[3].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- International Energy Agency (IEA) reports on critical minerals and clean energy transitions[1][4][5].
- U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) commodity statistics for price and supply tracking.
- DNI/National Intelligence Council assessments of resource trends[2].
- Industry news and analyses for recent market dynamics[3].

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- Price volatility can be sharp, but sustained 10x price increases are rare due to rapid market adaptation.
- Forecasts for supply and demand are scenario-dependent and may diverge significantly based on technology choices, recycling rates, and policy effectiveness.
- For some minor elements, transparent and continuous price data may be lacking, complicating resolution of the 10x price spike criterion.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given historical adaptation to supply risks, ongoing policy responses, and scenario modeling, the probability that humanity will "run out" (i.e., experience a 10x inflation-adjusted price spike) of at least one "under serious threat" element before 2040 is **low to moderate**. Short-term spikes are possible, especially if demand growth outstrips supply or geopolitical disruptions occur, but sustained scarcity of this magnitude is unlikely barring major unforeseen shocks.
