## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- In 2019, a major national poll (VRG) found 2% of U.S. adults self-identified as dietary vegans.
- From 2019 to 2024, reputable national surveys (Gallup, VRG, Statista) consistently report vegan self-identification rates between 1% and 4%, with most clustering at 1%-2%[1][2][5].
- Younger adults (Millennials and Gen Z) are more likely to be vegan (up to 5% in some polls), but the overall U.S. adult rate remains low due to lower rates among older cohorts[5].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- There are no major federal policies or events as of 2025 that would drive a sudden surge in vegan identification among U.S. adults.
- Plant-based diets and veganism are increasingly visible in popular culture and food retail, but this has not yet translated into a sharp rise in national self-identification rates[5].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- VRG and Gallup polls are considered authoritative for measuring self-reported veganism in the U.S.[2][5].
- Statista consolidates multiple reputable sources and also reports the U.S. vegan rate at around 4% as of early 2025[1].
- International comparisons show similar slow growth patterns in other developed nations[5].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- Self-reported veganism is sensitive to survey wording and respondent interpretation[4][5].
- Short-term experimentation with veganism is common, but long-term adherence is less so.
- Estimates vary by poll, methodology, and demographic weighting.
- Social desirability bias can affect self-reporting.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment for 2028

Given the slow but steady increase, the modest generational effect, and the lack of transformative policy or social change, the most likely outcome for a major, representative poll in 2028 is:

> **Between 2.5% and 3% of U.S. adults will self-report following a vegan diet in 2028.**
>
> The interquartile range for reasonable forecasts is 2%â€“3.5%.
