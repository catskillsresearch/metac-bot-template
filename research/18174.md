## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of 2023, solar power is the third-largest renewable energy source by global consumption, behind hydropower and wind[1].
- Solar power accounted for approximately 5.5% of global electricity generation in 2023, up from 4.6% in 2022, reflecting rapid growth[3].
- Global solar installations grew by 87% in 2023, contributing 447 GW of new capacity and bringing the world’s total solar capacity to 1.6 TW[5].
- Solar represented 78% of all new renewable installations in 2023, outpacing wind and hydro by a significant margin[5].
- China is the dominant player, representing 57% of new global solar installations, and 35.6% of global solar consumption[1][5].
- Despite these gains, hydropower and wind remain ahead in total global consumption due to their established base and higher capacity factors.

## Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Metric

- Major economies, especially China, have accelerated solar deployment through strong policy support and investment, catalyzing global growth[2][5].
- The International Energy Agency (IEA) notes that global renewable capacity additions increased by almost 50% in 2023—the fastest rate in two decades—driven primarily by solar[2].
- While wind and hydro growth continues, their rates are much slower compared to solar, partly because of site and resource limitations for hydro, and supply chain or permitting challenges for wind.

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The [Energy Institute Statistical Review of World Energy](https://www.energyinst.org/statistical-review) will provide annual data for resolution.
- Additional data sources include the International Energy Agency (IEA)[2], Statista[1][3], and SolarPower Europe[5].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- Global energy consumption figures for renewables can lag behind capacity additions due to differences in capacity factors (e.g., solar typically produces less energy per unit of installed capacity than hydro).
- Measurement is based on primary energy consumption, not just electricity generation, which can introduce conversion and reporting differences.
- Policy or market disruptions, grid integration challenges, or technological hurdles could affect solar’s trajectory.
- Hydro’s large existing base means overtaking it in annual consumption will require sustained, extraordinary growth from solar.

## Comparison to Reference Cases and Probabilistic Assessment

- Historically, transitions in renewable energy dominance have occurred over decades, but the current exponential growth in solar is unprecedented.
- The current situation differs from past periods due to:
  - Rapid cost declines and manufacturing scale for solar.
  - Slower expansion of wind and hydro due to physical and regulatory constraints.
  - Massive policy and market momentum behind solar, particularly in China.

Given these factors, the probability that solar will be the leading renewable energy source in terms of annual global consumption before 2031 is high and rising, but not yet a certainty. Solar’s exponential growth, especially if sustained for several more years at 2023 rates, could plausibly allow it to overtake wind and hydro by 2030. However, the large base of hydro and wind, and the lag from capacity to consumption, mean that this is best viewed as a strong but not guaranteed outcome. 

**Adjusted probabilistic assessment as of October 2023:**  
A likelihood in the range of 60–75% that solar will become the largest single source of renewable energy consumption globally before 2031, conditional on continued policy support and absence of major deployment bottlenecks.
