### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Tesla's quarterly deliveries since the start of 2023 have fluctuated, with a notable dip in Q1 2024 (386,810) followed by a rebound in Q2 2024 (443,956) and further improvement in Q3 2024 (463,000)[2][4].
- Q4 has historically been Tesla's strongest quarter, with Q4 2023 seeing a record 484,507 deliveries[1][3].
- As of Q3 2024, Tesla's delivery numbers are above the 450,000 threshold, suggesting positive momentum heading into Q4 2024[4].

### Recent Announcements and Policies

- During the Q4 2023 earnings call, Tesla's CEO stated that 2024's vehicle volume growth rate may be "notably lower" than in 2023, as the company focuses on launching its next-generation vehicle platform[3].
- No major production disruptions or new product launches affecting Q4 2024 deliveries have been announced as of October 21, 2024.

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Tesla's official Investor Relations site is the authoritative source for delivery numbers and will publish the Q4 2024 results, typically within two days after the quarter ends[1][2][4].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- Demand fluctuations, potential supply chain issues, and Tesla's own guidance of slower growth in 2024 introduce uncertainty.
- The final outcome depends on Tesla's official Q4 2024 delivery report, which will be released in early January 2025.

### Summary Table: Tesla Quarterly Deliveries (2023â€“Q3 2024)

| Quarter      | Deliveries   |
|--------------|--------------|
| Q1 2023      | 422,875      |
| Q2 2023      | 466,140      |
| Q3 2023      | 435,059      |
| Q4 2023      | 484,507      |
| Q1 2024      | 386,810      |
| Q2 2024      | 443,956      |
| Q3 2024      | 463,000      |

Given the Q3 2024 result (463,000) and historical Q4 strength, Tesla appears well-positioned to deliver more than 450,000 vehicles in Q4 2024, barring unforeseen disruptions[4].
