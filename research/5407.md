## 1. Reference Cases and Current Situation

- **Largest IPO to Date:** Saudi Aramco’s 2019 IPO raised $30 billion, the global record before inflation adjustment[2].
- **Starlink’s Position:** As of early 2025, Starlink is a rapidly growing SpaceX subsidiary, with projected 2025 revenue of $11.8 billion, over 4 million subscribers, and an estimated valuation of $137 billion[2][5].
- **IPO Status:** Starlink is not yet public. Elon Musk has indicated an IPO is only likely after the unit achieves sustained cash flow positivity, which reportedly occurred in October 2023. Public speculation and investor commentary suggest a potential IPO between 2025 and 2027, but no firm date is set[2][3][4].

## 2. Key Differences Affecting the Forecast

- **Revenue and Sector:** Saudi Aramco’s massive revenue base and oil sector dominance contrast with Starlink’s high-growth but smaller tech/infrastructure revenue[2][5].
- **Government vs. Private:** Aramco is a state-owned oil company with vast resources and sovereign support. Starlink, while valuable, is a commercial tech venture.
- **IPO Structure:** Record IPO proceeds depend not just on company valuation but on the proportion of shares sold; high valuation does not guarantee record proceeds[2].
- **Market Conditions:** Tech valuations can fluctuate, and investor appetite for large tech IPOs in the late 2020s is uncertain.

## 3. Probabilistic Assessment

Given current information:
- Starlink’s projected financials ($11.8B revenue in 2025, $137B valuation) make a very large IPO possible but falling short of Aramco’s $30B (plus inflation) seems likely[2][5].
- For a record, Starlink would need to sell a much larger share of its equity at IPO, or see a dramatic further increase in revenue and valuation.
- The probability that Starlink will set a new record for largest IPO before 2030, adjusted for inflation, appears **low (<10%)** given current trends and historical context.

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- **Forecast Uncertainty:** Future Starlink growth, global market conditions, and the IPO’s actual structure are unknown.
- **Inflation Adjustment:** Aramco’s 2019 IPO figure will need to be adjusted for inflation to 2030, raising the bar further.
- **IPO Size vs. Valuation:** Much will depend on how much of Starlink is offered in the IPO.

## 5. Authoritative Verification

- Major financial news outlets (WSJ, NYT, FT, Bloomberg) will report and verify IPO size at the time of offering, as per resolution criteria.
