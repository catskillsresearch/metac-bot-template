# Forecasting Internet Freedom Trends Through 2025

Based on information available as of June 20, 2021, I'll analyze the likelihood that Freedom House will continue to report declining internet freedom through 2025.

## Historical Trends and Current Status

Freedom House's Freedom on the Net report has documented a consistent decline in global internet freedom for ten consecutive years through 2020. This represents a decade-long trend of deteriorating conditions, with the 2020 report showing 26 countries experiencing declines versus 22 countries showing improvements. This persistent downward trajectory suggests strong momentum toward continued erosion of internet freedoms globally.

Several factors have contributed to this trend:

- **COVID-19 Pandemic Impact**: The pandemic accelerated digital surveillance and content restrictions as governments implemented emergency measures, many of which may become permanent.

- **Growing Digital Authoritarianism**: China's export of surveillance technologies and censorship models to other nations has expanded.

- **Social Media Manipulation**: Political actors increasingly employ coordinated inauthentic behavior to influence public opinion and elections.

- **Expanding Internet Shutdowns**: Government-ordered internet disruptions have become more common, especially during protests and elections.

## Recent Developments Affecting Future Trends

Several developments as of mid-2021 suggest the decline will likely continue:

- **Regulatory Expansion**: Major democracies including the EU, UK, and US are developing new regulatory frameworks for digital platforms that could potentially restrict online expression.

- **Increased State Control**: Countries like Russia, Turkey, and India have implemented new laws requiring data localization and expanding government authority over content moderation.

- **Private Sector Compliance**: Major technology companies have shown increasing willingness to comply with government demands for content removal and user data.

- **Normalization of Restrictions**: Practices once considered exceptional, such as internet shutdowns, are becoming normalized governance tools in many regions.

## Measurement Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors could affect the accuracy of this forecast:

- **Methodological Changes**: If Freedom House alters its scoring methodology or the countries included in its assessment, year-to-year comparisons may become less reliable.

- **Response to Criticism**: Growing awareness of digital rights issues could pressure some governments to implement reforms.

- **Technological Countermeasures**: Advancements in circumvention technologies might make some restrictions less effective, potentially improving scores.

- **Definitional Challenges**: As the internet evolves, defining what constitutes "freedom" online becomes increasingly complex.

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on the decade-long consistent trend of declining internet freedom and the acceleration of restrictive practices during the pandemic, there is a high probability (approximately 75-80%) that Freedom House will continue to report more countries declining than improving in internet freedom scores each year through 2025.

However, this assessment carries several uncertainties:

- The potential for democratic pushback against digital authoritarianism could grow
- Major policy shifts in influential countries could reverse some trends
- Technological innovations might empower users to circumvent restrictions
- Methodological adjustments in Freedom House's assessment approach could affect outcomes

The most likely scenario is continued overall decline, but potentially with fluctuations in the magnitude of decline and occasional years where improvements nearly match declines.
