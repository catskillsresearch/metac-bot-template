## Historical Trends and Current Status

- Freedom Houseâ€™s Freedom on the Net report has documented a continuous, multi-year decline in global internet freedom. As of the 2021 edition, internet freedom had declined for the 11th consecutive year, with the majority of the 70 countries assessed experiencing net decreases in their scores. Major events such as Myanmar's military coup in 2021 drove some of the steepest declines ever recorded, and the report cites a global "drive to control big tech" and rising digital repression as central trends[2].
- By 2024, the pattern persisted: the report stated internet freedom had declined for the 12th consecutive year, with sharpest downgrades in countries like Russia, Myanmar, Sudan, and Libya[5].

## Key Differences and Recent Developments

- There has been no major global reversal of restrictive internet policies since 2021. In fact, new laws and technologies have made censorship, surveillance, and control even easier for both authoritarian and some democratic governments.
- The expansion of the report's country coverage (from 65 to 72 countries) might introduce variability, but historical data suggests the overall trend of decline is robust to such changes[2][4].
- While some countries occasionally improve, these are typically outweighed by more numerous or severe declines elsewhere.

## Probabilistic Assessment

- Given the unbroken pattern of decline reported annually through at least 2024, and the lack of evidence for a global liberalization trend, it is highly probable that Freedom House will continue to report a net decline in internet freedom for each year through 2025.
- Forecasting consensus (e.g., Metaculus) puts the probability of continued annual decline at 94% as of early 2025, reflecting both expert and community expectations[5].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- Methodological changes by Freedom House, especially in country coverage or scoring criteria, could impact the comparability of year-to-year results.
- Significant, unexpected political liberalization in large countries or regions could shift the balance, but as of mid-2025, no such events have occurred at scale.
- The metric is sensitive to both the number and intensity of country-level declines versus improvements, and isolated large improvements (e.g., regime changes) could theoretically flip the annual trend, though this remains unlikely.

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Annual Freedom on the Net reports and country-by-country scores published by Freedom House provide the definitive data for resolving this question[1][2][4].
