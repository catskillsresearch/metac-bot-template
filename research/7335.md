# Forecasting Internet Freedom Trends Through 2025

As of June 20, 2021, I'll analyze available evidence to forecast whether Freedom House will report declining internet freedom every year through 2025.

## Historical Trends and Current Status

The most significant pattern in internet freedom is its consistent decline over an extended period:

- Freedom House's 2021 report documents that "Global internet freedom declined for the 11th consecutive year"[4]
- This report covers developments between June 2020 and May 2021[2]
- The 2021 report assessed internet freedom in 70 countries, representing 88% of global internet users[2]

This established pattern of decline spans more than a decade, showing remarkable consistency despite varying global conditions and events.

## Factors Affecting Future Trends

Several factors visible as of mid-2021 suggest this trend may continue:

1. **Increased government control attempts**: The 2021 report highlights "The Global Drive to Control Big Tech" as a significant theme, indicating growing regulatory pressure worldwide[4]

2. **Political instability and electoral disputes**: Countries like Myanmar experienced severe internet freedom deterioration (14 points, the largest ever recorded) following electoral disputes and military action[2]

3. **Expansion of surveillance technologies**: The report documents growing concerns about government surveillance and forced data handovers[2]

4. **Restrictive regulatory frameworks**: New laws putting online expression at risk were identified as a continuing trend[2]

However, some countervailing forces exist:

1. **Increased awareness**: Growing recognition of digital rights issues may generate resistance to further restrictions

2. **Potential for regulatory balance**: The report discusses "The Promise and Peril of State Regulation," suggesting some regulatory approaches could potentially foster competition and improve digital rights[2]

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based solely on information available as of June 20, 2021, I estimate a **75-80% probability** that Freedom House will report declining internet freedom every year through 2025.

This assessment is based on:

1. The strong historical precedent of 11 consecutive years of decline
2. Ongoing trends of increased government control
3. Limited but visible countertrends that could potentially reverse the pattern

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors create uncertainty in this forecast:

- Freedom House's methodology has evolved over time, potentially affecting comparability across years
- The report covers 70 countries, but global conditions in non-covered countries could shift overall trends
- The definition of "decline" is based on more countries decreasing than increasing in score, not necessarily global average scores
- Unexpected global events (like the COVID-19 pandemic) can dramatically alter internet governance priorities

## Conclusion

The weight of evidence as of June 2021 suggests the pattern of declining internet freedom is likely to continue through 2025, though with meaningful uncertainty. The established 11-year trend, combined with ongoing regulatory and political pressures, provides a strong baseline expectation for continued declines, despite some potential for positive developments in specific countries or regulatory approaches.
