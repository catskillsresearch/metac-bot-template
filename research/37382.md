# Forecasting Bluesky Unique Posters for June 28, 2025

To accurately forecast the number of unique posters on Bluesky for June 28, 2025, I'll analyze current user statistics, historical growth patterns, and engagement metrics based on the most recent available data.

## Current Status and Historical Trends

As of May 28, 2025, Bluesky has approximately 36.14 million registered users according to Jaz's Bluesky index[1]. This aligns with Backlinko's report of 35.98 million users as of May 20, 2025[4]. The platform has experienced significant growth in the past year, with key milestones including:

| Date | Registered Users |
|------|------------------|
| September 15, 2024 | 10 million |
| November 20, 2024 | 20 million |
| January 29, 2025 | 30 million |
| May 20, 2025 | 35.98 million |

This data demonstrates a slowing but still substantial growth trajectory, with approximately 6 million new users added in the nearly 4 months between January 29 and May 20, 2025[4].

## Growth Rate Analysis

The platform has shown varying growth rates:
- Early reporting suggested approximately one user joining per second as of March 31, 2025[3]
- Previous analysis indicated about 0.5 users per second during the September-December 2024 period[5]
- Between January 29, 2025 (30M) and May 20, 2025 (35.98M), the growth rate calculates to approximately 49,800 new users per day

The recent growth rate (Jan-May 2025) represents a slight increase from the 43,200 daily new users reported during the September-December 2024 period[5].

## Active Users vs. Registered Users

A critical distinction for this forecast is the difference between registered users and active posters. While Bluesky has 36.14 million registered users, only a fraction regularly post content. Available data indicates:

- In the US and UK combined, Bluesky has approximately 3.5 million daily active users[4]
- Total posts across the platform stand at 1.516 billion[1]

## Projection Methodology

To estimate unique posters on June 28, 2025, I'll consider:

1. **Current user-to-poster ratio**: While exact global figures aren't available, social media platforms typically see 1-10% of users create content regularly. Given Bluesky's relatively engaged community and the 3.5M daily active users in just US/UK, I estimate 15-20% of registered users are active posters.

2. **Growth projection for the next month**: Based on the most recent growth rate of approximately 50,000 users per day, Bluesky would add roughly 1.5 million new registered users by June 28, 2025.

3. **New user activation patterns**: New users typically have higher initial posting rates as they explore the platform.

## Forecast for June 28, 2025

Based on the analysis of current trends:

- Projected registered users by June 28, 2025: approximately 37.6-37.7 million
- Estimated percentage of active posters: 15-20% of registered users
- **Forecasted unique posters on June 28, 2025: 5.6-7.5 million**

This forecast accounts for:
- The current growth trajectory showing continued but moderating expansion
- The platform's demonstrated ability to maintain engagement as it scales
- Seasonal factors (summer in Northern Hemisphere may affect usage patterns)

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors could significantly impact this forecast:

1. The exact percentage of registered users who actively post is not directly provided in the available data
2. Growth rates could accelerate or decelerate based on platform changes, competitor actions, or external events
3. The definition of "unique posters" may vary (daily vs. monthly active posters)
4. Jaz's Bluesky index methodology for counting unique posters might differ from internal Bluesky metrics

The forecast assumes relatively stable growth without major disruptions or changes to the platform's functionality in the coming month.
