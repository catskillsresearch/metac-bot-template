## 1. Historical Trends and Current Status

- In 2018, the United States remained the world’s largest economy by nominal GDP, with a lead over China of roughly $6.3 trillion[3].
- China’s real GDP growth averaged 9.8% annually since the 1970s, compared to the US's 2.8%, but by 2015, China’s growth had slowed to about 6.9% and was expected to continue decelerating as the economy matured[5].
- China surpassed the US in GDP at purchasing power parity (PPP) in 2014, but nominal GDP (converted to USD) is the relevant metric for this question[1][5].

## 2. Key Differences Affecting the Forecast

- The US’s nominal GDP advantage is large and persistent, in part because the US has a much larger GDP base, so even with lower growth rates, it can add more incrementally than China[5].
- Currency effects are critical: The conversion of China’s GDP into US dollars introduces volatility and typically understates China's economic size in nominal terms compared to PPP terms[5].
- Chinese GDP per capita remains much lower than the US, indicating potential for catch-up but also highlighting structural limitations[5].
- Structural challenges for China include an aging population, rising debt, and slowing productivity growth, all of which are expected to moderate future economic growth.

## 3. Probabilistic Assessment (as of late 2018)

- Projections like those from Angus Maddison suggested China’s nominal GDP could overtake the US before 2041, possibly as early as 2030, but these depend heavily on optimistic assumptions about Chinese growth and stable/strengthening exchange rates[5].
- The combination of a slowing Chinese economy and potential for yuan depreciation introduces significant uncertainty.
- As of 2018, a reasonable estimate is that there is a moderate-to-high probability (perhaps 60-70%) that China’s nominal GDP will surpass that of the US in at least one year before 2041, but the scenario is far from certain and is highly sensitive to future economic and currency trends.

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- The main uncertainty lies in the future USD/CNY exchange rate, which can dramatically alter nominal GDP comparisons.
- Forecasts depend on policy continuity, global economic conditions, and unforeseen shocks (e.g., trade wars, financial crises).
- GDP measurement and reporting practices may differ between countries, potentially affecting headline numbers.

## 5. Authoritative Verification

- The World Bank and IMF provide consistent, authoritative data on nominal GDP for both countries, which should be used for resolution[2][1].
