# Forecasting H5 Human Cases in the United States by October 1, 2024

To forecast whether the CDC will report more than 100 total human cases of H5 in the United States by October 1, 2024, we need to analyze the current situation and historical trends of H5N1 bird flu infections in humans.

## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

As of July 12, 2024, the CDC has reported a total of five human cases of A(H5) infection in the United States since the first case was detected in 2022[4]. The timeline of these cases is as follows:

- April 2022: First human case detected in a person involved in culling birds at a commercial poultry facility in Colorado[5]
- April 1, 2024: First human case linked to the dairy cow outbreak, reported in Texas (also likely the first human infection with A(H5N1) from a cow globally)[3][4]
- May 22, 2024: Second human case associated with the dairy cow outbreak, identified in Michigan[3][4]
- May 30, 2024: Third human case associated with the dairy cow outbreak, identified in Michigan[3][4]
- July 3, 2024: Fourth human case associated with the dairy cow outbreak, identified in Colorado[4]

The current rate of infection shows a relatively slow progression, with approximately four new cases reported over a three-month period (April to July 2024) related to the dairy cow outbreak[4].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

The CDC continues to respond to the public health challenge posed by the multistate outbreak of avian influenza A(H5N1) virus in dairy cows and other animals in the United States[3][4]. They are working in collaboration with:

- U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)
- Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
- State public health and animal health officials
- Other partners using a One Health approach[3][4]

Despite the ongoing outbreak, the CDC's current H5N1 bird flu human health risk assessment for the U.S. general public remains **low**[2][4]. The agency is actively monitoring the situation and has implemented surveillance systems to detect H5N1 activity in humans[2].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

The primary authoritative source for tracking H5N1 human cases in the United States is the CDC. They provide regular updates through:

1. CDC Media Releases[1]
2. CDC Bird Flu Situation Summaries[2]
3. CDC A(H5N1) Bird Flu Response Updates[3][4]

The World Health Organization (WHO) also reports on confirmed cases of human infection with influenza A(H5N1) virus globally, including those in the United States[5].

## Limitations and Uncertainties in Measurement

Several factors create uncertainty in forecasting the total number of H5N1 cases by October 1, 2024:

1. **Exposure patterns**: All current human cases have been associated with direct exposure to infected animals (dairy cows or poultry)[2][3][4]. The spread of the virus among dairy herds and poultry flocks will significantly impact human case numbers.

2. **Limited human-to-human transmission**: Current evidence suggests limited or no human-to-human transmission of the current A(H5N1) strains circulating in the United States[2].

3. **Surveillance capabilities**: Case detection depends on testing capacity and surveillance systems, which may not capture all mild or asymptomatic infections[2].

4. **Viral evolution**: CDC has noted that contemporary A(H5N1) bird flu viruses detected in the U.S. during late 2021 and 2022 are different from earlier A(H5N1) bird flu viruses[2]. Further mutations could potentially affect transmissibility.

5. **Preventive measures**: Implementation of enhanced biosecurity measures at affected farms and processing facilities could reduce human exposure and subsequent infections.

## Conclusion

Based on the current rate of human H5N1 infections in the United States (5 cases over approximately 27 months, with 4 of those occurring between April and July 2024), and the CDC's assessment that the risk to the general public remains low, it appears unlikely that the total case count would exceed 100 by October 1, 2024. However, this forecast comes with significant uncertainty due to the unpredictable nature of viral outbreaks and potential changes in the virus's characteristics.

The situation requires continued monitoring of CDC updates and surveillance reports for any significant changes in transmission patterns or case numbers.
