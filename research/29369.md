# Alaska Ballot Measure 2 (2024): Repeal of Ranked-Choice Voting

Alaska voters will decide in November 2024 whether to repeal the state's ranked-choice voting system and open primaries that were implemented following voter approval in 2020. This analysis examines available information that could help forecast the outcome of this ballot measure.

## Background and Current Status

Alaska Ballot Measure 2 on the November 2024 ballot, known as the "Repeal Top-Four Ranked-Choice Voting Initiative," would repeal the voting system approved by Alaska voters in 2020[1]. If approved, it would:

- Eliminate the current open primary system where all candidates appear on a single ballot regardless of party affiliation
- End ranked-choice voting in general elections
- Return Alaska to partisan primaries and a single-choice, plurality-wins voting system[1][4]

Under the current system implemented in 2022, all candidates participate in a single primary election, with the top four vote-getters advancing to the general election. In the general election, voters rank candidates from first to last choice, with a candidate needing to secure more than 50% of votes to win[4].

## Arguments For and Against Repeal

**Arguments for repeal (Yes on Measure 2):**
- Would restore political parties' ability as private organizations to determine methods for selecting party nominees[1]
- Would return to a simpler voting system that some voters may find more familiar

**Arguments against repeal (No on Measure 2):**
- The No on 2 campaign emphasizes voter freedom in the open primary system, allowing voters to choose candidates regardless of party affiliation[5]
- Evidence suggests ranked-choice voting can result in higher voter turnout and increased engagement with political campaigns[1]
- The current system may produce more representative election outcomes than a plurality-wins system[1]
- The No on 2 campaign argues the open primary gives voters more choices without having to select a specific party ballot[5]

## Historical Context and Significance

If Alaska voters approve Ballot Measure 2, the state would become the first in the nation to implement and then repeal ranked-choice voting[5]. The current system has only been in use since 2022, giving voters limited experience with the ranked-choice method[5].

The ballot measure will appear as "Ballot Measure 2" on the November ballot. A "yes" vote would repeal the current system, while a "no" vote would maintain the status quo[5].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

The available information has several limitations for forecasting purposes:

1. The search results don't provide polling data on voter sentiment toward the measure
2. There's limited information about campaign funding or the relative strength of advocacy efforts on either side
3. The search results don't indicate how satisfied voters have been with the ranked-choice system since its implementation
4. There's no information about how political parties or major political figures in Alaska have positioned themselves on this issue

## Conclusion

Alaska's November 2024 vote on Ballot Measure 2 represents a significant decision about the state's electoral system. While the measure would repeal a relatively new voting method, the limited experience voters have had with ranked-choice voting could influence their decision. The outcome will determine whether Alaska becomes the first state to implement and then abandon ranked-choice voting, or whether voters choose to continue with the system they approved in 2020.
