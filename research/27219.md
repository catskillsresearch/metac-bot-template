### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- On August 6, 2024, Ukraine launched a major and unexpected offensive into Russia’s Kursk Oblast, advancing up to 18 miles (30 km) and capturing approximately 1,000 square kilometers, including at least 28 settlements[5].
- This operation marks the first significant cross-border incursion by Ukrainian regular forces since the start of the war, and is notably larger in scale and ambition than previous Ukrainian raids, which were limited and did not result in sustained territorial control deep inside Russia[5].
- As of August 14, 2024, there are no confirmed reports of Ukrainian forces holding territory at least five miles deep inside any Russian oblast other than Kursk. The offensive appears to be concentrated exclusively in Kursk Oblast[2][5].

### Recent Announcements and Policies

- Russian forces have responded by redeploying conscripts and battle-hardened units from other fronts to stabilize the situation in Kursk Oblast, indicating the seriousness of the Ukrainian advance[1][2].
- Ukrainian offensive activity in Kursk has reportedly decreased after the initial push, with Russian sources claiming the frontline has stabilized and no significant new advances have been made since August 11[2].
- There is no public evidence or credible reporting as of August 14, 2024, of Ukrainian offensives reaching five miles or more into other Russian oblasts such as Belgorod or Bryansk[2][3][5].

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) Ukraine Interactive War Map is the primary source for determining the extent of Ukrainian-held territory as of October 1, 2024, per the resolution criteria.
- Additional verification may come from geolocated footage, reporting by Ukrainian and Russian military observers, and independent analysis from organizations such as Critical Threats and the Long War Journal[2][3][5].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- Both Ukrainian and Russian authorities exercise tight control over battlefield information, leading to some uncertainty about the precise status of the frontline.
- The ISW map is authoritative for this forecast, but in the event of ambiguity, Metaculus may consult other credible sources.
- The situation remains fluid, and while as of August 14, 2024, Ukrainian-held territory at least five miles deep is confirmed only in Kursk Oblast, future developments could alter this assessment.

### Summary

As of August 14, 2024, all available factual information indicates that Ukrainian offensives reaching at least five miles into Russian territory include Kursk Oblast and no other oblasts. There is no evidence of similar deep incursions in Belgorod, Bryansk, or other Russian regions. This assessment is based on the ISW campaign assessments, geolocated footage, and independent analysis, all of which confirm the exclusivity of the Kursk incursion up to the knowledge cutoff date[1][2][5].
