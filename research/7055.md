### Key Historical Trends and Current Status (as of 2021-04-22)

- Cultivated meat, also known as cultured or cell-based meat, had not yet achieved mainstream commercial availability by April 2021. The first and only regulatory approval for cultivated meat sale was in Singapore, with extremely limited product launches in select restaurants[4].
- No major QSR (Quick Service Restaurant) chain—such as those listed in the question—had publicly announced the sale of cultivated meat products as of this date. Most commercialization efforts were at the pilot or demonstration phase[4].
- The plant-based meat sector, by contrast, had already seen widespread adoption by QSRs. This provides a reference for the upper bound of how quickly novel protein products can penetrate the QSR landscape, though cultivated meat faces additional regulatory and technical obstacles[5].

### Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- Projections in 2021 indicated that the global cultivated meat market could reach $248 million by 2026, representing rapid relative growth but remaining a very small fraction of the multi-trillion-dollar global meat market[3][4].
- Analyst consensus in 2021 was that cultivated meat would likely see "dozens" of restaurants and specialty retailers offering products by 2026, but not widespread adoption by global QSR chains[4].
- Regulatory progress outside Singapore was slow as of 2021, with the U.S., EU, and other major markets still in the evaluation or early approval stages[4].
- Community and expert forecasts, such as those on Metaculus, placed the median probability of a top QSR offering a cultivated meat product in 2026 at less than 0.1% per QSR, with an upper quartile estimate of about 0.3%[1][2].

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Metaculus community forecast aggregating expert and public predictions[1][2].
- Market research and economic analysis reports detailing market size projections and regulatory status[3][4].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- The cultivated meat market is subject to high uncertainty due to regulatory timelines, technological maturity, and consumer acceptance.
- Measurement is complicated by the resolution criteria—offering a product in a single location, even for a limited time, qualifies as "offering" for this forecast.
- QSRs are generally risk-averse and slow to launch unproven products, especially those with higher costs or regulatory complexity compared to plant-based analogues.
- Rapid advances or major regulatory approvals post-2021 could accelerate adoption, but these were not predictable as of the reference date.

### Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the reference cases and expert forecasts as of 2021, and accounting for possible but unlikely acceleration due to regulatory or technological breakthroughs, the most likely outcome for 2026 is that only one or two of the 13 top QSRs may offer a cultivated meat product in at least some locations. This yields an estimated proportion in the range of 0% to 15%, with a best-guess median around 7-8% (i.e., one QSR out of thirteen)[1][4].

> **Forecast:**  
> The proportion of listed QSRs offering a cultivated meat product in at least some stores in 2026 is likely to fall in the range of **0–15%**, with a median estimate of **~8%**.
