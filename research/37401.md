# Forecasting Analysis: Trump Executive Clemency in June 2025

President Donald Trump has demonstrated an active pattern of granting executive clemency since beginning his second term in January 2025. To forecast whether he will grant clemency to more than 2 individuals in June 2025, I'll analyze recent trends and historical patterns.

## Recent Clemency Activity (2025)

Trump has already established a significant clemency record in his second term:

- Since taking office on January 20, 2025, Trump has granted executive clemency to more than 1,500 individuals as of January 22, 2025[4]
- Most recently, Trump issued a "flurry of pardons" on May 29, 2025[1]
- Notable recent pardons include:
  - Todd and Julie Chrisley (reality TV stars) on May 27, 2025[3]
  - NBA YoungBoy (Kentrell DeSean Gaulden) on May 28, 2025[3]
  - Larry Hoover (mentioned among notable figures granted clemency in 2025)[3]

The timing is particularly notable, with multiple clemency actions occurring in late May 2025, just days before the June period in question.

## Historical Context

Trump's clemency patterns from his first term provide additional context:

- During his first presidency (2017-2021), Trump granted executive clemency to 237 individuals[5]
- The presidential clemency power is described as "one of the most unlimited powers bestowed on the president by the Constitution"[4][5]

## Forecast Considerations

Several factors support the likelihood of Trump granting more than 2 clemencies in June 2025:

1. **Established Pattern**: Trump has demonstrated a willingness to use his clemency powers extensively in both terms
2. **Recent Acceleration**: The "flurry of pardons" in late May 2025 suggests active use of this power
3. **Timing Continuity**: With multiple clemencies issued in late May, continuation into early June appears likely
4. **Scope of Authority**: The presidential clemency power is extremely broad, allowing Trump significant discretion

## Limitations and Uncertainties

A few factors could affect this forecast:

- No specific announcements regarding planned June clemencies appear in the search results
- Political reactions to the May pardons could potentially influence June decisions
- The search results don't indicate if there are specific cases under consideration for June

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on the available information, there appears to be a high probability (approximately 75-85%) that Trump will grant executive clemency to more than 2 individuals in June 2025. This assessment is based primarily on:

1. The recent pattern of multiple clemencies in May 2025
2. The historical precedent from both his current and previous terms
3. The established momentum of clemency actions heading into June

The extensive use of clemency powers already demonstrated in 2025 (over 1,500 clemencies by January 22)[4] suggests that granting more than 2 clemencies in a single month aligns with established patterns.
