## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The Abraham Accords (2020) saw the UAE, Bahrain, and Morocco normalize relations with Israel, largely in response to shared security concerns about Iran and to deepen ties with the US and Israeli technology and investment[4].
- Saudi Arabia, while not a signatory, has maintained clandestine or informal ties with Israel, focused on intelligence and security cooperation, especially regarding Iran.
- As of early 2025, normalization negotiations between Saudi Arabia and Israel have advanced periodically, with the US offering incentives such as security guarantees, support for a Saudi civil nuclear program, and advanced technology transfers[1][2][3][5].

## Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- Saudi officials and policy analysts have consistently emphasized that normalization with Israel must be tied to tangible progress toward a Palestinian state, or at minimum, a “credible” or “irreversible” pathway[1][3].
- Domestic and regional opinion in Saudi Arabia remains sensitive to the Palestinian issue, and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) is seen as unwilling to alienate his population or regional allies by sidelining Palestinian aspirations[1][3].
- The 2023 Hamas attack on Israel and the subsequent war in Gaza have heightened scrutiny of normalization, making any agreement more politically costly for Riyadh[5].
- US strategy in the region — specifically the willingness to offer treaty-level security guarantees and support for Saudi nuclear ambitions — remains a key variable[1][2][3].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Major international media outlets such as Reuters, AP, BBC, Al Jazeera, and The New York Times would be used to verify legal recognition and normalization.
- Official statements from the Saudi and Israeli governments and UN documentation would serve as primary sources.

## Limitations and Uncertainties in Measurement

- The definition of “credible” progress toward Palestinian statehood remains vague and subject to evolving Saudi and regional standards[1][3].
- Domestic politics in both Israel and Saudi Arabia are volatile; leadership changes or major regional events could shift the calculus.
- US policy in the Middle East is unpredictable and could change with new administrations.
- Iran’s nuclear advancement may increase pressure for normalization, but could also harden Saudi reluctance if it increases regional instability or anti-Israel sentiment[2][5].

## Key Differences Affecting the Forecast

- Unlike the UAE and Bahrain, Saudi normalization is more tightly bound to the Palestinian issue and requires greater US concessions[1][3][5].
- Saudi Arabia’s symbolic role as custodian of Islam’s holiest sites and its leadership among Sunni states makes the political cost of normalization higher.
- The Iranian nuclear threat is a strong motivator for alignment with Israel, but not sufficient alone to overcome domestic and regional political costs[2][5].

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the above, if Iran obtains a nuclear weapon by 2031:

- The probability of Saudi Arabia normalizing relations with Israel before 2031 increases relative to a scenario without an Iranian nuclear bomb, due to heightened security imperatives.
- However, the requirement for at least a “credible” pathway to Palestinian statehood and for robust US guarantees means the probability remains moderate, not high.
- As of early 2025, the most authoritative analyses suggest that normalization is possible but will depend on factors beyond Iran’s nuclear status — especially US policy and progress on the Palestinian issue[1][2][3][5].

**Expert estimate:** Conditional on Iran acquiring a nuclear weapon by 2031, the probability that Saudi Arabia will normalize relations with Israel by 2031 is in the range of 30–50%, elevated compared to baseline but far from certain due to the outlined constraints.
