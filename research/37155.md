## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Donald Trump and Elon Musk have both recently engaged in public debates and X posts about U.S. immigration policy, but their focus has been on employment-based visas like the H-1B and the new "gold card" visa program[1][2][5].
- Neither Trump nor Musk has a documented history of tweeting or posting about the Diversity Visa program specifically, nor is there evidence of them using the exact phrase "diversity visa" on X in recent months.

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- Trumpâ€™s administration has recently promoted a "gold card" visa program for wealthy immigrants, with Musk publicly supporting and discussing the pilot program on X[2].
- Both have publicly supported legal immigration for skilled workers but have not addressed the Diversity Visa program in these discussions[1][2][5].
- No recent policy changes or controversies regarding the Diversity Visa program have been reported that would likely prompt a high-profile comment.

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The official search for the phrase "diversity visa" from either @realDonaldTrump or @elonmusk on X will be used to resolve the question, as specified in the resolution criteria.
- Recent news coverage and X posts show a clear focus on H-1B and gold card visas, not the Diversity Visa[1][2][5].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- The forecast is limited by the lack of direct historical precedent for either figure posting about the Diversity Visa.
- Both Trump and Musk are known for unpredictable social media behavior, so while current trends suggest a low probability, an unexpected event could change this assessment.
- The metric is binary and strictly defined: only posts containing the exact phrase "diversity visa" will count.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

- Based on current trends, the probability that Donald Trump or Elon Musk will tweet (X post) using the exact phrase "diversity visa" before July 1, 2025, is low. Their focus remains on other visa categories, and there is no current catalyst for a post about the Diversity Visa.
