# Forecasting First-Time Gold Medal Winners at the 2024 Olympics

Based on the available information as of July 29, 2024, I'll analyze the potential for at least 5 countries to win their debut gold medal at the 2024 Paris Olympics.

## Historical Context

The question notes that in recent Summer Olympics, the number of countries winning their first gold medal has varied:
- London 2012: 3 countries
- Rio de Janeiro 2016: 9 countries
- Tokyo 2020: 3 countries

This shows significant variation, with Rio 2016 being particularly notable for new gold medal winners.

## Medal Predictions for Paris 2024

The available medal forecasts provide some insights, though they don't specifically focus on first-time gold medal winners:

Nielsen's Gracenote Virtual Medal Table (VMT) projects the United States to win the most medals overall (112), followed by China (86) and Great Britain (63)[1]. These established Olympic powers are expected to continue their dominance.

Sports Illustrated's medal predictions include some potential candidates from countries that might be seeking their first gold:

- In archery, Mete Gazoz from Turkey is predicted to win gold in the men's individual event. The prediction notes that "Gazoz would be the first archer to win individual golds at consecutive Olympics," suggesting he has won before[2].

- In boxing, Tammara Thibeault from Canada is predicted to win gold[2]. Canada has won numerous gold medals in previous Olympics.

- In breaking (a new Olympic sport), Dominika Baneviƒç from Lithuania is predicted to win gold in the women's competition[2]. This could potentially be Lithuania's first gold medal if they haven't won one previously.

## Potential First-Time Gold Medal Winners

From the limited information available in the search results, it's difficult to identify 5 or more countries that might win their first gold medal. The search results don't provide a comprehensive list of countries that have never won gold medals, nor do they specifically highlight potential first-time winners.

One potential indicator comes from a mention of "Carlos Yulo MAKES HISTORY on floor for Philippines' first gymnastics gold medal"[3]. This suggests the Philippines might be a candidate for a first-time gold medal in gymnastics, though it's unclear if this is a prediction or has already occurred, and whether the Philippines has won gold medals in other sports previously.

## Limitations in the Forecast

The available information has several limitations for forecasting this specific question:

1. The medal predictions don't specifically identify which countries have never won gold medals before.

2. The forecasts focus primarily on established Olympic powers (USA, China, Great Britain) rather than potential breakthrough nations[1][4].

3. The sport-specific predictions don't provide enough context about the historical medal status of each country mentioned[2][5].

4. There's insufficient information to identify 5 or more specific countries that might win their first gold medal.

## Conclusion

Based on the limited information available, it's not possible to make a confident forecast about whether 5 or more countries will win their debut gold medal at the 2024 Paris Olympics. The historical pattern shows significant variation (from 3 to 9 countries in recent Games), and the available predictions don't specifically address this question.

To make a more accurate forecast, one would need:
1. A complete list of countries that have never won gold medals
2. Sport-by-sport analysis of potential breakthrough performances
3. Expert assessments of underdog nations with strong medal contenders
