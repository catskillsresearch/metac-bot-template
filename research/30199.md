### Key Factual Information Relevant to the Forecast

- **Historical Trends**: President Joe Biden has issued executive orders in December of previous years. For example, in December 2021 and December 2023, executive orders were signed and published in the Federal Register[1][2][4]. This indicates a pattern of executive order activity continuing through the end of the year.
  
- **Current Status (as of November 18, 2024)**: No executive orders for December 2024 can be listed yet, as the month has not occurred. There are no announcements from the administration indicating a pause or cessation of executive orders for December 2024.

- **Recent Announcements/Policies**: There have been no public statements or policy changes suggesting that President Biden will refrain from issuing executive orders in December 2024[3][5].

- **Authoritative Sources for Verification**:
  - The Federal Register is the official and sole resolution source for this question, specifically the page listing Biden's 2024 executive orders.
  - Ballotpedia provides a summary but is not the resolution source.

- **Limitations and Uncertainties**:
  - Executive orders can be signed and published at any time, including late in December.
  - The Federal Register may have publication delays, but only what is listed as of the resolution date will count.
  - There is no precedent for a president issuing zero executive orders in December, but it remains a possibility.

### Summary Table: Biden Executive Orders in December (Recent Years)

### Conclusion

As of November 18, 2024, there is no factual information confirming that the Federal Register will list exactly zero executive orders by President Joe Biden for December 2024. Historical trends suggest it is likely that at least one executive order could be issued, but the outcome remains uncertain until the month concludes and the Federal Register is updated.
