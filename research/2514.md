# Forecasting Analysis: Global Biological Catastrophe Population Impact

Based on information available as of January 13, 2019, this analysis examines the likelihood that a global biological catastrophe would reduce human population by 95% or more.

## Current Understanding of Global Catastrophic Biological Risks (GCBRs)

Global Catastrophic Biological Risks (GCBRs) are defined as biological risks of unprecedented scale with the potential to cause tremendous loss of life and undermine the long-term potential of human civilization[1]. These risks are characterized by their potential to cause:

- Massive loss of human life
- Societal instability 
- Prolonged damage to governments and economies
- Damage to international relationships
- Threats to global security[1]

## Key Factors Increasing GCBR Likelihood

Several factors are contributing to increased GCBRs:

1. **Technological Advancement**: Rapid advances in biotechnology are making it easier to manipulate biological organisms and to create and engineer pathogens with pandemic potential[1][4].

2. **Proliferation of Capabilities**: Biotechnology capabilities and knowledge continue to proliferate and become more readily available to a wider variety of actors[4].

3. **Potential Malicious Interest**: Both state and non-state actors may have interest in biological weapons[1].

4. **Research Risks**: Legitimate bioscience research continues to conduct experiments involving the creation and enhancement of pathogens with pandemic potential[1].

5. **Laboratory Incidents**: A 2019 analysis of laboratory-caused pathogen exposures from 1975 to 2016 documented 71 incidents, demonstrating the need to guard against accidental release[4].

## Historical Disease Parameters

No single disease currently combines worst-case levels of all critical parameters (transmissibility, lethality, resistance to treatment, and global reach). However, historical evidence shows that extreme values for individual parameters exist:

- Some diseases exhibit nearly 100% case fatality ratio without treatment (e.g., rabies, septicemic plague)
- The 1918 flu pandemic reached virtually every human community worldwide
- Some viruses like chickenpox and HSV-1 can infect over 95% of a given population

## Expert Risk Assessments

An informal survey at the 2008 Oxford Global Catastrophic Risk Conference produced the following median risk estimates:
- 0.05% chance that a natural pandemic would lead to human extinction by 2100
- 2% chance that an "engineered" pandemic would lead to extinction by 2100

## Statistical Extrapolations

Millett and Snyder-Beattie performed a power law extrapolation based on casualty distributions from terrorism and warfare. Their analysis suggests:

- Attacks that kill 10^x people are approximately 3 times less likely than attacks killing 10^(x-1) people
- The probability of an attack killing more than 5 billion people was estimated at 0.000014
- Assuming 1 attack per year and that 10% of such attacks lead to extinction, they calculated an annual existential risk of 0.0000014 (1.4 × 10^-6)

## Technical Limitations and Uncertainties

Current technical limitations that affect the likelihood of engineered pathogens causing 95%+ population reduction include:

1. **Engineering Challenges**: Significant challenges exist in engineering genome modifications that result in desired pathogen characteristics (transmissibility and virulence) while remaining replication competent and capable of human-to-human transmission[4].

2. **Sustainability Factors**: Uncertainty exists about whether a synthetic pandemic can be sustained, based on:
   - Evolutionary biology constraints
   - Pathogen-host interaction dynamics
   - Pathogen stability for continued human-to-human transmission[4]

3. **Reproduction Number**: If the basic reproduction number (R₀) cannot be sustained above 1, a pandemic will naturally end[4].

## Forecast Assessment

Based on the information available as of January 13, 2019, the likelihood that a global biological catastrophe would reduce human population by 95% or more appears to be very low but non-zero. The current evidence suggests:

1. The technical capability to engineer pathogens with the necessary combination of high transmissibility, lethality, and resistance to create a 95% population reduction exists in theory but faces significant practical challenges.

2. Expert assessments place the probability of even complete human extinction from engineered pandemics at only 2% by 2100, suggesting that a 95% reduction would be somewhat higher but still low.

3. Statistical extrapolations from historical data suggest an annual risk on the order of 10^-6 for catastrophes of this magnitude.

4. The increasing accessibility of biotechnology capabilities and knowledge suggests this risk may grow over time, with the analysis indicating that "many, if not most" engineering challenges are likely to be overcome in the next 30 years[4].

While a global biological catastrophe causing at least 10% population reduction appears plausible given current and projected capabilities, the additional factors required to reach 95% population reduction represent a significantly higher threshold that would likely require overcoming multiple technical barriers that exist as of early 2019.
