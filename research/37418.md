## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- BRICS remained a five-member bloc from 2010 until 2023.
- At the 15th BRICS Summit in August 2023, the group extended full membership invitations to six countries (Argentina, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, UAE); four accepted and joined in 2024[4].
- The 16th Summit in October 2024 established a "partner country" framework, inviting 13 countries as partners but not offering full membership to new states at that time.
- Indonesia, originally a partner, was invited to full membership and joined in January 2025[4].
- The 17th BRICS Summit is set for July 6–7, 2025, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil[1][2][4].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- Brazil, as the 2025 BRICS chair, has prioritized internal institutional development, economic integration, AI regulation, climate change action, and public health cooperation, rather than explicit further expansion[3][4].
- Over 100 technical and ministerial meetings are being held in preparation for the 17th Summit, reflecting a focus on deepening cooperation among current members[3][4].
- Many countries have formally expressed interest in BRICS membership, but no new full membership invitations have been confirmed as of May 31, 2025[4].

## Differences Affecting the Forecast

- The 2023–2025 expansion cycle was unprecedented, suggesting some appetite for growth, but may also prompt a period of consolidation.
- The new partner country framework allows BRICS to engage with interested states without granting immediate full membership, potentially reducing expansion pressure.
- Brazil’s summit agenda is oriented toward internal reforms rather than enlargement.
- Membership requires unanimous agreement, and no leaks or official reports indicate consensus on new invitations ahead of the 17th Summit.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the focus on institutional development, the very recent expansion, and the lack of credible reports about imminent new invitations, the probability that a new country will be invited to join BRICS as a full member at the 17th Summit is assessed as **low** (estimated 10–20%). The likeliest scenario is continued engagement with partner countries, with potential for new invitations at future summits depending on internal consensus and external geopolitical developments.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- BRICS membership decisions are often made at the highest political levels and could be announced with little advance notice.
- Publicly available information may not capture ongoing negotiations.
- The summit’s outcome could be influenced by last-minute shifts in member state positions or global events.
