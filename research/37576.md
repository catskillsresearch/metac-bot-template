# Forecast Analysis: US Industrial Production Year-over-Year Growth for May 2025

The question asks whether the US Industrial Production will show positive year-over-year growth for May 2025. Based on current data and forecasts as of June 2, 2025, I'll provide a comprehensive analysis to inform this forecast.

## Current Situation and Historical Context

US Industrial Production has demonstrated positive momentum in recent months. The year-over-year growth rate increased to 1.5% in April 2025, improving from 1.3% in March 2025[5]. This upward trend is supported by strong performance across major sectors:

- Utilities: 4.3% increase
- Manufacturing: 1.2% increase 
- Mining: 0.7% increase[5]

This pattern of growth has been consistent, with industrial production showing resilience despite broader economic challenges. The Industrial Production Index, which measures real output for all facilities located in the US in manufacturing, mining, and electric and gas utilities, has been a reliable indicator of the health of the industrial sector[2].

## Key Factors Affecting the May 2025 Forecast

Several factors will likely influence the May 2025 industrial production figures:

**Tariff Impacts**: The Conference Board has noted that tariffs are expected to affect economic growth, forecasting US real GDP growth of 1.6% for 2025, down from 2.8% in 2024[4]. This suggests some headwinds for industrial production, though not necessarily enough to drive it negative.

**Sector-Specific Momentum**: The strong performance in utilities (4.3% growth) provides a buffer that could help maintain positive overall growth even if other sectors experience some weakening.

**Forecasted Values**: The US Industrial Production Index Forecast (IIP) specifically projects a value of 103.78 (±0.25) for May 2025[3]. This represents a continued positive trajectory.

**Quarterly Outlook**: Trading Economics projects industrial production to remain at 1.50% by the end of Q2 2025[5], suggesting stability in the growth rate through June.

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on the available data, there is a high probability that US Industrial Production will maintain positive year-over-year growth for May 2025:

1. The April 2025 figure of 1.5% provides a strong base
2. The specific May 2025 forecast of 103.78 indicates continued growth
3. The broader economic forecast, while showing some slowing, still maintains positive territory
4. The quarterly projection through Q2 2025 remains at 1.5%

While the ±0.25 margin in the May forecast[3] suggests some uncertainty, even at the lower bound this would likely remain positive given the April performance.

## Measurement Considerations and Limitations

It's important to note that:

1. Industrial production data is subject to revision by the Federal Reserve
2. The resolution criteria specifies that subsequent revisions will not affect the question resolution
3. The data used for resolution will be from FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data), using percent change from year ago, seasonally adjusted, monthly frequency
4. The April 2025 value was 1.48803 as reported on May 27, 2025

## Conclusion

The weight of evidence strongly suggests that US Industrial Production will show positive year-over-year growth for May 2025. The combination of recent positive momentum, specific forecasts for May, and broader economic projections all point to continued growth, albeit potentially at a moderated pace due to tariff impacts and other economic factors.
