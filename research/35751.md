## Historical Trends and Current Status

- Court-ordered changes to the outcome of U.S. House, Senate, or top statewide elections are extremely rare. Significant reference cases include North Carolina's 9th congressional district in 2018 (ballot tampering led to a new election) and Minnesota's 2008 Senate race (court-ordered recount changed the winner). Both involved extraordinary, well-documented irregularities.
- In the aftermath of the 2020 presidential election, courts faced a surge of lawsuits alleging fraud or procedural errors, but none resulted in a reversal of outcomes for major offices. Courts have generally required clear, systemic evidence that could alter the result, a high legal bar[3].
- In recent cycles, especially since 2020, partisan and legal disputes over election outcomes have become more common, increasing the likelihood of post-election litigation in close races[3].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- The U.S. Department of Justice sued North Carolina in May 2025 over alleged violations of the Help America Vote Act (HAVA), echoing issues that were previously at the heart of state-level election protests and lawsuits[4]. The outcome of this litigation, scheduled for trial in 2026, could set a precedent for federal intervention in state election administration if serious flaws are found.
- State supreme court races, such as the ongoing 2026 contest in Ohio and recent high-profile races in Wisconsin, highlight the increasing politicization of state courts, which are often the final arbiters in election disputes[1][3].
- No major federal election law changes have been implemented since 2024 that would systematically alter the standards for judicial intervention in election disputes.

## Key Differences Affecting the Forecast

- Heightened legal readiness and willingness by both parties to litigate close races may increase the number of cases brought before courts, particularly in battleground states with highly competitive races[2][3].
- Ongoing federal scrutiny of state election administration, especially over voter roll maintenance and compliance with HAVA, could create new grounds for litigation, though federal courts have historically been cautious about overturning election outcomes absent egregious violations[4].
- The composition of state supreme courts—shifting in several states due to recent and upcoming elections—may affect how receptive courts are to challenges, especially regarding procedural issues or alleged irregularities[1][3].

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

- The baseline probability of a court changing the winner of a major U.S. election remains very low (historically under 0.5% per election cycle for these offices).
- Due to increased legal activity, ongoing federal lawsuits, and close partisan splits in key states, the probability for the 2026 cycle should be adjusted moderately upward.
- A reasonable, evidence-based probabilistic assessment as of May 2025 is in the range of 1–3% that a court will overturn the initially certified winner of a 2026 U.S. House, Senate, or top statewide office race before January 1, 2028.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- The forecast is sensitive to the outcome of ongoing litigation, especially the DOJ's HAVA suit in North Carolina, which could set new legal precedents[4].
- The actual likelihood depends on the number of extremely close races and the nature of any irregularities that might emerge in 2026.
- Courts have demonstrated consistent reluctance to overturn certified election results without clear, outcome-determinative violations, making reversals still unlikely barring major, documented irregularities.
