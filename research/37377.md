## Limitations and Uncertainties

- No information is available on additional Democratic candidates, making it unclear whether Rouse faces significant competition.
- No polling, fundraising reports, or major endorsements are cited in current sources.
- The absence of negative press or major controversies is a positive sign for Rouse, but the lack of information about the field and voter sentiment introduces significant uncertainty.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given Rouse's active campaign, recent Senate victory, and lack of evidence of strong competitors or negative developments, he appears to be a probable front-runner for the Democratic nomination at this stage. However, the absence of polling or detailed opponent information warrants caution. On current evidence, a preliminary probabilistic estimate would place Rouse's chances of winning the Democratic primary above 60%, but with considerable uncertainty due to information gaps.
