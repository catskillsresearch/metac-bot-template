## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of Q1 2024, the FDIC’s Problem Bank List included 63 banks, up from 52 in Q4 2023. This represents 1.4% of all U.S. banks, which is within the normal range for non-crisis periods[1][2][3].
- Actual bank failures remain rare: only one bank failed in the first half of 2024, following five failures in 2023 (three of which were large regional banks in early 2023)[3][4].
- The banking sector continues to face significant unrealized losses—$329 billion as of Q3 2024—primarily due to higher interest rates and devalued securities, but this is an improvement from previous quarters[5].
- The FDIC describes the industry as resilient, though it notes ongoing risks from inflation, interest rate volatility, and specific loan portfolios (notably office properties and credit cards)[1].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- No major new regulatory interventions or emergency policies have been announced that would suggest a sudden increase in bank failures.
- The FDIC continues to monitor risks and maintains supervisory attention on problem areas, but the overall tone is one of cautious stability[1].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The FDIC’s official Failed Bank List is the definitive source for tracking actual bank failures and will be used for resolution[1].
- The Problem Bank List is confidential, but the FDIC releases the total number of problem banks and their combined assets quarterly[1][3].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- The Problem Bank List is not predictive of imminent failure; most banks on the list do not fail.
- Macro shocks or sudden liquidity events could cause unexpected failures.
- The number of actual failures in a quarter has recently been low, but the sector faces ongoing risks from unrealized losses and economic uncertainty[1][5].

## Forecast Summary

Given the recent trend—one failure in the first half of 2024, five in 2023, and a stable but elevated Problem Bank List—it is most likely that the number of banks listed on the FDIC's Failed Bank List for Q1 2025 will be low, probably in the range of 0 to 1.
