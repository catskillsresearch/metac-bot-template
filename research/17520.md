## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The share of U.S. workers in white-collar jobs (defined as management, professional, and related plus sales and office occupations) has risen steadily for decades, increasing from about 57% in 1985 to approximately 62.2% in 2022[3].
- Occasional small declines occurred, such as a brief dip below 60% during 2007 and in the late 1990s, but the overall trend has been upward[3].
- As of 2023, professional and technical workers represented 57.8% of the workforce, but this figure excludes sales and office occupations, so the broader white-collar share remains close to 62%[2][3].

## 2. Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Metric

- While there has been rapid advancement in artificial intelligence and rising concerns about automation's impact on white-collar jobs, major job losses have not yet materialized as of mid-2023[3].
- The professional services sector (largely white-collar) saw a significant slowdown in hiring demand in 2023, with job openings falling nearly 20% compared to 2022, indicating some softening in the sector[5].
- Despite these headwinds, overall employment remained robust, and the unemployment rate stayed relatively low and stable through early 2025[1][4].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The Bureau of Labor Statistics Current Population Survey reports quarterly employment data by occupation, with the relevant categories for this metric clearly defined[1][3].
- Additional breakdowns and trends are available from professional associations and labor market research organizations[2][5].

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- Occupational definitions and BLS methodology may evolve, but the question specifies adjustments if necessary.
- Short-term labor market fluctuations, such as economic shocks or accelerated AI adoption, could impact the forecast, but there is currently no evidence of a large, sudden decline in white-collar share.
- Some ambiguity may exist in classifying emerging "collarless" jobs that blur traditional white/blue-collar distinctions[5].

## 5. Probabilistic Assessment

- Given the decades-long upward trend, the 62.2% share in 2022, and only modest recent declines, the probability that the share of white-collar workers will drop to 60.0% or lower in any quarter before 2026 appears low but not negligible.
- Structural changes such as rapid AI adoption could accelerate a reversal, but as of the latest data, the shift is not yet of sufficient magnitude to expect a 2+ percentage point decline within the forecast window.

**Adjusted probability:** Less than 20% that the white-collar share will fall to or below 60.0% before Q1 2026, barring an unforeseen economic or technological shock.
