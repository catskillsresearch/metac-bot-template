### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of November 6, 2024, there have been no credible reports of exchanges of weapon fire between the national military forces or law enforcement personnel of Taiwan and the People's Republic of China resulting in any deaths, let alone 100 or more.
- The PRC has significantly increased military pressure on Taiwan throughout 2024, including large-scale exercises such as Joint Sword 2024A and 2024B, frequent incursions into Taiwan’s Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ), and repeated China Coast Guard (CCG) entries into restricted waters near Kinmen[1][2][3].
- These activities are widely interpreted as part of a coercion and intimidation campaign rather than preparations for immediate, large-scale armed conflict[2][3].
- The PRC’s military exercises have grown in scale and complexity, but analysts generally assess that Beijing is focused on blockade scenarios and psychological pressure rather than launching a full-scale invasion, due to the high costs and risks involved[2][4].

### Recent Announcements and Policies

- In October 2024, the PRC escalated military exercises around Taiwan in response to political developments, but these did not result in armed exchanges or casualties[1].
- The PRC has normalized a higher volume of ADIZ incursions and CCG activities near Taiwan, particularly around outlying islands like Kinmen, but these have not led to direct combat or fatalities[3].
- Political rhetoric from Beijing has intensified, with warnings against “secessionist” actions by Taiwan’s leadership, but this has not translated into lethal military action as of the latest updates[1][3].

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The Institute for the Study of War and the Global Taiwan Institute provide regular, detailed updates on cross-strait military developments[1][2][3].
- No major international news outlets or government sources have reported any exchange of weapon fire resulting in mass casualties between Taiwan and the PRC as of November 6, 2024.

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- Casualty figures in the event of a sudden escalation could be difficult to verify in real time, especially if incidents occur in contested waters or are subject to information control by either government.
- The situation remains dynamic, and while the risk of conflict is elevated, the prevailing pattern is one of military posturing and psychological operations rather than open warfare.

---

**Conclusion:**  
Based on all available factual information as of November 6, 2024, there is no evidence of any armed conflict between Taiwan and the PRC resulting in at least 100 deaths. The trend remains one of heightened military pressure and intimidation, not direct, lethal exchanges. Therefore, the forecast is that it is unlikely this threshold will be met before January 1, 2025, unless there is a dramatic and unforeseen escalation.
