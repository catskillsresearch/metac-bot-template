### Key Facts for Forecasting New Movies on Netflix's Global Top 10 (Week Ending Feb 9, 2025)

- Netflix is releasing several new movies in early February 2025, including "Kinda Pregnant," "Apple Cider Vinegar," "Surviving Black Hawk Down," and "Love Hurts"[1][3][4][5].
- These titles are being highlighted by entertainment media as major new releases and are likely to attract significant viewership[3][4][5].
- Historically, Netflix’s global top 10 movies list often sees 1–3 new entries per week, especially when multiple high-profile titles debut.
- The official Netflix Top 10 site will confirm the exact number, but based on release schedules and promotional activity, it is reasonable to expect "2 or more" new movies to appear for the first time in the top 10 during this week.

#### Limitations and Uncertainties
- The final count depends on actual viewership data, which is only available after the week concludes.
- Some new releases may not perform as expected, and holdover titles could remain in the top 10, affecting the number of new entries.

#### Authoritative Sources
- Netflix’s official Top 10 website will provide the definitive answer.
- Major entertainment outlets (Time Out, Collider, People) have previewed and promoted these new releases, supporting the likelihood of multiple new entries[3][4][5].
