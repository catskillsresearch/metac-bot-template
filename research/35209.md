# Forecasting Assassin's Creed Shadows' Steam Ranking (March 18-25, 2025)

Assassin's Creed Shadows is positioned to be a significant release for Ubisoft, with its launch scheduled for March 20, 2025, falling directly within the measurement period for Steam's Weekly Top Sellers chart (March 18-25, 2025). Based on available information as of February 2025, here's an analysis to help forecast its potential ranking.

## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

Assassin's Creed Shadows' pre-order sales are reported to be "solid" and "in line with those of Assassin's Creed Odyssey, the second most successful entry in the franchise."[4] This is particularly notable as Odyssey had the franchise's best launch when it arrived in 2018, with early sales that rapidly outpaced several of its predecessors including Origins, Syndicate, and Unity.[4]

The only Assassin's Creed title that has surpassed Odyssey's performance was Valhalla (2020), which became the best-selling entry in the series.[4] This historical context suggests that Shadows could potentially achieve similar success, placing it among the top-performing titles in the franchise.

Ubisoft has made a strategic decision to release Assassin's Creed Shadows on Steam on day one[2], which represents a shift from their previous approach with some titles. This day-one availability on Steam will likely boost its initial performance on the platform's charts compared to previous titles that may have had delayed Steam releases.

## Recent Announcements Affecting Performance

Several recent developments may impact Assassin's Creed Shadows' performance on Steam:

1. **Release Date Adjustment**: Originally scheduled for November 12, 2024, the game was postponed to February 14, 2025[2], and appears to have been further adjusted to March 20, 2025[3]. This extended development time may result in a more polished product, potentially leading to better reception and sales.

2. **Abandonment of Season Pass Model**: Ubisoft has eliminated their previous Season Pass approach that offered more expensive editions with early access and exclusive content. Instead, all buyers will be able to play Assassin's Creed Shadows simultaneously on the release date.[2] This change could concentrate initial sales into a shorter timeframe, potentially boosting its position on the weekly chart.

3. **Critical Importance to Ubisoft**: Given Ubisoft's reported 31.4% revenue decline to â‚¬990 million and ongoing restructuring efforts, the company is placing significant hopes on Assassin's Creed Shadows as a potential turnaround cornerstone.[3] This suggests Ubisoft may allocate substantial marketing resources to ensure a successful launch.

4. **Steam Day-One Release**: Unlike some previous Ubisoft titles that initially launched on their proprietary platform before coming to Steam, Assassin's Creed Shadows will be available on Steam from day one.[2] This approach should maximize its visibility and sales potential on the platform.

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

The most reliable sources for verifying Assassin's Creed Shadows' performance will include:

1. Ubisoft's financial reports and press releases, which have previously disclosed sales figures for major titles.

2. Steam's own Weekly Top Sellers chart, which will provide the definitive ranking for the March 18-25, 2025 period.

3. Industry analysts and tracking services that monitor game sales across platforms.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors could introduce uncertainty into forecasting Shadows' Steam ranking:

1. **Release Timing**: With a March 20 release date, Assassin's Creed Shadows will only be available for approximately 5 days of the 7-day measurement period (March 18-25). This partial-week availability could impact its ranking compared to titles available for the full week.

2. **Competition**: The forecast period's competitive landscape is unknown as of February 2025. Other major releases during the same timeframe could affect Shadows' relative position.

3. **Pre-load Availability**: If pre-loading is available before the official release, this might concentrate more purchases within the launch window, potentially boosting its position on the weekly chart.

4. **Critical Reception**: While pre-order numbers are strong, the game's critical reception upon release will significantly influence its sales momentum during the crucial launch period.

## Conclusion

Based on the available information as of February 2025, Assassin's Creed Shadows appears well-positioned to achieve a high ranking on Steam's Weekly Top Sellers chart for March 18-25, 2025. The combination of strong pre-order sales comparable to Odyssey (the franchise's second most successful entry), day-one Steam availability, and the concentrated launch approach without early access tiers suggests it could potentially reach the top 5 positions on the chart, despite being available for only part of the measurement week.

The game's performance will ultimately depend on its critical reception, the competitive landscape during that specific week, and how effectively Ubisoft's marketing drives interest leading up to the March 20 release date.
