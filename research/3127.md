## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- **Space Elevator**: As of late 2019, the International Space Elevator Consortium (ISEC) declared the concept "Tech Ready," meaning ready for engineering validation, and released a report substantiating that the basic transportation concept has passed a preliminary Technology Readiness Assessment[1][4]. However, no physical engineering testing, prototype construction, or significant funding had begun. Progress over the previous decade was largely conceptual; companies like Liftport admitted little tangible progress despite earlier ambitions[2]. The required cable materials (e.g., carbon nanotubes or graphene) remained a major bottleneck, with no scalable manufacturing process available.
  
- **Skyhook**: The skyhook concept, in various forms (rotating or non-rotating tethers), had been studied since the late 20th century. A NASA NIAC study around 2000 concluded that a basic skyhook is feasible with materials available at that time. However, skyhooks have not advanced beyond theoretical studies, and as of 2019, there were no announced plans or funded projects to construct or test such a system[5]. Operational challenges (energy losses per payload, orbital maintenance) reduce practical viability.

## 2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- The primary development in 2019 was ISEC's assertion that the space elevator concept is ready for engineering validation[1][4]. This is a significant milestone in the conceptual phase but does not equate to construction readiness.
- No government space agencies or major private companies had announced plans to construct or test a space elevator or skyhook as of November 2019[2][5].
- There were no policy changes or new funding streams announced that would accelerate development.

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- International Space Elevator Consortium (ISEC) newsletters and technical reports[1][4]
- Wikipedia summaries of space elevator and skyhook development status[2]
- Peer-reviewed and policy analysis papers on technical feasibility and challenges of both concepts[5]

## 4. Limitations or Uncertainties in Measurement

- **Technical Hurdles**: The space elevator remains dependent on breakthroughs in material science for construction of a tether with adequate tensile strength and manufacturability[1][4]. Skyhook designs, while theoretically possible, would require substantial engineering and operational demonstration that had not occurred as of 2019[5].
- **Funding and Political Will**: Both concepts lack significant funding or institutional commitment. The scale of investment and international cooperation required remains unprecedented for an unproven technology[5].
- **Operational Definitions**: The resolution requires cumulative payloads to exceed 10 metric tons by end of 2045, via a single system. Even if one were constructed, ramp-up and reliability issues could delay significant payload operations.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given that as of late 2019:
- Neither a space elevator nor a skyhook had progressed beyond design and concept validation.
- No prototype construction or large-scale engineering testing had begun.
- No major funding, governmental endorsement, or private sector commitment was in place.

The probability that either a space elevator or skyhook will cumulatively transport 10 metric tons before 2046 is **very low**. 
A reasonable forecast would place the likelihood well below 10%, with most of the risk on material science breakthroughs, funding, and political/institutional will. Absent dramatic and unexpected advances, positive resolution before 2046 appears extremely unlikely.
