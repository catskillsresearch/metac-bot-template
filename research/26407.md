# Russia's Mobilization Strategy: Current Status and Future Prospects

Based on the Institute for the Study of War's (ISW) reporting, Russia has been relying on "crypto-mobilization" rather than launching a second formal mobilization wave to sustain its military operations in Ukraine. This analysis examines the available evidence regarding Russia's force generation approach and the likelihood of a second mobilization before September 30, 2024.

## Current Force Generation Strategy

Russia has been employing crypto-mobilization as its primary method of force generation since the completion of its first partial mobilization in October 2022. According to Bloomberg reporting cited by ISW in April 2024, the Kremlin has been intensifying these crypto-mobilization efforts specifically to avoid conducting another partial mobilization call-up of reservists[3]. This suggests a deliberate strategy to maintain troop levels without resorting to the politically sensitive measure of formal mobilization.

Ruslan Pukhov, head of the Moscow-based Center for Analysis of Strategies and Technologies and a member of a Russian Ministry of Defense civilian advisory board, provided specific figures on these efforts, claiming that:

- Current Russian crypto-mobilization efforts generate approximately 30,000 new personnel each month
- The Russian military could potentially recruit 300,000 total personnel in 2024 through these methods[3]

## Sustainability of Current Approach

ISW assessments indicate that Russia's ongoing crypto-mobilization efforts have proven capable of sustaining Russia's offensive operations in Ukraine despite heavy losses[5]. The Russian military has maintained its operational tempo by "rapidly deploying low quality troops to frontline units," though this approach has hindered Russia's ability to conduct complex operations and make rapid advances[1].

This strategy appears to be working sufficiently for Russia's current needs:

- The formation of additional reserves through crypto-mobilization would likely allow the Russian military to backfill losses without taking significant operational pauses[5]
- These efforts could potentially provide enough manpower to form limited Russian operational reserves[5]

However, ISW notes limitations to this approach:

- Russia's ability to produce new weapons and equipment and modernize old systems "does not correspond" with how quickly Russia hopes to equip its strategic reserves[5]
- Russian forces are currently sustaining a higher casualty rate per square kilometer gained than in Fall 2024[1]

## Indicators for Future Mobilization

ISW has identified several indicators that would signal shifts in Russian strategy, though none specifically point to an imminent formal mobilization:

- A future slowing of Russian offensive operations and/or transition to defensive operations would indicate that Putin is shifting his short-term goals from seizing more territory to consolidating previously held territory[1]
- Western intelligence reportedly suggests that Putin may begin prioritizing short-term goals such as consolidating Russia's gains in Ukraine and Russia's immediate economic viability over seizing more territory[1]

However, Putin's demonstrated commitment to maintaining the tempo of Russian offensive operations despite high casualty rates contradicts this assessment[1], suggesting he remains focused on battlefield gains rather than consolidation.

## Summer 2024 Offensive Planning

ISW reporting indicates that Russian forces were expected to launch a large-scale summer offensive in June 2024[2][3]. Ukrainian Main Military Intelligence Directorate Head Lieutenant General Kyrylo Budanov had previously forecasted a major Russian offensive for late May or early June 2024, later narrowing his forecast specifically to June[3].

This planned offensive appears to be proceeding with the forces generated through crypto-mobilization rather than through a new formal mobilization wave. The Russian military command may consider "significant changes to the large-scale offensive operation" expected in June 2024, though it may still proceed as planned[2].

## Conclusion

Based on the available ISW reporting, there is no indication that Russia plans to initiate a second formal mobilization wave before September 30, 2024. Instead, the evidence suggests Russia is committed to its crypto-mobilization strategy as a means to avoid the political costs associated with another formal mobilization while still maintaining sufficient force levels for its operations in Ukraine.

The current crypto-mobilization approach appears to be generating enough personnel (potentially 300,000 in 2024) to sustain operations, though with limitations in terms of troop quality and equipment. Unless there is a dramatic shift in battlefield conditions or Russian strategic calculations, ISW reporting suggests Russia will continue with this approach rather than announcing a second formal mobilization wave.
