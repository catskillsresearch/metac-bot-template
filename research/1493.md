### 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- From 1950 to 2018, global population saw consistent annual growth between 1% and 2%, rising from 2.5 billion to over 7.7 billion, with no period of global decline[1].
- The worst 20th-century events (e.g., WWII, 1918 flu pandemic) caused millions of deaths but did not reduce the global population by 10% within five years.
- As of 2018, the UN projected continued global growth, peaking at 10.4–10.9 billion late in the 21st century, with annual growth dropping below 0.1% by 2100, and only a modest decline (if any) thereafter[1][3][4].

### 2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- Dramatic declines in global fertility rates are expected: by 2100, more than 97% of countries will have sub-replacement fertility (below 2.1 children per woman), but this translates into gradual, not precipitous, population decline[5].
- Regional declines (notably in Europe and East Asia) are forecast, but Africa is expected to offset this with high birth rates, keeping global numbers relatively stable[1][5].
- No major policy or event as of 2018 was expected to cause a global population drop of 10% in five years under "business as usual" scenarios.

### 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- United Nations World Population Prospects (2019 and later updates)[1][3][4]
- The Lancet/Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) studies on global fertility[5]

### 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- Catastrophic risks (nuclear war, engineered pandemics, AI, etc.) are not incorporated into baseline demographic models, though they could—if realized—cause sharp population loss.
- The probability of a 10% decline in five years is extremely low by reference-class forecasting, but not strictly zero due to anthropogenic and natural global catastrophic risks.
- Forecasts do not account for "unknown unknowns" or Black Swan events; thus, while mainstream projections strongly suggest such a decline is highly unlikely, absolute certainty is not possible.

**Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment (as of 2018):**  
Based on all available demographic projections and historical precedent, the probability that the global human population will decrease by at least 10% in any five-year period before 2100 is very low—well under 1%—absent a major, unprecedented global catastrophe. However, the risk is not strictly zero due to anthropogenic threats with no historical precedent[1][3][5].
