# Ukraine's Kursk Incursion: Withdrawal Forecast Analysis

Ukraine's incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast represents a significant strategic shift in the Russo-Ukrainian war. This analysis examines the available information as of August 21, 2024, to help forecast whether Ukraine will withdraw from Kursk Oblast before October 1, 2024.

## Current Status of the Incursion

As of mid-August 2024, Ukrainian forces have established a significant presence in Kursk Oblast:

- Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky stated on August 13 that Ukrainian forces "control" 74 localities in Kursk Oblast[2].
- The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) has observed claims and geolocated footage indicating Ukrainian forces are operating in or near approximately 41 settlements in Kursk Oblast as of August 13[2].
- Geolocated footage published on August 13 indicates that Ukrainian forces recently advanced northeast of Korenovo[2].

## Russian Response and Counteroffensive Efforts

Russia has been mobilizing resources to counter the Ukrainian incursion:

- Russian forces appear to be "more adequately defending against Ukrainian assaults following the arrival of additional conscripts and more combat effective personnel from frontline areas in Ukraine"[1].
- Elements of the Russian 810th Naval Infantry Brigade (previously deployed in Kharkiv and Kherson directions) have been redirected to Kursk Oblast[1].
- Russian milbloggers claimed that Russian forces repelled company-sized Ukrainian mechanized assaults in various directions on the night of August 9-10[1].
- Despite these efforts, Russian milbloggers acknowledged that "Russian forces have not completely stabilized the situation in Kursk Oblast" as of August 13[2].

## Strategic Significance and Ukrainian Objectives

The Kursk operation appears to serve several strategic purposes for Ukraine:

- According to Oleksandr Lytvynenko, Secretary of Ukraine's National Defence and Security Council, the incursion is intended to offset Russia's "inexorable economic and numerical advantage through surprise, manoeuvre and Ukrainian tactical cunning"[3].
- Prior to Kursk, Ukraine was losing ground at a rate of "one hundred to two hundred metres per day, very slow, but apparently unstoppable"[3].
- The operation has "successfully changed the narrative of the war"[3].
- President Zelensky has indicated that holding ground in Kursk could serve as a "bargaining chip in negotiations"[3].

## Factors That May Influence Ukrainian Withdrawal

Several factors could impact Ukraine's decision to withdraw or maintain its position in Kursk Oblast:

1. **International Support**: Zelensky emphasized on August 17 that international assistance, particularly regarding "long-range capabilities," is crucial for the operation's success[3].

2. **Russian Military Response**: The Russian military command may be pulling elements from Donetsk Oblast to address the Kursk situation, though they are "unlikely to pull entire units actively engaged in combat operations from these priority sectors"[2].

3. **Diplomatic Leverage**: Ukraine appears to be using the captured territory as a potential bargaining chip, suggesting they may maintain presence until favorable negotiation conditions emerge[3].

4. **Operational Sustainability**: The Ukrainian advance rate has slowed following Russian reinforcements, indicating potential challenges in maintaining momentum[1].

## Uncertainties and Limitations

Several uncertainties could affect the forecast:

- The exact extent of Ukrainian control in Kursk Oblast remains unclear, with discrepancies between official Ukrainian reporting and ISW's observations[2].
- The full scale of Russia's redeployment of forces to Kursk Oblast is not completely known.
- The impact of the upcoming US election (November 2024) on international support for Ukraine's operations.
- The operation is described as "militarily fraught with risk," suggesting potential vulnerabilities[3].

## Conclusion

Based on available information as of August 21, 2024, Ukraine appears committed to maintaining its position in Kursk Oblast at least in the short term. The incursion serves both tactical purposes (disrupting Russian military operations) and strategic objectives (changing war narratives and creating negotiation leverage). However, sustainability challenges, Russian reinforcements, and international support factors create significant uncertainty about whether Ukraine will maintain this position through October 1, 2024.

The situation remains fluid, with both Ukrainian advances and Russian counterefforts continuing as of mid-August 2024.
