### Key Factual Information for Forecasting

**1. Current Rankings and Status**
- As of the time of the question, Call Her Daddy is ranked #4 and Candace is ranked #5 on the Spotify U.S. Top Podcasts chart.

**2. Historical Trends**
- The top positions on Spotify's podcast charts are highly competitive and can change daily, but shows in the top 5 tend to be relatively stable unless affected by major events or viral episodes[1][3].
- There is no evidence in the available sources of a recent surge or decline for either Call Her Daddy or Candace that would suggest a dramatic change in their relative positions.

**3. Chart Calculation and Dynamics**
- Spotify's podcast charts are determined by daily unique streams and listener engagement, updating every day[3].
- A podcast's position can fluctuate based on new episode releases, viral moments, or significant media coverage, but absent such events, rankings tend to be consistent for established shows[1][3].

**4. Recent Announcements or Policies**
- There are no reported major announcements, controversies, or format changes for either Call Her Daddy or Candace in the available sources that would likely impact their rankings significantly as of March 2025.

**5. Authoritative Sources for Verification**
- The official Spotify Podcast Charts can be checked at podcastcharts.byspotify.com, with settings for United States and Top Podcasts[3].
- Additional ranking information and trends can be found on industry sites like Podscribe and Podchaser, though Spotify's own chart is the resolution source[1][3][5].

**6. Limitations and Uncertainties**
- Chart positions are volatile and can change daily, especially for podcasts ranked closely together.
- No source provides a forward-looking guarantee; this forecast is based on current and historical data, not future events.
- The absence of detailed, up-to-the-minute chart data for late March 2025 means the forecast is probabilistic, not certain.
