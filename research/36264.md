To forecast which podcast will rank higher on Spotify on March 31, 2025 (Call Her Daddy or Candace), I'll analyze the available historical data and trends as of March 2025.

## Historical Performance and Current Status

**Call Her Daddy:**
- Established podcast that has been creating conversation since 2018[5]
- Described as "the most-listened to podcast by women"[5]
- By 2020, it was already the most popular podcast on Spotify[4]
- As of December 2024, it ranked #10 in top podcasts across platforms[3]
- Currently ranked #4 on Spotify (as stated in the question)
- Hosted by Alex Cooper with episodes dropping on Wednesdays and Sundays[5]

**Candace:**
- Relatively new podcast launched in June 2024 following Candace Owens' departure from The Daily Wire in March 2024[1][2]
- Made a strong debut at #45 in the Top 50 Podcasts for Q4 2024[1][2]
- Has shown remarkable growth, moving from #45 in Q4 2024 to #5 currently
- Part of a broader trend of rising conservative talk podcasts in late 2024[1]

## Recent Trends and Contextual Factors

**Growth Trajectory:**
- Candace has demonstrated exceptional upward momentum, climbing approximately 40 positions in the rankings in a relatively short period
- Call Her Daddy has maintained consistent popularity over several years but hasn't shown the same dramatic recent rise

**Political Context:**
- The November 2024 election contributed to several politically-oriented podcasts gaining popularity[1]
- Conservative talk podcasts showed significant growth in Q4 2024, with established voices like Ben Shapiro and Megyn Kelly moving higher in the rankings[1]
- This political podcast trend appears to have benefited Candace

**Audience Loyalty:**
- Edison Research noted that Candace Owens' "loyal audience followed her to her new venture"[1]
- Call Her Daddy has maintained a strong female audience base over multiple years[5]

## Measurement Considerations and Limitations

- The most recent comprehensive ranking data available is from Q4 2024
- The current #4 and #5 positions indicate both podcasts are performing exceptionally well
- Spotify rankings can fluctuate based on current events, guest appearances, and trending topics
- The close proximity in current rankings (#4 vs #5) suggests the competition between these podcasts is tight

Given the remarkable growth trajectory of Candace and the general rise in conservative talk podcasts, contrasted with Call Her Daddy's longer-term consistent performance, this forecast requires weighing recent momentum against established popularity. The March 31 ranking will likely depend on content released in the weeks immediately preceding that date and any notable guests or topics covered by either podcast.
