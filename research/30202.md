### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of October 24, 2024, Rwanda has reported 64 confirmed Marburg virus disease cases and 15 deaths, with most cases among healthcare workers in Kigali[3].
- The CDC has stated that, as of September 30 and October 21, 2024, there have been no cases of Marburg virus disease reported in the United States[1][2].
- The CDC’s risk assessment concludes that the likelihood of Marburg infection in the US general population is extremely low, with no evidence of community transmission in Rwanda’s capital and transmission limited to clusters[2][3].

### Recent Announcements and Policies

- The CDC issued a Health Alert Network advisory on October 3, 2024, informing US clinicians and public health departments about the outbreak in Rwanda and providing recommendations for case identification and laboratory biosafety[4][5].
- CDC has reached out to US-based organizations with staff in affected areas but has not reported any suspected or confirmed US cases[4].
- No new travel restrictions or heightened screening measures have been announced as of the latest updates.

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- CDC official press releases and Health Alert Network advisories[1][4][5].
- CDC’s qualitative risk assessment for Marburg virus[2].
- WHO Disease Outbreak News for international case counts and outbreak status[3].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- There is always a possibility of undetected or delayed cases, but the CDC’s confirmation process is stringent and public.
- Only laboratory-confirmed cases announced by the CDC will count for resolution; suspected or probable cases do not meet the criteria.
- The CDC’s risk assessment is based on available epidemiological data and subject-matter expert analysis, but unforeseen importations, while unlikely, cannot be ruled out entirely.

### Summary Table: Current Marburg Virus Disease Status (as of October 24, 2024)

| Metric                        | Status/Value                  |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Confirmed US MVD cases        | 0                             |
| CDC risk assessment           | Extremely low likelihood      |
| Outbreak location             | Rwanda (mainly Kigali)        |
| Total confirmed cases (Rwanda)| 64                            |
| Total deaths (Rwanda)         | 15                            |
| CDC advisories issued         | Yes (October 2024)            |

### Conclusion

As of November 18, 2024, there is no factual evidence that the CDC has confirmed any case of Marburg virus disease in a US resident. The CDC assesses the risk as extremely low, and no official CDC announcements indicate a confirmed US case. Therefore, based on all available information before January 1, 2025, the likelihood of CDC confirming a Marburg case in a US resident remains very low.
