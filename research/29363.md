**Key Historical Trends and Current Status**

- Google has faced mounting antitrust scrutiny in the US, culminating in two major court decisions against it: one in August 2024 regarding its search monopoly, and a second in April 2025 for monopolizing digital advertising markets[1][4][5].
- In both cases, federal judges found Google liable for maintaining illegal monopolies, with the April 2025 ruling stating Google’s conduct “substantially harmed” publishers and consumers[1][4].
- The DOJ and FTC are actively considering structural remedies, including forced divestitures of major business units such as Chrome and segments of its advertising operations[2][3][4].

**Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Forecast**

- As of May 2025, the DOJ, with support from the FTC, is pursuing aggressive remedies, including forcing Google to share data with competitors and potentially to divest high-profile units (e.g., Chrome)[3].
- The government’s proposals directly mention “breakup plans” and are aimed at restoring competition in online search and advertising[3].
- Remedy hearings are ongoing, and Google has announced its intention to appeal at least part of the rulings[2][4].

**Authoritative Sources for Verification**

- US Department of Justice press releases and court filings detail the government’s case and possible remedies[1][3].
- Federal court decisions (District of Columbia and Virginia) have formally found Google liable for antitrust violations and opened the door for structural remedies[4][5].
- Major news and legal analysis outlets confirm that forced breakup is under active consideration but not yet ordered or executed[2][3][4].

**Limitations and Uncertainties**

- For the question to resolve as “Yes,” the US government must not only order a breakup but see it fully completed—i.e., core divisions like Chrome, YouTube, or Google Ads must be divested and operating as separate companies—by January 1, 2026.
- Google’s appeals and the complexity of designing and implementing a breakup make it unlikely that such structural remedies could be finalized and operational within the specified timeframe, even if ordered in late 2025.
- Historically, major US antitrust breakups (e.g., AT&T, Standard Oil) have taken several years from ruling to full execution, often involving protracted appeals and logistical challenges.
- There is a high probability of continued legal wrangling and potential delays, suggesting that, while a breakup order is plausible in the near term, full completion before 2026 is improbable.

**Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment**

- The probability that the US will fully break up Google (divestiture completed) before January 1, 2026, remains low—best estimated at less than 10%—despite unprecedented legal and regulatory momentum.
- The probability of a breakup order or structural remedy being issued before the deadline is higher but does not meet the strict resolution criteria for completion.
