# Forecasting Analysis: Will the US break up Google before January 1, 2026?

The question of whether the US government will break up Google before January 1, 2026, requires careful analysis of recent antitrust developments and historical precedents for such major regulatory actions.

## Current Status and Recent Developments

Google has recently suffered significant defeats in two major antitrust cases brought by the Department of Justice (DOJ):

1. On August 2024, a federal judge ruled that Google violated Section 2 of the Sherman Act by maintaining monopolies in general search services and general text advertising[2].

2. More recently, on April 17, 2025, Judge Brinkema of the US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia ruled that Google had formed an illegal monopoly in its advertising business[1][4]. The judge found Google liable on two of three counts, concluding that the company had unlawfully monopolized the publisher ad server and ad exchange markets[4].

These rulings represent watershed moments in US antitrust enforcement against Big Tech. The April 2025 decision specifically noted that Google's conduct had "substantially harmed" publishers and "ultimately, consumers of information on the open web"[4].

## Remedy Considerations

As of May 2025, the court has not yet determined remedies for Google's antitrust violations. Judge Brinkema indicated that the court "will set a briefing schedule and hearing date to determine the appropriate remedies"[5]. The DOJ has previously sought "at minimum, the divestiture of Google Ad Manager"[4], which would constitute a partial breakup of Google's business.

On May 9, 2025, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) filed an amicus brief supporting the DOJ's Revised Proposed Final Judgment (RPFJ) related to Google's antitrust violations[2]. This RPFJ proposes that Google be required to share targeted portions of its search index, user, and ads data with certain competitors for a limited period with suitable security and privacy safeguards[2].

## Timeline and Probability Assessment

Several factors affect the likelihood of a Google breakup before January 1, 2026:

**Factors increasing probability:**
- Two significant antitrust rulings against Google within a year
- The DOJ has explicitly sought divestiture remedies
- The FTC's support for the DOJ's proposed remedies
- Increased regulatory focus on tech monopolies

**Factors decreasing probability:**
- Google has announced its intention to appeal the April 2025 ruling[3][4]
- The appeals process could extend beyond January 2026
- Implementing structural remedies (divestiture) typically takes significant time
- The court has not yet scheduled hearings on remedies
- Historical precedent suggests antitrust remedies often take years to implement

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on the current evidence, I estimate a **25-35% probability** that the US will break up Google before January 1, 2026, as defined by the resolution criteria.

While the recent legal victories against Google are significant, several practical constraints make a complete breakup before January 2026 challenging:

1. **Legal timeline:** The remedies phase is just beginning, with briefing schedules not yet set. Google's announced appeals will likely extend the timeline.

2. **Implementation complexity:** Even if divestiture is ordered in 2025, the actual separation of major business units like Google Ads would be complex and time-consuming.

3. **Scope of remedies:** While the DOJ has sought divestiture of Google Ad Manager, it remains unclear whether the court will order the separation of other major divisions specified in the resolution criteria.

4. **Historical precedent:** Major antitrust breakups (like AT&T) typically took years from ruling to implementation.

The most likely outcome appears to be that while significant remedies may be ordered in 2025, the actual completion of any structural separation would extend beyond January 1, 2026, particularly given Google's stated intention to appeal and the complexity of divesting major business units.
