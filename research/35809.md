**1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status**

- On July 25, 2024, Revolut received a UK banking license with restrictions from the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA), entering the standard "mobilisation" phase[1][3].
- The mobilisation phase is routine for new UK banks, allowing them to complete operational setup and regulatory requirements before full launch[1][3].
- Other neobanks such as Monzo, Starling, and Atom Bank have previously undergone similar mobilisation phases, typically lasting up to 12 months[4].
- As of May 2025, Revolut is actively hiring and building out its UK banking operations, with the company expecting to have a staff of around 200 by year-end[4].

**2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric**

- Revolut's UK CEO, Francesca Carlesi, stated in March 2025 that the company remains in open dialogue with regulators and is focused on meeting the highest standards during mobilisation[4].
- Regulators and company representatives have indicated that the mobilisation phase is expected to conclude within 12 months of the July 2024 license award, implying a likely transition to full banking status by July 2025[4].
- No credible reports as of May 2025 suggest additional regulatory hurdles or delays.

**3. Authoritative Sources for Verification**

- The PRA (Prudential Regulation Authority) is the primary authority for official announcements regarding the lifting of restrictions.
- Corporate communications from Revolut and reputable financial news outlets (e.g., Bloomberg, PYMNTS) provide updates on operational progress[1][3][4].

**4. Limitations or Uncertainties in Measurement**

- While the typical 12-month mobilisation period suggests a high likelihood of restrictions being lifted before July 26, 2025, unforeseen regulatory or compliance issues could delay the process.
- Revolut’s large customer base and previous regulatory scrutiny introduce some risk, but no specific obstacles have been reported as of the current date[4].
- The final decision rests with the PRA, and the process is not guaranteed to follow historical timelines exactly.

**Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment**

Given the standard duration of the mobilisation phase, positive regulatory communication, and absence of reported delays, there is a high probability (estimated 80–90%) that the restrictions on Revolut’s UK banking license will be removed before July 26, 2025. However, a small chance of delay remains due to the scale and regulatory complexity of Revolut’s operations.
