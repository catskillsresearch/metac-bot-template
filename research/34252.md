# Texas Drought Forecast Analysis: January 2025

Based on available data as of January 28, 2025, here is an analysis of Texas drought conditions to help forecast whether 15.0 million or more residents will be living in drought areas by March 28, 2025.

## Current Drought Status

As of January 21, 2025, drought conditions ranging from moderate (D1) to exceptional (D4) covered 42.29% of Texas according to the U.S. Drought Monitor[1]. This represents a significant portion of the state experiencing some level of drought.

The drought situation appears to be particularly severe in certain regions:

- Southern New Mexico and far west Texas were experiencing severe (D2) to extreme (D3) drought status as of early January 2025[2]
- Numerous counties across Texas have been officially designated as being in a state of drought disaster[3]

## Recent Trends

The National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) reported that moderate to exceptional drought covered 25.9% of the South region (which includes Texas) as of January 2025, noting this represented a decrease from December 2024 levels[4]. This suggests some improvement in drought conditions across the broader region.

However, the situation remains serious enough that on January 22, 2025, Governor Greg Abbott amended and renewed a drought disaster proclamation that was initially issued on July 8, 2022[3]. The proclamation specifically declared a disaster in 76 Texas counties due to persistent drought conditions, including:

- Major population centers such as Bexar (San Antonio), Travis (Austin), and Williamson counties
- Numerous counties in West Texas, South Texas, and Central Texas regions[3]

## Policy Responses

Local water authorities have implemented drought management measures:

- The Central Texas Groundwater Conservation District voted on December 20, 2024, to impose mandatory reductions for permitted water users, requiring a 15% decrease from total annual permitted production volumes for non-exempt permit holders effective January 1, 2025[5]
- These restrictions are scheduled to remain in effect until December 31, 2025, unless terminated earlier[5]

## Hydrological Impacts

The drought has significantly affected water resources:

- Elephant Butte storage was at only 9.8% capacity in early January 2025, which represents an increase from the previous month but remains well below the 30-year median[2]
- The Rio Grande water had mostly dried up south of the Caballo Dam and was expected to remain dry through Spring 2025[2]
- Soil moisture was reported as very low in early January 2025[2]

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

The most authoritative source for tracking drought conditions in Texas is the U.S. Drought Monitor, which provides regular updates on drought coverage and intensity. The Texas Water Development Board also maintains drought data specific to Texas[1][2].

For official government responses to drought conditions, the Office of the Texas Governor provides information on disaster declarations related to drought[3].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors create uncertainty in forecasting drought conditions for March 2025:

1. Weather patterns can change rapidly, potentially bringing relief through precipitation or exacerbating conditions through continued dry weather
2. The drought data available is from January 2025, leaving a two-month gap to the March 28 forecast date
3. Population distribution relative to drought areas is not explicitly provided in the available data, making it difficult to precisely estimate how many residents are affected
