# Denver Rent Growth Forecast Analysis: May 2025

As of June 2, 2025, I've analyzed the available data to provide a forecast assessment of Denver's year-over-year rent growth for May 2025 according to Zillow's metrics.

## Current Market Status

The most recent data indicates that as of May 2025, Denver's rental market has shown remarkable stability in year-over-year terms. According to comprehensive market updates, the average rent for single-family homes in Denver currently stands at $3,100, reflecting a month-over-month increase of $52 but no change on a year-over-year basis[5].

This contrasts with the national rental market, where the Zillow Observed Rent Index (ZORI) showed a 3.4% year-over-year increase as of April 2025, with the typical U.S. asking rent climbing to $2,024[4].

## Key Factors Affecting Denver's Rental Market

Several factors appear to be influencing Denver's rental market performance:

1. **Housing Value Trends**: Denver's housing market has experienced a 2.8% decline in home values over the past year, with the average home value at $568,754[1]. This downward pressure on home prices may be creating spillover effects in the rental market.

2. **Market Activity**: Denver currently has 951 available rentals with properties staying on the market for an average of 37 days[5], indicating moderate market liquidity.

3. **Economic Drivers**: The city's tech and healthcare sectors continue to support rental demand, offsetting potential downward pressures[5].

4. **Suburban Competition**: While Denver proper shows flat year-over-year growth, nearby Highlands Ranch has seen more substantial rental growth of $140 year-over-year, potentially drawing demand away from the core urban area[5].

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on the available data as of June 2, 2025, the year-over-year increase in rent in Denver, CO in May 2025, according to Zillow's Observed Rent Index, is most likely to be reported as 0%[5].

The probability distribution for this metric appears to be:
- **Most likely outcome (70% probability)**: 0% year-over-year change, consistent with current reporting
- **Upside scenario (15% probability)**: 0.1% to 1.0% increase, if late-month data shows slight improvement
- **Downside scenario (15% probability)**: -0.5% to -1.0%, if final calculations reveal a slight decline

This assessment is based on the most recent available data point indicating "no year-over-year change" in Denver rents as of May 2025[5].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors could affect the final reported figure:

1. **Methodology Differences**: The reported "no year-over-year change" for single-family homes may differ from Zillow's official ZORI calculation, which includes all homes plus multifamily units.

2. **Data Revisions**: Zillow occasionally revises historical data, which could affect the final published year-over-year figure.

3. **Reporting Lags**: The most recent data point is from May 21, 2025, so additional rental activity in the final days of May could potentially impact the final calculation.

4. **Seasonal Adjustments**: The ZORI methodology includes various adjustments that may result in slight differences between preliminary and final figures.

Given these considerations, while the most likely outcome is 0% year-over-year change, the final reported figure may vary slightly when officially published in Zillow's data repository.
