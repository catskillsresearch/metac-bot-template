# Assessment of Russian Control of Chasiv Yar by January 30, 2025

Based on available information as of January 2025, I'll analyze the current situation in Chasiv Yar and factors relevant to forecasting Russian control by January 30, 2025.

## Current Status of Chasiv Yar (as of late January 2025)

As of January 21-22, 2025, Chasiv Yar remains contested, with both Russian and Ukrainian forces maintaining positions within the city. Russian forces have made notable advances in central Chasiv Yar, confirmed by geolocated footage published on January 21, 2025[3]. Russian military elements, including the "Shustry" Detachment of Chechen Akhmat Spetsnaz, have been documented operating south of Chasiv Yar, indicating recent Russian advances in that area[3].

The strategically important Refractory Plant in central Chasiv Yar has been a focal point of fighting. Russian milbloggers claimed that Russian forces cleared the plant, though independent confirmation of this claim was not available as of January 21[3]. Ukraine's Luhansk Group of Forces Spokesperson Colonel Dmytro Zaporozhets stated on January 21 that Russian forces were leveraging poor weather conditions with limited visibility to accumulate in northern Chasiv Yar and assault the Refractory Plant[3].

As of January 22, 2025, Ukraine still controlled a former brick factory in Chasiv Yar after repelling a Russian assault, though Russian troops were "moving in the direction of the factory"[4]. This suggests that while Russia has made advances, Ukraine still maintained control of key positions within the city.

## Recent Military Developments

Throughout January 2025, Russian forces conducted consistent offensive operations in the Chasiv Yar direction:

- January 3, 2025: Russian forces attacked within and near Chasiv Yar itself and south of Chasiv Yar near Bila Hora, Predtechyne, and Stupochky, though no confirmed advances were reported[2].
- January 11-12, 2025: Russian forces continued offensive operations within and near Chasiv Yar and south of Chasiv Yar near Bila Hora and Stupochky[1].
- January 19, 2025: Both Russian and Ukrainian forces advanced in Chasiv Yar amid continued offensive operations[5].
- January 20-21, 2025: Russian forces continued attacking near Chasiv Yar itself, south of Chasiv Yar toward Stupochky, and northwest of Chasiv Yar toward Fedorivka[3].

Russian forces have employed "small assault groups of three to eight people" in Chasiv Yar, a tactic described by Ukrainian military spokesman Dmytro Zaporozhets as "effective" because "dispersed small assault groups are harder to deal with all the time"[4].

## Strategic Importance

Chasiv Yar holds significant strategic value for both sides. Before the full-scale invasion, it was home to approximately 12,000 people, but as of January 22, 2025, only 229 civilians remained, mostly elderly people, people with disabilities, and their caretakers[4].

The town would represent a major prize for Russia's military because of its proximity to the larger towns of Kostyantynivka and Kramatorsk, which are important bases for the Ukrainian military[4]. Capturing Chasiv Yar would potentially allow Russian forces to advance toward these larger strategic objectives.

## Factors Affecting the Forecast

Several factors may influence whether Russia will control Chasiv Yar by January 30, 2025:

1. **Recent Russian Advances**: Confirmed Russian advances in central Chasiv Yar by January 21 suggest momentum in Russia's favor[3].

2. **Ukrainian Counteractions**: Ukrainian forces recaptured some lost positions near Chasiv Yar as of January 19, demonstrating their capability to contest Russian advances[5].

3. **Russian Military Presence**: Multiple Russian units have been identified operating in the area, including elements of the Russian 299th Airborne Regiment, "Hispaniola" Volunteer Brigade, and the 200th Motorized Rifle Brigade[3], indicating a substantial commitment of forces.

4. **Tactical Approach**: Russia's use of small assault groups has been described as effective in the urban environment of Chasiv Yar[4].

5. **Weather Conditions**: Russian forces have been leveraging poor weather conditions with limited visibility to their advantage in assaults on key positions[3].

## Conclusion

As of late January 2025, Russian forces have made significant advances in Chasiv Yar, particularly in the central part of the city, but have not yet secured full control. Ukrainian forces continue to hold some key positions, including a brick factory as of January 22[4]. 

Given the pace of Russian advances documented throughout January, the multiple Russian units operating in the area, and the effectiveness of their small-group tactics, there appears to be substantial momentum toward Russian gains in Chasiv Yar. However, Ukrainian forces have demonstrated the ability to recapture some positions and continue to contest key areas of the city.

The situation remains fluid, with active combat ongoing and both sides making tactical adjustments. The outcome by January 30, 2025, will likely depend on whether Ukrainian forces can maintain their remaining positions against continued Russian pressure.
