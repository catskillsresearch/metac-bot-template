# Forecasting William Ruto's Presidency Status Before October 1, 2024

As of May 2024, William Ruto remains the President of Kenya, having been sworn in on September 13, 2022, after winning the presidential election on August 9, 2022[5]. To assess the likelihood of Ruto ceasing to be President before October 1, 2024, I'll examine relevant historical and current factors.

## Current Political Status

President William Ruto has been facing significant political challenges in 2024. Political commentator Boniface Mwangi has expressed doubts about Ruto's political longevity, suggesting he might be a one-term president if he survives certain political challenges[1]. This indicates substantial political pressure on the current administration.

Despite these challenges, Ruto has maintained his international diplomatic engagements. On May 23, 2024, he participated in a joint press conference with U.S. President Biden during an official state visit to the United States[3][4]. This was particularly significant as it marked the first time in two decades that an African president received such an invitation[4].

## Domestic Challenges

Domestically, Ruto has faced criticism regarding his administration's priorities. During the joint press conference with President Biden, Ruto was questioned about committing Kenyan police forces to Haiti while security issues remained unresolved in parts of Kenya, specifically in counties like Baringo, West Pokot, and Turkana where schools had not opened due to banditry problems[3].

In response, Ruto affirmed his commitment to addressing domestic security issues, stating: "I made a commitment to the people of Kenya to sort out insecurity in the North Rift. I have followed that with action. As we talk, there are 3,000 military officers in the North Rift, 2,000 police officers in the North Rift. We have renovated the first 15 schools and completed â€” we have reopened 20 schools already that were closed in the North Rift."[3]

## Government Initiatives and Challenges

Ruto's administration has been working on several initiatives, including:

1. Universal Health Coverage reforms to address challenges in the healthcare system[2]
2. Releasing funds (KSh 2.5 billion) to pay debts owed to hospitals by the defunct National Hospital Insurance Fund[2]
3. Implementing a nationwide livestock vaccination program[2]
4. Urging public servants to improve service delivery, with Ruto cautioning against "failing Kenyans on service delivery"[2]

However, these initiatives occur against a backdrop of political pressure and public dissatisfaction with aspects of his governance.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors limit our ability to forecast Ruto's status with certainty:

1. Constitutional processes for removing a president in Kenya require specific legal procedures that take time to implement
2. The intensity and sustainability of public protests can be difficult to predict
3. Political alliances in Kenya can shift rapidly
4. International support or pressure can influence domestic political outcomes

## Conclusion

Based on available information as of May 2024, while President Ruto faces significant political challenges, there is insufficient evidence to conclusively predict he will cease to be President before October 1, 2024. He continues to engage in international diplomacy and implement domestic policies, suggesting a functioning presidency despite the challenges. However, the political situation appears volatile, with vocal opposition to his leadership.
