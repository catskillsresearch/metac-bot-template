## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The U.S. Supreme Court has consisted of nine justices since the Judiciary Act of 1869[3]. 
- Any change to this number requires Congressional legislation, which must pass both chambers and be signed by the President (or passed over a veto).
- Multiple recent efforts to expand the Court, such as the Judiciary Acts of 2021 and 2023, have been introduced by Democrats but failed to advance due to lack of support, even within the party[3][4].
- There is also a countervailing trend: in January 2025, a "Keep the Nine" constitutional amendment was re-introduced, aiming to lock the number of justices at nine[2]. This reflects significant resistance to court expansion.

## 2. Recent Announcements and Policies

- In May 2023, Democrats in Congress reintroduced the Judiciary Act of 2023 to add four justices, but it has not progressed out of committee[4].
- In 2025, legislative activity has focused more on protecting the current size than expanding it, as exemplified by renewed efforts to constitutionally fix the number at nine[2].
- No major party—neither the current congressional majority nor the presidential administration—has prioritized court expansion in their legislative agenda in 2025.

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Congressional bills and government websites maintain public records of all legislative activity related to the Supreme Court's size[1][2][4].
- The Supreme Court's own website and major legal reference resources, such as the U.S. Code, provide up-to-date status on statutory mandates for the Court's size[3].

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- Legislative shocks (such as an unexpected shift in congressional composition or an extraordinary Supreme Court decision) could alter the political calculus suddenly, but no such event is currently visible.
- While partisan tensions remain high, and some observers argue that court-packing could be revived as a live issue if the Court blocks signature executive policies, the procedural and political obstacles are significant and persistent.
- Forecasting longer-term institutional changes is inherently uncertain, especially in a volatile political environment.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given historical inertia, lack of legislative momentum, active resistance to expansion, and the current composition and priorities of Congress, the probability that the size of the U.S. Supreme Court will increase before January 1, 2029 is **very low**—likely below 10%.
