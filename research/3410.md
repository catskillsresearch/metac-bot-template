## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The global average atmospheric CO₂ concentration in 2023 was 419.31 ppm[3].
- In 2024, the global average jumped to approximately 422.7–422.8 ppm—a record high[1][4].
- The annual increase in 2024 was 3.75 ppm, the largest on record, driven by a strong El Niño, record global temperatures, drought, and major forest fires[1].
- The Mauna Loa Observatory reported an annual average of 424.61 ppm in 2024, also a new record[1].
- Forecasts for 2025 project an increase of 2.26 ± 0.56 ppm over 2024, suggesting a 2025 average near 425 ppm[5].

## 2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- No new global policy between 2019 and 2024 has produced a measurable, immediate downturn in atmospheric CO₂ growth rates. Emissions from fossil fuels and cement are expected to reach new highs in 2024, despite some slowing in growth rate[4].
- Natural variability, particularly strong El Niño years, has amplified the recent increases in atmospheric CO₂[1].

- UK Met Office CO₂ Forecasts[5]

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- There is slight variation between global averages and Mauna Loa-specific measurements, but both show the same upward trend.
- Short-term anomalies (e.g., El Niño, wildfires) cause year-to-year fluctuations, but the underlying trend is robustly upward[1].
- Forecasts may have small uncertainties (±0.56 ppm for the 2025 projection), but these are not large enough to alter the overall conclusion[5].

## Conclusion: Probabilistic Assessment

Given that:
- 2024’s global average is already about 422.8 ppm,
- The forecast for 2025 is around 425 ppm,
- The average for 2024–2027 would require a significant drop in emissions and/or atmospheric concentration for the mean to be ≤423.89 ppm,

**It is extremely likely (>99% probability) that the global average CO₂ concentration over 2024–2027 will exceed 423.89 ppm.** The observed trend is above the RCP4.5 scenario, and no data suggest a reversal or plateau in the next several years[1][3][5].
