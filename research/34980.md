### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Since the fall of Bashar al-Assad, Turkey has strengthened relations with Syria's new interim government, supporting reconstruction and expanding trade and economic ties[3][5].
- The idea of a maritime demarcation agreement, modeled after Turkey's 2019 deal with Libya, has gained traction as both countries seek to define their Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ) in the Eastern Mediterranean, unlocking potential for energy exploration and cooperation[1][2][4].
- Turkish companies are actively preparing for increased investment and operations in Syria, and both governments have discussed the need for a maritime border agreement as part of broader normalization efforts[3].

### Recent Announcements and Policies

- Turkish officials, including the Transport and Infrastructure Minister, have publicly stated that Turkey aims to strike a maritime demarcation agreement with Syria "when the time is right," but emphasized that certain conditions—such as the establishment of stable authority in Syria—must be met first[4].
- As of early February 2025, Turkish and Syrian delegations have held high-level meetings to discuss energy, trade, and infrastructure, with the maritime agreement frequently mentioned as a priority but not yet finalized[3][4].
- Media reports from late December 2024 and early 2025 confirm that advanced talks are underway, and the agreement is on the agenda, but no official signing has occurred[2][5].

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Statements from Turkish government ministers and the interim Syrian president, as reported by reputable outlets such as Daily Sabah, Atalayar, and Euractiv, provide the most direct evidence of the current status and intentions[1][3][4][5].
- Trade data and economic cooperation initiatives further corroborate the warming relations and the likelihood of future agreements[3].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- As of February 14, 2025, no maritime demarcation agreement has been signed or officially announced between Turkey and Syria[4][5].
- The process is contingent on further stabilization in Syria and the establishment of recognized authority, as well as ongoing negotiations and potential regional pushback from other Mediterranean actors[1][4].
- The unpredictability of regional politics and the complexity of the issues involved mean that, while prospects are strong, the timing of any agreement remains uncertain.

### Conclusion

Based on all available factual information as of February 14, 2025, Turkey and Syria are in advanced talks and have expressed strong mutual interest in signing a maritime demarcation agreement. However, no agreement has been signed or officially announced by this date. Therefore, while the probability of an agreement in the near future is high, there is no definitive evidence to forecast that the agreement will be signed before April 1, 2025.
