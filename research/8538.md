## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- In 2020, battery electric vehicles (BEVs) accounted for about 1.4–1.6% of new US light-duty vehicle (LDV) sales, with all plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs, including PHEVs) at 2.1%[1].
- By 2021, PEV market share (BEVs + PHEVs) had risen to above 3.5%[1].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- The US federal government and several states have introduced purchase incentives, infrastructure investments, and regulatory targets to encourage electric vehicle adoption.
- The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), passed in 2022, provides long-term tax incentives and funding for EVs and related infrastructure, though the full impact on BEV market share depends on implementation details and future policy continuity[3][5].

## Authoritative Forecasts and Reference Cases

| Source                | Scenario/Assumptions                | 2050 BEV/PEV Share of New US LDV Sales |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| EIA (Annual Outlook)  | Reference Case (current policies)   | 13–29% (PEVs; BEVs likely a subset)    |
| Energy Innovation     | Aggressive policy, tech, oil prices | 65–75% (BEVs)                          |
| IEA (2021, for 2030)  | STEPS (current) / SDS (ambitious)   | 10.7% / 36.3% (BEVs, 2030)             |

- EIA’s projections through 2050 rely on policies and technology trends as of late 2022, with battery cost declines (51–56% drop by 2050) driving increased adoption, but the Reference Case is cautious and includes both BEVs and PHEVs[3][5].
- Energy Innovation’s more optimistic scenario assumes faster technological progress and/or higher oil prices, leading to much greater BEV adoption[1].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- EIA’s Reference Case may underestimate future BEV adoption if new policies or regulations are enacted after November 2022.
- Aggressive scenarios depend on factors that are not guaranteed, such as rapid declines in battery cost, high oil prices, or significant new policy mandates.
- Consumer acceptance, charging infrastructure, supply chain stability, and technological breakthroughs could all shift the trajectory significantly.
- Measurement is based on percentage of new LDV sales (not total vehicles in use) and relies on consistent definitions of LDVs and BEVs.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment (as of Jan 2022)

- **Conservative baseline** (EIA Reference Case): BEVs likely below 29% of new US LDV sales in 2050.
- **Moderate scenario** (accounting for likely policy tightening and tech improvements): 30–50%.
- **Aggressive scenario** (rapid tech, high oil prices, strong policy): 65–75%.

Given the reference cases and uncertainties, a reasonable central estimate for the percentage of new US LDV sales that will be all-electric (BEVs) in 2050 is **30–50%**, with a right tail (but lower probability) for 65% or higher if favorable conditions align[1][3][5].
