## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The Supreme Court's 2023 *Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard* decision ended race-conscious admissions, increasing scrutiny of university DEI and diversity-related programs.
- As of April 2025, the EEOC has opened a Title VII investigation into Harvard, focusing on potential discrimination against white, Asian, male, or straight individuals in areas such as hiring, promotion, and career development programs—areas often associated with DEI initiatives[1].
- The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) revoked Harvard’s SEVP certification in May 2025, citing concerns about viewpoint diversity and compliance with federal regulations. However, this action is not a DOJ or DOE civil rights investigation into diversity-related programs[2].
- The DOJ has announced a False Claims Act investigation into Harvard, but this is related to alleged fraud, not civil rights compliance or discrimination regarding diversity programs[3].

## Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- Federal authorities have required Harvard to implement merit-based admissions, cease all preferences based on race or other protected characteristics, and conduct comprehensive viewpoint diversity audits, with ongoing federal oversight and mandatory public reporting starting August 2025[4].
- These actions indicate a significant increase in federal scrutiny, especially regarding compliance with anti-discrimination laws and the dismantling of traditional DEI practices.

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Official press releases or public statements from the DOJ or DOE regarding the opening of a civil rights or Title VI compliance investigation into Harvard’s diversity-related programs.
- News reports from credible outlets documenting such an announcement and explicitly citing discrimination or preference concerns tied to DEI or diversity programs.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- The EEOC’s Title VII investigation is significant but does not satisfy the strict resolution criteria, as it is not a DOJ or DOE civil rights or Title VI investigation[1].
- Actions by other agencies (DHS, DOJ False Claims, etc.) do not count unless they are announced as civil rights or Title VI compliance investigations into diversity-related programs.
- Political and regulatory environments are volatile and could result in a rapid shift, but as of January 31, 2025, no qualifying investigation has been publicly announced.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

- Given the heightened scrutiny, ongoing investigations by other agencies, and federal demands for policy changes, the probability of a DOJ or DOE civil rights investigation into Harvard’s diversity-related programs before 2026 is elevated compared to past years.
- However, as of January 31, 2025, no such investigation has been officially announced, so the current factual likelihood remains below 50%, but with an upward trend if current pressures persist.
