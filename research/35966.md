# PEPFAR Funding Status as of March 2025

As of early March 2025, PEPFAR (President's Emergency Plan For AIDS Relief) funding remains in a precarious position due to both the foreign aid funding freeze implemented by the Trump administration and upcoming reauthorization challenges. Below is an analysis of the current situation based on information available as of March 12, 2025.

## Current Status of PEPFAR Funding

On January 20, 2025, the U.S. Department of State announced an immediate 90-day pause for all U.S. foreign assistance, including activities supported by PEPFAR[2]. This freeze has significantly impacted the global AIDS response, affecting programs in numerous countries that rely on PEPFAR funding.

As of March 5, 2025, PEPFAR received a waiver to restart critical HIV services, representing a partial resumption of funding[5]. However, many of its activities continue to be suspended indefinitely, including programs for girls, young women, orphans, and vulnerable children[5]. This partial resumption suggests some recognition of PEPFAR's critical importance but falls short of full funding restoration.

## Timeline and Upcoming Deadlines

The current situation involves two critical timelines:

1. **Foreign Aid Funding Freeze**: Implemented on January 20, 2025, the 90-day pause would theoretically end around April 20, 2025, absent any changes[2].

2. **PEPFAR Reauthorization**: More urgently, PEPFAR's current authorization expires on March 25, 2025[4]. This deadline represents a significant hurdle, as it requires congressional action to continue the program regardless of the funding freeze situation.

## Political Context and Challenges

PEPFAR faces an uncertain future due to deepening political divisions and growing skepticism about foreign aid[4]. The program received only a one-year reauthorization in its previous cycle, indicating eroding bipartisan consensus that had historically supported the program[4].

Experts from Duke University have proposed strategic reforms that could reduce program costs by approximately 20% in five years, suggesting pathways for preserving PEPFAR while modernizing its operations[4]. These proposals include frameworks for countries to gradually assume financial responsibility for HIV prevention and treatment programs.

## Funding Levels and Budget Requests

For fiscal year 2025, the President requested $6.1 billion for PEPFAR[3]. To date, PEPFAR funding has totaled approximately $120 billion since its inception, with funding reaching $6.5 billion in FY 2024[3]. This represents a significant portion of U.S. global health funding, ranging from 51% to 55% over the past five years[3].

## Assessment of Resumption Likelihood

Based on the available information as of March 12, 2025, several factors will influence whether PEPFAR funding will be fully resumed before April 7, 2025:

1. The partial waiver already granted for critical HIV services suggests some recognition of PEPFAR's importance[5].

2. The March 25, 2025 reauthorization deadline will likely force congressional action one way or another before the April 7 date in question[4].

3. Reform proposals that reduce costs while maintaining effectiveness may provide a compromise path forward[4].

4. The Congressional Caucus on Black Women and Girls has actively engaged with this issue, hosting a briefing with global health experts to discuss a path forward for PEPFAR during the funding freeze[5].

The situation remains fluid, with significant uncertainty about whether full funding will be restored by the April 7, 2025 deadline. The partial resumption of critical services indicates some movement toward restoration, but many programs remain suspended as of early March 2025.
