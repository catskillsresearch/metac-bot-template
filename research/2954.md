## Factual Basis as of 2019-07-26

**Key Historical Trends and Current Status**
- The world population has increased rapidly since the industrial revolution, reaching about 7.7 billion in 2019.
- Growth rates peaked in the mid-20th century and have since slowed, with most regions experiencing declining fertility rates.
- The United Nations’ landmark 2004 projection (“World Population to 2300”) forecasts that, under its central scenario, world population will peak at 9.22 billion around 2075, then slowly decline and stabilize at approximately 8.97 billion by 2300[1][5].
- Alternate scenarios exist: the low scenario projects 2.3 billion by 2300, and the high scenario projects up to 36 billion, highlighting enormous uncertainty over centuries[4].
- Africa is expected to contribute most to future population growth, while other regions stabilize or decline[5].
- All scenarios assume no civilization-ending catastrophes and that fertility, after falling below replacement, eventually returns to replacement levels[1][5].

**Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric**
- No major policy shifts as of 2019 radically alter the 2300 outlook. Global initiatives focus on health, sustainable development, and slowing population growth in high-fertility regions.
- The main demographic uncertainties remain the pace of Africa’s demographic transition and global adaptation to climate, technology, and health challenges.

**Authoritative Sources for Verification**
- United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, “World Population to 2300”[1][5]
- Rockefeller University summary of UN projections[3]
- Secondary summaries (e.g., Business Insider, Wikipedia)[2][4]

**Limitations and Uncertainties**
- Projections to 2300 are inherently uncertain. Small changes in fertility or mortality assumptions compound over centuries.
- Possibility of technological, environmental, or socio-political disruption (e.g., pandemics, wars, radical life extension, etc.) is real but not included in base projections.
- The “biological human” definition excludes artificial entities and restricts the count to those with clear biological ancestry, as specified.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

**Conditional on there being more than 500 million biological humans alive on December 31, 2300:**
- The UN’s central (medium) projection is about **8.97 billion**[1][5].
- There is substantial uncertainty, with plausible values ranging from **2.3 billion** (low scenario) to **36 billion** (high scenario), but the distribution is strongly peaked around 9 billion given current demographic trends and conditional on avoiding global catastrophe[4][5].
- The most credible forecast, based on authoritative reference cases and current trends, is **8.9–9 billion**.
