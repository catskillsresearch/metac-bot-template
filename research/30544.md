# Forecasting Supreme Court Approval Rating for December 30, 2024

To assess whether the Supreme Court's approval rating will reach or exceed 41.0% by December 30, 2024, I'll analyze historical trends, recent developments, and factors that could influence public opinion in the coming months.

## Historical Approval Rating Trends

The Supreme Court's approval rating has fluctuated significantly in recent years:

- At the end of 2020, the Court had an approval rating of 42% and a disapproval rating of 33%, resulting in a net approval rating of +10 percentage points[1].
- Following controversial rulings, particularly the Dobbs decision overturning Roe v. Wade in June 2022, the Court's approval declined to 39% with a 48% disapproval rate, creating a net approval rating of -8 percentage points[1].
- By June 2023, the Court's approval rating had rebounded to 42%, though its net approval remained slightly negative at -2 points[1].
- The Court's popularity hit an all-time low in May 2024, with a net approval rating of -22.8 percentage points[5].
- By the end of the 2024 term, the net approval rating had improved slightly to -17.2 points, though this still represented the lowest end-of-term approval since tracking began in 2021[5].

This data shows that while net approval has fluctuated dramatically, the actual approval percentage has remained relatively stable between 39-42% despite significant shifts in disapproval rates.

## Partisan Divide in Court Approval

A key factor in the Court's overall approval rating is the growing partisan divide:

- In early 2021, Democrats and Republicans approved of the Court at nearly identical rates (46% and 45% respectively)[1].
- This gap widened dramatically, reaching a peak of 39 percentage points during the 2022 midterm election season[1].
- After the midterms, the partisan gap narrowed to about 25 points, primarily due to a 10-point increase in Democratic approval since mid-August 2022[1].

This partisan dynamic suggests that political events, including the 2024 presidential election and its aftermath, could significantly influence Court approval ratings through the end of 2024.

## Recent Court Decisions and Public Reaction

The Court's 2024 term featured several high-profile and generally unpopular decisions that continued to erode public confidence:

- The Court's decisions in 2024 contributed to historically low approval ratings, surpassing even the negative reaction to the Dobbs decision in 2022[5].
- Public confidence in the Court has declined significantly, with an AP-NORC poll from June 2024 showing only 16% of respondents having a "great deal" of confidence in the Supreme Court, down from 28% in February 2020[5].
- A Marquette University Law School poll from May 2024 found a similar 15 percentage point decline in public confidence over the previous four years[5].

## Timing of Court Decisions and Impact on Approval

An important pattern has emerged in how the Court releases controversial decisions:

- Since 2021, the Court has released a majority of its conservative-only decisions in the final days of the term[5].
- These unpopular rulings typically reduce average public support by over 10 points[5].
- This timing strategy appears designed to minimize public backlash by announcing opinions after media narratives about the term have solidified and right before the July Fourth holiday when public attention is lower[5].

## Forecast Considerations for December 2024

Several factors will likely influence the Court's approval rating by December 30, 2024:

1. **Post-election dynamics**: The aftermath of the 2024 presidential election could significantly impact public perception of the Court, especially if there are any election-related cases.

2. **Fall 2024 term decisions**: The Court's decisions in the first few months of its new term (which begins in October) could affect public opinion by December.

3. **Partisan trends**: The narrowing partisan gap observed after the 2022 midterms suggests that post-election periods may see some moderation in partisan views of the Court.

4. **Baseline stability**: Despite significant fluctuations in net approval, the Court's approval percentage has remained relatively stable in the 39-42% range over recent years.

## Conclusion

Based on the available data, the Supreme Court's approval rating has demonstrated resilience in the 39-42% range despite significant negative shifts in net approval. The most recent specific approval figure mentioned was 42% in June 2023, though net approval has worsened significantly since then.

Given the Court's historically low net approval at the end of the 2024 term (-17.2 points), the continued erosion of public confidence shown in multiple polls, and the pattern of unpopular decisions, reaching an approval rating of 41.0% or higher by December 30, 2024, would require a significant positive shift in public opinion during the fall.

However, the post-election period could potentially moderate partisan views, as observed after the 2022 midterms. The question of whether approval will reach 41.0% remains uncertain based on current trends, but historical data suggests it's within the range of possibility despite recent negative sentiment.
