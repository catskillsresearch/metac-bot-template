## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Ivory Coast has a recent history of contentious presidential elections, with candidates sometimes disqualified on legal or technical grounds[3].
- For the 2025 election, the official list of declared candidates includes all five named individuals: Gnangbo Kacou, Laurent Gbagbo, Pascal Affi N'Guessan, Jean-Louis Billon, and Simone Gbagbo[1].
- As of March 2025, Laurent Gbagbo has been excluded from the provisional electoral list due to a previous conviction related to the 2010-2011 post-election crisis[4]. This exclusion has been widely reported and has led to public protests and calls for his reinstatement.
- The other four candidates—Gnangbo Kacou, Pascal Affi N'Guessan, Jean-Louis Billon, and Simone Gbagbo—have not been reported as disqualified or removed from the electoral list as of May 30, 2025[1][4].

## Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- The publication of the provisional electoral list in March 2025 confirmed the exclusion of Laurent Gbagbo, as well as Charles Blé Goudé (not one of the named candidates)[4].
- Judicial and political appeals are ongoing, with opposition groups challenging the exclusion and demanding reinstatement[4].
- There is no evidence of new legal proceedings or administrative actions targeting the candidacy of Kacou, N'Guessan, Billon, or Simone Gbagbo[1][4].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Wikipedia's 2025 Ivorian presidential election entry for the current official candidate list and disqualification status[1].
- Africanews and RFI reports for the exclusion of Gbagbo and legal context[4][5].

## Limitations or Uncertainties

- The exclusion of Laurent Gbagbo, while confirmed on the provisional list, could be reversed by court or administrative action before July 1, 2025. There is ongoing political pressure for such a reversal[4].
- The absence of disqualification for the other candidates is only as current as the latest available news; sudden legal actions or administrative rulings remain possible.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

- As of May 30, 2025, at least one of the named candidates—Laurent Gbagbo—has been removed from the electoral list and is legally ineligible to run, meeting the resolution criteria for a "Yes" outcome.
- Given the current status and media coverage, the probability that this exclusion will not be reversed before July 1, 2025, is high, although not absolute due to ongoing legal challenges.

> **Forecast**: YES, at least one of the specified candidates (Laurent Gbagbo) has been disqualified from running in the 2025 Ivorian presidential election as of May 30, 2025[4].
