## Key Trends and Current Status

- Proposition 12 took full effect in California on January 1, 2024, after surviving extensive legal challenges, culminating in a 5-4 U.S. Supreme Court decision upholding the law against Dormant Commerce Clause objections[4].
- The law sets minimum space requirements for veal calves, breeding pigs, and egg-laying hens, and prohibits the sale in California of meat or eggs not produced to those standards, even if produced out of state[2][5].
- The implementation has resulted in increased prices for pork and eggs and significant adjustments by producers nationwide to comply with California's market demands[2][3].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- As of May 2025, Proposition 12 remains enforced and its requirements are being applied to all relevant products sold in California[1][2].
- There is ongoing political and industry pressure to overturn or preempt Proposition 12 at the federal level, most notably via the House-passed Farm Bill, which includes language that would prohibit states from enforcing production standards on out-of-state pork and veal sold within their borders[5].
- The Farm Bill is a point of significant contention, facing opposition from some Republicans, farmers, and consumer groups. There is no guarantee it will become law in its current form or before January 2026[5].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- California Department of Education confirms the state is operating under Proposition 12 requirements as of 2025[1].
- Illinois Farm Bureau, Washington Policy Center, and others provide background on legal, economic, and policy developments related to Proposition 12’s implementation and challenges[2][3][4].
- Sentient Media and other outlets report on the political dynamics surrounding attempts to federally preempt Proposition 12[5].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- The primary uncertainty is the potential for federal preemption via the Farm Bill or other national legislation. If such a bill passes and becomes law before January 1, 2026, it would nullify Proposition 12’s effect on pork and veal (but not eggs), and the question would resolve “No.”
- The legislative process for the Farm Bill is unpredictable; farm bills often face delays and amendments, and bipartisan opposition to preemption language makes passage uncertain as of May 2025[5].
- No new major court challenges appear likely to succeed given the Supreme Court’s recent decision[4].

## Probabilistic Assessment

Given the current status, existing legal precedent, and the uncertain but real risk of federal preemption, there is a moderate-to-high probability (estimated 60–75%) that California’s Proposition 12 will still be in effect on January 1, 2026. This estimate could change rapidly if Congress advances the Farm Bill with preemption language in the latter half of 2025.
