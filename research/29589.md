### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The 2023–2024 US influenza season was moderately severe, with activity beginning to rise in early November and peaking in late December. This timing is consistent with pre-pandemic flu seasons, where hospitalizations typically start increasing in November and accelerate through December[1].
- For the 2023–2024 season, there were approximately 390,000 flu-related hospitalizations, with a rate of 81.8 per 100,000—the highest since 2017[5]. The cumulative hospitalization rate was higher than the previous five seasons[4].
- In recent years, weekly hospitalizations in late November have generally ranged from 1,000 to 5,000, depending on the season's severity and whether the flu wave started early or late. For example, during the 2022–2023 season, the CDC estimated over 192,000 hospitalizations among people aged 65 and older, with total hospitalizations for all ages much higher[2].

### Recent Announcements and Policies

- As of early November 2024, the CDC had not yet begun updating the FluSight Forecast Hub dataset with numbers from the 2024–2025 season, so no real-time data or forecasts for the week ending Nov 23, 2024, are available[1].
- No new national policies or interventions specifically affecting influenza hospitalization rates for the 2024–2025 season have been reported as of the cutoff date.

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The CDC’s FluSight Forecast Hub and the associated hospitalization dataset are the gold standard for weekly influenza hospitalization counts in the US[1].
- The CDC’s annual influenza surveillance summaries and FluSurv-NET provide context and historical data for comparison[1][2][5].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- There is a reporting lag for hospitalization data, and the CDC may revise numbers weeks after initial publication[4].
- The 2024–2025 season’s hospitalization data had not begun updating as of early November 2024, so projections must rely on historical patterns and recent seasonal trends.
- Localized outbreaks or changes in virus transmissibility could cause deviations from historical norms, but no such anomalies have been reported as of the cutoff.

### Summary

Given the historical pattern of influenza activity in the US, the typical rise in hospitalizations in November, and the moderately severe nature of the most recent season, it is likely that the weekly total number of influenza hospitalizations for the week ending Nov 23, 2024, will exceed 2,000. However, the absence of real-time data for the 2024–2025 season as of early November 2024 introduces some uncertainty to this forecast.
