## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- NOAA's Climate.gov is a long-standing, authoritative source for climate information in the U.S. As of May 21, 2025, the site is fully operational, regularly updated, and hosting new content, such as the May 2025 ENSO update and U.S. climate outlooks published on May 2 and May 8, 2025[1][2].
- The resolution check via Is It Down Right Now? confirmed the site was "UP and reachable" as recently as May 7, 2025.
- Historically, there have been periods of concern about the removal of climate data from government websites, particularly during the Trump administration, but no similar actions have been reported since then.

## Recent Announcements or Policies Affecting the Metric

- There are no public announcements or policy changes since early 2025 indicating any threat to the continued operation of Climate.gov.
- The site continues to serve as NOAA's primary public-facing climate information portal, suggesting institutional stability and support[2].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The operational status of Climate.gov can be verified directly via Is It Down Right Now? (as specified in the resolution criteria).
- The site itself (climate.gov) and its recent updates serve as evidence of ongoing activity[2].
- NOAA remains the authoritative agency responsible for the site.

## Limitations or Uncertainties

- The main uncertainties are:
  - Unforeseen technical outages (e.g., server failures, cyberattacks).
  - Abrupt policy changes at the federal level that could affect NOAA's web presence.
  - Measurement is dependent on the status as reported by Is It Down Right Now? at the time of resolution.
- No current evidence suggests any imminent risk from these factors.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the current operational status, recent updates, and absence of threats or relevant policy changes, the probability that NOAA's Climate.gov will remain online on July 1, 2025, is very highâ€”likely above 95%. The only significant risks are low-probability, high-impact events not indicated by current trends.
