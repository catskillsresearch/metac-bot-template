# Forecasting Starship Launches: July-September 2024

To assess whether exactly two Starship launches will reach an altitude of 160 kilometers between July 1, 2024, and September 30, 2024, we need to examine the historical launch patterns, current development status, and announced plans for SpaceX's Starship program.

## Historical Context and Current Status

SpaceX has been rapidly developing its Starship program, with significant progress demonstrated in recent test flights. The most recent major milestone was the Integrated Test Flight 3 (IFT-3) on March 14, 2024, where Starship 28 briefly reached low-Earth orbit with an altitude of 234 km before breaking up during atmospheric re-entry[5]. This marked a substantial achievement for the program, as it was the first time a Starship prototype reached orbital altitude.

Prior to this flight, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk expressed optimism about the program's pace, stating "Hopefully, at least 6 more flights this year" before the IFT-3 launch. This would suggest a target of approximately one Starship launch every two months for the remainder of 2024 after the March test.

## Launch Schedule Analysis

When examining SpaceX's current launch manifest, we can see several scheduled missions for the coming months, though most involve the Falcon 9 rocket rather than Starship[2]. The publicly available launch schedule shows:

- May 7, 2025: Falcon 9 Block 5 | Starlink Group 6-93
- May 9, 2025: Falcon 9 Block 5 | Starlink Group 6-91
- May 10, 2025: Falcon 9 Block 5 | Starlink Group 15-3
- May 29, 2025: Falcon 9 Block 5 | Axiom Mission 4 (Ax-4)

These scheduled launches are for 2025 and do not include any Starship missions within the July-September 2024 timeframe in question[2].

## Limitations in Forecasting

Several factors complicate the prediction of exact Starship launch numbers:

1. **Regulatory Approvals**: Each Starship launch requires FAA approval, which can introduce unpredictable delays.

2. **Technical Challenges**: As demonstrated by previous test flights, technical issues can emerge that require resolution before subsequent launches.

3. **Limited Public Information**: SpaceX does not always publish detailed long-term Starship launch schedules, making it difficult to confirm planned launches for the July-September 2024 period.

4. **Rapid Iteration Approach**: SpaceX is known for its agile development methodology, which means launch plans can change quickly based on test results and engineering priorities.

## Conclusion

Based on the available information, there is insufficient data to make a definitive forecast about whether exactly two Starship launches will reach an altitude of 160 kilometers between July 1 and September 30, 2024. While Elon Musk's statement suggests multiple Starship launches in 2024 following the March IFT-3 test, specific dates for these launches have not been publicly confirmed in the search results.

The historical pace of development and testing, combined with Musk's stated goal of six more flights in 2024 after March, could potentially align with two launches occurring in the July-September window. However, this remains speculative without official launch confirmations from SpaceX.

For accurate forecasting, observers should monitor official SpaceX announcements, FAA launch approvals, and preparations at the Starbase facility in Texas for indications of upcoming Starship test flights.
