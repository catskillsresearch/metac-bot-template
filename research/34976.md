# Will the United States impose new tariffs on Mexico before April 1, 2025?

Based on information available as of February 13, 2025, here is an analysis of factors relevant to forecasting whether the United States will impose new tariffs on Mexico before April 1, 2025.

## Current Status and Recent Developments

On February 1, 2025, President Donald Trump signed executive orders imposing tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico, and China[1][2]. The executive order affecting Mexico, titled "Imposing Duties To Address the Situation at Our Southern Border," established a 25% ad valorem tariff on all products imported from Mexico[2][3].

These tariffs were initially scheduled to take effect on February 4, 2025[3]. However, on February 3, 2025, the United States and Mexico reached an agreement that resulted in a temporary pause of the tariffs[3][4]. According to this agreement:

- The 25% tariffs on Mexican imports have been paused until March 4, 2025[3][5]
- The pause is conditional on Mexico taking specific actions related to border security, illegal drugs, and immigration[5]
- Mexico's planned retaliatory measures are also on hold through the same period[5]

## Key Factors That May Affect Implementation

The executive order justifies the tariffs by claiming an "unusual and extraordinary threat" related to the southern border, specifically alleging that "the government of Mexico has afforded safe havens for the cartels to engage in the manufacturing and transportation of illicit drugs"[3]. The Trump administration is using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) as the legal basis for these tariffs, which is unprecedented for imposing tariffs[2].

The temporary pause expires at 12:01 am ET on March 4, 2025[5], which is before the April 1, 2025 deadline specified in the question. If Mexico fails to satisfy the U.S. demands regarding border security and drug trafficking during this 30-day period, the tariffs could be implemented after March 4.

## Potential Economic Impact

The implementation of these tariffs would have significant economic implications:

- The 25% tariffs would apply to all Mexican products entering the United States[2][3]
- These tariffs would be in addition to any preexisting tariffs[2]
- Goods covered by the executive order would no longer be eligible for de minimis duty-free treatment[2]

Fitch Ratings has noted that both the threat and uncertainty of these U.S. tariffs pose risks to Mexico[4], indicating the potential economic significance of this policy.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors create uncertainty about whether these tariffs will ultimately be implemented:

1. The specific metrics or benchmarks Mexico must meet to avoid tariff implementation have not been publicly detailed in the available information.

2. The temporary pause could potentially be extended beyond March 4 if negotiations continue or if Mexico makes progress toward addressing U.S. concerns.

3. The unprecedented use of IEEPA for imposing tariffs could potentially face legal challenges.

4. Companies and investors with interests in North America have been advised to use this pause to review their supply chains, investments, and business plans[5], suggesting uncertainty about the final outcome.

## Conclusion

Based on the information available as of February 13, 2025, there is a significant possibility that the United States will impose the announced 25% tariffs on Mexican imports after March 4, 2025, which would be before the April 1, 2025 deadline. However, this depends on whether Mexico satisfies U.S. demands regarding border security, illegal drugs, and immigration during the 30-day pause period.
