## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- **Historical Closures**: The NYSE and NASDAQ have only been closed for entire trading days outside of holidays and national days of mourning in extreme circumstances: World Wars, the Great Depression, and the September 11 attacks. These actions have always been coordinated with federal authorities but not ordered for political or personal reasons[2].
- **Current Operation**: In 2025, both exchanges have scheduled closures only for federal holidays and national days of mourning, consistent with longstanding practice[1][2][3][4]. No recent closures have occurred for non-standard reasons.

## 2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- **Regulatory Environment**: The SEC has extended certain compliance dates for clearing agencies, but these rule changes affect market operations and compliance, not exchange closure policies[5].
- **Presidential Conduct**: President Trump has publicly criticized regulatory bodies and market institutions, especially after trading halts related to his own company. However, there is no evidence of executive orders or formal attempts to close exchanges outside regular exceptions.
- **Exchange Calendars**: The official 2025–2026 trading calendars for both NYSE and NASDAQ show no planned closures beyond normal holidays and early closes[1][3][4].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- NYSE and NASDAQ official calendars for closure dates[1][4].
- SEC press releases and regulatory updates[5].

## 4. Limitations or Uncertainties

- **Political Volatility**: President Trump's willingness to challenge institutional norms introduces some uncertainty, but there is no precedent or legal framework supporting the notion that a president could unilaterally order a closure for political or market performance reasons.
- **Unpredictable Emergencies**: Unforeseen crises (not holidays, mourning, or natural disasters) could still trigger a closure, but such events are by definition low probability and currently absent from the horizon.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given historical precedent, current institutional structure, and the lack of credible signals or policy changes toward extraordinary closure, the probability that the US government will order the NYSE or NASDAQ to close for one or more entire regularly-scheduled trading days before January 20, 2029, for reasons not exempted (holiday, mourning, disaster) remains very low—well under 5%. The most significant tail risk stems from unpredictable external shocks or a severe constitutional crisis, but there is no direct evidence of movement in that direction as of May 2025.
