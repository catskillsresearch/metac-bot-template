# Forecasting Core CPI Inflation for August 2024

To assess whether the month-over-month percentage increase in core CPI inflation in the US in August 2024 will be 0.4%, we need to examine recent trends, current projections, and factors influencing inflation dynamics.

## Recent Inflation Trends

According to the July 2024 Consumer Price Index report released on August 15, 2024, headline CPI rose by 0.2% month-over-month, following a 0.1% decline in June[4]. The year-over-year CPI fell to 2.9% from 3.0% in June, marking the smallest annual increase since March 2021[4].

The July 2024 monthly rise in headline CPI was primarily driven by:
- A 0.4% increase in the shelter index
- A 1.0% rise in motor vehicle insurance prices
- A 0.2% increase in the food index[4]

The shelter index contributed significantly to the overall monthly increase, suggesting that housing costs continue to be a major factor in inflation persistence[4].

## Professional Forecasts and Projections

The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia's Survey of Professional Forecasters, released on August 9, 2024, provides valuable insights into expected inflation trends:

- Core CPI inflation for Q3 2024 is projected at 2.6% (annualized), revised downward from the previous forecast of 3.0%[1]
- For Q4 2024, core CPI is expected to remain at 2.6%, slightly lower than the previous projection of 2.7%[1]
- For the full year 2024, core CPI is forecast at 3.2% (Q4/Q4 annual average), down from the previous projection of 3.4%[1]

These projections suggest a gradual moderation in core inflation pressures through the remainder of 2024, though still above the Federal Reserve's 2% target.

## Factors Influencing August 2024 Core CPI

Several factors may influence the August 2024 core CPI reading:

1. **Housing costs**: The shelter component, which has been a persistent driver of core inflation, increased by 0.4% in July 2024[4]. Any continuation or acceleration of this trend would push core CPI higher in August.

2. **Service sector inflation**: Services inflation, particularly in categories like motor vehicle insurance (which rose 1.0% in July), continues to contribute significantly to core inflation[4].

3. **Federal Reserve policy**: The softer inflation data from July, combined with a weaker-than-expected employment report, has increased market expectations for the Fed to begin easing monetary policy, potentially at the September FOMC meeting[4]. This anticipated policy shift could influence inflation expectations and actual inflation outcomes.

4. **Seasonal factors**: August typically has specific seasonal patterns that may affect certain core CPI components.

## Assessment for August 2024

Based on the available data, several observations can inform our assessment of whether core CPI will increase by 0.4% month-over-month in August 2024:

- The most recent core CPI reading showed moderation, with the year-over-year rate trending downward[4].
- Professional forecasters have revised their core CPI projections downward for Q3 2024, suggesting expectations of continued moderation[1].
- However, persistent shelter inflation remains a significant factor that could keep monthly core CPI readings elevated[4].

While the exact month-over-month core CPI figure for July 2024 isn't explicitly stated in the search results, the query description indicates it was reported as 0.2%. A jump to 0.4% in August would represent a significant acceleration from this level and would run counter to the general moderating trend projected by professional forecasters.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several limitations affect our ability to precisely forecast the August 2024 core CPI figure:

1. **Economic volatility**: Unexpected shocks or developments could significantly alter inflation dynamics.
2. **Measurement challenges**: CPI data is subject to sampling and non-sampling errors.
3. **Timing issues**: August data will reflect economic conditions that may have changed since the most recent available information.
4. **Component-specific factors**: Unusual movements in specific core CPI components could significantly impact the overall figure.
