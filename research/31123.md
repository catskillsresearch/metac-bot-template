# Will Iran Possess a Nuclear Weapon Before 2026? A Forecasting Analysis

As of May 2025, Iran has made significant advancements in its nuclear program but has not yet crossed the threshold to possessing an actual nuclear weapon. To forecast whether this will occur before 2026, I'll analyze the current status, technical capabilities, political factors, and potential diplomatic developments.

## Current Nuclear Capabilities

Iran has positioned itself as a nuclear threshold state with rapidly expanding capabilities:

- As of February 2025, Iran is enriching uranium up to 60% purity (weapons-grade is 90%)[3]
- Iran's combined stockpile of 60% and 20% enriched uranium in gas form has reached nearly 900 kilograms[3]
- The country has installed approximately 118 cascades of centrifuges, with 76 being advanced machines that were prohibited under the JCPOA[3]
- In late 2024, Iran announced plans to further expand its uranium enrichment program, including the installation of an additional 32 cascades of centrifuges[2]
- Iran is increasing its production of 60% enriched uranium at the Fordow facility from 4.7 kilograms per month to 37 kilograms per month by using 20% enriched uranium as feed material[2]

These developments have significantly shortened Iran's "breakout time" â€“ the time needed to produce enough weapons-grade material for a nuclear bomb. The deeply buried Fordow facility provides additional protection against potential military strikes, making Iran's program more resilient to external intervention[2].

## Decision Factors and Official Assessments

Despite technical advancements, intelligence assessments indicate restraint in decision-making:

- According to 2024 and 2025 public U.S. intelligence assessments, Tehran has not made a decision to develop nuclear weapons[5]
- The United States has maintained that its "red line" is that Iran will never have a nuclear bomb[1]
- Iran has become a "nuclear weapons threshold state" with the technologies and capabilities that would allow it to move quickly toward weapon development if it chooses to do so[4]

## Technical Hurdles and Pathways

Iran faces both advantages and limitations in potential weapons development:

- The plutonium pathway for nuclear weapons appears effectively blocked due to modifications to the Arak reactor design combined with ongoing IAEA monitoring[2]
- The uranium enrichment pathway has advanced significantly, but would still require enrichment from 60% to 90% (weapons-grade) and weaponization steps
- Conducting enrichment activities at the deeply buried Fordow facility increases proliferation risk as this location is more challenging to destroy with conventional military strikes[2]

## Diplomatic Developments

Diplomatic efforts continue to constrain Iran's nuclear program:

- Discussions about a potential new Iranian nuclear deal have been ongoing in 2025[1][3]
- One proposed agreement option focuses on limiting enrichment levels and stocks while allowing Iran to retain some advanced centrifuges as a guarantee against sudden sanctions[3]
- An effective deal could increase breakout time by combining restrictions in three areas: enrichment levels, stockpiles, and centrifuge capacity[3]
- Iran is likely seeking to retain some capacity for rapid escalation after experiencing the quick restoration of sanctions following the U.S. withdrawal from the JCPOA in 2018[3]

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on the available evidence, I assess the probability of Iran possessing a nuclear weapon before 2026 as **low to moderate** (approximately 15-30%). This assessment is based on:

1. **Technical readiness**: Iran has the technical capability to produce weapons-grade material relatively quickly but would still need additional time for weaponization.

2. **Decision threshold**: Current intelligence assessments indicate Iran has not made the decision to develop nuclear weapons, suggesting strategic restraint.

3. **Diplomatic constraints**: Ongoing negotiations for a new nuclear deal could provide incentives for continued restraint.

4. **Timeframe**: The relatively short period between now (May 2025) and the end of 2025 provides limited time for both the technical development and the significant policy shift that would be required.

5. **Detection and response**: Any move toward 90% enrichment would likely be detected by international monitoring, triggering immediate international responses.

The most significant uncertainty in this forecast is whether Iran's leadership might make a strategic decision to rapidly pursue nuclear weapons in response to regional security developments or the collapse of diplomatic efforts. While Iran has positioned itself technically as a threshold state, the political decision to cross that threshold represents a major escalation that would invite significant international consequences.
