### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of July 15, 2024, the CDC reported 167 measles cases in the United States for the year, with updates provided biweekly.
- By December 31, 2024, the CDC reported a total of 285 measles cases for the year, spread across 33 jurisdictions. This represents a significant increase compared to 59 cases in 2023, but still below the 300-case threshold by year’s end[1].
- The majority of 2024 cases (69%) were associated with outbreaks (defined as three or more related cases), and most cases occurred among unvaccinated or undervaccinated individuals[1][2].
- The first quarter of 2024 saw a sharp rise, with 97 cases reported by March 28, and 121 cases by April 11, 2024[2][5].

### Recent Announcements and Policies

- The CDC and public health officials have expressed concern about the rising number of measles cases in 2024, warning that the increase threatens the U.S. measles elimination status[4][5].
- Efforts have been made to encourage vaccination, especially before international travel and in communities with low vaccination coverage[2].
- No major new federal policies were announced that would have immediately altered the trajectory of case reporting between July and September 2024.

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The CDC’s official measles cases and outbreaks page is the definitive source for case counts and outbreak information[1].
- CDC’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) provides detailed epidemiological analysis and context for trends[2].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- CDC case counts are subject to reporting delays and may be updated retroactively as new information becomes available.
- Outbreaks can cause sudden spikes in case numbers, but the overall trend in 2024 was a steady increase rather than an exponential surge after July.
- The CDC’s biweekly update schedule means there may be a lag between case occurrence and public reporting.

### Conclusion

Based on the CDC’s reported total of 285 measles cases for all of 2024, it is highly unlikely that more than 300 cases were reported by September 30, 2024. The available data indicate that the 300-case threshold was not reached at any point during the year, including by the end of September[1].
