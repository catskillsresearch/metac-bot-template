### Key Factual Information as of August 22, 2024

**1. Historical Trends**
- Donald Trump has a well-documented pattern of firing or reshuffling campaign managers during his presidential runs. In 2016, Corey Lewandowski was fired in June and replaced by Paul Manafort, who later resigned in August and was succeeded by Kellyanne Conway. In 2020, Brad Parscale was demoted in July and replaced by Bill Stepien, who remained through the election.

**2. Current Status of 2024 Campaign Managers**
- As of mid-August 2024, Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles remain the co-campaign managers for Trump’s 2024 campaign. Both have publicly stated they are continuing in their roles and are leading the campaign into its final stretch[1].

**3. Recent Announcements and Developments**
- The Trump campaign has recently expanded its senior staff, bringing back veterans such as Corey Lewandowski as a senior adviser. This move is described by the campaign as an expansion rather than a replacement or demotion of current managers. In a joint statement, Wiles and LaCivita said, "As we head into the home stretch of this election, we are continuing to add to our impressive campaign team"[1].
- There have been media reports suggesting Trump considered firing his campaign managers, but these reports were subsequently softened or denied. The campaign has explicitly stated that rumors of Wiles or LaCivita being fired are "not rooted in reality"[1].

**4. Authoritative Sources for Verification**
- Axios and Politico have both reported on the recent staffing changes, confirming that LaCivita and Wiles remain in their positions and that new hires are additions, not replacements[1][2].

**5. Limitations and Uncertainties**
- While Trump’s history suggests the possibility of abrupt staffing changes, as of August 22, 2024, there is no credible report of either campaign manager being fired, resigning, or being demoted. The situation remains dynamic, but no authoritative source indicates an imminent change.

### Conclusion

As of August 22, 2024, all available credible information indicates that Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles remain in their positions as Donald Trump’s campaign co-managers. There are no credible reports of either being fired, resigning, or being demoted. While the campaign environment is historically volatile, especially under Trump, there is no factual basis as of this date to forecast that either manager will leave their position before October 1, 2024[1][2].
