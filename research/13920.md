**1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status**

- As of December 2022, only 12 people—all American—have walked on the Moon, so the cumulative nationality count is one[3].
- The last human lunar landing was Apollo 17 in 1972.
- Multiple countries (Russia, ESA, China, Japan, India) have declared ambitions for future lunar exploration, but actual crewed lunar landings outside the US have not yet occurred.

**2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric**

- **Artemis Program (NASA, with international partners):**
  - Artemis III is planned to be the first human lunar landing since 1972, scheduled for no earlier than September 2026[2][5].
  - NASA has publicly committed that Artemis III will land the first woman and the first person of color on the Moon[2][5].
  - The Artemis program includes strong international partnerships. The European Space Agency (ESA), Japan (JAXA), and Canada (CSA) are involved, with agreements for future astronaut flights[1].
  - Artemis IV (planned for 2028) and Artemis V (planned for March 2030) will continue crewed lunar landings, with further integration of international partners and infrastructure[1].
  - As of 2022, there had been no public confirmation that non-Americans would be among the first Artemis lunar landing crews, but some Artemis partner nations have explicit agreements for future crew opportunities[1].

- **Other Nations:**
  - Russia and China have announced intentions to land astronauts on the Moon by 2030, but as of December 2022, these plans remained aspirational with no concrete crewed mission schedules[3].
  - India and Japan are collaborating on robotic lunar missions but do not have crewed lunar landings planned before 2030[3].

**3. Authoritative Sources for Verification**

- Wikipedia’s Artemis Program page[1]
- NASA news releases on Artemis mission planning and crew selection[2]
- Statista and other space mission tracking sites for mission timelines[3]
- Discovery Channel and other reputable science news outlets for historical facts (e.g., total people who have walked on the Moon)[3]
- Royal Museums Greenwich for Artemis mission details[5]

**4. Limitations and Uncertainties**

- Crew composition for Artemis III and IV has not been finalized or publicly announced as of December 2022. NASA’s stated intention to include diverse astronauts does not guarantee inclusion of non-Americans, but international astronaut participation is specifically planned for later Artemis missions.
- Russian or Chinese crewed lunar landings before 2030 are possible but face technical, financial, and political uncertainties.
- The fine print regarding dual/multiple citizenships could marginally increase the nationality count if, for example, a US astronaut selected for Artemis III or IV holds another citizenship.
- Delays are common in space exploration; any slippage in Artemis or other programs could impact the number.

**Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment**

- **Most Likely Scenario:** The first non-American astronaut will walk on the Moon as part of an Artemis mission before 2030, most likely via an ESA, Canadian, or Japanese partnership. The total number of nationalities will therefore increase from 1 (American) to 2 (American + one partner nationality).
- **Plausible Range:** If Artemis III and IV both include international crew (possible but not certain), or if an astronaut with multiple citizenships is selected, the total could be 2 or 3. Russian or Chinese landings before 2030 remain uncertain but less likely given program status as of 2022.
- **Low Probability:** A major breakthrough or acceleration by another national program could raise the count higher, but no evidence supports >3 by 2030 as of late 2022.

**Forecast:**  
By January 1, 2030, the total number of nationalities to have walked on the Moon will most likely be **2**, with a plausible range of **2–3** depending on Artemis crew selection and citizenship status. The probability of the count remaining at 1 (only Americans) is low but not zero if all Artemis lunar landing astronauts through 2030 are American citizens only and no other nation lands crew.
