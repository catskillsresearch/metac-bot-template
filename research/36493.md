### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The 45Q carbon oxide sequestration tax credit was first established in 2008 and has been expanded several times, most recently by the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which increased credit values and extended the eligibility window for new projects to January 1, 2033[4][5].
- The credit supports a wide range of carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) projects, with at least 226 projects currently qualifying[5].
- The value of the credit varies by project type, with the highest rates for direct air capture and geologic sequestration[5].

### Recent Announcements and Policy Developments

- In March 2025, Rep. Scott Perry (R-PA) introduced H.R. 1946, the 45Q Repeal Act, which would fully repeal the 45Q tax credit effective January 1, 2026, with no safe harbor for ongoing projects[1][2][5].
- The bill has bipartisan sponsorship, with Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA) as a co-sponsor, and is currently in the House Committee on Ways and Means[5].
- The Republican-controlled Congress is considering using budget reconciliation to pass tax and spending changes, which could include the repeal of 45Q and other clean energy tax credits[4].
- There is some Republican support for retaining certain clean energy tax breaks, but the 45Q credit is facing strong bipartisan opposition, making it a likely target for repeal[4].

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The full text of H.R. 1946 is available on Congress.gov[1].
- Multiple news outlets and advocacy organizations have reported on the introduction and implications of the 45Q Repeal Act[2][3][4][5].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- The final outcome depends on the legislative process, including potential amendments, negotiations within the Republican caucus, and the reconciliation process.
- There is some uncertainty about whether a safe harbor provision could be added during negotiations, but the current bill text does not include one[1][5].
- Stakeholder lobbying and public pressure could influence the final legislative language.

### Forecasted Outcome

Given the current legislative text of H.R. 1946, the political alignment in Congress, and the absence of a safe harbor provision, the most likely next outcome is:

**2025-2026 sunset w/o safe harbor**: The planned phase-out date of 45Q is moved to 2025 or 2026 or 45Q is fully repealed, with no safe harbor for ongoing projects.
