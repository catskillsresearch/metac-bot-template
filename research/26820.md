### Key Facts and Trends

- As of July 28, 2024, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s primary TikTok account (@teamkennedy2024) has 1.7 million followers[5].
- RFK Jr. has been active on TikTok since at least May 2023, giving him over a year of presence on the platform[5].
- By comparison, Donald Trump gained 3.2 million followers in his first 24 hours on TikTok (starting June 2, 2024) and reached 9.3 million followers by July 28, 2024[5].
- Kamala Harris gained 2.1 million followers in her first 24 hours (starting July 25, 2024) and reached 2.8 million followers by July 28, 2024.
- RFK Jr.'s follower growth has been steady but much slower than Trump or Harris, despite being on the platform longer[5].
- There is no evidence of a viral surge or campaign event likely to dramatically accelerate RFK Jr.'s follower growth to the level required to reach 15 million by September 30, 2024.

### Platform and Demographic Context

- TikTok is extremely popular among young voters, with 62% of U.S. adults under 30 using the platform[5].
- Kennedy performs relatively well with young voters, and a higher percentage of his supporters use TikTok compared to Biden or Trump[5].
- Despite this, Kennedy's TikTok engagement and follower growth have not matched the explosive growth seen by Trump or Harris upon their account launches[5].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- The only scenario in which RFK Jr. could reach 15 million followers by September 30, 2024, would require an unprecedented viral surge or major campaign event, for which there is no current evidence.
- If RFK Jr. deletes or loses access to his official account before September 30, the question resolves as "No" by definition.

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The official follower count can be verified directly on RFK Jr.'s primary TikTok account (@teamkennedy2024).

### Conclusion

Based on all available data as of July 31, 2024, there is no factual basis to expect Robert F. Kennedy Jr. will have more than 15 million TikTok followers on September 30, 2024. His current growth rate and historical trends make this outcome extremely unlikely.
