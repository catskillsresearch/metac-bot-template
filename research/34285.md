## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- North Korea has a long history of provocations against South Korea, but direct invasions (i.e., sending ground forces into South Korea without consent) have not occurred since the Korean War. Most recent actions have been symbolic, such as sending propaganda balloons and leaflets[4].
- In 2024, North Korea officially abandoned peaceful reunification, declaring the South an implacable enemy. However, its follow-up actions have remained non-military and symbolic[4].
- Despite increased military cooperation with Russia and China, North Korea has exercised restraint in direct confrontations with South Korea, even during periods of heightened tension[2].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- North Korea’s leadership has emphasized bolstering its defense industry and has sent troops to aid Russia in Ukraine, but has avoided direct military engagement with South Korea[2].
- The US continues to reaffirm its commitment to South Korea’s defense, though there are ongoing debates about the future of US-South Korea military cooperation, especially amid South Korea’s domestic political turmoil[1][4].
- Some military strategists have raised concerns about the possibility of North Korea attempting to occupy a South Korean island, but as of January 31, 2025, this remains speculative and has not materialized[4].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Georgetown Journal of International Affairs: Analysis of US commitment to South Korea’s defense[1].
- The Diplomat: Overview of North Korea’s 2025 strategy and restraint in military provocations[2].
- Crisis Group: Assessment of North Korea’s policy shift and the risk of future provocations[4].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- North Korea’s decision-making is highly opaque, and sudden escalations are always possible.
- South Korea’s political instability could create opportunities for miscalculation or provocation, but as of the latest reporting, no direct invasion has occurred[4].
- US policy could shift rapidly in response to new provocations, but no public accusation of invasion has been made as of January 31, 2025.

## Conclusion

As of January 31, 2025, there is no factual basis to forecast that the United States will accuse North Korea of invading South Korea before April 1, 2025. North Korea’s actions have remained below the threshold of military invasion, and the US has not made any such public accusation.
