## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- MIRI (Machine Intelligence Research Institute) has been a leading nonprofit in AI safety research since 2005, focused on the alignment of advanced AI systems with human interests[4].
- As of December 2024, MIRI projected $5.6 million in spending for the year and maintained at least two years of financial reserves, indicating prudent fiscal management and near-term stability[2].
- MIRI is still legally recognized as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit and maintains its public mission[4].

## 2. Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Metric

- In its 2024 year-end update, MIRI reported increased uncertainty in its funding situation. The organization is shifting its main strategic focus from technical alignment research to communications and policy, seeking to influence public and policymaker understanding of AI risks[2].
- The leadership acknowledges that this pivot may make it either easier or harder to secure future funding, depending on donor response. If funding becomes more difficult, MIRI may need to "drastically change plans and scale back ambitions," possibly impacting researcher employment[2].
- The broader AI safety research ecosystem is experiencing growth in funding and attention, with significant federal and philanthropic investments in AI research and safety in the US and internationally[1][3][5].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- MIRI’s financial and strategic updates (published on their website)[2]
- IRS/ProPublica nonprofit status records[4]
- NSF and government AI research funding reports[1][3][5]

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- MIRI’s future researcher employment depends primarily on donor support and the success of its new strategic direction. The organization is in a more uncertain funding position than in the past, explicitly noting that it may need to scale back if future fundraising falls short[2].
- The definition of "researcher" in the resolution criteria depends on ongoing or resumed technical research work. If MIRI’s focus shifts entirely to communications and advocacy, and no technical research is conducted, it may not meet the criteria for positive resolution.
- While the broad trend in AI safety funding is positive, MIRI’s unique position within the field and its strategic pivot could affect its competitiveness for grants and donations.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given MIRI’s long history, current reserves, and the growing relevance of AI safety, but factoring in its shift in focus and acknowledged funding uncertainty, there is a moderate-to-high probability that MIRI will still exist and employ researchers as defined on January 1, 2030. However, the probability is lower than in previous years due to clear strategic and funding risks. A reasonable forecast range as of early 2025 might place the probability between 55% and 75%, with the main risks being a further pivot away from research or a drastic funding shortfall.
