**Historical Trends and Current Status**

- As of October 2019, all known life—on Earth and in any sample analyzed from the solar system—is carbon-based. Carbon’s chemical versatility, ability to form complex molecules, and prevalence in organic chemistry underpin its central role in biology[1][2].
- NASA and other agencies' life-detection missions (e.g., Mars rovers, exoplanet biosignature searches) are primarily designed to detect carbon-based molecules or their byproducts, such as organic compounds, nucleic acids, and metabolic gases like oxygen or methane[1][5].
- While theoretical discussions exist around alternative biochemistries (e.g., silicon-based, ammonia solvent, or non-chemical systems), no empirical evidence for such life has been found in nature or laboratory settings as of 2019[2].

**Key Differences Affecting the Forecast**

- The search for life beyond Earth is currently biased towards detecting carbon-based organisms due to:
    - Technological constraints: Most detection techniques (e.g., Raman spectroscopy, gas chromatography, nucleic acid sequencing) are optimized for carbon-based biosignatures[3][5].
    - Scientific precedent: All examples of life, including extremophiles, utilize carbon chemistry, making it the default reference for life-detection strategies[1][2].
- Theoretical alternatives (e.g., silicon-based or purely informational/mechanical life) remain unverified and are not directly targeted by current mainstream detection initiatives[2].
- There is a nonzero but currently unquantifiable risk that radically different forms of life (e.g., non-carbon-based) could go undetected with existing tools[3][5].

**Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment**

Given that:
- All known life is carbon-based,
- Detection efforts as of 2019 overwhelmingly target carbon-based biosignatures,
- No confirmed discoveries of non-carbon-based life exist,
- And the scientific consensus continues to regard carbon as the most plausible basis for life at cellular or subcellular complexity,

The probability that the first independently-originating extraterrestrial life form we encounter will be carbon-based is extremely high—likely above 90%. The probability of encountering non-carbon-based life first is very low, barring a paradigm-shifting discovery or development of radically new detection methods.

**Limitations and Uncertainties**

- Detection bias: Current technology and mission design may miss non-carbon-based life.
- Conceptual limitations: Life may exist in forms not yet imagined or detectable by our instruments.
- Sample size: The vast majority of the universe remains unexplored, and even within the solar system, only a handful of environments have been sampled directly.
