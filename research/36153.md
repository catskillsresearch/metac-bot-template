4. Overall Quality of the project

As of March 18, 2025, winners in some other categories have been announced (such as "My Old Ass" for Outstanding Film and "Hacks" and "What We Do in the Shadows" for Outstanding Comedy Series)[4], but no information is available regarding the winner of the Outstanding Video Game category.
