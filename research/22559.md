## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- In early 2024, Congress passed a law compelling ByteDance to divest TikTok’s US operations to a non-foreign adversary entity within nine months, with a possible three-month extension if a sale is in progress[3].
- ByteDance challenged the law on constitutional grounds, but the US Supreme Court upheld the ban in January 2025, requiring TikTok to cease operations in the US by January 19, 2025, unless sold to an approved owner[1][2][3].
- Following the Supreme Court decision, TikTok briefly ceased operations, but executive orders from President Trump have twice delayed actual enforcement, pushing the deadline into the spring and then summer of 2025[2][3][4].
- As of May 2025, TikTok remains available for US users, but the company’s legal avenues are exhausted, and further extensions would require additional executive or legislative intervention.

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- The Supreme Court’s January 2025 decision eliminated the main legal avenue for ByteDance to retain ownership[1][2][3].
- President Trump’s executive orders have temporarily delayed enforcement but do not alter the requirement for divestment or shutdown[2][3][4].
- ByteDance has publicly indicated its preference to shut down the US service rather than sell if legal options are exhausted, though some uncertainty remains about whether a buyer will emerge or a last-minute deal will be struck[2].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Supreme Court decision upholding the TikTok ban: NYU, January 2025[1].
- Timeline and executive orders affecting enforcement: TechTarget, March 2025[3]; People, March 2025[2].
- ByteDance’s public statements and ongoing sale negotiations: Reuters (not directly cited in search results due to date, but referenced in question background).

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- ByteDance’s final decision—whether to sell or shut down—remains uncertain, though public statements suggest a shutdown is more likely if pressured to divest[2].
- The possibility of further executive or legislative intervention cannot be ruled out, but no new legal avenues currently exist post-Supreme Court ruling.
- There is inherent uncertainty in predicting the outcome of ongoing business negotiations or the emergence of a last-minute buyer.
- Enforcement actions by the US government and compliance by app stores will be crucial to determining actual US availability.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

- The most likely outcome, based on current facts, is that TikTok will not be available in the US on December 31, 2025, unless ByteDance finds a buyer accepted by US authorities.
- If TikTok is available, it is highly unlikely it will still be owned by ByteDance or any other entity deemed a "foreign adversary" under US law, due to the Supreme Court’s ruling and lack of further legal recourse[1][3].
- The scenario in which TikTok is still available but owned by ByteDance is extremely low probability barring unforeseen political or legal changes.
- The most plausible outcomes are:
  - "No" (service unavailable in the US), or
  - "Yes, non-adversary owner" (service available, but sold to a US or allied entity).

## Summary Table

| Outcome                           | Probability (as of May 2025) | Key Factors                                                    |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Yes, still owned by foreign adversary | Very low (<5%)               | Supreme Court ruling, law prohibits this outcome                |
| Yes, non-adversary owner             | Low-moderate (20–40%)         | Dependent on successful sale to US/aligned entity               |
| No                                  | High (60–80%)                 | ByteDance likely to shut down if unable/unwilling to sell       |
