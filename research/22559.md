### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Since 2020, US administrations have raised concerns about TikTok's ownership by ByteDance, a Chinese company, due to national security and surveillance fears. Previous attempts to ban or force divestment were blocked by courts[1].
- In 2024, Congress passed a law mandating that ByteDance divest TikTok to a non-adversary owner within 9 months, with a possible 3-month extension. If not, TikTok must be shut down in the US[1][2][3].
- On January 17, 2025, the US Supreme Court upheld this law, rejecting ByteDance’s First Amendment challenge, and the legal path for enforcement is now clear[2].
- After taking office, President Trump extended the deadline for compliance by 150 days through executive orders. However, some legal experts question the president’s authority to do this unilaterally, as the original law contains no provisions for such an extension[3].

### Recent Announcements and Policies

- ByteDance has publicly stated it would prefer to shut down TikTok in the US rather than sell the app if forced by law[1].
- The Chinese government has imposed restrictions on technology transfers, making a sale of TikTok’s US operations to a non-adversary owner more difficult[3].
- Several US tech companies, including Amazon and Microsoft, have expressed interest in acquiring TikTok’s US business, but potential deals remain complicated by political and regulatory factors[3].
- The law’s definition of "foreign adversary control" is explicit and would apply to any ByteDance ownership or indirect control.

### Probabilistic Assessment (as of 2024-05-11)

The most likely outcomes by December 31, 2025 are:

| Option                                 | Probability | Key Rationale                                                                                   |
|-----------------------------------------|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Yes, still owned by foreign adversary   | Low         | Supreme Court upheld the divestment law; enforcement is likely. Political will is strong.         |
| Yes, non-adversary owner                | Moderate    | Sale is possible, with interest from US tech companies; depends on negotiation and China’s stance.|
| No                                      | Moderate    | ByteDance has signaled preference for shutdown; China may block sale; enforcement is now settled. |

Given the Supreme Court’s decision and ByteDance’s stated shutdown preference, there is a significant risk that TikTok will become unavailable in the US after the divestment deadline if no sale is completed. However, the strong interest from US buyers and the possibility of last-minute negotiations make a compliant sale plausible if political obstacles can be overcome.

**Adjusted Probabilities (as of May 2025):**
- "Yes, still owned by foreign adversary": ~10% (given legal and political barriers)
- "Yes, non-adversary owner": ~45% (if a sale is completed)
- "No": ~45% (if ByteDance shuts down TikTok US rather than sell)

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Supreme Court decision in TikTok, Inc. v. Garland[2].
- Congressional text of the TikTok divestment law[1].
- Public statements by ByteDance and Chinese government actions on tech sales[1][3].
- News reports on acquisition bids and executive orders extending the deadline[3].

### Limitations and Measurement Uncertainties

- These probabilities are sensitive to sudden political changes, further legal action, or unexpected executive interventions.
- The outcome may also be influenced by the willingness of the Chinese government to approve a sale, and by ByteDance’s actions as the deadline approaches.
- “Available” is strictly defined as continued access for US users at scale, so even a temporary interruption or incomplete transfer could cause the outcome to resolve as "No."
