## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- TikTok has faced sustained US government scrutiny since at least 2020, with concerns centered on national security and data privacy due to ByteDance's ties to China[1][2][3].
- In early 2024, Congress passed a law requiring ByteDance to divest TikTok’s US operations within 9 months (with a possible 3-month extension) or face a ban. The law defines "foreign adversary" ownership strictly and includes detailed criteria for what constitutes divestment[2].
- As of May 2025, TikTok remains available in the US, but only due to a series of executive orders temporarily extending the compliance deadline. The most recent extension gives TikTok additional time to negotiate a sale or comply with the law[1].
- ByteDance has publicly indicated it would rather shut down TikTok in the US than sell to a non-Chinese, non-adversary buyer if legal challenges fail[3].
- The Supreme Court has heard arguments on the law’s constitutionality and appears likely to uphold it, with most justices suggesting that ByteDance, as a Chinese entity, lacks First Amendment protections[2].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- The President has issued multiple executive orders extending the compliance deadline for TikTok, but these are temporary and do not change the underlying legal requirement for divestment or shutdown[1].
- ByteDance and TikTok users have challenged the law in court, but initial indications from the Supreme Court suggest the law will be upheld[2].
- ByteDance has not announced any concrete plans to sell TikTok’s US operations and has signaled a willingness to shut down if forced to divest[3].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Major news outlets reporting on Congressional action and executive orders (e.g., Axios, TechTarget)[1][2].
- ByteDance’s official statements and legal filings[3].
- The text of the law and Supreme Court proceedings[2].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- Legal challenges could delay enforcement, but current judicial sentiment appears unfavorable to ByteDance’s position[2].
- Political developments or further executive action could alter the timeline or requirements, but as of now, the law remains in force.
- Technical workarounds (e.g., sideloading, alternative app stores) may allow some US users to access TikTok after a ban, but this would not meet the definition of "available" as required by the resolution criteria[3].
- A last-minute sale is possible but seems unlikely given ByteDance’s public stance and the complexity of such a transaction.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the above, the most probable outcomes for December 31, 2025, are:

- **"No"**: TikTok is not available in the US in the legally defined sense, as ByteDance is unlikely to sell, and the courts are poised to uphold the law, making a shutdown the most likely outcome.
- **"Yes, non-adversary owner"**: Possible if a sale occurs, but ByteDance’s public statements and lack of sale progress make this less probable.
- **"Yes, still owned by foreign adversary"**: Only possible if courts block or indefinitely delay enforcement, which current indications suggest is unlikely.

**Forecast**: The most likely outcome is "No"—TikTok will not be available in the US in its current form and under ByteDance ownership on December 31, 2025. This is based on the strict divest-or-ban law, ByteDance’s stated unwillingness to sell, and the apparent readiness of the Supreme Court to uphold the law[1][2][3].
