### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Chime has long been considered a strong IPO candidate, with its last private valuation at $25 billion in 2021[1][4].
- The company paused earlier IPO plans in 2022 due to unfavorable market conditions but resumed preparations in 2024[1].
- In December 2024, multiple sources reported that Chime had confidentially filed for an IPO and hired Morgan Stanley to lead the offering, with a target to go public in 2025[1][2][3][4][5].
- As of early 2025, Chime remains a private company, and no public S-1 filing has been reported.

### Recent Announcements and Policies

- Chime’s leadership has publicly stated the company is “as IPO-ready as a company can be” and is closely monitoring market conditions, but has not made a public commitment to an IPO date[1].
- All recent reports indicate that while Chime is preparing for an IPO, the timing is not finalized and subject to change[1][2][4][5].

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The SEC’s EDGAR database for any public S-1 filings.
- Chime’s official news page for any IPO-related announcements.

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- Confidential filings with the SEC are not public and do not constitute a public announcement.
- Media reports based on unnamed sources, while credible, do not meet the resolution criteria.
- There is no evidence as of March 6, 2025, of a public S-1 filing or an official announcement on Chime’s website regarding an IPO plan.

### Conclusion

As of March 6, 2025, all available factual information indicates that Chime has taken significant preparatory steps toward an IPO (confidential filing, hiring underwriters, public statements of readiness), but there is no public announcement or S-1 filing confirming an IPO plan. Therefore, unless such an announcement is made before April 1, 2025, the forecast is that Chime will **not** have publicly announced plans for an IPO by that date.
