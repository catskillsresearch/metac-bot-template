# Forecasting Human Extinction Before 2100

As of November 12, 2017, the question of human extinction before 2100 has been addressed by various experts and institutions with differing methodologies and perspectives. This analysis examines the available evidence and expert assessments to provide a probabilistic forecast.

## Expert Probability Estimates

Several notable experts and institutions have provided estimates on human extinction probability:

- In 2016, a mathematician at the University of Barcelona estimated a 13% chance that humanity would not survive the 21st century[2].
- The Global Challenges Foundation's 2016 annual report estimated an annual probability of human extinction of at least 0.05% per year, which equates to approximately 5% per century[1].
- In 2003, Martin Rees (Astronomer Royal of the United Kingdom) estimated a 50% chance of civilization collapse in the twenty-first century, though it should be noted that civilization collapse doesn't necessarily equate to complete human extinction[1].
- In 1996, John A. Leslie estimated a 30% risk of human extinction over the next five centuries, which translates to roughly 6% per century on average[1].

The informal poll at the 2008 Global Catastrophic Risk Conference at Oxford yielded a median probability of 19% for human extinction by 2100, though as noted in the question description, this may reflect selection bias among participants.

## Key Risk Factors

Based on information available as of 2017, several categories of extinction risks warrant consideration:

### Anthropogenic Risks
- **Nuclear warfare**: Despite reductions in nuclear arsenals since the Cold War, thousands of nuclear weapons remain deployed, with the potential for catastrophic global impacts.
- **Emerging technologies**: Developments in biotechnology, artificial intelligence, and nanotechnology present novel existential risks that were not present in humanity's evolutionary history.
- **Climate change**: While complete human extinction from climate change alone is generally considered unlikely by 2100, it could act as a risk multiplier for other threats.

### Natural Risks
- **Asteroid impacts**: NASA's Near-Earth Object Observation Program has identified and tracks potential extinction-level asteroid threats, with no imminent dangers identified as of 2017.
- **Supervolcanic eruptions**: These occur very infrequently (roughly every 50,000-100,000 years) and typically with some warning signs.
- **Pandemics**: Natural pandemics have caused significant mortality throughout human history but have not approached extinction-level events.

## Comparative Analysis

The historical record provides important context. Homo sapiens have existed for at least 200,000 years and survived numerous catastrophic events including supervolcano eruptions and asteroid impacts[1]. This suggests resilience to natural extinction risks.

However, anthropogenic risks represent a fundamentally different category. Unlike natural risks that have been present throughout human evolution, technological capabilities that could potentially cause extinction have only emerged recently and continue to develop rapidly.

## Probabilistic Assessment

Synthesizing the expert opinions available as of November 2017, and accounting for both natural and anthropogenic risks, a reasonable estimate for human extinction by 2100 falls in the range of 5-20%.

This assessment gives more weight to institutional estimates like the Global Challenges Foundation's 5% per century and less weight to higher individual estimates, while acknowledging that:

1. Natural extinction risks appear extremely low based on humanity's survival record
2. Anthropogenic risks are novel and potentially more dangerous
3. Expert opinion varies significantly, suggesting high uncertainty

It's important to note that this probability represents a significant risk when compared to other global catastrophic scenarios that receive substantial mitigation efforts.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors limit the precision of this forecast:

- Expert estimates vary widely, indicating high uncertainty
- Limited empirical data on extinction-level events (by definition)
- Difficulty in modeling complex technological and social systems
- Potential unknown risks that cannot be accounted for
