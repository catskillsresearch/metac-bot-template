# Forecasting Analysis: Human Extinction by 2100

This analysis examines the likelihood of human extinction before 2100 based on information available as of November 12, 2017.

## Current Situation Compared to Reference Cases

The question of human extinction probability has been addressed by several expert assessments and surveys:

- The 2008 informal poll at the Global Catastrophic Risk Conference at Oxford University yielded a median probability estimate of 19% for human extinction by 2100[2]. However, as noted in the question description, this result may reflect selection bias, as attendees likely already had concerns about catastrophic risks.

- John Leslie's 1996 assessment estimated a 30% risk of human extinction over the next five centuries (approximately 6% per century)[1].

- Martin Rees, in 2003, estimated a 50% chance of civilization collapse in the twenty-first century[1]. While civilization collapse doesn't necessarily equate to extinction, it represents a potential precursor.

- The Global Challenges Foundation's 2016 annual report estimated an annual probability of human extinction of at least 0.05% per year, which compounds to approximately 5% over a century[1].

- A University of Barcelona mathematician estimated in 2016 that there is a 13% chance humanity will not survive the 21st century[3].

## Key Differences Affecting the Forecast

Several factors differentiate the various estimates:

1. **Methodological approaches**: Different experts use varying methodologies—from mathematical models to expert elicitation—leading to a wide range of estimates (from approximately 1% to 50% for the 21st century).

2. **Definition of extinction**: Some analyses focus on complete biological extinction while others consider civilization collapse or existential catastrophe, which affects probability assessments.

3. **Time horizons**: Estimates vary in their timeframes, from annual probabilities to century-long or 500-year projections.

4. **Selection effects**: As noted in the question description, some surveys may be biased by sampling from groups already concerned with catastrophic risks.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Based on the information available as of November 2017, a reasonable probabilistic assessment would place the likelihood of human extinction by 2100 in the range of 1-20%:

- The lower bound (approximately 1%) represents more conservative estimates and accounts for humanity's demonstrated resilience.

- The upper bound (approximately 20%) reflects the Oxford conference median estimate, though with the acknowledged selection bias.

- The midpoint estimates from various experts (5-13%) may represent a more balanced view, accounting for both anthropogenic and natural extinction risks.

This assessment carries significant uncertainty due to:

1. The inherent difficulty in predicting low-probability, high-impact events
2. Potential unknown future technological developments that could either increase or decrease extinction risk
3. The limited number of formal, comprehensive studies on human extinction probability available as of 2017

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several limitations affect this forecast:

1. **Self-selection bias**: As noted, experts who study extinction risks may have higher prior beliefs about these risks.

2. **Limited empirical basis**: Human extinction has never occurred, making historical data unavailable for modeling.

3. **Evolving risk landscape**: New technologies and threats continue to emerge, potentially changing extinction risk profiles.

4. **Verification challenges**: As noted in the question description, verifying actual human extinction would be practically impossible if it occurred.
