## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of 2020, the longest documented increases in human lifespan have come from public health advances and control of infectious diseases, not direct medical interventions targeted at aging in healthy adults.
- Several drugs and compounds—such as metformin, rapamycin, and novel supplement formulations (e.g., NOVOS Core)—have extended lifespan in animal models and in limited ways in humans, but none have demonstrated an average lifespan extension of 25 years for healthy adults by conventional medical standards[1][3].
- The Targeting Aging with Metformin (TAME) trial aims to study whether metformin can delay age-related diseases in humans, but it had not started as of 2020 due to funding challenges[1].
- Studies in mice with interventions like NOVOS Core have shown up to 18% extension in lifespan, but translating such results to humans is highly uncertain, and no intervention has achieved a 25-year extension in any mammalian species[3].

## 2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- Research interest and funding in longevity science has increased, but no regulatory or scientific body has endorsed any specific intervention as capable of extending average human lifespan by 25 years as of 2020[1].
- Public opinion and some scientific voices suggest that radical life extension is plausible this century, but these are projections rather than results[4].
- No announcements of transformative AI or comparable scientific accelerators have occurred to "call off" the prediction as of 2020.

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Peer-reviewed studies on metformin, rapamycin, and other longevity interventions[1][3].
- U.S. Census Bureau and other demographic sources tracking trends in maximum and average lifespans[4].
- Open Philanthropy's 2017 report laying out the original reference probability and resolution criteria.

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties in Measurement

- Animal model results do not reliably predict human outcomes, especially for complex, multifactorial traits like aging.
- The sociopolitical, ethical, and regulatory acceptance of dramatic life extension interventions is uncertain.
- The definition of "average lifespan extension" depends on robust, long-term, controlled human trials, none of which had been completed or even started for leading candidates as of 2020.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the state of the science as of 2020, there is no compelling evidence to significantly revise the 7% probability estimated by Open Philanthropy in 2017. The field has seen increased activity and some intriguing animal results, but there are no breakthroughs or new paradigms to justify a substantial adjustment upward. Conversely, no major negative results have occurred to justify lowering the probability. The likelihood that by 1 January 2067, medical interventions for healthy adults will extend average lifespan by at least 25 years remains in the single-digit percentage range, consistent with prior expert assessments.
