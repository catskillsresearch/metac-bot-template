## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- **Iran’s Nuclear Program**: Since the US withdrawal from the JCPOA in 2018, Iran has expanded its uranium enrichment well beyond the 3.67% cap, now enriching up to 60%—close to weapons-grade but not sufficient alone for a bomb. As of late 2024, Iran announced significant upgrades: installing 32 additional centrifuge cascades and increasing 60% enrichment at the Fordow facility, which is deeply buried and resilient to airstrikes[3][5].
- **Threshold Status**: As of early 2025, Iran is considered a "nuclear weapons threshold state," meaning it possesses the technical capability and infrastructure to quickly produce weapons-grade uranium if it chooses[4][5].
- **Weaponization Gap**: Possessing sufficient highly enriched uranium is only part of the process. US and UK intelligence assessments in 2024–25 consistently found no clear evidence that Iran is building a deliverable nuclear weapon. The estimated timeline to assemble a deliverable warhead after obtaining weapons-grade material is generally 1–2 years[5].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- **2024–2025 Escalation**: Iran notified the IAEA of further enrichment expansion at Fordow and the installation of advanced centrifuges, accelerating its breakout timeline for fissile material[3].
- **Diplomatic Activity**: In April–May 2025, indirect US-Iran talks resumed, but with little public information on progress[5]. Domestic debate in Iran has increased over whether to pursue an actual weapon, particularly after heightened regional tensions and military exchanges with Israel[5].
- **Official Stance**: Iran continues to claim its program is for civilian purposes. The US Director of National Intelligence reiterated in 2025 that Iran is "not building a nuclear weapon"[5].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

The question will resolve as "Yes" only if there is credible public confirmation from the following:
- The Iranian government with corroboration by credible sources.
- A report by the Arms Control Association, Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, or Federation of American Scientists confirming Iran possesses or has tested a nuclear weapon.

As of May 2025, none of these sources have reported Iran as possessing a nuclear weapon[3].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- **Measurement Uncertainty**: Weaponization activities (like warhead miniaturization or missile integration) are harder to detect than uranium enrichment.
- **Political Unpredictability**: Shifts in Iranian policy—particularly in response to regional security threats or diplomatic isolation—could accelerate weaponization.
- **Short Timeframe**: With only seven months left until 2026, Iran would have to move rapidly and overtly for the resolution criteria to be met, which would likely be detected by international agencies or leaked by intelligence sources.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

- **Probability**: Given the current pace of enrichment, existing intelligence assessments, lack of observed weaponization, and the requirement for public, authoritative confirmation, the probability that Iran will possess a nuclear weapon (per the specified resolution criteria) before 2026 is moderate but probably less than 30%.
- **Key Watchpoints**: Sudden Iranian policy change, clear evidence of weaponization, or a credible public announcement would sharply change this outlook.
