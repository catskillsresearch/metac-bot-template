# US Building Permits Rate for February 2025

Based on the latest available data as of March 3, 2025, I can provide the following information regarding the annual rate of new US building permits for privately-owned housing units in February 2025.

## February 2025 Building Permits Data

According to the Census Bureau's report, building permits fell for a third straight month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.456 million in February 2025[2]. This represents a 1.2% decrease from the previous month[2].

For context, the January 2025 building permits were at a level of 1.482 million[3], indicating a downward trend in early 2025.

## Structure Breakdown

The February decline appears to be part of a continuing trend. Looking at the most recent structure breakdown data available:

- **Single-family building permits**: These have shown weakness, with recent data indicating a downward trend[2]
- **Multi-family building permits**: These have shown volatility, with some months showing increases followed by decreases[2]

## Housing Market Outlook for 2025

The broader housing market forecasts for 2025 provide important context for interpreting the February building permits data:

- Industry forecasts consistently predict that single-family starts will rise while multifamily starts will decline in 2025[4]
- According to the NAA/John Burns Research & Consulting Apartment Developer and Investor Survey from late 2024, 65% of developers expected starts to decrease in the following 12 months[4]
- Private sector data providers projected apartment completions to drop in 2025 by 8% to 51%, with another significant reduction expected in 2026[4]

## Factors Affecting Building Permits

Several factors may be influencing the February 2025 building permits figure:

- The Census Bureau implemented methodology changes to its building permits survey beginning in January 2025, which may affect how the data is calculated and reported
- Apartment market indicators were expected to show improving occupancy rates in 2025, increasing by 10 to 50 basis points[4]
- Effective rent growth was forecast to be stronger in 2025 than in 2024, ranging from 2.6% to 4.8%[4]

## Limitations and Uncertainties

When interpreting the February 2025 building permits data, it's important to note:

- Building permits data is known for its volatility, which is why analysts often pay more attention to the six-month moving average than to monthly changes[2]
- The preliminary figures released by the Census Bureau are sometimes revised in subsequent months
- The methodology changes implemented in January 2025 may affect comparability with previous periods
