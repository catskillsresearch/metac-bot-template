## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The Diversity Visa (DV) Program is a long-standing, congressionally mandated initiative under Section 203(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), administered annually by the US Department of State[1].
- For Fiscal Year 2025 (DV-2025), up to 55,000 visas are available, with eligibility and application instructions published in October 2023[1].
- The program has operated continuously for decades, with annual cycles and published instructions for each fiscal year[1][4].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- The official instructions for DV-2025 confirm the program's operation for the 2025 cycle, with no changes in eligibility (except for the United Kingdom and its territories becoming eligible)[1].
- Entrants for DV-2025 registered between October 4 and November 7, 2023, and results are available beginning May 4, 2024[3].
- Selectees are advised to keep their confirmation number until at least September 30, 2025, indicating the program's infrastructure (including the website) is expected to remain accessible through that date[5].
- There have been no official announcements or policy changes as of March 5, 2025, suggesting the removal or discontinuation of the DV program or its web presence[1][2][3][4].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The official "Submit an Entry" page and instructions are hosted on the US State Department's travel.state.gov domain[1].
- USA.gov and US embassy websites provide additional guidance and status updates on the DV program[2][3][4].
- The "DV Entrant Status Check" portal is the only official means for entrants to check their selection status, further supporting the continued operation of the website[5].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- While the program is statutorily mandated and there is no indication of imminent removal, government websites can change for technical or administrative reasons.
- Political discussions, such as Donald Trump's 2017 tweet, have called for ending the program, but no legislative or executive action has eliminated it as of March 5, 2025.
- The question resolves based on the presence of the specific "Submit an Entry" page, which could theoretically be moved or reorganized, though this is not indicated by any current information.

## Conclusion

Based on all available factual information as of March 5, 2025, the US State Department's Diversity Visa "Submit an Entry" page is expected to remain online through March 31, 2025, with no evidence of planned removal or program cancellation for the 2025 cycle[1][3][5].
