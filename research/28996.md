## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The US has seen a surge in AI-related legislative proposals at both state and federal levels in 2025, reflecting growing concern over AI’s societal impact and the need for regulatory clarity[1][2][3][4].
- As of May 2025, the US federal government still lacks a comprehensive, general AI regulation law. Existing measures—such as the National Artificial Intelligence Initiative Act of 2020—focus on innovation and research, not broad governance or oversight[3].
- The Biden administration issued executive orders and an “AI Bill of Rights” outlining policy goals, but these are not binding law and many have been rolled back or deprioritized under the Trump administration’s second term[3][4].
- A bipartisan House Task Force released recommendations on AI regulation in December 2024, but no major federal bill focused on general AI regulation has passed both chambers[3].
- A recent House committee attempted to include language in a tax and spending bill to preempt state-level AI regulation, highlighting Congressional awareness but also partisan and procedural obstacles to comprehensive federal action[5].

## Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Metric

- Over a dozen federal AI bills and hundreds of state bills have been introduced in early 2025, but most are fragmented, sector-specific, or in early stages of debate[1][2][3].
- Tech industry leaders and some lawmakers are pushing for federal regulation to avoid a patchwork of state laws, but there is no unified legislative front or consensus on the scope of regulation[5].
- The Trump administration’s policy direction has shifted toward deregulation and innovation, rolling back several Biden-era regulatory initiatives and creating uncertainty about new federal regulatory efforts[3][4].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL) for legislative tracking[1]
- Software Improvement Group for comprehensive legislative overviews[3]
- PYMNTS, Cimplifi, and InsideGlobalTech for reporting on recent bills and regulatory debates[2][4][5]

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- US federal lawmaking on complex technologies is often slow, with bipartisan divides, lobbying pressure, and competing priorities delaying comprehensive action.
- While legislative activity is high, most federal proposals remain in committee or are attached to unrelated bills, limiting their chances of enactment.
- The current administration’s priority appears to be preempting state regulation rather than enacting comprehensive federal rules, at least in the immediate term[5].
- The risk of continued regulatory fragmentation—absent strong bipartisan agreement—remains significant.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the above, the probability that the US will pass a comprehensive, general federal AI regulation bill (meeting all resolution criteria) before January 1, 2026, is **moderate to low**—likely in the 20–35% range. Increased urgency, industry lobbying, and global precedent (EU AI Act) are positive signals, but ongoing partisanship, administrative priorities, and legislative inertia are major constraints[3][5].
