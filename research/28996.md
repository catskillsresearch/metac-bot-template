## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Despite the exponential growth in AI capabilities and widespread calls for regulation, the United States has not yet passed a comprehensive federal AI regulation law as of late May 2025. Current federal action consists of executive orders and non-binding frameworks, such as the 2022 “AI Bill of Rights” and the 2023 Executive Order 14110, which provide policy direction but do not establish enforceable, general regulatory standards[1][2][3][4].
- Legislative momentum exists: numerous AI-related bills have been introduced at both federal and state levels in 2025, reflecting growing political and public concern[3][4]. However, these efforts have so far failed to produce an overarching regulatory framework.
- In May 2025, the House of Representatives passed a budget reconciliation bill that includes a 10-year moratorium on state and local AI regulations, preempting local action without establishing federal standards[1][2]. This is a significant federal intervention in AI policy, but not a comprehensive regulatory bill as defined by the resolution criteria.

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- The House-passed moratorium bill would prevent states and localities from enacting or enforcing AI laws for a decade, aiming to address the “patchwork” of state rules and buy time for Congress to consider federal regulation[1][2]. However, the bill’s fate is uncertain in the Senate, with Democratic lawmakers expected to challenge the inclusion of the AI provision under budget reconciliation rules[2].
- There is no indication that a comprehensive, general AI regulation bill (as opposed to sector-specific or procedural bills) is poised to pass both chambers and be signed into law in the near term[3][4].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- The current House action is not a general AI regulation bill as required by the resolution criteria; it preempts state/local laws but does not establish a federal regulatory framework.
- The fate of the bill is uncertain in the Senate and may be derailed by procedural rules or partisan opposition[2].
- The US legislative process is slow, with upcoming elections and ongoing partisan division adding to the uncertainty.
- Rapid AI advancements or a major AI-related incident could change the political calculus, but no such event or breakthrough in consensus is evident as of late May 2025.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given:
- The lack of comprehensive federal AI regulation so far,
- The passage of a preemption bill in the House (but not the Senate),
- The complex, contentious nature of federal technology regulation,
- No imminent, bipartisan push for a general AI regulatory bill,

**The probability that the US will pass a comprehensive federal bill on AI regulation—meeting the outlined resolution criteria—before January 1, 2026, appears low.** A reasonable probabilistic assessment, based on current information, would be **less than 20%**.
