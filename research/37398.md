# Forecasting X (Twitter) Censorship Status on Wikipedia by June 2025

Based on the available information as of May 29, 2025, I'll analyze the likelihood that Wikipedia will continue to list China, Iran, Myanmar, North Korea, Pakistan, Russia, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela as "currently" blocking access to X (formerly Twitter) at the end of June 2025.

## Current Censorship Landscape

The "Censorship of Twitter" Wikipedia page documents government-imposed blocks on the platform now known as X[1]. This is distinct from content moderation or account suspensions implemented by the platform itself, which are covered under "Twitter suspensions"[2].

As of late May 2025, we can observe that internet censorship remains an active practice globally. Russia, for example, continues to implement partial blocks on Wikipedia, with most parts accessible but Wikimedia Commons currently inaccessible as of May 25, 2025[3]. This suggests that authoritarian regimes continue to maintain internet censorship infrastructures.

## Recent Developments

The search results don't indicate any recent changes to X's accessibility status in the eight countries specified in the question (China, Iran, Myanmar, North Korea, Pakistan, Russia, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela). There are no reports of these countries lifting their bans on X or implementing new restrictions in recent months.

One notable development in X's history occurred in February 2025, when Twitter settled a lawsuit with former President Donald Trump regarding his account suspension, paying approximately $10 million[4]. However, this corporate legal matter appears unrelated to government censorship of the platform.

## Forecast Analysis

### Factors Supporting Continued Blocking

1. **Historical Persistence**: Countries like China and North Korea have maintained long-term, comprehensive internet censorship regimes, suggesting stability in their blocking policies.

2. **Current Censorship Trends**: The continued partial blocking of Wikipedia in Russia as of May 2025[3] indicates that authoritarian regimes remain committed to controlling internet access.

3. **Short Timeframe**: With only one month between the current date (May 29, 2025) and the resolution date (July 1, 2025), significant policy changes across multiple countries would be unusual without major precipitating events.

### Factors Supporting Potential Changes

1. **Dynamic Censorship Patterns**: Some countries have historically implemented temporary blocks rather than permanent ones. Pakistan, for instance, has been known to block services for shorter periods[3].

2. **Potential Undetected Recent Changes**: The search results may not capture very recent policy changes in some of the countries listed.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

The primary limitation in this forecast is the lack of specific, recent information about X's blocking status in each of the eight countries. The search results don't provide detailed updates on whether any of these countries have recently changed their policies regarding X.

Additionally, Wikipedia's "Current" section relies on editors updating information, which may introduce delays between actual policy changes and their documentation on the page.

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on the available information, I estimate an **80-85% probability** that Wikipedia will still list all eight countries (China, Iran, Myanmar, North Korea, Pakistan, Russia, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela) as currently blocking X at the end of June 2025. This high probability reflects:

1. The absence of information indicating recent changes
2. The historical persistence of internet censorship in these regimes
3. The short timeframe until resolution

The remaining 15-20% uncertainty accounts for potential undetected recent changes or policy shifts that might occur in the coming month.
