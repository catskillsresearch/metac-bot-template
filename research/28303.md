### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of mid-September 2024, the AAA national average retail price for regular gasoline is $3.20 per gallon[4].
- Gas prices have fallen sharply—about 13% or nearly 50 cents per gallon—from their 2024 peak in April[4].
- In 16 states, the average price is already below $3 per gallon, and in five states, it is under $3[4].
- Earlier in the summer, prices hovered around $3.50, but have since declined due to seasonal demand drops and falling crude oil prices[3][4].

### Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Metric

- Experts, including those at GasBuddy and AAA, expect the national average to continue declining, with some forecasts suggesting it could fall below $3 per gallon for the first time since May 2021[4].
- The drop is attributed to sluggish post-summer demand and a sharp decline in crude oil prices[4].
- AAA notes that hurricanes affecting Gulf Coast refineries could cause temporary price spikes, but as of late August 2024, no such events have led to sustained increases[3].

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The AAA National Average Gas Prices page is the definitive source for the metric in question, specifically the "Yesterday Avg." for "Regular" gas on September 30, 2024.

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- Gasoline prices are subject to sudden changes from supply disruptions (e.g., hurricanes, refinery outages, geopolitical events).
- The forecast assumes no major supply shocks or policy changes before September 30, 2024.
- The AAA methodology is stable and widely accepted, but real-time data can be volatile.

### Summary Forecast

Given the current price ($3.20), the established downward trend, and expert forecasts for further declines, it is unlikely that the US national average retail price of regular gasoline will be greater than $3.10 on September 30, 2024, according to AAA, barring an unexpected supply shock[4][3].
