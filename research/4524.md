# US Nuclear Testing Forecast: Analysis Through 2030

As a forecasting analyst examining whether the US will conduct a nuclear test explosion before 2030, I'll assess the historical context, current situation, and factors that might influence this decision.

## Historical Context and Current Status

The United States conducted its last nuclear test (codenamed "Divider") on September 23, 1992, after which President George H.W. Bush declared a moratorium on nuclear weapons testing. Since then, the US has maintained this unilateral testing moratorium for nearly three decades.

In 1996, the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) was adopted by the UN General Assembly and opened for signature. The United States signed the CTBT but has not ratified it[1][2]. This treaty bans all nuclear explosions on Earth but requires ratification from 44 specific "Annex 2" states before it can enter into force[1]. As of 2020, eight key countries including the United States have not completed the necessary ratifications, preventing the treaty from becoming fully enforceable[4].

The Trump Administration's 2018 Nuclear Posture Review reaffirmed the continuation of the US unilateral moratorium on nuclear testing[5]. However, the US maintains its nuclear stockpile through alternative methods, primarily using supercomputer simulations and subcritical experiments that do not produce nuclear yield, which are permitted under both the CTBT and the US moratorium[5].

## Recent Developments Affecting the Forecast

Several recent factors could influence the likelihood of US nuclear testing resumption:

1. **Allegations of foreign testing**: In 2020, the United States alleged that Russia had conducted low-yield nuclear tests between 1996 and 2019[2]. These allegations, if substantiated, could weaken the normative power of the testing moratorium.

2. **Reported considerations of testing**: As of May 2020, there have been reports that the Trump administration considered conducting a nuclear test explosion in response to suspected Russian and Chinese low-yield tests. This indicates that at least some officials within the administration have contemplated ending the moratorium.

3. **Stockpile reliability concerns**: Some experts argue that computer simulations alone are insufficient to ensure the reliability of the aging US nuclear arsenal. The National Nuclear Security Administration's mission to maintain a "safe, secure, and reliable nuclear stockpile" could potentially be used to justify resuming testing if concerns about stockpile reliability grow[5].

## Comparative Analysis with Reference Cases

Historical precedents suggest several factors that typically precede resumption of nuclear testing:

1. **Perceived security threats**: Nations have historically resumed testing when facing new security challenges. Current US-Russia-China tensions mirror some aspects of Cold War dynamics.

2. **Technical necessity**: Countries have conducted tests when needing to verify new designs or ensure reliability of existing ones. The US stockpile is aging, potentially increasing pressure for verification testing.

3. **Treaty abandonment**: Testing often follows withdrawal from treaties. While the US has not ratified the CTBT, abandoning its unilateral moratorium would represent a significant policy shift.

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on the available information as of June 2020, I assess the probability of the US conducting a nuclear test explosion before 2030 as relatively low but not negligible. Key factors supporting this assessment:

- The longstanding US moratorium (since 1992) represents significant policy inertia
- The international diplomatic costs of resuming testing would be substantial
- Alternative verification methods continue to advance technologically

However, several factors could increase this probability:

- Confirmed evidence of Russian or Chinese testing could rapidly change the calculus
- Growing concerns about stockpile reliability as weapons systems age
- Potential shifts in US nuclear policy depending on future administrations

The most likely scenario for resumed testing would involve confirmed foreign testing combined with technical concerns about the US stockpile reliability that cannot be addressed through simulation alone.

## Verification and Measurement Considerations

Any US nuclear test would be detected by the International Monitoring System established under the CTBTO, which includes seismic, hydroacoustic, infrasound and radionuclide monitoring stations worldwide[1]. Additionally, other nuclear powers maintain their own detection capabilities.

The zero-yield standard in the CTBT prohibits "any test that produces a self-sustaining, supercritical chain reaction of any kind," which provides a clear technical threshold for what constitutes a prohibited test[5].
