## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The Conservative Party, under Kemi Badenoch's leadership since November 2024, has continued to struggle in national polls and suffered heavy defeats in the 2025 local elections, losing over 600 council seats and 13 councils.
- Comparisons to previous Conservative leaders show that leaders presiding over historic electoral losses—such as Theresa May (2019) and Iain Duncan Smith (2003)—often faced organized leadership challenges within a year, especially when subsequent polling and local election results failed to improve[1].
- As of late May 2025, there is mounting internal pressure: MPs are openly plotting to remove Badenoch, and local party chairmen are reportedly considering confidence motions, echoing the steps that led to May's resignation[1].

## Recent Announcements and Party Dynamics

- Badenoch has publicly dismissed calls for her resignation as "not serious," signaling she does not intend to step down voluntarily in the near term[1].
- However, senior party figures and commentators view a leadership challenge as "inevitable" amid renewed panic over the party's future and the rise of Reform UK, with some MPs and party activists actively preparing the ground for a contest[1].
- Polling indicates that only about a quarter of the public and just over half of Conservative voters believe Badenoch is doing a good job, with a significant portion of both groups expressing doubts or indifference—a weak base for withstanding an internal challenge[3].

## Key Differences Affecting the Forecast

- The party is more diminished and fractured than in many past leadership crises, which may slow the coordination needed to trigger a formal challenge.
- The threshold to trigger a confidence vote (15% of MPs) is numerically lower due to the reduced number of Conservative MPs, potentially making it easier for dissidents to reach the required number of letters.
- Unlike some predecessors, Badenoch lacks a strong personal mandate or clear policy direction post-election, increasing her vulnerability.
- The leadership rules and cultural precedent do not require a formal scandal or electoral defeat to trigger a challenge—sustained poor performance and morale can suffice.

## Probabilistic Assessment

Given the:

- Active plotting and public acknowledgment of internal dissent[1]
- Precedent of previous leaders being challenged within a year after similar or lesser crises
- Ongoing poor polling and electoral performance

there is a **high probability** that a leadership challenge will be formally launched before September 2025, and a moderate probability that Badenoch will either resign or lose a confidence vote as a result. The most likely pathway is a challenge triggered by letters to the 1922 Committee rather than voluntary resignation. However, the process may be delayed by party lethargy, lack of a clear successor, or short-term tactical calculations.

**Estimated probability (as of 2025-05-25):**  
- Challenge or resignation before September 2025: **65-75%**

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- The precise number of letters submitted to the 1922 Committee is confidential, and internal party dynamics may shift rapidly.
- A lack of a coordinated alternative candidate could delay or deflate a challenge.
- Badenoch’s personal resolve and any unexpected improvement in polling or party morale could reduce the likelihood of a successful challenge.
