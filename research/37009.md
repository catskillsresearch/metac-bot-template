# Forecasting Analysis: Project 2025's NPR and PBS Defunding Objective

As of May 16, 2025, I'm assessing the likelihood that the Project 2025 Tracker will mark the objective of stopping funding for NPR and PBS as "complete" before July 1, 2025. Currently, this objective is marked as "in progress" according to the query description.

## Current Status

The most significant development is that President Trump has already issued an executive order directing the Corporation for Public Broadcasting to cease funding for NPR and PBS[2]. This executive action represents a major step toward fulfilling the Project 2025 objective, though the tracker still lists it as "in progress" rather than "complete."

## Recent Developments

In March 2025, approximately two months ago, the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) specifically targeted NPR and PBS for investigation[5]. FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr, who authored the FCC section in Project 2025's 900-page plan, stated: "I'm not sure I see a reason why the taxpayer should be forced to subsidize NPR and PBS"[5]. This indicates continued administrative focus on this objective.

The Project 2025 plan explicitly calls for the elimination of funding to NPR and PBS[5], and this has been a consistent goal documented in the tracker system that monitors implementation progress[1].

## Implementation Timeline Analysis

With the executive order already issued, the primary question is whether full implementation will occur and be recognized as "complete" by the Project 2025 Tracker before July 1, 2025. Several factors suggest this is likely:

1. Executive orders typically take effect immediately unless specified otherwise
2. The current date (May 16, 2025) provides approximately 1.5 months for implementation to be finalized
3. DOGE's active involvement suggests ongoing administrative pressure to complete this objective
4. The explicit language in Project 2025 about defunding these organizations aligns with the executive action already taken

## Potential Obstacles

Several factors could potentially delay the "complete" designation:

1. Legal challenges to the executive order
2. Congressional intervention or budget complications
3. Administrative delays in implementation
4. Specific criteria used by the Project 2025 Tracker to determine "completion" versus "in progress"

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on the available evidence, I assess there is approximately a **75-80% probability** that the Project 2025 Tracker will mark the objective of stopping funding for NPR and PBS as "complete" before July 1, 2025.

The executive order already issued represents the most significant step toward completion, and the continued focus from DOGE suggests administrative follow-through. The remaining time (approximately 1.5 months) should be sufficient for implementation to be recognized as complete by the tracker, barring significant legal or administrative obstacles.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

This forecast is limited by:
- Lack of specific information about the Project 2025 Tracker's criteria for marking objectives as "complete"
- Uncertainty about potential legal challenges to the executive order
- Limited visibility into implementation timelines for the funding cessation
- Potential for political developments that could affect implementation
