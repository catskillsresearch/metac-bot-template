### Key Factual Information Relevant to the Forecast

**1. Current Box Office Tracking and Forecasts**
- BoxOfficeTheory's five-week tracking (as of early November 2024) forecasts an opening weekend range for The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim between $15 million and $24 million, with a midpoint forecast of $20 million[3]. This range reflects current market sentiment and pre-release data, but is subject to change as more information (such as pre-sales and marketing impact) becomes available.
- BoxOfficePro's long-range forecast (as of mid-November 2024) projects a domestic opening weekend range of $10 million to $25 million[1]. This wide range highlights the uncertainty in audience turnout for this animated installment, especially compared to previous live-action entries in the franchise.

**2. Historical Franchise Performance**
- The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit trilogies were major box office successes, with each film opening in December and achieving massive domestic and global grosses. However, The War of the Rohirrim is expected to perform "well below anything from the Lord of the Rings or Hobbit trilogies," due to its animated format and the passage of time since the franchise's peak popularity[1][2].

**3. Market Context and Competition**
- The film opens in a crowded holiday season, which could impact its box office potential. The franchise is not as fresh with modern audiences, and animated spinoffs typically draw less than live-action tentpoles[1].

**4. Definitions and Measurement**
- "Domestic" box office refers to gross receipts from North America (U.S., Canada, and Puerto Rico), as defined by Box Office Mojo[3].
- Opening weekend is measured from Friday through Sunday, with studio estimates reported on Sunday mornings[3].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- All forecasts are subject to revision as new data (such as ticket pre-sales and marketing effectiveness) becomes available[3].
- The wide forecast ranges reflect significant uncertainty, and the final result could fall anywhere within or even outside these bounds.
- Animated franchise entries often have less predictable performance compared to live-action films, especially for established properties like The Lord of the Rings.

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Box Office Mojo will provide the official domestic opening weekend gross for The War of the Rohirrim, which will be used for resolution.
- BoxOfficeTheory and BoxOfficePro are the primary industry sources for pre-release tracking and forecasts.

### Conclusion

As of November 21, 2024, the best available forecasts place The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim's domestic opening weekend in a range that straddles the $20 million threshold, with both major tracking sources listing $20 million as a plausible outcome but not a certainty[1][3]. The result is highly uncertain and will depend on final pre-release momentum and audience turnout.
