### 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The FOMC's voting members include 7 Board of Governors (BOG) members (presidential appointees), the president of the New York Fed (permanent), and 4 rotating regional Fed presidents[1][4].
- BOG members are appointed for 14-year terms, but early resignations are not uncommon; most recent decades have seen several mid-term departures, often for personal or professional reasons.
- As of January 2025, the FOMC is fully staffed, with all 7 BOG seats filled and no public indications of imminent resignations or removals[1][4][5].
- Historically, FOMC membership changes via early resignation or removal have occurred, but the frequency is low compared to standard term expirations.

### 2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- No official announcements or policy changes, as of March 28, 2025, indicate impending early departures, removals, or plans to expand the Board of Governors[1][4].
- The 2025 roster is set, with new regional presidents rotating in, but this is according to the normal schedule rather than extraordinary appointments[5].
- No current legislative or executive branch efforts are publicly underway to alter the structure or number of BOG seats.

### 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The Federal Reserve's official FOMC website and press releases provide the most current membership lists and meeting information[1][2][3].
- Public databases, such as Wikipedia's FOMC page, are regularly updated with membership changes and can be cross-referenced for historical trends[4].
- Industry analysis and news media provide context on recent voting members and any turnover among regional presidents[5].

### 4. Limitations or Uncertainties

- Sudden events (health, scandal, political conflict) can prompt unexpected resignations or removals, which are inherently unpredictable.
- The President could nominate a replacement or an additional member if there is a resignation or statutory change, but there is no current indication of such plans.
- Measurement is limited by the availability and timeliness of public information; private deliberations or pending resignations may not be immediately visible.

### Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the FOMC's current full staffing, the lack of any public signals of impending early departures or removals, and no legislative or executive movement toward expanding the Board, the probability of a new FOMC member being appointed before any member's term is over and before January 20, 2029 is low but not zero. The base rate for such early changes is historically under 20% over a four-year period, rising modestly in times of political turmoil or as election cycles approach. 

As of late March 2025, a reasonable probabilistic estimate is that there is a 10â€“25% chance of a new FOMC member being appointed under the conditions described, with most risk stemming from unforeseen resignations rather than structural changes.
