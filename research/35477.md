# Analysis of UN Staff Presence in Gaza (as of February 2025)

Based on the available information as of February 28, 2025, here is an analysis to help forecast whether 290 or more UN staff will be reported to be working in Gaza according to OCHA's final impact snapshot before April 1, 2025.

## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

The humanitarian situation in Gaza remains severe, with significant implications for UN staffing levels:

- As of January 2025, approximately 1.9 million people (about 90% of Gaza's population) were displaced, many having been displaced multiple times[4].
- The conflict has resulted in at least 46,645 Palestinians reportedly killed and 110,012 injured between October 7, 2023, and January 14, 2025, according to the Ministry of Health in Gaza[4].
- Humanitarian workers face extreme risks in Gaza, with at least 318 humanitarian workers reported killed as of November 5, 2024[5].
- UNRWA, a key UN agency operating in Gaza, reported that many of its team members had been killed since October 7, 2023 (though the exact number is not specified in the available data)[4].

The query indicates that as of February 11, 2025, OCHA reported 277 UN staff working in Gaza, though this specific data point is not contained in the search results provided.

## Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting UN Staffing

Several factors may influence UN staffing levels in Gaza:

- The 2025 OPT Flash Appeal calls for $4 billion for UN agencies, INGOs, and NGO partners to address urgent humanitarian needs, indicating ongoing and expanded humanitarian operations that would require staffing[5].
- Humanitarian actors continue to face a "constrained operating environment in 2025," which makes it "impossible to scale up operations effectively"[5].
- The operating environment in Gaza is characterized by "rising security, logistics, demurrage, and staff costs" that are "inversely correlated with operating constraints"[5].
- Israeli evacuation orders have affected areas where UNRWA installations are located. For example, on January 12, 2025, an evacuation order impacted the Nuseirat area where three UNRWA installations were located[4].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

The most reliable sources for tracking UN staff numbers in Gaza include:

- OCHA's impact snapshots for the Gaza Strip, which provide regular updates on the humanitarian situation, including staffing levels.
- UNRWA situation reports, which detail the agency's operations and challenges in Gaza[4].
- The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) publications, including humanitarian situation updates for the Gaza Strip[1][2].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors create uncertainty in forecasting UN staff numbers:

- The volatile security situation in Gaza makes staffing levels highly unpredictable, with evacuation orders potentially affecting UN operations at short notice[4].
- As of January 14, 2025, around 80.5% of the Gaza Strip was under active evacuation orders from Israeli authorities, which could significantly impact where and how many UN staff can operate[4].
- The search results do not provide specific trend data on UN staffing levels over time, making it difficult to identify patterns or project future numbers.
- The "constrained operating environment" mentioned in the 2025 humanitarian planning documents suggests continued challenges in maintaining or increasing staff presence[5].

Given the available information, it is difficult to make a definitive forecast about whether UN staff numbers will reach 290 or more by April 1, 2025. The combination of increasing humanitarian needs (which would typically require more staff) and severe operational constraints (which limit staff deployment) creates opposing pressures on staffing levels.
