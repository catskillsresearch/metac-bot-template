# Forecasting US H5N1 Cases by December 31, 2024

To forecast the number of H5N1 cases the CDC will report by December 31, 2024, I've analyzed the available data as of mid-December 2024. This analysis focuses specifically on H5N1 subtype cases as required by the question parameters.

## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

As of December 2, 2024, the United States had confirmed 57 human cases of influenza A(H5N1) across 7 states[5]. The distribution of these cases was:
- California: 31 cases
- Washington: 11 cases
- Colorado: 10 cases
- Michigan: 2 cases
- Missouri: 1 case
- Texas: 1 case
- Oregon: 1 case

The case count has shown a steady increase throughout 2024:
- By November 18, 2024, there were 53 human cases of H5 bird flu reported in the United States[3]
- By November 22, 2024, this number had increased to 55 cases, including the first pediatric case in California[4]
- By December 2, 2024, the count reached 57 confirmed H5N1 cases[5]

It's important to note that the CDC's H5N1-specific tracker showed only 27 cases as of October 25, 2024, according to the question statement. This discrepancy likely stems from the CDC's shift to reporting H5 cases more broadly on its main tracker around July 2024, while maintaining separate tracking for confirmed H5N1 subtypes.

## Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

Several recent developments may impact the H5N1 case count by December 31:

1. **First Pediatric Case**: On November 22, 2024, the CDC confirmed the first H5N1 infection in a child in the United States. The child experienced mild symptoms and recovered, but this represents a new demographic being affected[4].

2. **Ongoing Surveillance**: The CDC continues active surveillance and testing, particularly among farm workers exposed to infected dairy cattle and poultry. This enhanced surveillance may identify additional cases before year-end[3].

3. **Exposure Patterns**: Most cases (98%) have been in adults over 18 years of age, with the majority associated with occupational exposure to infected dairy cattle and poultry[5]. The primary exposure locations have been:
   - Central Valley in California
   - Weld County in Colorado
   - Franklin County in Washington[5]

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

The most reliable sources for tracking official H5N1 case counts include:

1. **CDC's H5N1-specific tracker**: The official source that will determine the resolution of this question, available at cdc.gov. As of October 25, 2024, this showed 27 confirmed H5N1 cases[5].

2. **CDC Press Releases and Updates**: The CDC regularly issues updates on confirmed cases, as evidenced by their November 22 and December 10 announcements[1][4].

3. **Pan American Health Organization (PAHO)**: Their December 3, 2024 Epidemiological Alert reported 57 confirmed H5N1 cases in the US as of December 2, 2024[5].

## Limitations and Uncertainties in Measurement

Several factors create uncertainty in forecasting the final December 31 count:

1. **Reporting Lag**: There may be delays between case identification, confirmation, and public reporting, especially during the holiday season.

2. **H5 vs. H5N1 Distinction**: The CDC appears to track H5 cases more broadly on its main tracker while maintaining separate H5N1-specific counts. This creates potential confusion in interpreting the numbers[3][5].

3. **Testing Capacity**: The ability to specifically subtype H5 viruses as H5N1 may affect the official count. Not all H5 cases may be confirmed as specifically H5N1.

4. **Case Definition**: The criteria for confirming H5N1 cases may impact the final count. For example, the CDC notes that some cases have been identified through surveillance systems with varying levels of viral material detected[4].

Based on the current trend of approximately 2-4 new cases being identified per month in recent months, and assuming this rate continues, the CDC might report between 59-63 H5N1 cases by December 31, 2024. However, this projection depends heavily on whether the CDC updates its H5N1-specific tracker to align with the broader H5 case counts reported in other sources.
