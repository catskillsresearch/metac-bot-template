### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- In Gallup's 2023 World Affairs poll, 54% of Americans said their sympathies lay more with the Israelis, while 31% sympathized more with the Palestinians. This was the lowest share for Israelis since 2005 and the smallest gap Gallup has recorded, but still above the 50% threshold[2].
- The share of Americans not favoring either side fell to a new low of 15% in 2023[2].
- Gallup's 2024 data showed a decline in favorable views of Israel (58%, down from 68%), marking the lowest favorability since tracking began. However, Gallup noted that "Middle East sympathies [were] largely unchanged by war," suggesting the core sympathies metric may not have shifted as dramatically as favorability[3].
- Disapproval of Israeli actions in Gaza rose sharply in early 2024, with 55% disapproving and 36% approving, but this is a measure of approval of government actions, not the sympathies question[1].

### Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- No major U.S. policy changes or announcements directly affecting public sympathies toward Israelis or Palestinians were reported in the sources for the period leading up to the 2025 survey.
- The ongoing conflict in Gaza and increased media attention may have influenced public opinion, but Gallup's own analysis suggests that core sympathies have remained relatively stable despite these events[3].

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Gallup's annual World Affairs poll is the primary source for tracking American sympathies in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict[2][3].
- Additional Gallup polling on favorability and approval of Israeli actions provides context but does not directly answer the sympathies question[1][3].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- The most recent available data is from early 2024, and the 2025 survey results are not yet published. There is a lag of over a year between the last published data and the upcoming survey.
- Major geopolitical events or shifts in U.S. domestic politics could alter public opinion in ways not captured by the latest available data.
- The Gallup sympathies question is distinct from favorability or approval of government actions, so changes in those metrics may not translate directly to changes in sympathies.

### Summary

As of February 11, 2025, all available factual information indicates that while American sympathies for Israelis have declined to historic lows, they remained above 50% in the most recent Gallup data (54% in 2023). Favorability toward Israel and approval of its actions have declined further, but Gallup notes that core sympathies have been "largely unchanged" by recent events. Therefore, the best-supported forecast is that it remains plausible—but not certain—that 50% or more of respondents will express sympathies for the Israelis in Gallup's 2025 survey.
