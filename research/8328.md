## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of November 2021, AGI research was highly active, with 72 projects across 37 countries[1]. Efforts were spread among universities, for-profit corporations (e.g., Google DeepMind, Microsoft, Facebook AI Research), and non-profit or hybrid entities (notably OpenAI, which transitioned from a non-profit to a "capped-profit" structure)[1].
- Resource requirements (compute, data, talent) for frontier AI research in 2021 were immense, favoring well-funded organizations. Investment in AI had grown roughly 30-fold over the previous decade[5].
- While foundational AI research historically emerged from academia and non-profits, recent major advances (e.g., large language models, reinforcement learning breakthroughs) have come from large tech companies and hybrid non-profit/for-profit labs[2][1].
- OpenAI, once a pure non-profit, restructured into a “capped-profit” model to secure the investment and talent needed for AGI-scale projects while attempting to preserve mission alignment[1].

## 2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- The shift of OpenAI to a hybrid structure (announced in 2019) illustrates the challenge for non-profits to compete at the resource frontier without private capital. OpenAI remains mission-driven but is no longer strictly non-profit[1].
- No major new purely non-profit AGI efforts were announced as of November 2021, though some academic and government-affiliated labs continued work.
- The trend, as of 2021, was for major AI labs to seek hybrid financial/governance models to balance mission and capital needs.

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Wikipedia's overview of AGI and OpenAI's organizational history[1]
- Tableau's history of AI milestones[2]
- Our World in Data's review of AI investment growth[5]
- Metaculus and other forecasting platforms for AGI timelines and institutional trends[3]

## 4. Limitations or Uncertainties

- Classification ambiguity: Hybrid entities like OpenAI blur the lines between non-profit and for-profit, complicating resolution.
- Potential for rapid organizational change: A group that is non-profit in 2021 could restructure before AGI is achieved.
- Multilateral projects: The question resolves positively if a non-profit is part of a collaboration, making joint ventures relevant.
- Government and national lab efforts: Some government programs may not fit neatly into existing categories and could accelerate unexpectedly.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the above, as of November 2021:
- The probability that the first AGI is developed solely by a non-profit research group is **lower than for-profit or hybrid models**, primarily due to resource constraints and recent organizational trends.
- However, the probability that a non-profit is involved as part of a collaborative effort remains **significant** due to ongoing academic and mission-driven work.
- A reasonable adjusted probability (as of 2021-11-05) would be:
  - **10–20%**: AGI is developed solely by a non-profit group.
  - **30–40%**: AGI is developed by a collaboration involving a non-profit group.
  - **60–70%**: AGI is developed by a for-profit or hybrid entity without non-profit involvement.
