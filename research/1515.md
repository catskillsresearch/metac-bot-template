## 1. Historical Trends and Current Status (as of October 2018)

- Since the late 1990s, studies have suggested a small but potentially significant level of neurogenesis occurs in the adult mammalian and human hippocampus, implicated in memory formation and cognitive function.
- The prevailing dogma before the late 20th century was that adult brains do not generate new neurons. This was overturned by studies in rodents and nonhuman primates and, later, in humans.
- Two key 2018 studies sharply contradicted each other:
  - Sorrells et al. (March 2018) found that neurogenesis in the human hippocampus declines rapidly after infancy and is undetectable in adults, challenging the prior consensus[1][2].
  - Boldrini et al. (April 2018) reported continued neurogenesis in the adult human hippocampus using different markers and methodologies, supporting the view that new neurons are generated throughout life[3].
- The field remains divided, with no definitive consensus as of late 2018[3][5].

## 2. Key Differences Affecting the Forecast

- **Methodological Advances:** The main difference in recent studies is the use of more stringent and varied markers for identifying new neurons, as well as improved tissue preservation and analysis techniques. These have led to both negative and positive findings regarding adult human NG[2][3][5].
- **Discrepant Findings:** The direct contradiction between well-executed studies using different methodologies means that, as of 2018, the question remains highly contested and unresolved[1][3][5].
- **Technical Limitations:** The detection of NG in postmortem human brain tissue is highly sensitive to how samples are processed, potentially leading to false negatives or positives[4].

## 3. Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment (as of 2018)

- Given the state of the field in late 2018, the probability that, by 2028, definitive evidence will show functionally important adult human neurogenesis throughout the lifespan is **less than 50%**.
- The strongest reason is the lack of methodological consensus and the very low levels of NG detected, even by positive studies. Technical limitations may continue to obscure clear results for several more years[3][4][5].
- However, the possibility remains for technological or methodological breakthroughs that could tip the consensus by 2028, so this is not a negligible probability.

**Estimated probability as of October 2018:**  
- Positive resolution (functionally important adult NG exists): ~30–40%
- Negative resolution (no functionally important adult NG): ~40–50%
- Ambiguous/unresolved: ~20–30%

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- The measurement of NG in adult human brains is hampered by technical challenges, especially the rarity of neural progenitor cells and the sensitivity of markers to tissue processing[4][5].
- The existence of contradictory high-quality studies means any forecast must be tentative and subject to future discoveries.
- "Functional importance" is itself a complex criterion, requiring not just evidence of new neurons but also demonstration of their integration and impact on behavior or cognition.
