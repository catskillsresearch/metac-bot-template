## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The longest-lived laboratory mouse on record is a growth hormone receptor knockout (GHRKO) mouse, which lived approximately 1,800 days (almost five years) in the lab of Andrzej Bartke at Southern Illinois University[1][3].
- For standard laboratory strains (e.g., C57BL/6), the typical maximum lifespan under ideal conditions is about 1,200 days (3.29 years)[1].
- Exceptionally, some wild-derived or genetically diverse laboratory mice have reached lifespans slightly above 4 years (up to about 4.5 years, or ~1,642 days), but these are rare and still far below the 2,500-day mark[4][5].
- As of 2018, there are no verified instances or credible reports of a laboratory *Mus musculus* mouse living beyond these records.

## 2. Recent Announcements or Policies Affecting the Metric

- As of December 2018, there have been no major breakthroughs or announcements in the field of mammalian aging or rejuvenation that would plausibly enable a mouse to live well beyond existing records, such as to 2,500 days.
- Research continues in caloric restriction, genetic modification, and pharmacological interventions, but none have demonstrated results approaching the required increase in maximum lifespan for mice[1][5].
- No policy changes or funding initiatives specifically targeting extreme extension of maximum mouse lifespan have been reported as of this date.

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Lifespan records and claims for laboratory mice are documented by authoritative aging research databases and peer-reviewed publications, as well as media reports and institutional press releases in the event of a verified record[3][4][5].
- The question’s resolution criteria specify credible media reports as the standard for confirmation[1].

## 4. Limitations or Uncertainties in Measurement

- Laboratory mice are closely monitored, and their birth and death dates are well documented in research settings, minimizing ambiguity in lifespan measurement.
- The primary uncertainty is whether future breakthroughs—such as dramatic advances in rejuvenation biotechnology—will occur before 2035, enabling a mouse to surpass the longevity barrier.
- There is a low but nonzero probability of unreported or misreported lifespan records, but such cases are unlikely to satisfy the “credible media report” standard required for resolution.

## Comparison to Reference Cases and Key Differences

| Case                     | Maximum Observed Lifespan (days) | Key Differences Affecting Forecast                    |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Standard lab mouse       | ~1,200                            | Baseline; no intervention                            |
| Wild-derived/genetic outliers | ~1,642–1,819                 | Exceptional genetics, rare mutations                 |
| GHRKO mouse (record)     | ~1,800                            | Hormone receptor knockout, genetic manipulation      |
| Required for question    | 2,500                             | Would likely require major, as-yet-unseen breakthrough |

The gap between current record (1,800 days) and required (2,500 days) is substantial—nearly 40% beyond the current maximum. Bridging this gap would almost certainly require a transformative advance in mammalian aging biology.

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on historical trends and the lack of recent breakthroughs as of December 2018, the probability of a laboratory mouse being confirmed to have lived for 2,500 days before 1 January 2035 is moderate but not high. The forecasting community consensus at the time placed the probability at approximately 55%[1], reflecting the recognition that while possible, such an outcome would likely require an unprecedented advance in biotechnology.

|-----------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Longest-lived mouse         | ~1,800 days (GHRKO)      | Far short of 2,500 days                 |
| Standard lab strain max     | ~1,200 days              | Not competitive                         |

| Community forecast (2018)   | ~55%                     | Moderate, not high, probability         |
