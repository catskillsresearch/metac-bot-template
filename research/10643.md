## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of April 13, 2022, NATO had 30 member states.
- Finland joined on April 4, 2023, and Sweden on March 7, 2024, making 32 full members as of May 2025[1][2][3].
- NATO expansion is typically gradual, requiring consensus among all member states and fulfillment of membership criteria.

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- Finland and Sweden’s accessions were the most recent, driven by security concerns following Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine[2][3].
- Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, and Ukraine remain official aspiring members, but none are expected to join imminently due to significant political and security obstacles[1][2].
- There have been no official announcements or credible reports indicating that further enlargements will occur before December 31, 2025.

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- NATO’s official list of member states[1][5].
- Parliamentary briefings and news outlets documenting recent accessions and anticipated candidates[2][3][4].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- The main uncertainty is the possibility of accelerated accession for Ukraine, Georgia, or Bosnia and Herzegovina due to geopolitical developments. However, given the typical duration of accession and the requirement for unanimity, this remains unlikely before the end of 2025.
- There is no precedent for member withdrawal, so the number is unlikely to decrease.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

- The most likely number of NATO members on December 31, 2025, is **32**.
- There is a low probability that Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, or Ukraine will join by this date, barring extraordinary geopolitical shifts.
