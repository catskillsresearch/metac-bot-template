# Forecasting Core CPI Inflation for August 2024

The question of whether the month-over-month percentage increase in core CPI inflation in the US in August 2024 will be 0.2% requires analysis of recent inflation trends, economic projections, and factors influencing price pressures.

## Recent Core CPI Trends

The most recent data shows that the core Consumer Price Index (CPI-U excluding food and energy) increased by 0.2% month-over-month in July 2024, following a 0.1% increase in June[4]. This indicates a slight acceleration in core inflation from the previous month but remains moderate compared to earlier periods.

The year-over-year headline CPI fell to 2.9% in July 2024 from 3.0% in June, marking the smallest annual rise since March 2021[4]. While this refers to headline inflation rather than core inflation, it suggests a general downward trend in price pressures.

## Projections for Q3 2024

According to the Survey of Professional Forecasters released on August 9, 2024, the projection for core CPI in Q3 2024 (which includes August) has been revised downward to 2.6% from the previous forecast of 3.0%[1]. This downward revision suggests economists expect continued moderation in core inflation pressures during the quarter.

The quarterly projections show a gradual decline in core CPI inflation over time:
- Q3 2024: 2.6%
- Q4 2024: 2.6%
- Q1 2025: 2.4%
- Q2 2025: 2.4%[1]

These projections indicate that forecasters expect core inflation to remain relatively stable in the near term before gradually declining.

## Factors Influencing August 2024 Core CPI

Several factors could influence the August 2024 core CPI reading:

1. **Housing Costs**: The shelter index has been a significant contributor to core inflation. In July 2024, the shelter index increased by 0.4%, contributing to the majority of the monthly headline CPI increase[4]. Housing costs remain a key driver of the difference between current inflation rates and the Fed's 2% target.

2. **Service Prices**: Service sector inflation, particularly in areas like motor vehicle insurance (which rose 1% in July 2024), continues to contribute to core inflation pressures[4].

3. **Labor Market Conditions**: While still strong, there are signs of cooling in the labor market. The July 2024 employment report was weaker than expected, which could reduce wage pressures and subsequently inflation in services[4].

4. **Federal Reserve Policy**: The Federal Reserve's monetary policy stance influences inflation expectations. The softer inflation data, coupled with the weaker employment report, has increased expectations for the Fed to begin easing policy, potentially at the September 2024 FOMC meeting[4].

## Limitations in Forecasting

While historical trends and projections provide context, there are several limitations to consider:

1. **Monthly Volatility**: Month-to-month inflation readings can be volatile and affected by temporary factors not captured in quarterly projections.

2. **Measurement Challenges**: The BLS methodology for measuring core CPI involves sampling prices across various categories, which can introduce measurement uncertainties[2].

3. **Timing of Data**: The August 2024 CPI data will be released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics on September 11, 2024, according to their release schedule[2].

4. **Nowcasting Limitations**: While institutions like the Cleveland Fed provide nowcasts of inflation for PCE and CPI, these are estimates subject to revision as new data becomes available[3].

Based on the available information, the recent 0.2% month-over-month increase in core CPI for July 2024, combined with forecasters' expectations of moderating inflation pressures, suggests that a 0.2% increase for August 2024 is within the range of plausible outcomes. However, the exact figure will depend on the evolving economic conditions and specific price movements in August.
