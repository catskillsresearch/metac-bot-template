**Key Historical Trends and Current Status**

- US crude oil production has been on a steady upward trajectory in recent years, reaching record highs in late 2024 and early 2025. According to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), the average daily crude oil production in the US is projected to be 13.51 million barrels per day in 2025[1].
- The EIA's April 2025 Short-Term Energy Outlook (STEO) forecasts continued incremental growth, with production rising slightly each quarter[1][4].

**Recent Announcements and Policies**

- President Donald Trump, upon taking office for his second term in January 2025, declared a national energy emergency and directed agencies to expedite leasing, permitting, and production of domestic energy resources. However, the tangible impact of these measures on production volumes as early as April 2025 is likely limited, due to the time required for new drilling and infrastructure to affect output[1].

**Probabilistic Assessment for April 2025**

- Using the EIA's projected average for 2025 (13.51 million barrels/day), the estimated US crude oil production for April 2025 is:
  \[
  13.51 \text{ million barrels/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 405.3 \text{ million barrels} = 405,300 \text{ thousand barrels}
  \]
- Given the lack of evidence for an unusual production surge and considering the normal pace of month-to-month output gains, the best forecast for April 2025 is that US crude oil field production was approximately 405,000 thousand barrels[1][2][4].
- This estimate falls well within the open bounds of [300,000.0, 500,000.0] thousand barrels.

**Authoritative Sources for Verification**

- The most authoritative and up-to-date data source is the EIA's official monthly field production dataset[2], which will ultimately provide the finalized figure.
- The EIA's Short-Term Energy Outlook provides the relevant projections and context[1][4].

**Limitations and Uncertainties**

- The final, official April 2025 production figure may be subject to revision as more complete data are reported.
- Short-term effects from emergency policy actions are unlikely to materially alter production within a single quarter, though longer-term impacts could emerge in subsequent months.
- The monthly average is a projection, and actual daily production can fluctuate due to weather, maintenance, or unanticipated operational issues.
