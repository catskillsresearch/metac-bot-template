# Tesla Model 3 Pricing Forecast for December 30, 2024

## Current Pricing Status

As of November 11, 2024, the cheapest Tesla Model 3 was priced at $42,490, according to the query description. This aligns with information from October 2024, which indicated that the Tesla Model 3's Long Range Rear-Wheel Drive trim started at an MSRP of $42,490 without any upgrades, excluding taxes and fees[2].

The most recent pricing data available shows varying figures:
- According to Kelley Blue Book (as of May 2024), the Tesla Model 3 pricing started at $40,630[1]
- Electrek reported (as of October 2024) that the Long Range RWD Model 3 started at $42,490[2]
- Car and Driver indicates that for the 2025 model year, Tesla has dropped the Standard Range model (previously the least expensive option) from the lineup, with the new starting price at $44,130[5]

## Recent Changes and Announcements

A significant development affecting Tesla Model 3 pricing is that Tesla has eliminated the Standard Range model for the 2025 model year, which was previously the most affordable option in the lineup[5]. This change has effectively raised the entry price point for the Model 3.

The 2025 Tesla Model 3 now starts at $44,130 and ranges up to $56,630 depending on trim and options[5]. The base model now comes with rear-wheel drive and a single electric motor as standard[5].

## Historical Pricing Trends

Tesla has a history of price adjustments throughout the year. Looking back to December 2023, the Model 3 RWD was priced at $38,990 while the Long Range started at $45,990[4]. This demonstrates Tesla's willingness to adjust prices, sometimes significantly, over relatively short periods.

It's worth noting that the "Project Highland" facelifted Model 3 mentioned in late 2023 offered improvements including a sleeker body, improved range, and an updated cabin[4], which may have contributed to subsequent price adjustments.

## Forecast Analysis

Based on the most recent information available, the cheapest Tesla Model 3 appears to be priced at $44,130 for the 2025 model year[5], which is above the $43,000 threshold specified in the resolution criteria. The elimination of the Standard Range model has effectively raised the entry price point.

Unless Tesla implements a price reduction before December 30, 2024, it appears unlikely that the cheapest Model 3 will be listed under $43,000. The current trajectory suggests that the price will remain at or above $44,130.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors could affect this forecast:
- Tesla has a history of making unexpected price adjustments
- End-of-quarter or end-of-year sales incentives might be introduced
- Production costs, supply chain issues, or competitive pressures could prompt pricing changes
- The information available may not reflect the most current pricing strategy Tesla will implement by December 30, 2024
