# Forecasting Diplomatic Expulsions or Recalls Between the Philippines and China

## Current State of Philippines-China Relations

Relations between the Philippines and China have deteriorated significantly in 2024, primarily due to escalating tensions in the South China Sea. The two countries have experienced increasing confrontations, with a major clash occurring on June 17, 2024, that resulted in injuries to at least one Filipino serviceman[5]. This incident represents a significant escalation in the ongoing maritime dispute.

The Philippines under President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has markedly shifted away from his predecessor Rodrigo Duterte's Beijing-friendly approach. While Duterte sought to appease China through a reported "gentlemen's agreement" not to construct military outposts in disputed regions, Marcos Jr. has pursued stronger partnerships with the United States and Japan[3]. This policy shift has contributed to heightened tensions with Beijing.

## Recent Confrontations and Diplomatic Efforts

### Second Thomas Shoal Dispute

A central flashpoint in the conflict is the Second Thomas Shoal, where the Philippines maintains a military presence aboard the grounded vessel BRP Sierra Madre. China has effectively blocked Philippine resupply missions and halted ship repairs through gray zone tactics for over a year[1]. The Philippines faces a challenging predicament between responding to China's blockade and maintaining its occupation of the shoal.

The two countries' objectives regarding the Second Thomas Shoal appear irreconcilable:
- The Philippines aims to strengthen the BRP Sierra Madre to continue occupying the feature long-term
- China seeks to prevent this reinforcement while maintaining its claim to the area[1]

### Recent De-escalation Attempts

On July 3, 2024, China and the Philippines held a meeting aimed at easing tensions in the South China Sea, following the major clash on June 17[4]. This indicates that diplomatic channels remain open despite the serious confrontations. However, the effectiveness of these talks remains uncertain given the fundamental disagreements over territorial claims.

## Internal Political Dynamics in the Philippines

The Philippines is experiencing internal political rifts regarding its approach to China, which could influence diplomatic decisions:

1. Defense Secretary Teodoro Jr. has expressed skepticism about bilateral discussions with China, stating they should only occur "when it is proven that they are sincere"[5].

2. In contrast, other officials like Executive Secretary Bersamin have maintained that recent disputes "can easily be resolved" through diplomacy[5].

These divergent views within the Philippine government could either accelerate or restrain potential diplomatic actions like expulsions or recalls, depending on which faction's approach prevails.

## Factors Increasing Risk of Diplomatic Expulsions/Recalls

Several factors suggest an increased risk of diplomatic expulsions or recalls before September 30, 2024:

1. **Escalating Physical Confrontations**: China has employed water cannons, collision tactics, and military-grade lasers against Philippine vessels, with confrontations becoming increasingly dangerous.

2. **Irreconcilable Territorial Claims**: The fundamental dispute over the Second Thomas Shoal appears intractable, with both sides unwilling to compromise on their core positions[1].

3. **Public Pressure**: The June 17 incident that injured Filipino personnel has likely increased domestic pressure on the Marcos administration to take stronger action against China.

4. **Previous Diplomatic Tensions**: The Philippines' national security advisor has already called for the expulsion of Chinese diplomats over the leak of a telephone transcript, indicating that diplomatic expulsions are being actively considered as a policy option.

## Factors Decreasing Risk of Diplomatic Expulsions/Recalls

Counterbalancing factors suggest restraint might prevail:

1. **Ongoing Diplomatic Engagement**: Both countries continue to engage in bilateral discussions, as evidenced by the July 3 meeting aimed at de-escalating tensions[4].

2. **Economic Considerations**: The Philippines may be hesitant to severely damage economic ties with China, its largest trading partner.

3. **U.S. Posture**: The Biden administration has shown "little interest in offering direct military support in response to China's non-kinetic use of force"[5], which may encourage the Philippines to pursue diplomatic rather than confrontational approaches.

4. **Chinese Strategic Calculations**: Beijing understands that military action could push neighboring states to align more closely with extra-regional powers, contradicting its regional strategic objectives[1].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several key uncertainties could affect the likelihood of diplomatic expulsions or recalls:

1. The outcome and effectiveness of the July 3 de-escalation talks remain unclear.

2. Internal political dynamics within the Philippines government could shift rapidly.

3. Future incidents in the South China Sea could trigger escalatory responses that were not previously planned.

4. The search results do not provide information about specific red lines that either country has established that would trigger diplomatic expulsions if crossed.
