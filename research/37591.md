# Forecasting the 2025 Kids' Choice Award for Favorite Animated Movie

As of June 3, 2025, the 2025 Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards is scheduled to take place on June 21, 2025, at Barker Hangar in Santa Monica, California, hosted by Grammy-winning artist Tyla[5]. Below is an analysis of the available information to forecast the potential winner of the Favorite Animated Movie category.

## Historical Context and Trends

The Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards has a long-standing tradition of celebrating fan favorites across various entertainment categories. SpongeBob SquarePants holds the record for most KCA wins with twenty-one awards throughout its run[4]. In the animated movie category, Spider-Man: Across The Spider-Verse won the Favorite Animated Movie award at the 2024 ceremony[2][3].

The 2025 nominees represent a diverse mix of animation studios:
- 2 films from Disney (Moana 2, Mufasa: The Lion King)
- 1 film from Pixar/Disney (Inside Out 2)
- 2 films from DreamWorks/Universal (Dog Man, The Wild Robot)
- 1 film from Illumination/Universal (Despicable Me 4)
- 1 film from Nickelodeon/Netflix (Plankton: The Movie)
- 1 film from Paramount Animation/Hasbro (Transformers One)

## Current Status and Voting Dynamics

Voting for the 2025 Kids' Choice Awards is currently open, as indicated by the "VOTE NOW" call to action on the official Kids' Choice Awards website[2]. This means that the outcome is still in flux and could change significantly between now and the awards ceremony on June 21.

## Key Factors Influencing the Forecast

**Studio Performance History**: 
Disney and Nickelodeon properties have historically performed well at the KCAs. With SpongeBob's strong historical performance at the KCAs[4], Plankton: The Movie (a SpongeBob spinoff) could have an advantage on Nickelodeon's own platform.

**Sequel Advantage**: 
Several nominees are sequels to popular franchises (Inside Out 2, Moana 2, Despicable Me 4), which typically perform well with the KCA audience demographic.

**Voting Platform Ownership**: 
As Nickelodeon owns the Kids' Choice Awards, their own production (Plankton: The Movie) might have advantages in terms of promotion on the platform.

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on the available information as of June 3, 2025, here is a probabilistic assessment for each nominee:

**Higher Probability Contenders**:
- **Inside Out 2**: The original film was highly successful, and Pixar/Disney films typically perform well with young audiences. Amy Poehler is also nominated for her voice role as Joy[5].
- **Moana 2**: Disney sequels often perform well, and Auli'i Cravalho is nominated for her voice role[5].
- **Plankton: The Movie**: Given SpongeBob's historical dominance at the KCAs and Nickelodeon's ownership of the awards, this spinoff has strong potential.

**Medium Probability Contenders**:
- **Despicable Me 4**: The franchise has a strong track record with children.
- **Mufasa: The Lion King**: Disney's reimagining of classic properties has been successful.

**Lower Probability Contenders**:
- **Dog Man**
- **The Wild Robot**
- **Transformers One**

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors limit the accuracy of this forecast:
1. Voting is still ongoing, and children's preferences can be highly volatile.
2. The search results don't provide current voting tallies or trends.
3. Recent marketing campaigns and social media buzz, which could significantly influence voting patterns, are not captured in the available data.
4. Previous winners in this specific category beyond 2024 are not provided in the search results, limiting historical trend analysis.

The forecast will become more accurate as the award date approaches and if additional voting data becomes available.
