# Lockheed Martin Stock Price Forecast Through March 2025

Based on available information as of February 18, 2025, here's an analysis of whether Lockheed Martin's stock will remain below its all-time high of $618.95 through March 31, 2025.

## Current Status and Historical Trends

As of early 2025, Lockheed Martin (LMT) stock has been showing notable movement in the market. According to forecasts, the stock was expected to begin January 2025 at approximately $561, with a maximum projected price of $607 during the month[1]. This indicates that analysts did not expect the stock to breach its all-time high of $618.95 in January.

For February 2025, forecasts suggested the stock would begin at $562 with a maximum projected price of $615 during the month[1]. This maximum projection approaches but remains below the all-time high threshold of $618.95.

However, for March 2025, which is critical to the resolution of this question, forecasts indicated a beginning price of $569 with a maximum projected price of $620 during the month[1]. This maximum projection exceeds the all-time high threshold of $618.95, suggesting that according to at least one forecast model, the stock could potentially breach the all-time high during March 2025.

## Recent Announcements and Analyst Perspectives

Several financial institutions have provided price targets for Lockheed Martin in early 2025:

- On January 30, 2025, JPMorgan Chase & Co. maintained an "Overweight" rating but lowered their price target to $485.00[5]
- On January 29, 2025, Susquehanna maintained a "Positive" rating with a price target of $535.00[5]
- Citigroup maintained a "Buy" rating on January 21, 2025[5]

These analyst targets from major financial institutions remain significantly below the all-time high threshold of $618.95, suggesting that these analysts did not expect the stock to reach that level in the near term.

In corporate news, Lockheed Martin declared a first-quarter 2025 dividend of $3.30 per share in late January 2025[4]. While dividend announcements can positively impact stock prices, this particular dividend does not represent a significant change that would likely drive the stock above its all-time high.

## Uncertainties and Limitations

Several factors create uncertainty in this forecast:

1. Stock market volatility can lead to unpredictable price movements
2. Geopolitical events can significantly impact defense stocks like Lockheed Martin
3. The forecasts available represent projections rather than certainties
4. Different analysts and forecasting models show varying price targets

## Conclusion

Based on the information available before February 18, 2025, there is conflicting evidence regarding whether Lockheed Martin's stock will continuously remain below its all-time high until March 31, 2025. While most analyst price targets remain below the threshold, at least one forecast model suggests the stock could potentially reach a maximum of $620 in March 2025, which would exceed the all-time high of $618.95[1]. However, this represents a maximum potential price rather than a certainty.

Given that the maximum forecasted price for March 2025 exceeds the threshold, there appears to be a possibility that the stock could breach its all-time high before March 31, 2025, though most analyst targets suggest otherwise.
