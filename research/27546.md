### Key Factual Information Relevant to CDC Mpox Risk Assessment

**1. Most Recent CDC Risk Assessment**
- As of July 8, 2024, the CDC assessed the risk to the US general population from mpox as "VERY LOW." The CDC is currently updating this assessment in response to the spread of clade I mpox in Sub-Saharan Africa, but no new risk level has been published as of August 23, 2024[1].

**2. Current US Mpox Epidemiology**
- The US has reported 33,435 mpox cases and 60 deaths as of August 6, 2024, with 1,700 new cases in 2024, all attributed to clade IIb. The outbreak continues at a low but steady pace, with no evidence of clade I mpox in the US[5].
- There are no known clade I mpox cases in the United States as of August 22, 2024[1].

**3. Global Developments**
- On August 14, 2024, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) due to the upsurge of clade I mpox in Central and Eastern Africa[1][5].
- The CDC issued a Health Alert Network (HAN) notice on August 7, 2024, emphasizing that the risk of clade I mpox spreading to the US is "very low at this time"[2].

**4. US Preparedness and Response**
- The US government has been preparing for clade I mpox since December 2023, with robust diagnostic, surveillance, and vaccination infrastructure in place[1].
- The JYNNEOS vaccine is available and believed to protect against both clade I and IIb mpox[2].

**5. CDC and Government Statements**
- Both the CDC and the White House state that the risk to most Americans from clade I mpox remains very low, and the US is well-prepared to detect and contain any cases should they occur[1][2].

**6. Limitations and Uncertainties**
- The CDC is updating its risk assessment, but as of August 23, 2024, there is no evidence of increased risk to the general public, nor any indication that the risk level will be raised above "Low" in the near term.
- The situation could change if clade I mpox is imported or begins spreading domestically, but there are no such cases as of the latest data.

### Conclusion

Based on all available factual information as of August 23, 2024, there is no evidence to suggest that the CDC's assessment of the risk posed by mpox to the US general public will exceed "Low" before October 1, 2024. The risk remains "very low" to "low," with no domestic clade I cases and robust public health measures in place[1][2][5].
