## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- **BRICS Summit Guest Invitations:** In past years, countries invited as guests to BRICS summits have typically made public confirmations of attendance several weeks to months in advance, especially when heads of state are expected to participate.
- **Uruguay’s Recent Position:** As of June 5, 2025, there has been no public confirmation from Uruguay regarding President Yamandú Orsi’s attendance at the July BRICS summit in Rio. The country is considering joining the BRICS New Development Bank but has explicitly stated it does not plan to join BRICS as a political bloc[1][5].
- **Orsi Administration:** The new Uruguayan government under President Orsi assumed office on March 1, 2025, and is perceived as more open to pragmatic engagement with BRICS, particularly on economic matters[5].

## Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Metric

- **Invitation Extended:** Brazilian President Lula da Silva formally invited Uruguay to participate in the 2025 BRICS summit in March[2][3].
- **Official Statements:** Uruguayan officials have stated that the current proposal "has nothing to do with joining" BRICS, emphasizing Uruguay’s non-membership and lack of plans to join the bloc[1].
- **Parliamentary Action:** Uruguay’s parliament is actively considering joining the BRICS Development Bank, indicating economic engagement but not political alignment or summit attendance[5].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- **Timeframe:** As of June 5, 2025, there is still nearly a month for a potential announcement before the July 1 resolution deadline.
- **Political Ambiguity:** Uruguay’s government has signaled interest in economic cooperation but maintains a policy of non-alignment with BRICS as a bloc, adding uncertainty to the likelihood of a formal announcement[1][5].
- **Lack of Precedent:** There is no recent precedent under Orsi's leadership for engagement with BRICS summits, adding to the forecasting uncertainty.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

- **Compared to reference cases** where guest invitations resulted in public confirmations, Uruguay is showing more caution and less urgency, reducing the likelihood of an imminent confirmation.
- **Key Difference:** The Orsi administration's focus on economic, not political, engagement with BRICS, and the absence of signals suggesting summit attendance, are significant departures from reference cases.
- **Probabilistic Assessment:** Given the lack of an official announcement, Uruguay's stated policy, and the current status as of June 5, 2025, the probability that the government of Uruguay will announce President Orsi's planned attendance at the BRICS summit before July 1, 2025, is **low**—estimated at 15-25%.
