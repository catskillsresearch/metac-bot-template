# 2025 Oscar Best International Feature Film Forecast

Based on available information as of February 2025, the race for the 2025 Oscar for Best International Feature Film appears to be shaping up with several strong contenders. Here's an analysis of the current landscape to help forecast the potential winner.

## Leading Contenders

### Emilia Pérez

"Emilia Pérez" has emerged as one of the frontrunners following strong reception on the festival circuit[2]. The film features an ensemble cast that has garnered significant attention in early awards conversations[2]. While specific details about the film's country of origin aren't explicitly mentioned in available sources, it has positioned itself as a major contender across multiple Oscar categories.

### I'm Still Here

"I'm Still Here" has been described as "a strong contender from a filmmaker who one can argue is quite due" and "one of 2024's best films for certain"[1]. The film was expected to make the shortlist based on early predictions, though its country of origin isn't specified in the available information.

## Historical Context and Trends

The International Feature Film category (formerly Foreign Language Film) has historically favored certain countries with strong film industries and Oscar campaign resources. As noted in analysis of previous years, "films where backers have the most money to spend on publicity are always the likely nominees"[1].

In the previous Oscar cycle, five countries dominated the nominations:
- Italy ("Io capitano")
- Germany ("The Teacher's Lounge")
- Spain ("Society of the Snow")
- Japan ("Perfect Days")
- UK ("The Zone of Interest" - the winner)[1]

Four of these five countries received nominations again in the subsequent year, demonstrating consistency in which nations tend to be recognized[1].

## Other Potential Contenders

Several other international films have been submitted and may challenge the frontrunners:

- **Armand** (Norway): Norway has garnered 6 nominations historically with no wins, with their last nomination being in 2021 for "The Worst Person in the World." "Armand" was scheduled for release by IFC Films in February 2025[1].

- **Waves** (Czechia): Directed by Jiří Mádl, this film is described as "ambitious, emotionally gripping and sweeping"[1].

France, Italy, and Germany were specifically mentioned as countries "favored to make the short list for certain"[1], though the specific films submitted by Italy and Germany weren't identified in the available information.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

The available information has several limitations:

1. The complete list of all 85 submitted films for International Feature consideration isn't fully detailed in the sources.

2. The shortlist status of these films isn't confirmed in the available information as of February 2025.

3. While "Emilia Pérez" and "I'm Still Here" are mentioned as strong contenders, their specific strengths relative to each other in the International Feature category specifically (as opposed to general Oscar buzz) isn't clearly established.

4. Historical patterns suggest that countries with stronger promotional resources tend to dominate nominations, which could influence the final outcome beyond film quality alone.

Based on the limited information available, both "Emilia Pérez" and "I'm Still Here" appear to be strong contenders, with "Emilia Pérez" potentially having an edge due to its prominent mention in awards predictions across multiple categories. However, the race remains open with several months to go before the ceremony.
