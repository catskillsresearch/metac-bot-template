## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- In March 2019, Emma Haruka Iwao set a world record by calculating π to 31,415,926,535,897 digits using Google Cloud[1][3].
- The computation of ever-more digits of π follows a long-term exponential growth trend, facilitated by advances in hardware, cloud computing, and algorithm optimization.
- By 2023, Emma Haruka Iwao, working with Sara Ford and others, set a new world record by computing π to 100 trillion digits[2].
- As of May 25, 2025, there are no credible media reports of anyone surpassing the 100 trillion digit record.

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- The 100 trillion digit computation was widely publicized and verified by both first-hand accounts (interviews, podcasts) and reputable technology outlets[2].
- No significant new policies or computational breakthroughs have been reported since that milestone that would substantially alter the pace of future record-breaking attempts by the end of 2025.

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Google Cloud and its official blog posts
- Major tech news outlets (e.g., The Verge, Google Cloud Blog)
- Direct statements by record holders in interviews and podcasts[2]

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- The record depends on public disclosure and verification; unreported or unpublished computations may exist but are not counted per the resolution criteria.
- Computational resource limitations, cost, and technical challenges may slow the pace of future records.
- The measurement is precise, but only officially announced and verifiable results are recognized.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the rate of progress and the absence of new records since the 100 trillion digit computation, it is highly probable that the largest number of digits of π computed by December 31, 2025, will be:

**100,000,000,000,000 digits (100 trillion)**

unless a new, publicly verified record emerges before the end of 2025.
