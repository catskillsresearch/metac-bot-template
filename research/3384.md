## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of March 2019, the record for the most digits of π computed stood at 31,415,926,535,897 (about 31.4 trillion), achieved by Emma Haruka Iwao at Google using cloud computing resources. This calculation used 25 virtual machines over 121 days and was a significant improvement over the previous record of 22.4 trillion digits set in 2016[1][3].
- By June 2022, the record was dramatically extended to 100 trillion digits, again by Emma Haruka Iwao and Google Cloud. This was verified using independent algorithms (such as the Bailey–Borwein–Plouffe formula), and the result was publicized as a new world record[2].

## Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Metric

- No announcements in the provided context indicate a new record beyond the 100 trillion digits calculated in 2022.
- The use of cloud computing platforms like Google Cloud has enabled these large-scale computations, allowing for parallel processing and massive storage requirements that were previously impractical on standalone machines[2][3].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Google's official cloud blog and various reputable technology news outlets have reported and verified the 100 trillion digit computation[2].
- Guinness World Records and other mathematical record-keeping organizations typically document and verify such achievements, but the computation itself is independently verifiable via published data and validation formulas.

## Limitations or Uncertainties

- The only limitation is the possibility of a new, unpublicized record between June 2022 and December 31, 2025. However, such achievements typically receive prompt and broad attention due to their technical significance.
- Verification of extremely large computations remains a challenge, but independent cross-checks using different algorithms are standard practice[2].
- Technological advances could, in theory, enable new records, but as of the latest credible reports, 100 trillion digits remains the maximum[2].

## Probabilistic Assessment

Given historical record-setting frequency, the high computational and verification barriers, and the absence of new public announcements, it is highly probable (estimated >95%) that the largest number of digits of π computed by December 31, 2025, will remain at 100 trillion digits.
