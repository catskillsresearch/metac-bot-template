## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The U.S. International Investment Position (IIP) has been negative for many years, indicating that U.S. liabilities to foreign residents exceed U.S. assets abroad.
- In recent quarters, the net IIP has continued to deteriorate, driven by persistent current account deficits and rising external debt.
- As of Q4 2024, the U.S. current account deficit stood at $303.9 billion, and external debt reached $27.63 trillion, both reflecting increased U.S. liabilities[5].
- Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in the United States increased by $76.2 billion in Q4 2024, up from $73.9 billion in the previous quarter, suggesting continued strong foreign interest in U.S. assets[5].

## Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Metric

- Robust demand for U.S. investment-grade credit and strong secondary market activity have continued through late 2024, with elevated issuance absorbed by both domestic and foreign investors[1].
- The U.S. economy has maintained stable growth, supporting continued cross-border investment flows[2][3].
- No major policy shifts directly affecting the IIP were reported for Q4 2024, but ongoing monetary policy and global investment trends have contributed to the observed patterns[1][2].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) is the primary source for official IIP statistics, including quarterly releases and methodological notes.
- Trading Economics provides timely updates on FDI, current account, and external debt figures, sourced from the BEA[5].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- The IIP is subject to significant quarterly fluctuations due to exchange-rate movements, asset price changes, and other valuation effects.
- The initial release of Q4 2024 IIP data by the BEA may be revised in subsequent updates, but only the initial release is relevant for this forecast.
- While FDI and external debt figures provide directional guidance, the precise IIP value depends on the net effect of all cross-border assets and liabilities, including portfolio investment and other financial flows.

## Summary Forecast

Based on the available data and trends as of February 26, 2025, the U.S. International Investment Position for Q4 2024 is expected to remain deeply negative, likely within the range of -$18 trillion to -$19 trillion, reflecting continued large net liabilities to the rest of the world. The exact figure will be published by the BEA in its initial release.
