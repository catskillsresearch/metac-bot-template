## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of early 2025, nine countries possess nuclear weapons, with a combined inventory of approximately 12,331 warheads; the United States and Russia account for about 88% of these[1].
- Since 1945, only two nuclear weapons have been detonated offensively (Hiroshima and Nagasaki). All subsequent detonations have been for testing or demonstration purposes, not wartime use[1].
- The Cold War saw numerous crises (e.g., Cuban Missile Crisis) where nuclear use was considered but ultimately avoided.
- Global inventory is gradually declining due to the dismantlement of retired warheads, but the number of operationally available warheads is slowly rising in several states, including China, India, Pakistan, North Korea, and the UK[1].
- No new states have joined the nuclear club since North Korea, but some existing states are modernizing or modestly expanding their arsenals[1].

## 2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- The United States and Russia continue slow reductions in total arsenals but maintain substantial operational forces and have modernized delivery systems[1][3].
- Several countries (China, India, North Korea, Pakistan, UK) are increasing their operational nuclear stockpiles[1].
- Arms control agreements have eroded in recent years, with the demise or weakening of key treaties (e.g., INF Treaty), though New START has been extended.
- Defense budgets for nuclear forces are rising, indicating continued prioritization and possible future expansion or modernization[2][5].
- No official policy shift toward nuclear disarmament among the nine nuclear states; most maintain doctrines allowing for potential first use in certain scenarios[1][3].

- Federation of American Scientists: Status of World Nuclear Forces[1]
- Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists: Nuclear Notebook[3]
- Congressional Budget Office: U.S. Nuclear Forces Cost Projections[2]
- Arms Control Association: U.S. Nuclear Costs[5]
- Metaculus: Probabilistic community forecast on nuclear weapon use[4]

## 4. Limitations or Uncertainties

- Forecasting actual wartime use is highly uncertain, given the lack of historical precedent since 1945.
- Most reference cases (e.g., Cold War crises) resulted in no use; the only offensive uses were limited to two detonations.
- Escalation dynamics are poorly understood; a single use could trigger a larger exchange, but the most likely scenario is a small number of detonations if any[4].
- Non-state actors, cyber risks, or command/control failures could alter probabilities, but data is limited.
- Measurement is limited to officially confirmed offensive detonations, not tests or peaceful explosions as defined in the resolution criteria.

## 5. Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

- Conditional on at least one offensive detonation by 2050, the most likely number is **1** or **2**, with a rapidly declining probability for higher numbers.
- The distribution is heavily skewed: median and mode at **1**, 75th percentile perhaps at **2-5**, but with a long, thin tail extending to higher values in the event of uncontrolled escalation.
- A full-scale exchange involving major powers could result in dozens to hundreds of detonations, but this outcome has much lower probability compared to limited use.
- Therefore, under these conditions, the most reasonable forecast for the **number of nuclear weapons detonated offensively by 2050, if at least one occurs, is 1â€“5, with a strong central tendency at the lower end**[1][3][4].
