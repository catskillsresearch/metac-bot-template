Based on the available information as of May 27, 2025, I can provide the following forecast assessment regarding Pat Herrity's chances in the Virginia Republican lieutenant governor primary:

## Current Status

Pat Herrity has officially withdrawn from the race for the Republican nomination for lieutenant governor of Virginia. On April 21, 2025, Herrity announced he was dropping out of the race due to health reasons[1][2]. Herrity, who serves as a Fairfax County Supervisor, had undergone heart surgery on March 13 and experienced "some pretty significant complications" following the procedure[1].

In his withdrawal announcement, Herrity stated: "my doctors are still predicting a full recovery but I have come to realize it will be much slower than anticipated"[1]. He further explained that he would not be able to give the campaign the "150%" effort required for a statewide race[2].

## Primary Election Status

With Herrity's withdrawal, the Republican Party of Virginia announced that John Reid has become the Republican nominee for lieutenant governor[5]. As a direct result of Herrity's exit from the race, there will be **no Republican primary election** for lieutenant governor in Virginia[5].

The Virginia Department of Elections confirms that primaries only take place if two or more candidates qualify to be on the primary ballot[3]. Since John Reid is now the only Republican candidate for lieutenant governor, no primary will be held for this position.

## Forecast Assessment

**Probability: 0%**

Pat Herrity cannot win the Republican primary for lieutenant governor of Virginia because:

1. He has officially withdrawn from the race as of April 21, 2025
2. No Republican primary for lieutenant governor will be held in June 2025 as John Reid is now the sole nominee

## Key Factors Affecting the Forecast

1. **Candidate Withdrawal**: Herrity's official withdrawal from the race due to health complications makes it impossible for him to win the nomination[1][2].

2. **Primary Cancellation**: Virginia election rules stipulate that primaries only occur with multiple qualified candidates[3]. With Herrity's exit, John Reid became the sole Republican candidate, eliminating the need for a primary[5].

3. **Republican Ticket Finalization**: The Republican statewide ticket for 2025 is now set with Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears for governor, John Reid for lieutenant governor, and Attorney General Jason Miyares seeking reelection[1][5].

## Measurement Limitations

The only uncertainty would be if Herrity somehow reentered the race and forced a primary before June 17, 2025. However, there is no indication in any of the sources that this is a possibility, especially given his stated health concerns and the Republican Party's announcement that Reid is now the nominee.

In contrast to the Republican situation, the Democratic lieutenant governor race still has six candidates and will proceed with a primary on June 17, 2025[5].
