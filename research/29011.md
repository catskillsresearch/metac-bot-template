# Forecasting US Airline Passenger Volume for Veterans Day Weekend 2024

Based on available data as of October 2024, there are several indicators that can help forecast whether US airline passenger volume for Veterans Day weekend 2024 will exceed the 2023 figures.

## Historical Trends and Current Status

The air travel industry has shown strong growth throughout 2024, continuing the recovery trend from the pandemic. Several key indicators suggest continued passenger volume growth:

- The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) prepared for the busiest summer travel season ever in 2024, with checkpoint volume expected to increase approximately 6.4% for the period from May 23 to May 29, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023[1].

- Airlines for America (A4A) predicted a record-setting summer travel season for US airlines in 2024, with carriers expected to transport 271 million passengers, representing more than a 6% increase from summer 2023[4].

- United Airlines forecasted its busiest Memorial Day weekend on record for 2024, with more than 3 million travelers expected between May 23-28, up 5% from the comparable period in 2023[2].

- TSA Administrator David Pekoske indicated expectations that some days in summer 2024 would be "particularly busy, exceeding 3.1 million passengers per day," which would surpass the agency's previous busiest day ever recorded on the Sunday after Thanksgiving in 2023[2].

## Factors Affecting Veterans Day Weekend 2024

Several factors suggest Veterans Day weekend 2024 could see higher passenger volumes than 2023:

1. **Calendar Advantage**: Veterans Day falls on a Monday in 2024 (creating a three-day weekend), whereas it fell on a Saturday in 2023. This calendar configuration typically encourages more leisure travel as travelers can take advantage of the long weekend without using additional vacation days.

2. **Continued Growth Trend**: The consistent growth patterns seen throughout 2024 (5-6.4% increases) suggest this upward trajectory could continue into the fall travel season[1][2][4].

3. **Budget Planning**: The TSA's budget for 2025 funds passenger volume to meet an average of 3.1 million daily enplanements, indicating the agency anticipates continued high travel demand[3].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

While the general trend points toward increased travel volume, several factors create uncertainty in this forecast:

1. The search results don't provide specific forecasts for Veterans Day weekend 2024.

2. Holiday travel patterns can be influenced by factors not captured in the available data, such as economic conditions, fuel prices, and consumer sentiment closer to the holiday.

3. Weather events, which are unpredictable this far in advance, can significantly impact travel volumes during specific holiday periods.

## Conclusion

Based on the available information, there are strong indicators suggesting US airline passenger volume for Veterans Day weekend 2024 could exceed 2023 levels:

- The consistent 5-6.4% year-over-year growth observed in 2024 travel data
- The more favorable calendar configuration in 2024 (Monday holiday vs. Saturday in 2023)
- TSA and airline industry projections indicating continued strong travel demand

If the growth trends observed earlier in 2024 continue, and considering the more favorable calendar configuration, it appears likely that the Veterans Day weekend 2024 passenger volume would exceed the 2023 total of 11,870,141 passengers. However, this forecast comes with significant uncertainty due to the lack of specific Veterans Day projections and potential external factors that could influence travel patterns.
