1. **Key Historical Trends and Current Status**
   - Sweden has experienced deadly terrorist attacks in the past, most recently the 2017 Stockholm truck attack.
   - From about 2010 to 2023, Sweden maintained a "heightened" (level 3) terrorist threat level, with no major fatal attacks during this period.
   - In August 2023, the Swedish Security Service raised the threat level to "high" (level 4) due to increased risk from violent Islamist and right-wing actors, and specifically noted Sweden had become a "prioritised" target following events like Koran burnings[1][2][5].
   - As of May 2025, the threat level was reduced to "elevated" (level 3), reflecting a somewhat improved assessment but still above "limited" risk[3].

2. **Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric**
   - The August 2023 escalation to threat level 4 was the first since 2016 and was triggered by both domestic and international developments, including religious provocations that generated global condemnation and new propaganda targeting Sweden[2][5].
   - Swedish authorities responded with increased security measures and public awareness campaigns, signaling that counterterrorism capacity and readiness have been enhanced after more than a decade of elevated threat[2][5].
   - The May 2025 reduction in threat level suggests a partial normalization, but authorities continue to warn that the risk of terrorist attacks remains credible[3].

3. **Authoritative Sources for Verification**
   - The Swedish Security Service (Säkerhetspolisen) and the National Centre for Terrorist Threat Assessment (NCT) are the official authorities for threat level announcements and criteria[2][3].
   - International and government sources (e.g., U.S. State Department, Krisinformation.se) provide independent verification and contextual information[1][2][4].

4. **Limitations or Uncertainties in Measurement**
   - Terrorist threat levels are inherently probabilistic and based on classified intelligence, making precise quantitative assessment difficult.
   - The categorization of violent incidents as "terrorism" depends on legal and governmental designations, which may change as investigations proceed.
   - The risk is not evenly distributed over the forecast window; initial years (2023–2025) saw higher threat, but this may decline, remain steady, or spike again due to unpredictable geopolitical or domestic events.
   - Increased security measures may reduce risk, but the "prioritised" status and continued international propaganda may sustain or elevate the threat over the next several years.

**Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment:**  
Given the raised threat level in 2023–2025, Sweden's new status as a prioritised target, active propaganda, and historical precedent, the probability of a terrorist attack causing at least one civilian or innocent death in Sweden before January 2031 is elevated compared to the previous decade. However, the country's strong counterterrorism apparatus and recent reduction in threat level suggest that while the risk is significant, it remains meaningfully less than 50%—but higher than the baseline in comparable Western European countries with a history of such attacks. An expert-calibrated range would plausibly place the probability in the 20–35% interval, with the risk highest in the years immediately following the threat level escalation and tapering if no attack occurs and threat levels remain at or below "elevated."[1][2][3][5]
