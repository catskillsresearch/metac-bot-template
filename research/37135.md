# Forecasting Analysis: Cube-shaped UFO Sightings in June 2025

The National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC) maintains the largest independently collected database of UFO/UAP sighting reports available online, with reports categorized by various characteristics including shape[2]. To forecast whether NUFORC will report a cube-shaped UFO in June 2025, I'll analyze the available data and relevant factors.

## Current Status and Historical Context

NUFORC actively collects and categorizes UFO sighting reports in 2025, as evidenced by their compilation of "2025's Best UFO Reports so Far"[3]. The organization maintains a comprehensive classification system, categorizing reports into four tiers based on their characteristics and credibility:

- **Tier 1**: Most dramatic sightings - strange structured craft or highly anomalous phenomena seen at close distance
- **Tier 2**: Objects exhibiting unusual characteristics (incredible speed, non-inertial turns, unexplainable propulsion)
- **Tier 3**: Other reports that cannot be easily explained
- **Tier 4**: Reports potentially explainable by human or natural phenomena[2]

According to the query information, cube-shaped UFO reports do occur but appear relatively rare, with six such sightings reported in December 2024. This establishes that cube-shaped objects are within the taxonomy of shapes reported to and documented by NUFORC.

## Recent Reporting Patterns

The most recent documented sighting in the search results is from February 20, 2025 (reported on February 24, 2025), describing an orb-shaped object with color-changing properties observed by multiple witnesses including a military pilot[5]. Between January and early May 2025, "thousands of UFO sightings have been reported globally" with reports describing "a diverse array of objects"[3].

The search results also mention that a "drone wave" from late 2024 has abated[3], suggesting potential shifts in the types of aerial phenomena being reported in 2025.

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on the available information, I assess the likelihood of NUFORC reporting at least one cube-shaped UFO in June 2025 as **moderately high (approximately 65-75%)** for the following reasons:

1. **Established precedent**: The occurrence of six cube-shaped sightings in December 2024 demonstrates that such reports do occur and are recognized within NUFORC's classification system.

2. **High overall reporting volume**: The mention of "thousands" of reports in early 2025 indicates a substantial ongoing flow of sightings being submitted to NUFORC[3].

3. **Diverse object morphology**: The 2025 reports explicitly mention "a diverse array of objects"[3], suggesting variety in the shapes being reported.

4. **Reporting lag consideration**: NUFORC notes that "it is common for witnesses to report sightings well after they occur"[3], meaning that even if a cube-shaped sighting occurs in early June, it might be reported and documented later in the month.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors limit the precision of this forecast:

1. **Lack of comprehensive shape distribution data**: The search results don't provide statistics on the relative frequency of different UFO shapes across time periods.

2. **Unknown seasonality effects**: Without historical monthly data, it's unclear if there are seasonal patterns in cube-shaped sightings.

3. **Reporting and processing delays**: As NUFORC acknowledges, there can be delays between sightings and reports, and further delays in processing and publishing reports to their database.

4. **Potential classification changes**: How NUFORC categorizes shapes could evolve, potentially affecting what qualifies as "cube-shaped."

## Conclusion

Given the established precedent of cube-shaped UFO reports, the high volume and diversity of current reporting, and the specific example of six cube-shaped sightings in a single month (December 2024), it appears reasonably likely that at least one cube-shaped UFO will be reported to NUFORC in June 2025. However, this forecast is made with moderate confidence due to the limitations in available historical data and potential seasonal variations.
