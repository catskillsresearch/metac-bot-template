### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Second Thomas Shoal (Ren'ai Jiao/Ayungin Shoal) is a flashpoint in the South China Sea, with China asserting "indisputable sovereignty" and the Philippines maintaining a military presence via the beached Sierra Madre vessel[3].
- Over the past decade, China has escalated pressure through maritime and paramilitary means, harassing Philippine supply missions but stopping short of deploying military personnel to seize the shoal[3].
- China’s official policy has consistently emphasized maintaining the status quo, shelving disputes, and resolving issues diplomatically. In 2025, China reiterated it has "no intention of occupying Second Thomas Shoal," seeking instead to restore the feature to its "natural state"[1][5].

### Recent Announcements and Policies

- In 2024, diplomatic channels between China and the Philippines led to a reduction in tensions at Second Thomas Shoal and nearby features[1][4][5].
- The US has increased its support for the Philippines, including the establishment of "Task Force Ayungin" to monitor the situation, but has not directly intervened militarily[2].
- Both China and the Philippines have shown willingness to manage the dispute through preventive diplomacy and crisis management, building on a July 2024 understanding[4].
- Despite ongoing provocations and confrontations, the Philippines is constrained by its limited operational capacity, reducing the likelihood of major escalations absent direct US intervention[5].

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- As of February 13, 2025, there are no reports or official accusations from the US or Philippine governments that China has deployed military personnel at Second Thomas Shoal without Philippine consent[1][2][3][4][5].
- Multiple expert analyses and policy statements confirm that China’s approach remains focused on coercion and gray zone tactics rather than outright military occupation[1][3][5].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- The situation remains volatile, and China’s use of paramilitary and maritime law enforcement vessels blurs the line between civilian and military presence, complicating clear attribution of "military personnel" deployment[3].
- Sudden escalations or miscalculations could alter the status quo, but as of the knowledge cutoff, no such event has occurred.
- The resolution depends on official accusations by the US or Philippine governments, which have not been made as of February 13, 2025.

---

**Conclusion:**  
Based on all available factual information as of February 13, 2025, there is no evidence that China has seized control of Second Thomas Shoal by deploying military personnel without Philippine consent, nor have the US or Philippine governments made such an accusation. The situation remains tense but managed through diplomatic and gray zone means.
