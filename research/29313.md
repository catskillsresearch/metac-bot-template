## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Michigan and Wisconsin have been pivotal swing states in recent presidential elections. In 2020, both states were won by Joe Biden, but by narrow marginsâ€”Wisconsin by just 0.6 percentage points, making it the "tipping-point state" that delivered Biden his 270th electoral vote[5].
- Historically, these states often vote for the same candidate, but not always. In 2016, both flipped from Democratic to Republican, and in 2020, both returned to the Democratic column[5].
- As of October 2024, polling shows extremely tight races in both states. A Quinnipiac poll from October 23, 2024, finds Kamala Harris leading Trump 49% to 46% in Michigan and tied 48% to 48% in Wisconsin, with very small shares for other candidates[1].
- Another Quinnipiac poll from October 9, 2024, showed Trump leading Harris 50% to 47% in Michigan and 48% to 46% in Wisconsin, again with very small third-party shares[2].
- FiveThirtyEight's polling average as of mid-October 2024 had Harris leading Trump by just 0.6 points in Wisconsin, nearly identical to the 2020 margin[5].

## Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- No major policy announcements or campaign events in the final weeks before the cutoff have dramatically shifted the polling landscape in either state. The races remain defined by a pronounced gender gap, with women favoring Harris and men favoring Trump in both states[1].
- Economic concerns and negative views of the state economies are prominent issues among voters in both Michigan and Wisconsin, contributing to the tightness of the race[4].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Quinnipiac University polling releases provide detailed, recent polling data for both states[1][2].
- FiveThirtyEight offers polling averages and expert analysis of state-level trends[3][5].
- CBS News and ABC News/538 provide context on economic issues and historical voting patterns[4][5].

## Limitations or Uncertainties in Measurement

- Polling in both Michigan and Wisconsin is within the margin of error, meaning either candidate could plausibly win either state[1][2][5].
- Both states have a history of close elections and late swings, with outcomes potentially hinging on turnout and undecided voters.
- The presence of third-party and independent candidates, while polling at low levels, could affect the margins in either state[2].
- Polling averages and models are subject to sampling error, nonresponse bias, and last-minute shifts in voter sentiment.

## Summary

As of October 29, 2024, the best available evidence indicates that Michigan and Wisconsin are extremely likely to be won by the same presidential candidate, given their historical voting patterns and the current polling, which shows both states as toss-ups with nearly identical margins. However, the races are so close that a split result remains possible, and the outcome will depend on turnout and late-deciding voters. The high correlation between the two states' results in recent cycles supports a "Yes" forecast, but with significant uncertainty due to the tightness of the races and the limitations of polling data.
