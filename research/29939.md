### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- President Joe Biden issued 24 executive orders in 2023 and 29 in 2022, averaging about 2–3 per month, though the monthly count varies[2][4].
- There is no clear pattern of increased executive order activity in November in previous years.
- As of late October 2024, the most recent relevant White House action was a notice regarding the continuation of a national emergency with respect to Sudan, but this is not a new executive order[5].

### Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- No major policy announcements or events as of early November 2024 indicate an expected surge in executive orders for that month.
- The Sudan national emergency notice is a continuation, not a new executive order, and thus does not count toward the November 2024 total[5].

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The only source that will be used for resolution is the Federal Register’s official listing of executive orders for President Joe Biden in November 2024.

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- Executive order issuance is inherently unpredictable and can be influenced by emergent events.
- There may be delays between signing and publication in the Federal Register.
- No forward-looking data is available; only historical trends and current status can inform the forecast.

### Summary Table: Biden Executive Orders by Year

| Year | Total Executive Orders | Average per Month |
|------|-----------------------|------------------|
| 2022 | 29                    | ~2.4             |
| 2023 | 24                    | ~2.0             |

Given historical averages, it is plausible but not certain that three or more executive orders could be listed for November 2024. There is no specific evidence as of November 12, 2024, indicating a higher-than-average issuance for that month.
