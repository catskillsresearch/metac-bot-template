Based on information available as of March 20, 2025, here's what we know about the potential Fort Knox visit:

## Current Status and Statements

Donald Trump has explicitly stated intentions to visit Fort Knox to verify the presence of gold reserves. During public remarks in early March 2025, Trump said: "We're actually going to Fort Knox to see if the gold is there, because maybe somebody stole the gold. Tons of gold."[2] This statement indicates a clear intention to make such a visit, though no specific date was announced.

Elon Musk has also expressed interest in visiting Fort Knox. During an appearance on Joe Rogan's podcast released in early March 2025, Musk stated: "A live tour of Fort Knox would be awesome... is the gold there or not? They say it is -- is it real? Or did somebody spray paint some lead?"[2] Musk's comments align with Trump's expressed intentions.

As of February 24, 2025, Trump had not yet announced when he planned to visit Fort Knox or whether he would send Musk to investigate on his behalf.[3]

## Context and Background

The United States Bullion Depository at Fort Knox reportedly holds approximately 147.3 million ounces of gold, according to the U.S. Mint.[2] This gold is currently valued at $42.22 per troy ounce in national accounts, which is significantly below market value.[1]

Some analysts suggest that Trump's interest in Fort Knox may be related to potential plans to revalue America's gold stocks. One theory is that Trump wants to show Americans the gold reserves to justify an accounting maneuver that would use gold to create "cash" for the Treasury.[1]

## Previous Relevant Visits

Steven Mnuchin, who served as Treasury Secretary during Trump's first term, personally visited the gold reserves at Fort Knox and confirmed their presence.[2] This provides precedent for high-level government officials visiting the facility.

## Verification Mechanisms

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has stated that there is an audit of the gold reserves conducted every year and that "all the gold is present and accounted for."[2] This suggests that official verification processes are already in place.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- No specific date for a visit has been announced as of March 20, 2025
- The search results do not mention any plans for JD Vance to visit Fort Knox
- Security protocols at Fort Knox might affect the feasibility and timing of such a visit
- It remains unclear whether the visit would be a private inspection or a public event, though Trump's comments suggest it might be intended as a public demonstration

The expressed intentions from both Trump and Musk indicate a reasonable possibility of a visit occurring, but without a confirmed schedule, it's difficult to determine if it will happen before April 1, 2025.
