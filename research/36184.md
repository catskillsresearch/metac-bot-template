# Will Musk, Trump, or Vance Visit Fort Knox Before April 1, 2025?

Based on information available before March 20, 2025, there are strong indications that both Elon Musk and Donald Trump have expressed intentions to visit Fort Knox, though no confirmed visit has yet occurred.

## Current Status and Recent Announcements

As of mid-March 2025, both Elon Musk and Donald Trump have publicly stated plans to inspect the gold reserves at Fort Knox:

- In February 2025, Elon Musk hinted at plans to investigate gold reserves at Fort Knox, suggesting he could direct DOGE (Department of Government Efficiency) to conduct this audit[1].

- During the 2025 CPAC Summit in February, Musk elaborated on these plans, specifically discussing "the planned trip by DOGE to assess the gold stored at Fort Knox"[2].

- Musk has announced intentions to "conduct an in-person audit of Fort Knox's gold reserves on behalf of his cost-cutting operation, the Department of Government Efficiency"[3].

- President Donald Trump has explicitly stated, "We're going to open up the doors. We're going to inspect Fort Knox," expressing concern about potentially finding that "the cupboards are bare"[5].

- Trump has indicated that Elon Musk will be examining Fort Knox "to ensure the gold is still there"[5].

There is no public information available before March 20, 2025, regarding any plans for JD Vance to visit Fort Knox.

## Context and Historical Significance

The United States Bullion Depository at Fort Knox has stored American precious metal reserves since 1937 and is renowned for its security measures[5]. The U.S. holds approximately 8,133 metric tons of gold, the largest reserve of any country in the world[3].

The value of this gold has been officially maintained at $42 per ounce since 1973, despite market prices reaching record highs of $2,940 per ounce in early 2025[3]. This discrepancy between the official valuation and market value appears to be one factor driving interest in auditing the reserves.

## Official Responses

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has responded to these plans by asserting that:
- An annual audit of the gold reserves already takes place
- "All the gold is present and accounted for"[5][4]

This suggests some tension between the administration's plans and the Treasury Department's position on the necessity of an additional inspection.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors create uncertainty in forecasting whether a visit will occur before April 1, 2025:

1. While intentions have been clearly stated, no specific date for a visit has been announced in any of the available sources.

2. The logistics of arranging a visit to one of America's most secure facilities may require significant planning and security coordination.

3. There appears to be some resistance from the Treasury Department, which maintains that regular audits already confirm the gold's presence.

4. The short timeframe (from mid-March to April 1) provides limited opportunity for scheduling such a high-profile visit.

Based on the available information, while both Trump and Musk have expressed clear intentions to visit Fort Knox, there is no confirmation that a visit has been scheduled or will definitely occur before April 1, 2025.
