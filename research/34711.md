## Key Historical Trends and Current Status
Historically, the U.S. has been vocal about Russian military actions, especially regarding Ukraine. In January 2022, the U.S. accused Russia of fabricating a pretext to invade Ukraine, highlighting a pattern of U.S. skepticism towards Russian military intentions[1][4]. However, as of early 2025, there is no public record of the U.S. accusing Russia of invading another country.

## Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric
Recent announcements have focused on the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and tensions involving NATO. The U.S. has maintained a strong stance against Russian aggression in Ukraine but has not publicly accused Russia of invading another country[2][3].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification
For verification, one would need to monitor official statements from the U.S. Department of State, the White House, and the Department of Defense. These sources would provide any updates on U.S. accusations against Russia regarding military actions in other countries.

## Limitations or Uncertainties in Measurement
A limitation in measurement is the reliance on public statements from U.S. officials. Private diplomatic communications or unreported incidents could influence the situation without being publicly acknowledged.

## Conclusion
As of early 2025, there is no evidence that the U.S. has accused Russia of invading any country other than Ukraine. However, geopolitical tensions remain high, and any future accusations would likely be reported through official U.S. government channels.
