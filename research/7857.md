## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The US population increased by 7.4% from 2010 to 2020, the slowest growth since the 1930s[3][4].
- Growth is decelerating: projections estimate a 5.5% increase from 2020–2030 and continued slowing thereafter[3][4].
- The US fertility rate is at a historical low, below the replacement level, but still higher than in countries like Japan, Italy, and South Korea[3][4].
- Since 2030, projections expect net international migration to become the primary source of growth, as annual deaths begin to exceed births[2][4].

## 2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- No major policy shifts as of February 2022 had been announced that would radically alter immigration or fertility trends. However, ongoing debates about immigration reform could impact future inflows[2][5].
- The COVID-19 pandemic temporarily depressed both immigration and birth rates, but projections assume a return to pre-pandemic trends[2][4].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- US Census Bureau population projections and decennial census results[1][4].
- Congressional Budget Office demographic outlooks[2].
- State-level and independent academic projections, such as those from the Cooper Center[3], and the Penn Wharton Budget Model[5].

## 4. Limitations or Uncertainties in Measurement

- Projections assume current immigration policies and rates; significant policy changes could alter outcomes[2][5].
- Fertility rates could continue to fall, or unexpected events could disrupt migration or birth/death rates[2][4][5].
- Census undercounts or data quality issues could affect interpretation, but the decennial census is the official benchmark.

## Probabilistic Assessment

- **Most likely scenario:** US population continues to grow slowly through 2060–2070, with growth driven almost entirely by net immigration[2][3][4][5].
- **Key risks for decline:** Major sustained reduction in immigration, further fertility drops, or large-scale emigration.
- **Adjusted probability:** As of early 2022, authoritative projections assign a low probability (significantly less than 50%) to a US Census before 2071 showing a population decline. The base case remains continued, if minimal, growth.
