# Forecasting the 2025 Belizean General Election

The upcoming Belizean general election scheduled for March 12, 2025, presents a unique political landscape with several factors that could influence which party will secure a majority in the House of Representatives.

## Current Political Landscape

As of March 2025, Belize is preparing for a general election where more than 204,378 registered voters (as of January 2025) will determine the next government[2]. The election will feature 90 political candidates representing 6 political parties and 4 independents[2]. Prime Minister John Briceño, leader of the People's United Party (PUP), announced the election date on February 11, 2025, calling the election 244 days before the end of his five-year term[2].

## Historical Context and Current Status

In the November 2020 general election, the PUP secured a decisive victory:
- PUP won 26 seats out of 32 (59.6% of the vote)[5]
- UDP won only 5 seats (38.8% of the vote)[5]
- Voter turnout was approximately 82%[5]

This represented a significant shift in power, with the PUP defeating the UDP led by Patrick Faber at that time[2].

## Key Factors Affecting the 2025 Election

### 1. UDP Internal Division

The most significant factor potentially influencing the 2025 election outcome is the unprecedented split within the opposition United Democratic Party:

- The Election and Boundaries Department has recognized 41 UDP candidates across 31 constituencies[2]
- Current UDP leader Moses "Shyne" Barrow unveiled a slate of 26 candidates on February 22, 2025[3][4]
- Tracy Panton, representing another UDP faction, unveiled a separate slate of 15 candidates[3]

This internal rift means that for the first time in Belize's history, voters in several constituencies will have the option to choose between two or even three candidates under the UDP banner[2]. This division could significantly split the opposition vote.

### 2. Party Representation

The election features candidates from multiple parties:
- People's United Party (PUP) - led by John Briceño
- United Democratic Party (UDP) - led by Moses "Shyne" Barrow
- Belize Justice Movement - led by Rudy Wade
- Good Opportunity Development Party (GOD) - led by Francisco Escobar
- People's National Party - led by Wil Maheia
- Independent candidates[5]

## Uncertainties and Limitations

Several factors create uncertainty in forecasting the election outcome:

1. **Impact of UDP Split**: The unprecedented division within the UDP creates significant uncertainty about how opposition votes will be distributed.

2. **Voter Turnout**: Historical turnout has been high (81.86% in 2020)[2], but changes in voter participation could affect results.

3. **Limited Recent Polling Data**: The search results don't provide recent polling data that would help gauge current voter sentiment.

4. **Constituency-Level Dynamics**: The presence of multiple UDP candidates in some constituencies creates unique local dynamics that are difficult to predict at the national level.

## Conclusion

Based on the available information as of March 10, 2025, the election presents a complex scenario. The PUP enters the race with the advantage of incumbency and having won a decisive victory in 2020. Meanwhile, the UDP faces significant challenges due to its internal division, with competing candidates potentially splitting the opposition vote in multiple constituencies.

This internal rift within the UDP represents a historical anomaly in Belizean politics and could significantly benefit the PUP by fragmenting opposition support. However, without recent polling data, it's difficult to quantify exactly how this will translate to seat distribution in the House of Representatives.
