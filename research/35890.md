## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- In the 2021 Greenlandic general election, Inuit Ataqatigiit (IA) won the largest share of seats (12 out of 31), followed by Siumut (10 seats), with the rest divided among smaller parties[1][2].
- The current Prime Minister, MÃºte Egede, is from Inuit Ataqatigiit, which leads the governing coalition[5].
- The majority of the current parliament is controlled by pro-independence parties, with IA as the largest single party[3].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- The 2025 election is set for March 11, with all 31 seats in the Inatsisartut (parliament) up for election[1][3].
- A new pro-independence party, Quelleq, has gained ballot access, but there is no indication it will surpass IA or Siumut in seat count[3].
- The Simiut party (likely a reference to Siumut) has promised a vote on independence after the election, potentially influencing voter behavior[5].
- Prime Minister Egede has suggested a national referendum on independence could follow the election[3].

## Recent Polling and Forecasts

- A Verian poll from January 2025 (497 respondents) indicated Inuit Ataqatigiit could receive about 31% of the vote, leading Siumut by roughly 9 percentage points[5].
- Pro-independence parties collectively have strong support, but IA remains the largest individual party in polling and recent history[3][5].
- Polling in Greenland is limited and less frequent than in other European countries, introducing some uncertainty[5].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- ElectionGuide and Wikipedia provide historical results and current parliamentary composition[1][2].
- GreenMet and Euronews offer recent context, polling data, and analysis of party positions[3][5].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- Greenlandic elections are often shaped by single-issue campaigns, which can cause rapid shifts in voter sentiment[3].
- Polling is infrequent and sample sizes are small, so forecasts carry significant uncertainty[5].
- The emergence of new parties or late-campaign developments could alter the outcome.

## Conclusion

Based on historical trends, current polling, and the political landscape as of March 10, 2025, Inuit Ataqatigiit is the most likely party to win the largest number of allocated seats in the 2025 Greenlandic general election.
