## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Iran’s relationship with the Taliban has shifted from open hostility in the 1990s to pragmatic engagement since 2021. Both sides have established new trade and transit agreements, and high-level diplomatic exchanges have become more common, signaling a move toward deeper cooperation[1][2][3][4].
- Despite this, Iran has not formally recognized the Taliban regime as of May 2025, maintaining an official stance of engagement without recognition[1][4][5].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- On January 26, 2025, Iran’s foreign minister visited Kabul, marking the highest-level contact since the Taliban’s return and demonstrating a willingness to strengthen cooperation, particularly in economic and transit matters[1][2][3].
- However, Iran’s concerns over border security remain acute. In March 2025, Iranian officials announced an ambitious border closure and fortification project targeting smuggling, terrorism, and instability from Afghanistan, reflecting ongoing mistrust and security priorities[5].
- While economic and diplomatic ties are growing, these have not translated into formal recognition.

## Key Differences Affecting the Forecast

- Iran’s current approach is pragmatic, seeking to manage rather than resolve core disputes (sectarianism, water, security)[1][4][5].
- Unlike the 1990s, Iran is not out-rightly hostile, but it remains cautious, especially as the Taliban’s international legitimacy is still in question and Iran’s own political establishment is divided on the issue[1][5].
- The international context and lack of broader recognition limit Iran’s incentive to move unilaterally toward formal recognition.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given:
- Iran’s practical cooperation but continued formal hesitation,
- Ongoing security and ideological tensions,
- And the absence of recognition by other major regional actors,

**The probability that Iran will formally recognize the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan before 2030 appears moderate—likely between 30% and 50%.** While improved relations and economic interdependence create incentives, significant barriers remain and no decisive signals of imminent recognition have been recorded as of early 2025.

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Official government statements from Iran’s foreign ministry.
- Major international news agencies (France 24, World Politics Review).
- Policy analysis from regional think tanks and diplomatic correspondents.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- The situation remains fluid, and sudden political changes in either country or shifts in international policy could rapidly alter forecasts.
- The threshold for “formal recognition” may be blurred if Iran deepens ties without an explicit diplomatic declaration.
- Internal Iranian politics and Taliban behavior toward minorities and international norms could also influence the final decision.
