## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

As of January 2025, all six U.S.-designated foreign adversaries—China, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Russia, and Venezuela—remain under the leadership of the same individuals who have held power for multiple years:
- Xi Jinping (China)
- Miguel Díaz-Canel (Cuba)
- Ali Khamenei (Iran)
- Kim Jong Un (North Korea)
- Vladimir Putin (Russia)
- Nicolás Maduro (Venezuela)[2][1]

Historically, these regimes exhibit high leadership stability. Leadership changes have typically occurred due to death, severe health crises, or orchestrated succession rather than regular transfers of power.

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- There are no publicly reported plans for succession or credible indications of impending leadership transition in any of the six countries as of January 2025.
- Recent elections or power consolidations (e.g., Putin’s reelection in 2024) have reinforced incumbency for at least the near term.
- U.S. intelligence assessments as of March 2025 continue to monitor these adversaries, but do not forecast imminent changes in leadership[5].

## Key Differences Affecting the Forecast

- **Age and Health:** Ali Khamenei (Iran) and Nicolás Maduro (Venezuela) are older and may face higher health risks, but no reliable reports indicate critical health issues as of early 2025.
- **Regime Stability:** All six regimes maintain strong security apparatus and have limited tolerance for dissent, reducing the likelihood of coups or sudden removals.
- **Recent Activity:** No significant purges, protests, or destabilizing events have been reported that would threaten leadership continuity in these states.
- **International Environment:** Growing cooperation among adversaries and a more polarized global environment may reinforce their internal cohesion[5].

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given:
- The historical rarity of leadership changes in these countries within a single calendar year;
- The absence of credible succession crises or destabilizing events as of January 2025;
- The advanced age of some leaders, which introduces some uncertainty;

The adjusted probability that at least one leadership change (per the strict resolution criteria) will occur in 2025 remains low, likely in the range of 10–20%. The most plausible triggers would be an unexpected health event or internal coup, but there is no direct evidence pointing to imminent risk in any particular country.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- Sudden, opaque events (e.g., health emergencies, palace coups) are inherently difficult to forecast, especially in closed regimes.
- Publicly available information may lag behind real developments, particularly in North Korea and Iran.
- The probability could change rapidly if new credible reports or crises emerge.
