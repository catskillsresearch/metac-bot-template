# Forecasting US National Average Retail Price of Regular Gasoline for September 30, 2024

The question of whether the US national average retail price of regular gasoline will exceed $3.30 per gallon on September 30, 2024, requires analysis of current price trends, seasonal patterns, and expert forecasts. This analysis will help understand the likelihood of gas prices crossing the $3.30 threshold by the specified date.

## Current Gas Price Trends

As of September 17, 2024, the national average price for a gallon of regular gasoline stands at $3.20, according to AAA data[5]. This represents a significant decline from earlier in the year, with prices having fallen approximately 13% from their 2024 peak in April, amounting to a decrease of nearly 50 cents per gallon[5].

The most recent comprehensive data prior to this shows that in April 2024, the national average was $3.62 per gallon, which was slightly higher ($0.02) than the same period in 2023[1]. During that time, prices had increased by 27 cents in just the first two weeks of April, and AAA was anticipating continued price increases throughout 2024[1].

However, the trajectory has clearly reversed since then, with a substantial downward trend observed through the summer and into September.

## Factors Influencing Current Price Decline

Several factors are contributing to the current downward trend in gasoline prices:

1. **Seasonal Demand Shift**: The end of the summer travel season has led to decreased demand for gasoline, which typically puts downward pressure on prices[5].

2. **Crude Oil Price Decline**: A sharp reduction in crude oil prices has contributed significantly to the falling gasoline prices, with experts noting that the decline is larger than what is typically seen during this time of year[5].

3. **Market Equilibrium**: According to petroleum analysts, the market is coming into a better balance between supply and demand factors.

## Expert Forecasts

Industry experts are projecting continued declines in gasoline prices:

- Patrick de Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, has stated that "gas prices continue to crumble across the entire nation" and that "the outlook is bright" regarding further price decreases[5].

- Some experts have forecasted that the national average price will likely drop below $3 per gallon for the first time since May 2021[5].

- As of mid-September 2024, 16 states already have average gas prices below $3 per gallon, including Texas, Georgia, North Carolina, Wisconsin, Kansas, and Iowa[5].

## Regional Price Variations

There are significant regional variations in gas prices across the United States:

- Western states typically have the highest gas prices, with California leading at $5.39 per gallon (as of April 2024)[1].

- Southeastern states generally have the lowest prices, which is reflected in the sub-$3 averages in states like Georgia and North Carolina[5].

- Florida's average gas price was $3.099 per gallon, with Jacksonville at $3.096 and Miami at $3.029[4].

## Historical Context

For historical context, it's worth noting that:

- The highest recorded average price for regular gasoline was $5.06 per gallon in June 2022[1].

- In Florida, the highest recorded average price was $4.882 on June 13, 2022[4].

- Gas prices have decreased approximately 15% in the last two years from when they were $4.27 per gallon[1].

## Forecast for September 30, 2024

Based on the available data and expert opinions, it appears unlikely that the national average retail price of regular gasoline will exceed $3.30 per gallon on September 30, 2024. The current price of $3.20 (as of September 17) is already below this threshold, and the strong downward momentum, coupled with expert forecasts predicting continued price decreases, suggests prices will remain below $3.30 or potentially drop even further by the end of September.

The seasonal pattern of decreased demand after the summer driving season, combined with falling crude oil prices, provides additional support for this forecast. However, it's important to note that gasoline prices can be volatile and subject to unexpected global events that could affect oil supply or demand.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors could potentially disrupt this forecast:

1. **Geopolitical Events**: Conflicts or tensions in oil-producing regions could cause sudden price increases.

2. **Weather Events**: Hurricanes or other natural disasters affecting refineries could disrupt supply.

3. **OPEC+ Decisions**: Changes in production quotas by major oil-producing countries could impact crude oil prices.

4. **Economic Factors**: Unexpected changes in economic conditions could affect demand.

Despite these potential disruptions, the current strong downward trend and expert forecasts suggest that prices are more likely to continue falling than to reverse course and exceed $3.30 by September 30, 2024.
