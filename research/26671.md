## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The President of France has exclusive constitutional authority to appoint the Prime Minister and is not legally obligated to select someone from the largest parliamentary group[1][2][3].
- Following the June 30 and July 7, 2024 snap elections, the National Assembly is divided: the New Popular Front (NFP) holds 182 seats, Macron's Together alliance 168, and the National Rally 143[1].
- No group commands an outright majority, and the NFP is asserting its claim to the premiership, but as of July 17, 2024, internal negotiations have not produced a unified candidate[1].
- The current Prime Minister, Gabriel Attal, is a member of Macron's Together alliance[5].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- As of July 17, 2024, the NFP had not agreed on a candidate for Prime Minister, and Macron had not appointed a new government[1].
- Macron retains the option to appoint a Prime Minister from his own alliance or another group, but such a government would likely face an immediate no-confidence vote if it lacks parliamentary support[1].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The official French government website provides up-to-date information on the current Prime Minister and cabinet composition.
- The French Interior Ministry's elections page lists the party affiliations of elected officials.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- The fragmented parliament and lack of a clear majority mean coalition negotiations are ongoing, and the situation could change rapidly.
- If no agreement is reached, Macron could maintain a caretaker government or appoint a Prime Minister from his own alliance, but this would be politically unstable and subject to parliamentary challenge[1].
- As of July 29, 2024, there is no definitive public information confirming whether the Prime Minister on August 31, 2024, will be from the Together alliance.

## Summary

As of July 29, 2024, it remains uncertain whether the Prime Minister of France on August 31, 2024, will belong to Macron's Together coalition. The President has the constitutional power to appoint a Prime Minister from his alliance, but the lack of a parliamentary majority and ongoing coalition negotiations introduce significant uncertainty about the government's future composition[1][2][5].
