# Forecasting Major Civil Unrest in America Before 2031

As a forecasting analyst examining the potential for major civil unrest or rioting in America before 2031, I'll analyze historical patterns and current factors that may influence this possibility.

## Historical Context

The United States has experienced various levels of civil unrest throughout its history, with notable recent periods including:

- The 1992 Los Angeles riots (referenced in the question) resulted in over 60 deaths, 2,350+ injuries, 12,000+ arrests, and approximately $1 billion in property damage
- Previous Metaculus questions on this topic have all resolved as "No," suggesting that events meeting the specific threshold criteria have not occurred in recent years

## Current Trends and Indicators

Demonstration activity in the United States shows a significant volume of protests but relatively few incidents classified as riots. Historical data indicates that while protests are common, escalation to the level of "major civil unrest" as defined in the resolution criteria is rare.

The resolution criteria require either:
- At least 50 deaths directly due to violence within a 30-day period, or
- At least 10,000 arrests within a 30-day period

These thresholds are substantially high and have rarely been reached in modern American history outside of exceptional circumstances.

## Key Factors Affecting the Forecast

Several factors may influence the likelihood of major civil unrest before 2031:

1. **Political Polarization**: Increasing political division could potentially raise tensions and the risk of civil unrest during contentious political events.

2. **Economic Conditions**: Economic downturns, inequality, or rapid changes in economic circumstances have historically been correlated with civil unrest.

3. **Social Justice Issues**: Ongoing tensions around racial equality, police practices, and social justice have been catalysts for protests that could potentially escalate.

4. **Technological Factors**: Social media and communication technologies enable rapid organization of demonstrations but also provide authorities with surveillance capabilities.

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on historical patterns and current trends, I assess the probability of major civil unrest or rioting in America before 2031 as follows:

- **Low-to-moderate probability** (approximately 15-25%) of meeting the death threshold (50+ deaths in 30 days)
- **Low probability** (approximately 10-20%) of meeting the arrest threshold (10,000+ arrests in 30 days)
- **Overall probability** of approximately 20-30% that either threshold will be met before 2031

## Limitations and Uncertainties

This forecast has several important limitations:

1. **Black Swan Events**: Unpredictable triggering events could rapidly change the likelihood of major unrest.

2. **Data Limitations**: Comprehensive data on smaller-scale unrest that could indicate building tensions is limited.

3. **Definition Challenges**: The classification of events as "riots" versus "protests" involves subjective judgment and may vary between sources.

4. **Temporal Distance**: Forecasting over a 7+ year timeframe inherently involves significant uncertainty, particularly for socio-political events.

The forecast suggests that while demonstrations and protests are common in the United States, escalation to the level defined as "major civil unrest" in the resolution criteria remains relatively unlikely but cannot be ruled out over an extended timeframe.
