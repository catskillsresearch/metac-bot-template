## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The United States has few federal regulations specifically restricting IVF, preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD), or embryo selection, especially compared to most other advanced economies. This regulatory environment makes the US uniquely permissive among large countries for implementing new reproductive technologies, including embryo selection for polygenic traits like intelligence[1][3][4].
- Guidance from professional organizations such as the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) focuses primarily on infectious disease screening and basic genetic disorder risk, not on polygenic selection or enhancement[2].
- The US IVF industry is technologically advanced and home to multiple startups (e.g., Genomic Prediction, Orchid) offering polygenic risk scoring for embryos, with the first polygenically screened baby reportedly born in the US in 2021.
- No major US state or federal policy as of January 2022 prohibits embryo selection for intelligence; recent legal challenges regarding abortion have not targeted PGD or preimplantation selection[1][3].

## 2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- As of early 2022, no new US regulations restrict embryo selection for intelligence. The field operates largely under self-regulation and professional guidance, with few legal constraints[1][3].
- Globally, most countries with large IVF industries (e.g., UK, Germany, Japan, Australia) have significantly stricter regulations on embryo selection, especially for non-medical traits[1][4].
- There is active ethical debate in the US medical community about embryo selection for non-disease traits, but no regulatory changes have been enacted[5].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Lozier Institute report on US and international embryo regulation[1]
- ASRM guidance on gamete and embryo donation and ART oversight[2][4]
- Frontiers in Reproductive Health review on emerging embryo selection technologies[5]

## 4. Limitations or Uncertainties in Measurement

- Uptake rates: There is no authoritative data on what percentage of US newborns result from embryo selection for intelligence, as these procedures are experimental and not widely adopted.
- Social and political factors: While technical and regulatory barriers are low, actual adoption may be limited by cost, public ambivalence, ethical concerns, and potential future legal changes.
- Technological efficacy: It remains uncertain whether current polygenic selection methods can reliably produce an average IQ gain of at least 3 points, as required by the resolution criteria.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the US's uniquely permissive regulatory environment, advanced IVF market, and early adoption of polygenic embryo selection, it is more likely than not that the US will be the first large country to cross the 10% threshold for embryo selection for intelligence—if any country does so in the foreseeable future. However, considerable uncertainties remain due to social, ethical, and political constraints. The probability as of January 2022 might reasonably be estimated in the 40–60% range, higher than for any other country, but not overwhelming due to these uncertainties.
