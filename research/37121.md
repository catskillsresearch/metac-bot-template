## Factual Information Relevant to the Forecast

**1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status**
- Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has a history of endorsing progressive candidates and previously backed Brad Lander for NYC Comptroller in 2021[2].
- She shares Democratic Socialists of America ties with Zohran Mamdani, another progressive contender in the current mayoral race[2].
- The progressive vote is split, with the Working Families Party endorsing both Lander and Mamdani (as well as others), but not settling on a single candidate[2].
- AOC has not endorsed a centrist candidate in major recent races and has explicitly ruled out Andrew Cuomo, labeling him as "the weight of the past" and not representative of "new leadership"[2].

**2. Recent Announcements and Policies**
- In the weeks leading up to May 19, 2025, AOC met with both Lander and Mamdani, fueling speculation but making no public endorsement[2].
- AOC’s office has not responded to requests for comment regarding her plans, and there is no indication that an announcement is imminent[2][3].
- Media reports note that both AOC and influential outlets like the New York Times may have missed their windows to sway the race, suggesting any endorsement at this stage may have less impact than in past cycles[3].

**3. Authoritative Sources for Verification**
- The Bronx Times and City & State NY have reported on AOC’s meetings and the endorsement speculation[2].
- Crain’s New York Business commentary highlights the timing and potential waning influence of late endorsements[3].
- Official resolution criteria are outlined by the CFTC and KalshiEX, specifying that only a clear, public endorsement counts; otherwise, the result is "No endorsement"[1].

**4. Limitations and Uncertainties**
- The final outcome hinges on AOC making a clear, public endorsement before primary day. Campaign contributions, private support, or ambiguous statements do not count as endorsements per the resolution criteria[1].
- The lack of a single dominant progressive candidate and AOC's past preference for strategic timing or withholding endorsements in divided fields increase the probability she may not endorse anyone.
- The timing is critical; as of May 19, no endorsement has been made, and media sentiment suggests the window for meaningful influence may be closing[3].

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

- **Zohran Mamdani** and **Brad Lander** are the most likely candidates to receive AOC’s endorsement, given her history and interactions, but as of now, there is no public indication of a preference[2].
- **Andrew Cuomo** is almost certainly excluded, based on AOC’s explicit comments[2].
- The probability that AOC makes **no endorsement** is notably higher than in past cycles, given the divided progressive field, her silence thus far, and the technical requirement for a clear public statement[1][2][3].
