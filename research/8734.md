## 1. Historical Trends and Current Status

- In 2020, electric vehicles (EVs) comprised approximately 5.5% of US vehicle production: 450,000 EVs out of 8.8 million total vehicles produced[1][5].
- By 2023, new electric car registrations had grown to 1.4 million, a 40% increase from the prior year, though the growth rate is slowing and major automakers have recently scaled back EV production targets in response to softer demand[5].
- The US EV market continues to expand, but the pace has moderated compared to the most optimistic mid-2010s projections[5].

## 2. Recent Announcements and Policies

- The US government has promoted EV adoption through tax credits, infrastructure investment, and emissions regulations, all contributing to the market's growth[5].
- However, recent trends show some headwinds: automakers such as Ford and GM have reduced their production targets, citing weaker-than-expected consumer demand and challenges scaling up infrastructure[5].
- The majority of EV charging still occurs at home, but expansion of public and workplace charging is seen as critical for continued market growth[5].

## 3. Authoritative Forecasts

- BloombergNEF projects that EVs will account for about one-third (33%) of new US vehicle sales by 2027[2].
- The Edison Electric Institute estimates that annual EV sales will reach 7.7 million and account for nearly 46% of new vehicle sales by 2030, with continued acceleration expected thereafter[4].
- Global forecasts suggest that the US will lag somewhat behind leading markets such as Europe and China in EV adoption rates during this period[3].

## 4. Key Differences vs. 2017 Reference Cases

| Factor                         | 2017 Forecast (e.g., Musk)            | 2025-2027 Reality                        |
|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Battery cost trends             | Cost parity expected 2020-2025        | On track, but adoption still below 50%   |
| Consumer demand                 | Assumed rapid, near-total shift       | Strong but slower, with recent softening |
| Automaker investment            | Aggressive transition planned         | Investment continues, but targets slowed |
| Policy/infrastructure           | Expected supportive, rapid buildout   | Progress made, but infrastructure still a bottleneck |
| Market share 2027 (projected)   | >50% of new vehicles                  | 30–33% of new vehicles                   |

## 5. Limitations and Uncertainties

- Forecasts are sensitive to policy changes, supply chain disruptions, and consumer sentiment.
- The production/sales split may vary year-to-year based on exports, inventory, and classification.
- Some sources report sales, others production; question resolves to production, but the two are closely linked in the US market[5].
- New technologies, unexpected regulatory changes, or global economic shifts could accelerate or decelerate adoption.

## 6. Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Based on recent industry forecasts and current trends, the most probable range for the percentage of new vehicle production that will be electric in the US in 2027 is **30–33%**[2]. The probability that the share surpasses 50% is low (<10%) barring an unforeseen acceleration in adoption or major policy shift.
