## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Egypt and Israel fought five major wars between 1948 and 1973, culminating in the 1978 Camp David Accords and the 1979 peace treaty, which have held since then, preventing new direct hostilities[3][4].
- Since the treaty, cooperation has gradually increased, particularly in the past decade, with joint security efforts focused on Sinai-based militants and Hamas-related threats[5].
- Despite substantial military buildups, both countries now emphasize maintaining peace, though strategic planning for possible conflict persists on both sides due to mutual distrust and the enduring possibility of regime or policy change[3].

## 2. Recent Announcements, Policies, and Developments

- The October 7, 2023 Hamas attacks on Israel strained Egypt-Israel relations. Egypt was criticized for not preventing weapons smuggling through its territory and for resisting Israeli requests regarding Gaza border management[5].
- Egypt has deployed tanks and aircraft to the Sinai, requiring Israeli approval as per the peace treaty, but these moves have mostly been in response to non-state threats, not Israel itself[5].
- Operational security coordination continues at the senior level, but institutional and popular hostility toward Israel persists within Egypt’s military and general populace[5].
- Egyptian public opinion remains overwhelmingly opposed to Israel, with 84% against diplomatic recognition—yet this has not translated into government support for military escalation[3].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Uppsala Conflict Data Program (UCDP) is the resolution authority for counting deaths from state-based violence[Reference criteria].
- Middle East Institute, Stimson Center, Foundation for Defense of Democracies, and Israeli/Arab security think tanks provide contemporary analysis of military capabilities, intentions, and regional dynamics[1][2][3][4][5].

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- While both sides are militarily prepared for worst-case scenarios, actual intentions remain focused on deterrence and limited, pragmatic cooperation, not war[3][5].
- The primary risks are unforeseen escalations or regime shifts, especially if a crisis in Gaza or Sinai spills over, but such developments have not materialized as of 2025[5].
- The probability of 1,000 or more deaths from direct, state-on-state Egypt-Israel conflict remains low given the cost, the US and international pressure, and lack of a triggering event comparable to pre-1973 circumstances.
- However, the presence of large, modern militaries and persistent mutual distrust means the risk is not zero, and rapid escalation cannot be entirely discounted[3][4].

## Comparison to Reference Cases

| Factor                       | Pre-1978 (War Era)          | 2023-2025 (Current)              |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Diplomatic Relations         | Hostile, no formal ties     | Formal peace, limited trust      |
| Military Posture             | Offensive/defensive focus   | Deterrence, joint security ops   |
| Popular Sentiment            | Hostile                     | Hostile (Egyptian public)        |
| State Intentions             | Open to war                 | Avoiding war, pragmatic ties     |
| Triggers for War             | Border disputes, alliances  | Non-state actors, Gaza tensions  |

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given:
- More than four decades of peace,
- Persistent but limited cooperation even amid major regional shocks,
- No direct state-level preparations or announcements suggesting imminent conflict,
- The high threshold for conflict escalation due to international constraints,

**It is highly unlikely (estimated probability well below 10%) that a military conflict between Egypt and Israel will cause 1,000 or more deaths before 2030 under the UCDP definition.**
