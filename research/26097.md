### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of July 3, 2024, the BSE SENSEX closed at 79,986.80, reflecting a strong upward trend in the Indian equity markets following the initial volatility after the 2024 general elections[4].
- The SENSEX has shown resilience and bullish momentum, supported by gains in power, capital goods, banking, and metal sectors[4].
- The Nifty index, which is highly correlated with the SENSEX, also reached new highs, closing around 24,300 in early July 2024[1][2][4].

### Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Metric

- The 2024 general elections resulted in a narrower victory for the BJP, initially causing a sharp drop in the SENSEX (almost 6% on June 4, 2024), but the market quickly rebounded as concerns about policy paralysis eased and investors regained confidence[1][2].
- There have been no major negative policy announcements or macroeconomic shocks since the election. Instead, foreign institutional investors (FIIs) have shown strong buying interest, further supporting the rally[2].

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The Economic Times and 5paisa provide up-to-date market commentary and technical analysis, confirming the bullish trend and current index levels[1][2][3].
- Spider Software India’s market wrap confirms the SENSEX’s closing value near 80,000 in early July 2024[4].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- July 21, 2024, is a Sunday, so the relevant closing value will be from the last trading day before that date (likely July 19, 2024).
- While the market is currently bullish, unforeseen global or domestic events could trigger a correction, but there is no evidence of such risks materializing as of July 12, 2024.
- Technical analysis suggests continued strength unless key support levels are breached, but short-term volatility cannot be ruled out[1][2][3].

### Conclusion

Given the SENSEX’s closing value of nearly 80,000 in early July 2024 and the absence of major negative catalysts, it is highly unlikely that the index will close between 76,000 and 77,000 on the last trading day before July 21, 2024. The most recent data and prevailing market sentiment support the expectation that the SENSEX will remain above 77,000 barring a significant and unexpected downturn.
