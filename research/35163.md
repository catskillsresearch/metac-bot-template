### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of February 2025, chatgpt.com reached a new high, ranking sixth globally in website traffic according to Similarweb data cited in a news article[1].
- Wikipedia.org has consistently been among the top global websites for many years, typically ranking within the top 10 on Similarweb's worldwide list. However, the exact rank for February or March 2025 is not provided in the available sources.

### Recent Announcements or Policies Affecting the Metric

- There are no reported announcements or policy changes in the available sources that would significantly affect the traffic or ranking of either chatgpt.com or wikipedia.org as of February 2025.

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The Similarweb Top Websites Ranking (set to All Categories, Worldwide) is the definitive source for resolving this question. The ranking is updated monthly and reflects global traffic estimates[1].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- The most recent concrete data point is that chatgpt.com was ranked #6 globally as of February 2025[1]. There is no direct evidence of wikipedia.org's precise rank at that time, nor is there data for March 2025.
- Website rankings can fluctuate month-to-month, especially for sites experiencing rapid growth or changes in user engagement.
- Without the actual March 2025 Similarweb ranking, it is not possible to definitively state whether chatgpt.com will outrank wikipedia.org in that update.

### Summary Table

| Website         | Recent Known Global Rank (Feb 2025) | Trend         |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------|---------------|
| chatgpt.com     | #6                                  | Rapidly rising|
| wikipedia.org   | Top 10 (historically)               | Stable        |

**Conclusion:**  
As of February 2025, chatgpt.com has achieved a global rank of #6, indicating a strong upward trend. However, due to the lack of explicit ranking data for wikipedia.org and the absence of the March 2025 update, it is not possible to conclusively forecast that chatgpt.com will have a higher rank than wikipedia.org in Similarweb's March 2025 update. The available evidence suggests it is possible, but not certain.
