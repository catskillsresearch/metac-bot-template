### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), signed in August 2022, established the §48E Clean Electricity Investment Tax Credit (ITC), §45Y Clean Electricity Production Tax Credit (PTC), and §45X Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit (AMPC). These credits are designed to incentivize investment, production, and manufacturing in the clean energy sector.
- A major innovation of the IRA was making these credits transferable, allowing companies to sell their tax credits to unrelated parties, thereby creating a robust secondary market and increasing the credits’ value and accessibility[3][4].
- As of early 2025, the IRS continues to administer these credits and their transferability provisions, with active guidance and portals for registration and transfer[3].

### Recent Announcements and Policy Developments

- In January 2025, a new administration took office, with Republican majorities in both chambers of Congress. Budget reconciliation negotiations have included discussions about cutting or modifying IRA clean energy tax credits, including the possibility of eliminating transferability[4].
- Despite these discussions, there is no public record or authoritative reporting confirming that legislation eliminating the transferability of §48E, §45Y, or §45X credits has been enacted as of April 10, 2025[3][4].
- The tax credit structures for §48E and §45Y remain in effect for projects beginning construction in 2025 and beyond, with no mention of transferability being eliminated[3].

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- IRS official guidance and news releases continue to describe the credits and their transferability as active for tax year 2025[3].
- Financial and tax advisory sources (e.g., Baker Tilly, Kiplinger) report on ongoing legislative negotiations but do not confirm any enacted changes to transferability as of the latest updates[3][4].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- While there is clear political intent and ongoing negotiation to potentially cut or modify these credits, legislative action eliminating transferability has not occurred as of April 10, 2025.
- The situation remains fluid, and significant changes could be enacted later in 2025, but such changes would only be relevant if enacted before January 1, 2026.

### Conclusion

As of April 10, 2025, there is no evidence that legislation has been enacted eliminating the transferability of the §48E ITC, §45Y PTC, or §45X AMPC tax credits. The credits and their transferability provisions remain in effect, though they are subject to ongoing legislative negotiations that could result in future changes[3][4].
