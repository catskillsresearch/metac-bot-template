### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Since the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945, no nuclear weapon has been deliberately detonated in war, despite numerous geopolitical crises and several close calls during the Cold War[1][3].
- The global stockpile of nuclear weapons is estimated at around 15,000 warheads as of 2020, with the majority held by the United States and Russia, and the remainder distributed among China, France, the United Kingdom, India, Pakistan, North Korea, and Israel (ambiguous status)[1][4].
- Nuclear deterrence, underpinned by the threat of massive retaliation, has been a strong factor preventing nuclear use, although it is not a guarantee against escalation or miscalculation[1][2].

### Key Differences Affecting the Forecast

- **Number and Diversity of Nuclear States**: More countries possess nuclear weapons than in 1945 or the early Cold War, increasing the number of potential conflict dyads and risk of regional escalation[1][4].
- **Stockpile Trends**: While the total number of warheads has declined since Cold War peaks, modernization efforts are ongoing, and some states have developed newer tactical and strategic capabilities[4].
- **Geopolitical Tensions**: Tensions between nuclear-armed rivals (e.g., India-Pakistan, US-China, US-Russia, North Korea’s ongoing development) create multiple potential flashpoints[5].
- **Technological/Procedural Risks**: New vulnerabilities arise from cyber threats to command-and-control systems and potential breakdowns in decision-making, increasing the possibility of unauthorized or inadvertent use[1][5].
- **Arms Control and Policy Shifts**: The erosion of arms control agreements (e.g., INF Treaty withdrawal, uncertainty over New START) may weaken safeguards, though some efforts at crisis communication and failsafe reviews are ongoing[5].

### Recent Announcements/Policies

- As of 2020, there was no major new arms control agreement among the major nuclear powers. Some arms control treaties had lapsed or were at risk, while modernization programs continued in several countries[4][5].
- Calls for crisis communications and improved fail-safes are being discussed among experts and policymakers to reduce the risk of accidental or inadvertent escalation[5].

### Probabilistic Assessment

- **Expert Elicitation (2024-2025)**: A 2024 expert survey gave a median estimate of a 5% chance of a nuclear catastrophe by 2045; superforecasters gave a lower estimate of 1% for a catastrophic event (defined as causing at least 10 million deaths), but the probability of *any* wartime nuclear detonation is likely somewhat higher[5].
- **Risk Estimates**: General expert consensus in the early 2020s places the chance of *some* nuclear detonation in war before 2050 in the low single digits to low double digits, e.g., 5–20% for a non-catastrophic, limited use event[1][5]. Some analyses suggest a 20–50% chance of a nuclear war of any size within this century, but these estimates often include less stringent criteria than the scenario described[1][2].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- Probability assessments are highly uncertain and depend on rare, high-impact events with few historical precedents.
- Measurement is limited by classified information, unpredictable technological and geopolitical developments, and the potential for sudden escalation due to miscalculation or novel circumstances[1][2][5].

**Summary Table: Comparison of Key Factors**

| Factor                  | 1945–2020 (Reference)      | 2020+ (Current)         |
|-------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------|
| Wartime detonations     | 2 (1945 only)              | 0 since 1945            |
| Nuclear states          | 2 (US, USSR) → ~9 by 2020  | 9 (plus ambiguity)      |
| Stockpile trend         | Peaked, then declined      | ~15,000, modernizing    |
| Arms control            | Strong during late Cold War| Eroding, partial efforts|
| Flashpoints             | Few (bipolar)              | Multiple (multipolar)   |
| Deterrence effectiveness| High (MAD)                 | High but new risks      |

**Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment:**  
Based on historical trends, expert and superforecaster surveys, and current risks, the probability of a nuclear weapon being deliberately detonated in war by 2050 is estimated at 5–20%, with most expert consensus clustering toward the lower end of this range[1][5]. The risk remains lower than during some Cold War periods but is not negligible, especially due to increased proliferation, regional tensions, and technological vulnerabilities.
