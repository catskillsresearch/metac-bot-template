## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- **EU withdrawal is rare:** The only precedent is the United Kingdom's Brexit, which followed years of public debate and a referendum. Brexit required a clear, sustained political mandate and strong public support for leaving.
- **Hungary’s EU membership remains popular:** As of 2020, 85% of Hungarians supported remaining in the EU. There is no evidence of a significant decline in this support as of 2022[2].
- **Legal pathway for exit is complex:** Hungary can only leave the EU after a constitutional amendment (requiring a two-thirds parliamentary majority) and a national referendum[2]. This is a high procedural hurdle.
- **Rising tensions with the EU:** The passage of the anti-LGBT law in 2021 led to sharp criticism from EU leaders, with some (e.g., the Netherlands' Prime Minister) suggesting Hungary should consider leaving[2]. The EU has also invoked Article 7 proceedings over rule-of-law issues[3].

## Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- **Anti-LGBT law and EU backlash:** The law provoked unprecedented condemnation and some calls for Hungary’s departure, but no formal expulsion mechanism exists[2].
- **Article 7 and frozen funds:** By 2025, the EU escalated its response, withholding aid and threatening Hungary’s voting rights[3][4][5]. However, the main EU strategy remains pressure and containment, not expulsion or encouragement of exit.
- **Hungarian government posture:** While Prime Minister Viktor Orbán has used anti-EU rhetoric and positioned Hungary as a conservative outlier, he has not advocated for "Huxit" (Hungarian exit) as official policy[3][4].

## Comparison to Reference Cases (e.g., Brexit)

| Factor                     | Brexit (UK)                      | Hungary (as of 2022)        |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Public support to leave    | ~50% (2016 referendum)           | ~15% (2020 poll against EU) |
| Political elite support    | Strong pro-Brexit faction        | No major pro-exit faction   |
| Legal/constitutional path  | Simple majority referendum       | Complex, needs 2/3 majority |
| EU stance                  | Somewhat conciliatory            | Condemnation, but no push   |
| Economic incentive         | Ambivalent/mixed                 | Strong financial benefits   |

## Key Differences Affecting the Forecast

- **Public opinion in Hungary is overwhelmingly pro-EU, unlike in the UK before Brexit.**
- **Hungary would need to change its constitution and succeed in a referendum, both unlikely given current political and public sentiment.**
- **The EU has no existing mechanism to expel a member state, and Article 7 only suspends voting rights, not membership.**
- **Hungarian leaders exploit EU antagonism domestically but have not made EU withdrawal a policy goal.**

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the above, the probability that Hungary will leave the EU before 2030 is very low. The legal and political hurdles, combined with strong public support for EU membership, make voluntary withdrawal highly unlikely. While EU-Hungary tensions are severe and growing, they have not translated into a realistic exit scenario as of 2022. A probabilistic estimate based on available data and comparison with Brexit would be **less than 10%**.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- Future political shifts (e.g., a dramatic change in government or public opinion) could alter the outlook.
- Unforeseen EU-wide crises or changes to EU treaties that create new exit/expulsion mechanisms could impact the forecast.
- The information is current as of May 2022; subsequent developments should be monitored for significant changes.
