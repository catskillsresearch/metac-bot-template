## US Solar Electricity Share in 2030: Forecast Assessment

**1. Historical Trends and Current Status**

- In 2020, solar accounted for about 3% of US electricity production, but comprised 43% of new generating capacity added that year, indicating rapid growth from a low baseline[1][2].
- By 2021, the US had cumulatively installed roughly 100 GWdc of solar capacity, with projections of reaching 324 GWdc added by 2030 (for a total of 419 GWdc), if current policy and market trends continue[1].

**2. Recent Policies and Announcements**

- The Biden Administration’s Solar Futures Study (September 2021) outlined a scenario where solar could reach 40% of US electricity generation by 2035 and 45% by 2050, contingent on aggressive policy action and technological advances[2].
- The SunShot 2030 initiative aims to halve the levelized cost of solar electricity by 2030, increasing solar's competitiveness and enabling greater grid penetration[4].

**3. Authoritative Forecasts and Industry Outlooks**

- The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) and Wood Mackenzie forecast a quadrupling of solar capacity by 2030, but note this trajectory falls short of the most ambitious federal targets unless policy and market dynamics shift dramatically[1][5].
- PV Magazine and SEIA in late 2024 state that annual installations would need to more than triple (to 140 GW per year) to reach a 40% solar share by 2030, compared to ~40 GW per year projected under current trends—making such a rapid transition unlikely absent major changes[5].

**4. Limitations and Uncertainties**

- **Policy Uncertainty**: Projections depend critically on sustained federal/state support, tax credits, and infrastructure investment.
- **Grid and Storage Constraints**: Achieving high solar shares will require rapid rollout of energy storage and grid modernization beyond current plans[4].
- **Industry Bottlenecks**: Supply chain, labor, and permitting challenges may slow deployment.
- **Measurement**: The final metric (percent of electricity produced) may lag behind installed capacity share due to capacity factors and curtailment.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

- **Reference Case (2021):** Solar share of US electricity in 2030 projected at 14–20% under moderate policy support and current installation trends[1][5].
- **Aspirational Scenario (Biden Administration):** Up to 40% by 2030 with aggressive action, but this is not supported by current deployment rates[2][5].
- **Adjusted Forecast:** Based on actual trends, industry forecasts, and current policies as of late 2021, a **plausible central estimate is 15–20%** of US electricity from solar in 2030, with a **low probability (<10%)** of exceeding 30% absent transformative policy or technological breakthroughs.
