### 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Wikipedia articles on concluded wars typically list a clear victor only if one side achieves a decisive outcome; otherwise, results such as "stalemate" or "negotiated settlement" are used.
- As of February 2024, the Russo-Ukrainian front lines remain static, with neither side making major advances. Both Ukraine and Russia are under international pressure to negotiate, and U.S. envoys report that any agreement is likely to require territorial and economic concessions by both sides[5].
- Recent peace proposals suggest that the legal status of some occupied territories would be deferred for future negotiation, indicating an incomplete settlement[1].

### 2. Recent Announcements and Policies

- U.S. officials and envoys report ongoing negotiations and the likelihood of a compromise, rather than total victory for either side[5].
- Russia publicly insists that a ceasefire alone is not enough for peace, while Ukraine demands clarity on Russian proposals before sending negotiators[2][3].
- Past negotiation models (e.g., the 2022 Istanbul talks) involved proposals for neutrality, limited military forces, and deferred decisions for Crimea and other territories[5].

### 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Wikipedia's own editorial practices for war outcomes, as seen in the articles for World War II and the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict.
- Current news and policy analysis from sources such as the Quincy Institute[1], Atlantic Council[3], and Sky News[2].

### 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- Wikipedia's "Result" or "Status" field may change due to editorial updates or post-agreement developments.
- Unforeseen military, political, or diplomatic changes could alter the settlement's perception.
- The field may not precisely match historical precedent if the conflict is frozen, unresolved, or reignited.

### Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the static front, push for negotiated compromise, and lack of decisive victory, there is a high probability that Wikipedia will list the conflict's result as "stalemate", "negotiated settlement", or a similarly neutral term one year after a bilateral agreement. The likelihood of the "Result" or "Status" field stating "Russian victory" or "Ukrainian victory" is low, barring an unexpected shift.

- Russia: Low probability
- Ukraine: Low probability
- Neither: High probability
