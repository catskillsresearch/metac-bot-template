## Key Factual Information as of August 22, 2024

**Current Status and Trends**
- The federal funds target rate remains at a two-decade high of approximately 5.3%[5].
- The July 2024 jobs report showed only 114,000 jobs created, well below forecasts, and the unemployment rate has risen to 4.3% from 3.5% a year earlier[5].
- Inflation has moderated, with the Fed now describing it as “somewhat elevated” rather than simply “elevated,” and recent data shows a slowdown in price increases[3].
- Both inflation retreating and labor market weakening—two scenarios cited by Chair Powell as warranting cuts—are now evident[5].

**Recent Announcements and Market Expectations**
- In July, the Fed held rates steady but signaled that “the time for a rate cut is approaching,” with Powell stating that a reduction “could be on the table at our September meeting” if data continues to improve[3].
- Market participants and futures markets in early August were pricing in up to five quarter-point cuts by year-end, with some anticipating an emergency cut even before September[3].
- The CME FedWatch tool as of August 19, 2024, indicated expectations for about 100 bps of cuts by December, implying multiple cuts starting in September[3].
- Several major Wall Street economists (e.g., Citigroup, JPMorgan) have revised forecasts to predict a 50 bps cut at both the September and November meetings[3].
- Some analysts and economists expect the Fed to cut rates at all three remaining meetings in 2024, with the September cut likely to be at least 25 bps, possibly more[5].

**Fed’s Official Stance and Limitations**
- The Fed’s official projections as of June called for only one cut in 2024, but many analysts believe this is now too cautious given the recent economic slowdown and labor market weakness[4].
- Chair Powell has emphasized that the decision will be data-dependent, and has not committed to a specific pace or size of cuts[3].
- The final decision will depend on inflation and employment data released before the September meeting[3].

## Limitations and Uncertainties
- The Fed’s decision is explicitly data-dependent, and there is still uncertainty about the magnitude of the cut (25 vs. 50 bps).
- If inflation unexpectedly rebounds or the labor market stabilizes, the Fed could delay or reduce the size of the cut.
- The official policy announcement at the September FOMC meeting will determine the outcome, regardless of market expectations or speculation.

## Authoritative Sources for Verification
- The Federal Reserve’s official policy announcements and the Open Market Operations webpage will provide definitive confirmation of any rate change at the September meeting.
