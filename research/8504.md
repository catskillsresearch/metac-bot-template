### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The United States has historically resisted arms control treaties that would restrict weapon classes considered vital to its strategic or technological edge, such as landmines and cluster munitions, often due to military, definitional, or verification concerns.
- As of late 2024, the U.S. position is that current international law is adequate to regulate LAWS, and it does not support negotiations on a legally binding ban[5].
- International momentum has increased: in December 2024, a UN General Assembly resolution on LAWS passed with overwhelming support, but the U.S. clarified its vote did not equate to support for a ban treaty[2][4][5].
- The CCW process, which the U.S. participates in, continues to discuss LAWS, but its consensus model has slowed progress, particularly due to opposition from key military powers[2][3].
- U.S. defense policy and leadership consistently highlight the need for continued autonomy development for national security and the practical difficulties of defining and regulating LAWS in treaty form[1][5].

### Recent Announcements/Policies

- In May 2024, the U.S. formally reiterated its opposition to a legally binding treaty on LAWS in a submission to the UN Secretary-General[5].
- While supporting certain UN resolutions on LAWS, the U.S. has repeatedly published statements making clear it does not support a treaty-based ban at this time[5].
- The 2023 "New Agenda for Peace" by the UN Secretary-General urged states to conclude such a legally binding instrument by 2026, but the U.S. has not shifted its position in response[3].

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- U.S. Department of State Office of Treaty Affairs for official treaty actions
- UN General Assembly and CCW public records for negotiation and voting history
- Official U.S. government submissions, press releases, and statements at the UN

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- Unpredictable global events, technological breakthroughs, or dramatic changes in U.S. political leadership could alter the current trajectory.
- Ongoing definitional ambiguities around what constitutes LAWS may complicate or delay any consensus on a treaty text.
- The possibility of a partial or regulatory treaty (rather than an outright ban) complicates the forecast but would not meet the strict resolution criteria.

### Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Based on the above, the likelihood that the United States will sign a Treaty on the Prohibition of Lethal Autonomous Weapons Systems before 2031 is **very low**—estimated at less than 10% barring unforeseen, dramatic changes in U.S. policy or global security context[2][3][5].
