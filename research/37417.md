## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of May 2025, 138 out of 193 UN member states recognize Palestine as a sovereign nation, a figure largely unchanged since April 2022[2].
- The most recent recognitions from European countries (Spain, Ireland, Slovenia, Norway) occurred in 2024, and these states continue to advocate for wider recognition and full UN membership for Palestine[1][3][5].
- There is significant diplomatic momentum, with a major UN conference on the two-state solution scheduled for June 2025, co-chaired by Saudi Arabia and France, explicitly aiming to advance Palestinian statehood recognition[4].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- On May 28–29, 2025, Spain, Ireland, Slovenia, and Norway reaffirmed their recognition of Palestine and called for full UN membership, but they are not new recognizers as of June 2025[1][3][5].
- The June 2025 UN conference is designed to further mobilize support for Palestinian statehood, but as of May 31, 2025, there are no public announcements or credible leaks suggesting another country is poised to recognize Palestine in June[4].
- There is a growing international consensus on the two-state solution, but concrete actions beyond those already taken have not been reported in late May 2025[5].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Al Jazeera’s tracking page for recognition of Palestine is the primary verification source for new recognitions, along with major international news outlets for official announcements.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- Diplomatic recognitions are often announced with little advance notice, especially in the context of coordinated international events or summits.
- While the June 2025 UN conference could catalyze new recognitions, as of May 31, 2025, no specific country is reported to be preparing such an announcement in June.
- The window for the resolution (June 2025) is narrow, and the most likely countries to recognize Palestine have already done so.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the current diplomatic momentum and the upcoming UN conference, the probability of a new UN member country recognizing Palestine in June 2025 is slightly elevated compared to most months. However, in the absence of concrete announcements or imminent plans, the likelihood remains moderate. Based on current information, a reasonable probabilistic forecast would be around 15–25% for a new recognition occurring in June 2025.
