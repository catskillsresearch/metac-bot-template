# Forecasting: Will the IRS Accept Bitcoin for Tax Payments Before 2030?

As of July 20, 2021, I'll analyze the available evidence to forecast whether the US Internal Revenue Service will officially accept Bitcoin for tax payments before January 1, 2030.

## Current Status and Historical Context

As of mid-2021, the IRS does not accept Bitcoin or any cryptocurrency for tax payments. The IRS established its position in Notice 2014-21, stating that cryptocurrency is treated as property for federal tax purposes, not as currency. This means that general tax principles applicable to property transactions apply to transactions using cryptocurrency, rather than currency transaction rules.

The IRS has consistently maintained that cryptocurrency does not have legal tender status in any jurisdiction, which forms the basis of their treatment of digital assets as property rather than currency. This position remains unchanged through at least April 2025 based on IRS publications.

## Key Factors Affecting the Forecast

### Precedents and International Developments

A significant development within our reference timeframe (before July 20, 2021) is El Salvador's announcement that it would begin accepting Bitcoin as legal tender[5]. This represents the first nation to officially recognize Bitcoin as legal tender, potentially creating a precedent that could influence other governments.

### Regulatory Framework

The IRS requires taxpayers to report cryptocurrency transactions on their tax returns, including when they sell crypto, receive it as payment, or engage in other digital asset transactions[2]. This demonstrates that while the IRS recognizes cryptocurrencies for tax reporting purposes, they maintain a clear distinction between recognizing these assets and accepting them as payment.

### Technical Considerations

For the IRS to accept Bitcoin for tax payments, they would need to:
1. Develop secure infrastructure to receive and process Bitcoin payments
2. Establish protocols for valuation at the time of payment
3. Create accounting systems to handle cryptocurrency assets
4. Potentially develop methods to convert Bitcoin to USD

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on the information available as of July 20, 2021:

**Low probability (15-25%)** that the IRS will accept Bitcoin for tax payments before 2030.

Reasoning:
- The IRS's consistent position treating cryptocurrency as property rather than currency creates significant regulatory hurdles
- Even by 2025, the IRS maintains that digital assets are subject to Capital Gains Tax or Income Tax, indicating no fundamental shift in their classification of cryptocurrency[4]
- The precedent set by El Salvador, while notable, has not yet led to similar adoption by major economies as of the available data
- The IRS would need to overcome substantial technical, security, and accounting challenges to implement Bitcoin tax payments
- The volatility of Bitcoin presents valuation challenges for tax payments

## Uncertainties and Limitations

- Potential legislative changes that could mandate the IRS to accept cryptocurrency
- Technological developments that might make cryptocurrency transactions more secure and stable
- Changes in leadership at the Treasury Department or IRS that could shift policy
- Broader adoption of cryptocurrency in the mainstream financial system

The forecast is limited by the lack of clear policy statements from the IRS regarding any plans or considerations for accepting cryptocurrency as payment for taxes. As of mid-2021, there were no public indications that such a change was being contemplated.
