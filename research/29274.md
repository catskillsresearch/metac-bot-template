## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Brandon Scott was first elected mayor in 2020 with 70.5% of the vote, reflecting strong support in a city where Democratic candidates typically dominate general elections[5].
- During his first term, Scott faced significant criticism over crime, schools, and constituent services, leading to low approval ratings. A Goucher College Poll from late 2023 showed only 37% approval and 57% disapproval among Baltimore voters[1].
- Despite early vulnerabilities, Scott's standing improved in early 2024, with his approval rating rising to 46% and support among likely Democratic voters increasing, though the primary race against Sheila Dixon remained competitive[3][4].

## Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Metric

- Scott's response to the Francis Scott Key Bridge collapse and progress on economic growth and homicide reduction contributed to his improved public perception and approval ratings in 2024[5].
- He won the Democratic primary against Sheila Dixon, a result widely considered tantamount to victory in Baltimore due to the city's strong Democratic lean[5].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The most recent and authoritative sources as of October 28, 2024, include the Goucher College Poll, CBS News Baltimore, WYPR/The Baltimore Banner, and the Wikipedia entry for the 2024 Baltimore mayoral election[1][3][4][5].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- As of October 28, 2024, there is no official, authoritative source reporting the exact percentage of the general election vote received by Brandon Scott.
- Precinct-level results suggest Scott received between 50% and over 90% in various precincts, but do not provide a citywide total[5].
- While Scott's victory in the Democratic primary and the city's partisan makeup make a general election win highly likely, whether he will reach or exceed the 70% threshold remains uncertain without final, certified results.

## Conclusion

Based on available information as of October 28, 2024, Brandon Scott is favored to win re-election, but there is insufficient public data to confirm whether he will receive at least 70% of the vote in the 2024 Baltimore mayoral race. The outcome remains uncertain until official results are published.
