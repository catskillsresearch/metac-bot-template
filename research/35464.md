# Forecasting Cathy Harris's Status as MSPB Chair on March 31, 2025

Based on information available as of February 27, 2025, here is an analysis to help forecast whether Cathy Harris will still be listed as chairing the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) on March 31, 2025.

## Current Status and Background

Cathy Harris was appointed by President Biden and confirmed by the Senate to serve a seven-year term on the U.S. Merit Systems Protection Board, with her term not set to expire until March 2028[2][5]. The MSPB is an independent, quasi-judicial agency that serves a critical function in protecting federal employees from unfair employment practices, including politically motivated firings and reprisals against whistleblowers[1][2].

On February 10, 2025, President Trump fired Harris from her position on the MSPB[5]. The dismissal was executed via a one-sentence email stating that her position was "terminated, effective immediately"[2]. This action followed her demotion as chair on President Trump's first day in office[3].

## Legal Challenge and Temporary Reinstatement

On February 11, 2025, Harris filed a lawsuit challenging her dismissal[2][5]. Her legal argument centers on the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, which states that MSPB board members can be removed by the president "only for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office"[2]. Harris's lawsuit contends that President Trump "disregarded that clear statutory language" by firing her without providing any of these statutorily required reasons[2][3].

In a significant development, on February 18, 2025, U.S. District Judge Rudolph Contreras in Washington, D.C. issued a temporary restraining order that:
1. Prevented the Trump administration from removing Harris from the MSPB
2. Reinstated Harris as the chairwoman of the board while the judge considers her lawsuit[3]

As of February 27, 2025, this temporary reinstatement remains in effect, giving Democrats a 2-1 advantage on the board[3]. The other MSPB members include Raymond Limon (vice chairman) and Henry Kerner[3].

## Factors Affecting Future Status

Several factors could influence whether Harris will still chair the MSPB on March 31, 2025:

1. **Ongoing Legal Proceedings**: The temporary restraining order is not a final ruling. Judge Contreras is still considering the full merits of Harris's lawsuit[3]. The outcome of this case will be decisive.

2. **Statutory Protections**: The Civil Service Reform Act's provisions regarding removal only for specific causes provide Harris with significant legal protection[2]. This statutory language is central to her case.

3. **Precedent and Independence**: The MSPB's role in protecting the merit system and ensuring government service is "about taxpayersâ€”not politics" makes this case particularly significant for the independence of government oversight bodies[1].

4. **Political Context**: The firing of Harris comes in a broader context that includes the dismissal of Hampton Dellinger, head of the Office of Special Counsel, which Government Accountability Project characterized as "another assault on the Merit System"[1].

## Limitations in Forecasting

As of February 27, 2025, Harris has been temporarily reinstated as MSPB chair through judicial intervention. However, this is not a final determination, and the court is still considering the full merits of her lawsuit. The temporary restraining order suggests that the court found sufficient merit in Harris's claims to warrant interim relief, but this does not guarantee a favorable final ruling.

The question of whether Harris will still chair the MSPB on March 31, 2025, depends on how quickly the court reaches a final decision and the substance of that decision. Given the importance of the legal principles at stake and the temporary reinstatement already granted, there is a significant possibility that Harris could remain in her position through March 31, 2025, but this cannot be stated with certainty based on information available as of February 27, 2025.
