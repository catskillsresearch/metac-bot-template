### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- In the 2019 Brandenburg state election, AfD secured 23.5% of the vote, establishing itself as a major force in the region.
- In 2024, AfD has seen significant gains in eastern Germany, winning 32.8% in Thuringia and 30.6% in Saxony in recent state elections[4][2].
- However, as of early September 2024, polling in Brandenburg places AfD at around 24%, which is notably lower than their results in Thuringia and Saxony[4].

### Recent Announcements and Policies

- AfD continues to campaign on anti-immigration and Eurosceptic platforms, capitalizing on dissatisfaction with the federal government and the three-way coalition in Berlin[4][3].
- The party’s recent electoral successes in neighboring eastern states have energized its base, but there are no reports of major new policy announcements or events in Brandenburg that would suggest a sudden surge beyond current polling.

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Election results and polling data are reported by reputable outlets such as Politico, Le Monde, and the Atlantic Council, as well as official sources like Bundeswahlleiterin[1][2][3][4].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- Polling data for Brandenburg is less recent and less detailed than for Saxony and Thuringia, introducing uncertainty.
- Polls can under- or overestimate actual support, and late-campaign developments could shift voter sentiment.
- The cited poll for Brandenburg (around 24%) is a snapshot and may not fully capture late-breaking trends or turnout effects[4].

### Conclusion

Based on the available factual information as of September 12, 2024, AfD is expected to perform strongly in Brandenburg, but the most recent polling places their support at around 24%, below the 30–32% range in question. While their momentum in eastern Germany is clear, there is insufficient evidence to forecast that AfD’s vote share in the 2024 Brandenburg state election will be more than 30% and less than or equal to 32%[4].
