## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- From 1976 (post-Apollo/Luna) to 2013, there were no soft lunar landings. Since then, China (Chang'e 3, 4, 5) and India (Chandrayaan-3) have succeeded, with several failures from other nations and private companies.
- The period 2022–2025 marks an unprecedented surge in planned lunar lander missions, driven by NASA’s Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS), private companies (Intuitive Machines, Astrobotic, ispace), and new efforts from China, India, Japan, and others[5].
- As of November 2022, at least 18 lunar landings were planned for 2022–2025 by governments and commercial actors, but past trends suggest a high failure/delay rate[5].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- NASA’s Artemis program delayed its next crewed landing (Artemis 3) to no earlier than 2027. Artemis 2, a crewed flyby, also slipped to 2026, removing these from 2025 consideration[2][3].
- The CLPS program launched its first landers in 2024; Intuitive Machines’ IM-1 succeeded, Astrobotic’s Peregrine failed, and more CLPS landers (IM-2, IM-3, Griffin Mission 1) are planned for 2025[4][5].
- Blue Origin (MK1 Lander), ispace, and others target 2025, but timelines are fluid and at risk of delay[5].
- China and India are not expected to launch additional landers in 2025, but Chang’e 6 (China) launched in 2024.

## Probabilistic Assessment (2022–2025)

Based on the latest available data:

- **2022**: No successful landings.
- **2023**: Chandrayaan-3 (India) successfully landed and transmitted data.
- **2024**: Chang’e 6 (China) and Intuitive Machines IM-1 (USA) succeeded; Astrobotic Peregrine and Japan’s SLIM failed or did not transmit data after landing.
- **2025 (forecast)**: At least three landers are scheduled (Intuitive Machines IM-2, IM-3, Astrobotic Griffin, Blue Origin MK1, ispace), but based on the recent success rate (~50%), it is reasonable to expect 2–3 will transmit data after a soft landing[4][5].

**Adjusted forecast:**  
- Confirmed 2023–2024: 3 successful soft landings (Chandrayaan-3, Chang’e 6, IM-1).  
- Projected for 2025: 2–3 likely, given current schedules and historical failure rates.  
- **Total (2022–2025):** 5–6 spacecraft will likely meet the criteria.

## Key Differences Affecting the Forecast

- The current era differs from the Apollo/Luna period with more actors, especially private commercial providers.
- The technical risks remain high, and delays are frequent.
- NASA’s Artemis crewed landings are now outside the window (after 2025).
- Commercial and international missions dominate the forecast for 2025.

## Sources of Verification

- Wikipedia’s “List of missions to the Moon”
- NASA NSSDCA Upcoming Planetary Events and Missions[1]
- Media coverage (Sky & Telescope, Space.com, RAND)[3][4][5]

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- Mission delays and failures are common, so actual numbers may be lower than optimistic schedules.
- Some missions may land but fail to transmit data, thus not meeting the resolution criteria.
- Commercial providers may announce or cancel launches with little notice.
- The status of missions will need verification from official lists and reliable news after 2025.
