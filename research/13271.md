# Lunar Landing Spacecraft Forecast (2022-2025)

As of May 26, 2025, I'll analyze the historical and planned lunar landings through the end of 2025 to provide a probabilistic assessment of the total number of spacecraft expected to successfully land on the lunar surface during the 2022-2025 period.

## Current Situation Analysis

The search results don't provide a comprehensive list of successfully completed lunar landings from 2022 to the present date (May 2025). However, we can extract some relevant information:

- In August 2023, India became the fourth nation to successfully soft-land on the moon[5]
- In January 2024, Japan became the fifth nation to achieve a lunar soft landing with its SLIM spacecraft (although it landed upside down)[5]

Based on this limited information, we can confirm at least two successful lunar landings between 2022 and the present date (May 2025).

## Planned Missions for Remainder of 2025

Several lunar landing missions are still scheduled for the remainder of 2025:

1. **Blue Ghost 1 (Firefly)** - Launched on January 15, 2025[1]
2. **Intuitive Machines 2 (PRIME 1)** - Launched on February 26, 2025[1]
3. **Griffin Mission 1** - Scheduled for Fall 2025 (NASA CLPS lunar lander)[3]
4. **Intuitive Machines 3 (PRISM)** - Planned for 2025[3]
5. **LUPEX** - A joint ISRO/JAXA mission scheduled for 2025, featuring an ISRO-made lander carrying a JAXA-made rover[5]

It's important to note that the search results don't clarify whether the first two missions (Blue Ghost 1 and Intuitive Machines 2) have already successfully landed since their launch dates have passed.

## Key Differences Affecting the Forecast

Several factors influence the probabilistic assessment:

1. **Historical success rates**: Lunar landings historically have had mixed success rates, with many attempts failing.

2. **Technological advancements**: Modern technology has improved reliability, but lunar landings remain challenging.

3. **Multiple nations and commercial entities**: The diversification of lunar mission providers (NASA, ISRO, JAXA, commercial companies) increases the number of potential attempts but introduces variability in experience levels.

4. **Artemis program timeline shifts**: The Artemis program has experienced delays, with Artemis 2 now scheduled for 2026 rather than its original target of November 2024 or September 2025[2]. This suggests potential delays in other missions as well.

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on the available information, here's my probabilistic assessment for the total number of successful lunar landings from 2022 through 2025:

- **Confirmed landings (2022-May 2025)**: 2 landings (India's 2023 mission and Japan's SLIM in 2024)
- **Potential additional landings (remainder of 2025)**: 3-5 missions

Taking into account historical success rates and the complexity of lunar landings, I estimate:

- **90% confidence interval**: 3-6 successful landings
- **Most likely outcome**: 4-5 successful landings

This assessment assumes that some of the planned 2025 missions may experience delays or failures, which is common in space exploration.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

1. **Limited historical data**: The search results don't provide comprehensive information about all lunar landing attempts since 2022.

2. **Mission status uncertainty**: The current status of Blue Ghost 1 and Intuitive Machines 2 (whether they successfully landed after launch) is unclear from the search results.

3. **Schedule uncertainty**: Space missions frequently experience delays due to technical issues, funding challenges, or launch constraints.

4. **Success criteria alignment**: The question defines success as a soft landing with data transmission, which may differ from how mission operators define success.
