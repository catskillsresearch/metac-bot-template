### Key Factual Information for Forecasting November 2024 Global Temperature Anomaly

**1. Historical Trends and Current Status**
- The global surface temperature anomaly for November 2024, as reported by NOAA, was **1.34°C above the 20th-century average of 12.9°C**. This makes November 2024 the second-warmest November on record, and it is **above the 1.25°C threshold** specified in the question[3].
- The first 10 months of 2024 saw record-breaking warmth, with the global temperature anomaly averaging 0.71°C above the 1991–2020 average, and 2024 is virtually certain to be the warmest year on record according to Copernicus Climate Change Service[5].

**2. Recent Announcements and Climate Drivers**
- Seasonal climate outlooks from the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and NOAA for September–November and October–December 2024 predicted a high probability of above-normal temperatures across most of the globe, with only limited regions (e.g., parts of coastal South America and the Pacific) expected to see below-normal temperatures due to the transition to weak La Niña conditions[2][4].
- Sea surface temperatures remained unusually high in many regions, contributing to persistent global warmth despite the onset of La Niña[5].

**3. Authoritative Sources for Verification**
- The official NOAA Global Land and Ocean Average Temperature Anomaly for November 2024 is published at: [NOAA Climate at a Glance](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/monitoring/climate-at-a-glance/global/time-series)[3].
- Additional verification and context are available from the Copernicus Climate Change Service and the World Meteorological Organization[2][4][5].

**4. Limitations and Uncertainties**
- NOAA’s monthly global temperature anomaly values are subject to minor revisions as more data are processed, but the preliminary value is typically robust and is the official metric for this resolution.
- There are inherent uncertainties in global temperature measurements due to data coverage, interpolation methods, and differences between datasets, but NOAA’s methodology is widely accepted for climate monitoring.

### Summary Table

| Metric                                      | Value (November 2024) | Threshold for "Yes" | Source  |
|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------|---------------------|---------|
| NOAA Global Land & Ocean Temp. Anomaly (°C)  | 1.34                  | <1.25               | [3]     |

**Conclusion:**  
Based on the preliminary NOAA data, November 2024 had a global temperature anomaly of 1.34°C, which is **not less than 1.25°C**. Therefore, the available factual information indicates the answer to the question is **No**.
