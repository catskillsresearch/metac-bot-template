# Forecasting NYT's Use of "Constitutional Crisis" Before April 1, 2025

## Current Status and Recent Trends

As of February 19, 2025, the New York Times last used the phrase "constitutional crisis" in its U.S. section on January 5, 2025, in an article titled "A Day of Love: How Trump Inverted the Violent History of Jan. 6." This indicates that the phrase is within the NYT's current lexicon for describing certain political situations.

The political climate in early 2025 appears to be experiencing significant tension. According to media analysis from February 11, 2025, there is growing concern about actions that some observers characterize as precipitating a "constitutional crisis," including unconstitutional executive orders, alleged law-breaking, and defiance of court orders[1].

## Factors That May Influence NYT's Usage

### Media Pressure and Coverage Trends

There appears to be increasing pressure on major news outlets to acknowledge and explicitly name what some media critics are calling a "constitutional crisis." Media analysts are advocating for newsrooms to enter "crisis mode" with "constant, round-the-clock, top-of-the-homepage coverage"[1].

Specifically, media critic Dan Froomkin wrote on February 11, 2025, that there will likely come a time "maybe even in the next few days, when at least some of our top newsroom leaders will acknowledge the growing mountain of evidence before them and reach the obvious conclusion" regarding a constitutional crisis[1].

### Historical NYT Editorial Practices

The New York Times has historically been cautious but not entirely averse to using the phrase "constitutional crisis" when covering significant challenges to governmental norms and separation of powers. The January 5, 2025 usage demonstrates this willingness under certain circumstances.

## Uncertainties and Limitations

Several factors create uncertainty in this forecast:

1. Editorial decisions at the New York Times are subject to internal policies and discussions that are not publicly available.

2. The evolving nature of political events between February 19 and April 1, 2025, could either intensify or diminish the perceived constitutional concerns.

3. The threshold for what constitutes a "constitutional crisis" worthy of that specific terminology varies among journalists and publications.

## Conclusion

Based on the information available as of February 19, 2025, there are several factors suggesting an increased likelihood of the New York Times using the phrase "constitutional crisis" before April 1, 2025:

- The phrase has already been used recently (January 5, 2025)
- There is growing media discourse about a constitutional crisis
- Media critics are explicitly calling for major outlets to acknowledge such a crisis
- The timeframe (approximately 40 days from February 19 to April 1) provides sufficient time for political developments that might prompt such terminology

However, the NYT's editorial standards and the unpredictable nature of political developments introduce significant uncertainty to this forecast.
