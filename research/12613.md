# Forecasting Boris Johnson's Potential Return as Conservative Party Leader

Based on the current political landscape and recent developments in the UK Conservative Party, I'll assess the probability of Boris Johnson returning as party leader before 2026.

## Current Status (as of May 2025)

The Conservative Party has gone through significant leadership changes since 2022. Following Rishi Sunak's resignation announcement on July 5, 2024[1], the party held a leadership contest between July and November 2024, which resulted in Kemi Badenoch becoming the new leader of the Conservative Party[3]. This indicates that Boris Johnson has not returned to the leadership position as of the present date.

Recent reporting from May 6, 2025, suggests there is some sentiment within the Conservative Party for Johnson's potential return, with some former party members believing that returning to certain policy approaches could help the party win the next election[2]. This indicates ongoing discussion about leadership direction but no immediate leadership change.

## Probability Assessment

With approximately seven months remaining until the January 1, 2026 resolution deadline, several factors affect the likelihood of Johnson's return:

**Factors decreasing probability:**
- The recent leadership transition to Kemi Badenoch occurred only about 6 months ago[3]
- Conservative parties typically avoid frequent leadership changes to maintain stability
- Johnson's previous tenure ended amid controversy, which could limit support for his return

**Factors increasing probability:**
- There appears to be some nostalgia for Johnson's leadership approach within the party[2]
- Political parties sometimes return to former leaders during periods of poor electoral performance
- Johnson has maintained a public profile since leaving office

## Forecast

Based on the available information, I estimate a **15-20% probability** that Boris Johnson will return as Conservative Party leader before January 1, 2026. This relatively low probability reflects:

1. The recency of Kemi Badenoch's leadership appointment[3]
2. The limited timeframe remaining before the resolution date
3. The institutional barriers to rapid leadership changes in major political parties

However, this probability is non-trivial given the historical precedent of former leaders returning in British politics and the apparent ongoing discussion about Johnson's leadership style within the party[2].

## Limitations

This forecast is constrained by:
1. Limited information about current internal Conservative Party dynamics
2. Uncertainty about potential triggering events that could precipitate a leadership challenge
3. Incomplete data on Johnson's current political ambitions and support base
4. The unpredictable nature of British politics, especially following recent electoral outcomes
