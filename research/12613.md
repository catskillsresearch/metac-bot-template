## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Boris Johnson resigned as Conservative Party leader in July 2022 after multiple scandals (including "Partygate") and the unprecedented resignation of over 60 government ministers, which forced a leadership contest[2][5].
- Johnson remained an MP after his resignation but left the House of Commons on June 12, 2023, and as of May 2025 is not a sitting MP[4].
- The Conservative Party has experienced ongoing instability, with speculation over leadership changes continuing through at least May 2025[3].
- Johnson’s leadership tenure delivered the Conservatives’ largest parliamentary majority since 1987, but his reputation was significantly damaged by scandals and loss of support among MPs[5].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- As of May 2025, there is no official announcement or evidence that Johnson has returned to or is actively seeking the Conservative leadership[3][4].
- The 2024 Conservative leadership election was triggered by Rishi Sunak’s resignation, but Johnson did not contest this election[1].
- Conservative party members and commentators have occasionally expressed nostalgia for Johnson's electoral successes, but this has not translated into a formal leadership campaign[3].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- UK Parliament member records confirm Johnson is no longer an MP as of June 2023[4].
- Wikipedia and reputable news sources chronicle the timeline of Johnson’s resignation and subsequent party leadership contests[1][2][5].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- While party rules do not strictly prohibit a non-MP from becoming leader, it is highly unusual and logistically challenging without a parliamentary seat.
- The Conservative Party’s history of abrupt leadership changes means a return is not impossible, but there is no evidence as of May 2025 that Johnson is positioned for a comeback.
- Political volatility and electoral setbacks could, in theory, prompt a dramatic move, but this remains speculative without supporting evidence.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

As of October 27, 2022, Johnson’s return was regarded as possible given his residual party support and the instability following his resignation. However, by May 2025, his absence from Parliament, sustained reputational damage, and the lack of active leadership bid all substantially reduce the probability. Barring an extraordinary and unprecedented set of circumstances, the likelihood that Boris Johnson will return as leader of the Conservative Party before January 1, 2026, appears low.
