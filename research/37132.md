## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The DesignSafe-CI portal is an active platform for natural hazards researchers to publish, store, and share datasets, with ongoing engagement as evidenced by continued events, workshops, and dataset awards[2][5].
- There is no explicit data on the typical number of monthly publications. However, the regular announcement of annual dataset awards and recent news updates imply a steady flow of publications[5].
- The portal will undergo routine maintenance in May 2025, but nothing indicates prolonged downtime or major changes affecting June 2025 activity[1].

## 2. Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Metric

- Dataset awards are recognized annually, with eligibility for any dataset published within the calendar year; no evidence suggests that June sees a significant increase due to the award cycle[5].
- Scheduled workshops and bootcamps in June 2025 may temporarily increase engagement but are not typically direct drivers of dataset publication[2].
- No new policies or announcements have been identified that would significantly alter the publication rate for June 2025.

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The official [DesignSafe-CI Data Depot Publications Browser](https://designsafe-ci.org/data/browser/public/designsafe.storage.published) is the authoritative source for checking the number of publications with a publication date in June 2025[3].
- The [DesignSafe Dataset Awards](https://www.designsafe-ci.org/community/dataset-awards/) and [NHERI Publications](https://www.designsafe-ci.org/news/publications/) pages document notable datasets and publication activity[4][5].

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- There is no direct, recent, or historical data available on the specific number of monthly publications, making trend-based forecasting uncertain.
- The impact of scheduled events (e.g., bootcamps, workshops) on publication rates is ambiguous, as these events may not immediately translate to new published datasets.
- Portal maintenance scheduled for May 20, 2025, appears routine and is not expected to affect June publication activity[1].

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the steady pattern of activity and no indication of an unusual surge or drop, the most likely range for June 2025 publications is either '0-20' or '21-30'. Considering the size of the community and ongoing engagement, '21-30' is a reasonable central estimate, but with some probability mass on '0-20' in case of lower-than-expected activity.

**Most likely option:** '21-30'
- Moderate-to-high confidence, given ongoing platform use and engagement.
