**Key factors for resolution**:  
1. **Publication lag**: EOs often appear in the Federal Register 1-5 days after signing[^1], but November 2024 data remains unconfirmed as of 11/12/2024.  
2. **Scraping restrictions**: FederalRegister.gov's access limitations[2][5] complicate real-time verification, requiring manual checks post-cutoff.  
3. **Historical precedent**: Biden has not skipped EO issuance for entire months since taking office[1][2][4], though November-specific patterns are unclear.  

**Uncertainties**:  
- **Data availability**: The 2024 EO page's inaccessibility[2][5] prevents pre-resolution confirmation.  
- **Political context**: Post-election transitions could influence EO volume, but no actionable signals exist pre-cutoff.  

**Verification method**:  
Metaculus must directly check https://www.federalregister.gov/presidential-documents/executive-orders/joe-biden/2024 post-11/12/2024, focusing on documents dated November 1-30, 2024.
