### Key Facts Relevant to the Forecast

- Apple has faced criticism for overheating issues in recent iPhone models, particularly the iPhone 15 Pro, prompting efforts to improve thermal management in upcoming devices[2][1].
- Multiple reputable sources report that Apple is developing a graphene thermal system for the iPhone 16 lineup, with the aim of improving heat dissipation. This is expected to be particularly relevant for the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max models[2][3][4][5].
- Graphene is known for its superior thermal conductivity compared to copper, which is currently used in iPhone heat sinks[2][4].
- Apple has previously filed patents related to graphene for thermal management, indicating a longstanding interest in the technology[2].
- Leaks and rumors suggest that the iPhone 16 series will feature both a graphene thermal system and a new metal battery casing, but these claims have not been officially confirmed by Apple[2][3][4][5].

### Recent Announcements and Official Status

- As of July 30, 2024, Apple has not officially announced any iPhone model with a graphene thermal system. All available information comes from leaks, supply chain rumors, and industry insiders, not from Appleâ€™s official communications[2][3][4][5].
- According to the resolution criteria, only an official Apple announcement (such as a press release or product launch event) before October 1, 2024, would resolve this question as "Yes."

### Authoritative Sources

- The information is widely reported by established tech news outlets (MacRumors, BGR, Firstpost) and attributed to leakers with a history of accurate reporting. However, none of these sources represent an official Apple statement[2][3][4][5].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- All current information is based on leaks and rumors, not official announcements.
- The question will only resolve as "Yes" if Apple officially announces an iPhone with a graphene thermal system before October 1, 2024. If no such announcement is made, the answer is "No."

### Summary Table

| Aspect                        | Status as of July 30, 2024                |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Official Apple announcement   | No                                        |
| Reputable leaks/rumors        | Yes (multiple sources)                    |
| Graphene system in iPhone 16  | Widely rumored, not confirmed by Apple    |
| Resolution by criteria        | "Yes" only if Apple makes official announcement before Oct 1, 2024 |

### Conclusion

As of July 30, 2024, there is no official announcement from Apple regarding an iPhone with a graphene thermal system. While multiple credible leaks suggest such a feature is in development for the iPhone 16 series, only an official Apple statement or product launch would satisfy the resolution criteria. Therefore, unless Apple makes such an announcement before October 1, 2024, the answer is "No."
