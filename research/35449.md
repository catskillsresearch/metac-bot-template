### Key Factual Information

- Speaker Mike Johnson formally invited President Donald Trump to address a joint session of Congress on March 4, 2025, marking his first such address since returning to office[1][2][3][4][5].
- As of February 25, 2025, Trump is expected to accept the invitation, but there is no official confirmation from the White House that the speech will occur on that date[2][3][4].
- In past addresses, presidents sometimes reference prominent opposition figures, and Trump has previously mentioned both Nancy Pelosi and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez ("AOC") in public remarks. However, there is no guarantee he will do so in this particular address.
- The current political focus is on Trump's "America First" legislative agenda, with no specific indication that Pelosi or AOC are central to ongoing legislative disputes or controversies as of early 2025[4].
- The authoritative transcript for resolving this question will be provided by the American Presidency Project, per the resolution criteria.

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- The content of Trump's March 4, 2025, address is unknown as of the last available information.
- Whether Trump will mention "AOC" or "Pelosi" depends on his rhetorical choices and any developments leading up to the speech.
- If the speech does not occur, or if Trump does not say "AOC" or "Pelosi" during the address, the question resolves as "No" per the resolution criteria.

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The American Presidency Project will provide the official transcript for the speech, which will be used to determine if Trump says "AOC" or "Pelosi" during the address.
