## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- **Historical Landfalls:** New York City has a documented history of hurricane impacts, most notably from the 1938 New England Hurricane and Hurricane Sandy in 2012. However, direct landfalls with sustained hurricane-force winds in the city are uncommon[3].
- **Recent Storm Activity:** The Atlantic hurricane basin has become more active in recent years. In 2025, NOAA forecasts a 60% chance of an above-normal hurricane season, with 13 to 19 named storms expected[1][2]. This continues a recent pattern of above-average activity.
- **Climate Change Influence:** Sea levels along New York’s coast have risen more than a foot since 1900, and warming temperatures are expected to make future hurricanes more intense and precipitation more extreme. The risk of damaging storm surge and rainfall-driven flooding is increasing[5].

## 2. Recent Announcements and Policies

- **2025 Hurricane Season Forecasts:** NOAA and other agencies have issued above-normal hurricane season outlooks for 2025, citing high ocean temperatures and other climate factors[1][2][4].
- **City Adaptation Efforts:** New York City has invested in infrastructure and updated emergency plans post-Sandy, but the city’s exposure to coastal storms remains high. No recent policy completely eliminates the risk.

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- **NOAA Seasonal Outlooks:** These provide state-of-the-art seasonal hurricane forecasts[2].
- **Metaculus Forecasting Platform:** Aggregates expert and community probabilities for specific forecast questions, currently estimating a 61.8% chance of a qualifying hurricane in NYC before 2030[3].
- **Peer-Reviewed Climate Risk Assessments:** These confirm rising risk due to ongoing climate change[5].

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- **Event Rarity:** Direct hurricane-force winds in NYC are rare, even though impactful storms (with weaker winds) are more frequent.
- **Forecast Horizon:** Seasonal and multi-year forecasts cannot predict specific hurricane tracks or landfalls this far in advance.
- **Resolution Criteria:** The strict requirement—sustained winds of at least 33 m/s measured within city limits—means many near-miss events would not resolve the question positively.
- **Changing Baseline:** Warming oceans and rising seas make historical analogs less directly applicable for future risk assessment.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given:
- The increased frequency and intensity of hurricanes in the Atlantic due to climate change,
- Multiple above-normal seasonal forecasts for the mid-2020s,
- New York City's geographic vulnerability and history of close calls,
- A robust community and expert consensus estimate of about 62% probability for such an event before 2030,

**It is reasonable to assess the probability of New York City experiencing a hurricane (as defined) before 2030 at approximately 60–65%.** This is notably higher than historical annual probabilities, reflecting new climate realities and recent forecasts[1][2][3][5].
