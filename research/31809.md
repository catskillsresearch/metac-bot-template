To forecast the monthly cargo volumes at the Port of NY-NJ for January 2025, I'll analyze historical data, recent trends, and relevant industry forecasts available as of January 24, 2025.

## Historical Trends and Current Status

The Port of New York and New Jersey has maintained a strong position in the US port system:

- According to the 2025 Annual Report, the Port of NY-NJ ranked #1 among US ports with 6,660.3 thousand TEUs handled[2].
- In January 2024, the port handled 667,346 TEUs (368,099 containers), representing a 3.4% increase compared to January 2023 (645,430 TEUs)[5].
- The port was the second busiest in the nation for loaded imports and exports in January 2024, handling 447,514 loaded TEUs, which was 2.6% above January 2023 levels[5].

Breaking down the January 2024 performance:

## Recent Announcements and Forecasts

The National Retail Federation (NRF) and Hackett Associates' Global Port Tracker provided forecasts relevant to January 2025:

- Overall US container imports were forecast to remain elevated in January 2025, with a projection of 2.16 million TEUs across US ports, representing a 10% increase year-over-year[1][4].
- This elevated forecast suggests continued strong import activity at major US ports, including NY-NJ.

## Analysis for January 2025 Forecast

Based on the available data, we can consider several factors to forecast January 2025 volumes:

1. If the Port of NY-NJ follows the national trend of 10% year-over-year growth projected by the NRF for January 2025, we might expect volumes around 734,080 TEUs (calculated as 667,346 Ã— 1.10).

2. However, port-specific factors must be considered:
   - The Port of NY-NJ has been gaining market share as the top-ranked US port[2]
   - Historical January performance shows steady growth (3.4% from 2023 to 2024)[5]

3. Seasonal patterns indicate January is typically a strong month for imports following the holiday season, with retailers restocking.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors could affect the accuracy of this forecast:

- Global economic conditions and trade policies that might change before January 2025
- Potential disruptions in shipping routes or labor issues at ports
- Changes in consumer demand patterns
- The actual growth rate at NY-NJ may differ from the national average forecast

## Conclusion

Based on historical data and current forecasts, the Port of NY-NJ could reasonably be expected to handle between 680,000-740,000 TEUs in January 2025, with the most likely scenario being around 730,000 TEUs if it follows the national growth projection of 10%. This would represent continued growth for the port and maintain its position as one of the busiest ports in the United States.
