## Key Factual Information for Forecasting

**1. Methodology and Volatility of the Index**
- The Bloomberg Billionaires Index is a daily ranking of the world’s richest people, updated at the close of every trading day in New York[1][3].
- Net worth calculations are based on a mix of public and private data, including stock prices, disclosed holdings, and valuations of private companies using peer comparisons and financial metrics[1][2].
- The Index is highly dynamic, with fortunes fluctuating in response to market movements, economic news, and currency exchange rates[1][3].

**2. Historical Trends and Current Status**
- The Index consistently tracks the top 500 richest individuals globally, with each billionaire’s profile detailing the calculation of their net worth[1][3].
- While the search results do not provide a specific historical series for the 500th-ranked billionaire’s net worth, the Index’s methodology ensures that the threshold for entry into the top 500 generally rises over time, especially during periods of global economic growth or strong equity markets[1][3].
- As of previous years, the net worth required to be ranked 500th has typically been in the multi-billion-dollar range, reflecting the concentration of wealth among the world’s richest individuals[3].

**3. Recent Announcements or Policies**
- No major policy changes or announcements affecting billionaire wealth calculations or the structure of the Index are mentioned in the available sources as of February 2025.
- The Index’s methodology and transparency have remained consistent, relying on Bloomberg’s reporting and data analysis[1][2].

**4. Authoritative Sources for Verification**
- The Bloomberg Billionaires Index itself is the authoritative source for this metric, with daily updates and detailed methodology available on Bloomberg’s website and terminals[1][3].
- Each billionaire’s profile includes explanations of asset valuations and calculation methods[1][3].

**5. Limitations and Uncertainties**
- The Index is subject to daily market volatility, which can cause significant swings in net worth, especially for those near the cutoff (e.g., the 500th-ranked billionaire)[1][3].
- Exchange rate fluctuations and changes in the valuation of private companies can also impact rankings[1][3].
- The precise net worth of the 500th-ranked billionaire on March 28, 2025, cannot be guaranteed in advance due to these variables.

## Summary

- The Bloomberg Billionaires Index is a transparent, daily-updated ranking that reflects real-time market and economic conditions.
- The net worth required to be the 500th richest person has historically been in the multi-billion-dollar range, but the exact figure on March 28, 2025, will depend on market conditions at that time.
- No recent policy changes or announcements are known that would drastically alter the threshold.
- The main uncertainties are market volatility and exchange rates, which could move the 500th-ranked billionaire’s net worth above or below $6.5 billion on the resolution date.
