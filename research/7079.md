As a forecasting analyst examining the question of how far away the nearest independent origination of life might be, I'll analyze what was known as of April 23, 2021, to help inform probabilistic assessments.

## Current Knowledge Base

The search for extraterrestrial life largely focuses on identifying planets within the "habitable zone" of their stars - the distance where liquid water could exist on a planet's surface, also known as the "Goldilocks zone" where conditions are neither too hot nor too cold for life[1]. 

When considering potential locations for independent life origination, we can examine several distance scales:

### Terrestrial Candidates (< 20,000 km)
The possibility of a second, independent origination of life on Earth itself cannot be ruled out based on available evidence as of 2021. If microbial communities with fundamentally different biochemistry were discovered in extreme environments, this would suggest an independent origin.

### Solar System Candidates (50-700 million km)
Mars and Venus, at approximately 50-400 million kilometers from Earth, have been primary targets in the search for extraterrestrial life:

- **Mars**: Evidence of past liquid water and organic molecules makes Mars a candidate, though no definitive evidence of past or present life had been discovered as of April 2021.
  
- **Venus**: The September 2020 announcement of phosphine in Venus's atmosphere generated excitement as a potential biosignature, though subsequent studies had cast doubt on these findings by early 2021.

- **Jovian Moons**: Moons like Europa and Enceladus, with subsurface oceans, represent potential habitats approximately 700 million km from Earth.

### Nearby Star Systems (~10^14 km)
The closest potentially habitable exoplanet to Earth is Proxima Centauri b, orbiting within the habitable zone of the red dwarf star Proxima Centauri, approximately 4 light-years (about 3.8 × 10^13 km) away[3][5]. While Proxima Centauri b orbits within its star's habitable zone, as of 2021, researchers did not know if it has an atmosphere or if liquid water exists on its surface[5].

Other nearby candidates include:
- Wolf 1061c, a rocky planet in the habitable zone of its star, approximately 14 light-years away[5]
- Planets in the Tau Ceti system, approximately 12 light-years away, with at least one planet (Tau Ceti e) considered potentially habitable[5]

### Galactic and Beyond (10^17 - 10^23 km)
For typical stars in our galaxy (~10^17 km) or nearby galaxies (~10^19 km), no specific candidates had been identified as of April 2021 due to the limitations of detection technology.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several significant limitations affect our ability to forecast where the nearest independent origination of life might be:

1. **Detection Limitations**: As of 2021, we had limited ability to directly detect biosignatures on exoplanets. Most exoplanet detections focused on finding the planets themselves rather than characterizing their atmospheres for signs of life.

2. **Habitability ≠ Habitation**: The presence of a planet in a habitable zone does not guarantee the presence of life. Many other factors, including planetary composition, magnetic field, and geological activity play crucial roles.

3. **Red Dwarf Challenges**: Many of the closest potentially habitable exoplanets orbit red dwarf stars, which present challenges for life development. Planets in these systems face extreme radiation levels and tidal locking, potentially creating hostile environments despite being in the habitable zone[1].

4. **Definition of "Independent"**: The question of what constitutes an "independent" origination of life remains open. If life were found elsewhere in our solar system, determining whether it shares a common origin with Earth life would be challenging.

## Assessment Considerations

Based on information available as of April 2021, a forecaster might consider these key points:

1. No definitive evidence of life beyond Earth had been discovered.

2. The closest potentially habitable environments were within our own solar system (Mars, Venus, and certain moons of Jupiter and Saturn).

3. Beyond our solar system, Proxima Centauri b represented the closest known potentially habitable exoplanet at approximately 4 light-years.

4. Projects like NEAR were actively searching for planets in the habitable zones of nearby stars[4], indicating ongoing scientific interest but no definitive discoveries as of the cutoff date.

Given these considerations, a comprehensive forecast would need to account for the full range of possibilities from a second genesis on Earth to life originating in distant galaxies, with appropriate probability weights reflecting our limited knowledge as of April 2021.
