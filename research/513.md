# Hyperloop Commercial Development Forecast: US vs. International (As of August 14, 2017)

As of mid-2017, the race to build the world's first commercial hyperloop system involves multiple countries and companies. This analysis examines the available evidence as of August 14, 2017, to assess whether the United States is likely to host the first commercial hyperloop system.

## US Hyperloop Development Status

The United States has several advantages in the hyperloop development race:

- Hyperloop One (later Virgin Hyperloop One) has constructed a 500-meter test track near Las Vegas in 2017, making it one of the most advanced physical implementations of the technology[2][3]
- Elon Musk, who popularized the modern hyperloop concept, has claimed "verbal approval" for a hyperloop system connecting New York to Washington, DC, though the exact nature of this approval remains unclear
- The Nevada test site represents significant progress in demonstrating the technical feasibility of the system within US territory

## International Hyperloop Development

Several international projects were already in development by mid-2017:

- In 2016, Hyperloop Transportation Technologies (HTT) announced an agreement with the Slovak government to conduct feasibility studies for routes connecting Vienna, Bratislava, and Budapest, with estimated costs of $200-300 million[5]
- HTT was also considering a route between Chennai and Bengaluru in India as of 2016[1]
- An India-based company, Dinclix Ground Works' DGW Hyperloop, was advocating for a hyperloop corridor between Mumbai and Delhi via Indore, Kota, and Jaipur in 2016[1]

## Comparative Analysis

When comparing US and international hyperloop projects as of August 2017:

**Funding and Resources:**
- Hyperloop One had secured substantial funding, having raised more than $450 million since its founding[2]
- As of 2016, HTT had raised $31.8 million in cash and received $77 million in man-hours, services, and other in-kind investments[5]

**Technical Progress:**
- The US had the most advanced test infrastructure with the Nevada test track
- International projects were still largely in the feasibility study and planning phases

**Regulatory Environment:**
- The US regulatory environment for novel transportation systems presented significant challenges
- Some international locations might offer more streamlined approval processes for new infrastructure projects

## Forecasting Considerations

Several factors would influence which country develops the first commercial hyperloop:

1. **Technical feasibility:** The US had the lead in testing infrastructure as of August 2017
2. **Funding:** Both US and international projects had secured significant funding
3. **Regulatory approval:** International projects might face fewer regulatory hurdles
4. **Political support:** Projects with strong government backing could move faster
5. **Economic viability:** The cost-benefit analysis would be different in different markets

Based on information available as of August 14, 2017, the US had technical advantages but international projects, particularly in Dubai and India, showed strong government support that could accelerate development. The timeline projections at that point suggested first commercial operations might begin between 2019-2020, though these projections were optimistic given the technological and regulatory challenges.
