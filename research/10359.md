# Analysis of Turkey's Inflation Trajectory (as of March 2022)

As of March 2022, Turkey is experiencing a severe inflation crisis, with the annual inflation rate reaching 54% in February 2022. This analysis examines the likelihood of Turkey's inflation rate falling to 4% or less before 2025 based on current economic conditions, historical patterns, and policy directions.

## Current Inflation Status

Turkey is currently in the midst of a significant debt and inflation crisis that began in 2018. The inflation rate has remained persistently high, staying above 10% since November 2019, and has recently accelerated dramatically to 54% as of February 2022. This represents one of the highest inflation rates Turkey has experienced in recent decades.

The Turkish lira has depreciated substantially, falling by 28% against the USD from November 2021 to February 2022. This currency depreciation has contributed significantly to inflation by increasing the cost of imported goods and services.

## Historical Context and Policy Approach

President Erdogan's administration has taken an unconventional approach to monetary policy. While most central banks raise interest rates to combat inflation, President Erdogan believes that lowering interest rates stimulates economic growth and reduces inflation. This approach contradicts conventional economic theory and practice.

President Erdogan has referenced Turkey's previous success in reducing inflation, stating in December 2021: "Sooner or later, just as we lowered inflation all the way to 4% when I came to power, we will lower it again." Indeed, annual inflation did briefly reach 4.0% in March 2011, though the yearly average was 6.5%.

## Forecast Analysis

Several factors make it highly unlikely that Turkey will achieve an inflation rate of 4% or less before 2025:

1. **Current Trajectory**: With inflation at 54% in February 2022 and continuing to rise, the magnitude of reduction required to reach 4% is enormous and would typically require years of tight monetary policy.

2. **Unorthodox Monetary Policy**: The current administration's policy of lowering interest rates in the face of high inflation runs counter to established economic practice and is likely to exacerbate rather than resolve inflationary pressures.

3. **External Forecasts**: The IMF's October 2021 World Economic Outlook projects Turkish inflation to average 13.55% from 2022 to 2024, significantly above the 4% threshold.

4. **Historical Precedent**: Even during periods of relative economic stability, Turkey has struggled to maintain inflation below 8%. The lowest annual inflation from 2018 to 2020 was 8.55% in October 2019.

5. **Global Economic Factors**: Rising global commodity prices and supply chain disruptions are creating inflationary pressures worldwide, making it even more challenging for Turkey to achieve low inflation.

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on the available information as of March 2022, the probability of Turkey's annual inflation falling to 4% or less before 2025 is very low, estimated at less than 5%. This assessment is based on:

- The current extremely high inflation rate (54% as of February 2022)
- The unconventional monetary policy approach that is likely to sustain rather than reduce inflation
- The significant currency depreciation that continues to drive import costs higher
- Expert forecasts such as the IMF's projection of continued double-digit inflation
- The historical difficulty of achieving inflation rates below 8% even in more favorable conditions

For Turkey to achieve an inflation rate of 4% or less before 2025 would require a dramatic policy reversal, extraordinary economic management, and favorable global economic conditions - a combination that appears highly improbable given the current situation.
