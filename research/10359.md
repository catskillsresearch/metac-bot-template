## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- From 2019 through early 2022, Turkey’s annual inflation remained in double digits, accelerating dramatically to 54% by February 2022 amid a currency crisis and unorthodox monetary policy[2][4].
- The Turkish Lira depreciated sharply, losing 28% of its value against the US dollar from November 2021 to February 2022, fueling import-driven inflation[2].
- Inflation peaked at 85.51% in October 2022 and, though it declined subsequently, it remained extremely elevated—registering 47.1% in November 2024 and 38.1% in March 2025[1][2].
- The last time Turkey’s inflation was near 4% was in March 2011; since then, structural changes and repeated economic shocks have kept inflation much higher[2].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- President Erdogan and policymakers continued to pursue low interest rates despite high inflation, diverging from orthodox central banking practice, which contributed to persistent inflation[2].
- Turkish Finance Minister Nureddin Nebati stated in March 2022 that the exchange rate was “stable and moves forward within acceptable limits,” yet this did not translate into inflation stabilization[2].
- Producer price pressures and supply-side costs, especially in food and energy, remained high and contributed to ongoing inflation[2].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Turkish Statistical Institute (TurkStat) is the official source for monthly inflation statistics.
- Reputable aggregators and analysts such as Trading Economics, Statista, and Macrotrends consistently report inflation well above 4% for every month between 2022 and the end of 2024[1][2][4][5].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- Official data from TurkStat is considered authoritative, but there have occasionally been public concerns about the accuracy and methodology of inflation measurements.
- No credible alternative sources report materially different inflation outcomes for this period.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given all available data and historical context, the probability that Turkey’s annual inflation rate fell to 4% or less in any month from January 2022 through December 2024 is virtually zero. All verified monthly figures from TurkStat and international aggregators show inflation remained far above this threshold throughout the period[1][2][4][5].
