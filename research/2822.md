## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- **Hardware Performance and Cost Trends**: Supercomputing costs have historically fallen rapidly. As of 2015, the cost to provide human-brain-level processing power (~10^16 operations per second) was estimated at $4,700–$170,000 per hour, depending on architecture and assumptions. Costs have been dropping at a rate of approximately 50% per 1.6 years, following trends similar to Moore’s Law[1].
- **WBE Hardware Requirements**: The computational demand for WBE depends heavily on the simulation detail. Estimates range from 10^18 operations per second (modest, abstracted neuron models) to 10^25 ops/sec (molecular-level simulation). For a plausible first emulation, a higher-level neuron or synapse model is likelier, implying requirements closer to the lower end—yet still far beyond 2019’s leading supercomputers[1].
- **Scanning and Interpretation Bottlenecks**: As of 2019, progress in connectome imaging (e.g., multi-beam and focused ion beam electron microscopy) is shifting from fundamental science to engineering, but the ability to image, label, and interpret the entire human brain at nanoscale remains a major challenge. There is increasing optimism that these hurdles are solvable with continued engineering effort[5][1].
- **Reference Roadmaps**: The Future of Humanity Institute’s 2008 and updated 2019 roadmaps outline a two-phase WBE development: (1) achieving core capabilities and (2) scaling to full human brains once an automated scan-interpret-simulate pipeline exists[1][5].

## 2. Key Differences Affecting the Forecast

- **Resolution Level**: The necessary fidelity for a functionally accurate emulation is unknown. If a higher-level, less granular model suffices, computational costs drop dramatically; if molecular detail is required, costs increase by many orders of magnitude[1].
- **Hardware vs. Neuroscience Bottleneck**: If neuroscience or scanning lags behind hardware, WBE will arrive later, when hardware is cheaper (“overshoot” scenario). Conversely, if hardware is the limiting factor, first emulations will occur when costs are higher[1].
- **Compression Factor (Subjective vs. Wall-Clock Time)**: If the emulator runs slower or faster than a biological brain, cost per “subjective hour” adjusts accordingly. Most forecasts assume initial emulations run at near-real-time or slower, due to hardware constraints[1].
- **Facility and Operating Costs**: Beyond hardware, costs include power, cooling, and facility operation, which can be significant for supercomputer-scale systems. These are amortized over a three-year period per established methodology[1].

## 3. Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment (2019 USD)

- **Central Estimate**: Given hardware costs and trends as of 2019, and assuming the first WBE is run at the lowest feasible resolution for human-level function (likely a detailed spiking neural network at the compartment/synapse level), the cost per hour of subjective runtime is likely to fall in the range of **$1,000 to $100,000**. This is based on amortized supercomputing costs for systems capable of 10^17–10^18 synaptic updates per second, with some allowance for further hardware cost reduction if neuroscience and scanning are the final bottlenecks[1].
- **Lower Bound**: If WBE is delayed until hardware costs drop significantly (overshoot), or if higher abstraction levels suffice, costs could fall to **$100 per hour** or less within 365 days of the first emulation, especially as cheaper or more efficient hardware is rapidly applied[1].
- **Upper Bound**: If molecular-level simulation is required, or if the first emulation is achieved at the edge of feasibility with little cost optimization, costs could exceed **$1,000,000 per hour**, but this is less probable for the first scalable, reproducible emulation[1].
- **Uncertainties**: Major uncertainties remain regarding the required simulation fidelity and the actual efficiency of early emulation pipelines. Additionally, non-hardware costs (e.g., staff, maintenance, cooling) could add significantly to the total, but hardware remains the dominant factor[1][5].
- **Probabilistic Assessment**: There is roughly a 70% probability the cost per hour of subjective runtime for the first emulated human brain (or an equivalent system within one year) will be between **$1,000 and $100,000** (2019 USD), with a 20% chance it will be lower due to rapid subsequent hardware improvements, and a 10% chance it will be substantially higher due to unexpectedly high simulation requirements or lack of immediate hardware advances.

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- **Simulation Model Fidelity**: The biggest uncertainty is the required simulation detail for functional equivalence, which could shift requirements (and costs) by many orders of magnitude[1].
- **Hardware Price Volatility**: Supercomputer pricing can fluctuate based on supply, demand, and technological discontinuities.
- **Unknowns in Scan/Interpret/Simulate Pipeline**: The cost and speed of data acquisition and interpretation may limit throughput and scalability, especially in the first year[1][5].
- **Assumption of 2019 Hardware Cost Trends**: The forecast assumes hardware cost trends continue; disruptive technology could accelerate or slow progress.
