### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Multiple Soviet Venera landers entered and survived Venus's atmosphere in the 1970s–1980s, but no new missions have entered since then[1][2].
- Mars receives far more robotic missions, while Venus has been largely neglected, with only orbiters and flybys in recent decades[1][5].
- The atmospheric and surface conditions on Venus are extremely hostile—surface temperatures near 467°C and pressures of 93 bar—making mission design more complex and expensive than for Mars[2][1].

### Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Metric

- As of 2018, the most concrete proposal was the Russian–U.S. joint Venera-D mission, with an “aggressive” timeline suggesting a possible launch in 2025–2026, though with significant uncertainty about schedule and funding[1].
- NASA had under study concepts like DAVINCI, targeting Venus atmospheric entry and descent, but no firm mission selection or funding commitment had been made by 2018[3].
- There was no evidence of any other nation or agency planning a Venus atmospheric entry mission before 2030 as of March 2018.

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- NASA and ESA mission announcements and press releases.
- Roscosmos public statements about Venera-D.
- Peer-reviewed scientific literature tracking planetary mission launches.
- Wikipedia’s “List of missions to Venus” and “Atmosphere of Venus” as aggregated, up-to-date reference lists[2][5].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- Planetary mission schedules are subject to frequent delays due to technical, funding, or policy issues.
- The selection and funding of Venus atmospheric entry missions are highly competitive and uncertain.
- Reliable verification depends on the public documentation of mission launches and objectives by recognized space agencies.

### Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the historical neglect of Venus, the technical challenges, and the lack of fully committed missions as of 2018, but noting ongoing proposals and studies (particularly Venera-D and NASA’s DAVINCI), the probability of a human-made spacecraft entering the Venusian atmosphere before January 1, 2030 is:

- **Estimated probability (as of 2018): 60%**  
This reflects a moderate likelihood—a significant chance that at least one mission will proceed, but with considerable risk of delay beyond 2030.

> A major Venus atmospheric entry mission could launch in the late 2020s if current proposals are selected and funded, but historical delays in planetary programs mean the outcome is far from certain.
