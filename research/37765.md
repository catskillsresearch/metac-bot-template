## Historical Trends & Current Status

- April 2025 personal saving: $1.12 trillion ($1,120 billion)
- April 2025 personal saving rate: 4.9% (up from 4.3% in March)
- Disposable personal income (DPI) grew 0.8% in April 2025[2][4]
- Long-term average saving rate: 8.4%, but recent years have seen rates between 3â€“5%[5]

## Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- No major fiscal or monetary policy changes reported for May 2025.
- Recent data show a slight acceleration in saving rates and DPI into April 2025, but projections suggest potential moderation in saving rate as consumer spending may pick up in late spring and summer[5].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- US Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) Personal Income & Outlays release (scheduled June 27, 2025)[4]
- BEA Personal Saving Rate data[1]
- Trading Economics: US Personal Savings Rate[5]

## Limitations & Uncertainties

- BEA figures are preliminary and subject to later revision, but the resolution is based on the initial release.
- Volatility in saving can result from shifts in tax timing, government transfers, or sudden changes in consumer sentiment.
- Forecasts are sensitive to small changes in income or outlays, especially when rates are low by historical standards.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the strong April figure and lack of disruptive news, the most likely May 2025 personal saving amount reported by the BEA will be modestly lower than April, reflecting possible normalization in saving behavior:

> The BEA is most likely to report a personal saving amount for May 2025 between $1,070 billion and $1,120 billion, with the highest probability around $1,100 billion.
