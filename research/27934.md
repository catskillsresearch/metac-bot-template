### Key Factual Information for Forecasting China's August 2024 Youth Unemployment Rate

**1. Latest Official Data and Trends**
- In July 2024, China's youth unemployment rate (ages 16â€“24, excluding students) climbed to 17.1%, the highest since the new record-keeping system began in December 2023[1].
- This marked the first increase since February 2024, suggesting renewed upward pressure on youth unemployment[1][2].
- The rate was 14.9% in December 2023, after a methodological change that excluded students from the calculation[3].

**2. Historical Context**
- Under the previous methodology (including students), the youth unemployment rate peaked at 21.3% in June 2023[3][4].
- The new methodology, introduced in December 2023, generally yields lower rates but still reflects significant labor market stress for young people[3][4].

**3. Economic and Policy Environment**
- The labor market remains under pressure, with slow job creation and a surge of nearly 12 million new graduates in 2024 exacerbating job scarcity[2][3].
- The Chinese government is intensifying support for the property sector and other stimulus measures, but these have not yet led to a significant improvement in youth employment[2].
- Structural challenges, such as skills mismatches and regulatory burdens in key industries, continue to hinder youth employment growth[3].

**4. Measurement and Data Limitations**
- The current rate excludes students, focusing only on non-student youth actively seeking work, which makes direct comparison with earlier data difficult[3].
- The rate is reported monthly by the National Bureau of Statistics of China and disseminated by sources like Trading Economics[1].

**5. Authoritative Sources for Verification**
- National Bureau of Statistics of China (NBS) official releases
- Trading Economics (for timely data aggregation)
- Conference Board and Statista for economic context and labor market analysis[1][2][4]

**6. Uncertainties and Limitations**
- The rate is sensitive to policy changes, macroeconomic shocks, and seasonal factors (e.g., graduation season).
- The exclusion of students may understate the broader employment challenges faced by the youth cohort.

### Summary Forecast

Given the July 2024 rate of 17.1%, the recent upward trend, and persistent economic headwinds, it is most likely that China's youth unemployment rate for August 2024 will remain greater than 17.0% and less than or equal to 18.0%, unless there is a sudden, significant policy intervention or unexpected economic improvement[1][2][3].
