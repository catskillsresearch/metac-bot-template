### Key Factual Information Relevant to Forecast

- **Current Status**: As of February 26, 2025, the US military's climate resilience portal (climate.mil) was confirmed to be down for everyone, according to "Is It Down Right Now?" No subsequent updates indicate the site has come back online.
- **Historical Trends**: The Trump administration has a documented pattern of removing or suppressing climate-related content from federal websites. The Guardian reports that scientists are bracing for further removals, and there is no indication of a reversal in this policy environment as of early March 2025[1].
- **Recent Announcements/Policies**: There are no public statements, press releases, or policy changes reported in the available sources that suggest climate.mil will be restored in the near future. The prevailing trend is continued removal of climate information from federal resources[1].
- **Verification Source**: The status of climate.mil will be determined by "Is It Down Right Now?" as specified in the resolution criteria.
- **Limitations/Uncertainties**: While it is technically possible for the site to be restored without advance notice, there is no evidence as of March 7, 2025, to suggest this is likely. The measurement is binary and will be resolved by an external, independent uptime checker.

### Conclusion

Based on all available information as of March 7, 2025, there is no factual basis to expect that the US military's climate resilience portal (climate.mil) will be back online by April 1, 2025. The historical and current policy environment suggests continued suppression of such resources, and no technical or administrative developments have been reported that would indicate a change in this status[1].
