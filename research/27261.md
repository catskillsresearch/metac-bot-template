# Geomagnetic Storm Forecast Analysis: August 21 - September 11, 2024

Based on available data as of August 19, 2024, I'll provide an analysis of factors relevant to predicting whether a geomagnetic storm with a K-index between 6 and 8 will occur during the specified timeframe.

## Recent Geomagnetic Activity

The most significant recent geomagnetic event was a Severe (G4) geomagnetic storm observed on August 12, 2024, at approximately 1442 UTC, triggered by a coronal mass ejection (CME) passing Earth[2]. This severe geomagnetic storm created aurora displays visible as far south as the Midwest in the United States[5].

Space weather activity leading up to this event included:

- At least five solar flares with associated CMEs observed since August 10, 2024[3][5]
- Geomagnetic storm conditions that intensified throughout the weekend into early Monday (August 12)[5]
- Storm conditions that persisted through Monday evening[2][5]
- Moderate geomagnetic storming observed through Tuesday morning (August 13), when the Geomagnetic Storm alert expired[5]

## Understanding K-index and Storm Classification

The K-index (Kp) measures fluctuations in Earth's magnetic field on a scale from 0 to 9. The NOAA Space Weather Scales classify geomagnetic storms based on Kp values:

- G1 (Minor): Kp = 5
- G2 (Moderate): Kp = 6
- G3 (Strong): Kp = 7
- G4 (Severe): Kp = 8
- G5 (Extreme): Kp = 9

The August 12, 2024 event reached G4 (Severe) level, which corresponds to a Kp value of 8. This indicates that geomagnetic storms of the magnitude specified in the question (Kp > 6 and â‰¤ 8) have occurred very recently.

## Factors Affecting Future Geomagnetic Activity

Several factors are relevant when considering the likelihood of significant geomagnetic activity between August 21 and September 11, 2024:

1. **Solar Cycle Progression**: We are currently in Solar Cycle 25, which has been showing stronger activity than initially predicted, with increased sunspot numbers and solar flares.

2. **Recent Pattern of Activity**: The occurrence of a G4 storm in August 2024 demonstrates that the sun is currently capable of producing the level of activity necessary to generate storms within the specified Kp range.

3. **Sunspot Region Rotation**: The question mentions AR3697 (previously AR3664), which has already produced significant activity. The sun's approximately 27-day rotation period means active regions can return to face Earth, potentially producing additional geomagnetic events.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several important limitations affect our ability to forecast geomagnetic storms:

1. **Prediction Timeframe**: Accurate geomagnetic storm predictions are typically limited to 1-3 days in advance, making forecasts for the August 21-September 11 period inherently uncertain.

2. **Solar Unpredictability**: Solar flares and CMEs can occur with limited warning, and their Earth-directed potential cannot always be accurately predicted.

3. **Data Availability**: The search results provide information about geomagnetic activity through mid-August 2024, but do not include specific forecasts for the August 21-September 11 timeframe.

4. **CME Impact Uncertainty**: Even when a CME is detected, there remains uncertainty about whether it will directly impact Earth and how strong the resulting geomagnetic disturbance might be.

## Verification Sources

For real-time and historical data on geomagnetic activity during the specified period, the following authoritative sources can be consulted:

1. The German Research Center for Geosciences' running 30-day history data product, which provides official Kp index values.

2. NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC), which is the official source for space weather forecasts, watches, warnings, and alerts[3].

3. Online resources that track geomagnetic storms, such as those providing current information about the state of Earth's magnetosphere and solar activity[1].
