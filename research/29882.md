### 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The longest-lived laboratory mouse on record was a growth hormone receptor knockout mouse that lived to approximately 1,800 days (about 4.9 years)[3].
- Standard laboratory strains (e.g., B6) typically have maximum lifespans of 1,200 days (3.3 years), with rare individuals reaching up to 36.6 months (about 1,100 days)[3].
- Diversity Outbred (DO) mice have shown more variability, with the longest-lived reaching 53.9 months (about 1,638 days)[3].
- Recent studies have reported some mice living as long as 43 months (about 1,300 days), but this is still far short of 2,500 days[5].

### 2. Recent Announcements and Policies

- Guinness World Records recognized "Pat the mouse" and "Patrick Stewart" as the oldest living mice in recent years, but neither reached anywhere near 2,500 days[1][2].
- No credible scientific or media reports have documented a laboratory mouse (*Mus musculus*) living to 2,500 days as of November 2024[1][2][3][5].

### 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Guinness World Records and the AnAge database are the primary sources for longevity records in mice[1][2].
- Peer-reviewed studies in journals and major scientific news outlets (e.g., Medical Xpress, PubMed Central) provide up-to-date lifespan data for laboratory mice[3][5].

### 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- There is always a possibility of unpublished or ongoing experiments, but a mouse living to 2,500 days would be a major scientific breakthrough and likely widely reported.
- Some confusion exists in media reports regarding the ages of record-holding rodents, but no verified *Mus musculus* has approached 2,500 days[1][2].

### Conclusion

Based on all available factual information as of November 11, 2024, there is no credible evidence or record of a laboratory mouse (*Mus musculus*) living for 2,500 days. The maximum verified lifespan remains well below this threshold, and no major breakthroughs have been reported that would make such a lifespan plausible before January 1, 2025.
