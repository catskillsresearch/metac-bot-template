## 1. Historical Trends and Current Status

- The writ of habeas corpus has only been suspended four times in U.S. history, each time during severe crises (such as the Civil War) and only with Congressional approval, or ratification after the fact. No previous suspension has targeted a specific group, such as unauthorized immigrants, nor been done solely by executive action[1][2].
- As of June 2025, the Trump administration has repeatedly and publicly discussed the possibility of suspending habeas corpus as a tool for mass deportations. Senior advisor Stephen Miller has confirmed the administration is "actively looking at" this option[1][2][3].

## 2. Recent Announcements and Policies

- In May 2025, Stephen Miller and Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem both publicly raised the prospect of suspending habeas corpus, citing an "invasion" at the border as justification under the Constitution[1][2].
- The administration has invoked the 1798 Alien Enemies Act (AEA) to expedite deportations, but the Supreme Court has blocked the use of the AEA in this manner, emphasizing the continued necessity of notice and the opportunity to challenge detention via habeas corpus[2][3].
- Legal experts note that only Congress has the authority to suspend the writ, and there is no indication of imminent Congressional support. Republican senators have downplayed the likelihood that Congress would consider such a move[2].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Official actions would be announced via executive orders, DOJ memoranda, or presidential proclamations, and would be widely covered by credible news and legal sources[1][2].
- Supreme Court decisions and Congressional records remain the definitive sources for any formal change in habeas corpus status[2][3].

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- While the administration is testing the boundaries of executive power, actual suspension would require a formal announcement with legal force, which has historically needed Congressional involvement[1][2].
- The strong judicial stance on due process and habeas corpus, combined with Congressional reluctance, limits the likelihood of a successful, legally durable suspension.
- However, the risk of an attempted or partial suspension (e.g., for specific groups or regions) is higher now than in previous decades, given the administration's rhetoric and willingness to push legal boundaries[1][2][3].

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the above, the probability of an official, announced suspension of habeas corpus by the Trump administration before January 20, 2029, is **non-negligible but remains low**—likely in the range of 5–15%. This is higher than in most recent administrations, due to explicit consideration and public statements, but still faces substantial legal, legislative, and political barriers.
