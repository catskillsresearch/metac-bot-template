### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The FBI’s National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) recorded its all-time monthly high in January 2021, with over 4.3 million background checks[1].
- After the 2020-2021 surge, monthly NICS checks trended downward but remained elevated compared to pre-pandemic years[1][4].
- In 2023, the total number of background checks was lower than the pandemic peak, but still historically high, with certain states like Illinois registering nearly 4 million checks for the year[2].
- Starting in July 2024, monthly NICS checks began trending upward year-over-year, indicating renewed but moderate growth in demand, before a 2.2% YoY decline in November 2024.

### Recent Announcements and Policies

- The FBI’s FY 2025 budget request includes additional funding to address an increased volume of firearms background checks, reflecting expectations of continued high activity[5].
- State-level legal changes, such as North Carolina’s removal of a pistol purchase permit requirement in 2023, have caused localized spikes in checks, but these effects are not nationwide[4].

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The definitive source for monthly NICS background check data is the FBI’s official NICS Firearm Checks report, available on the FBI website[2].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- NICS background checks are not a direct measure of firearm sales, as one check can cover multiple firearms, and some checks are for permits or other purposes[1][2][4].
- Monthly numbers can be influenced by seasonality, political events, and reporting delays.
- The most recent January data (2024) is not provided in the available sources, so precise forecasting for January 2025 must rely on trend extrapolation.

### Forecast

Given the downward trend since the 2020-2021 peak, the moderate upward movement in mid-2024, and the slight YoY decline in November 2024, it is reasonable to forecast that January 2025 NICS background checks will likely fall within the range of 1.8 million to 3 million, as specified in the question. The most probable figure is expected to be closer to the lower end of this range, likely between 2.0 and 2.5 million, reflecting elevated but not record-breaking demand.
