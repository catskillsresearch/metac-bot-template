### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The 2019 adaptation of The Lion King opened to $191 million domestically, ranking among the top 10 opening weekends of all time. However, Mufasa: The Lion King, as a prequel, is widely expected to see lower—though still strong—returns, with analysts predicting it will not match the 2019 film’s performance but should remain a major box office draw[2][4].
- Sonic the Hedgehog opened to $58 million domestically, and Sonic the Hedgehog 2 improved to $72 million. The franchise has shown growth and benefits from a loyal fanbase, with the third installment expected to continue this trend[2].
- Both films are scheduled for release on December 20, 2024, targeting the lucrative holiday family market[2][4].

### Recent Announcements and Box Office Tracking

- As of mid-November 2024, box office tracking and forecasts indicate that Mufasa: The Lion King holds a slight advantage for opening weekend, attributed to Disney’s strong brand and positive social media buzz from recent trailers[4].
- Sonic the Hedgehog 3 is not far behind in pre-release metrics, with tracking ranges for its opening weekend estimated between $53 million and $62 million[4]. Mufasa is expected to perform similarly or slightly better, but the race is described as “very close on either side”[4].
- No significant policy changes or new announcements have altered the competitive landscape for either film as of the cutoff date.

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Box Office Mojo is the primary source for domestic box office figures, defining “domestic” as the U.S., Canada, and Puerto Rico, and counting only theatrical box office revenue[1].
- Industry tracking sites and box office analysts provide pre-release forecasts, but these are subject to change and are not guarantees[4].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- Box office tracking is inherently uncertain and can be influenced by last-minute marketing, critical reception, weather, and other unpredictable factors[4].
- Both films are targeting similar audiences and release dates, increasing the potential for a close outcome.
- Final figures will be determined by Box Office Mojo’s reported opening weekend grosses, which may be updated after the initial weekend estimates[1].

### Summary

Based on all available information as of November 22, 2024, Mufasa: The Lion King is slightly favored to exceed Sonic the Hedgehog 3 in domestic opening weekend box office revenue, but the outcome is expected to be very close, with both films tracking in a similar range. There is no overwhelming consensus, and the result could plausibly go either way depending on final audience turnout[4].
