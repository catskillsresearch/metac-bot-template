### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Historically, Israel and Iran have avoided large-scale direct military confrontations, with most hostilities involving proxies or covert actions—resulting in relatively low direct death tolls between the two states[3].
- In 2024, incidents like the Israeli airstrike on the Iranian consulate in Damascus and Iran’s retaliatory missile strikes showed willingness for direct action, but the resulting deaths from these events did not approach the 1,000 threshold[3].

### Recent Announcements and Policies

- As of May 2025, credible intelligence and media reports indicate Israel is actively preparing for a potential strike on Iranian nuclear facilities, with the risk of such an event “increased substantially” in recent months[1][5].
- The outcome of US-Iran nuclear negotiations is a pivotal variable—failure could precipitate direct Israeli action and a wider conflict[1][3].
- Both Israeli and Iranian leadership are described as risk-averse and influenced by international pressure, particularly from the US, the Gulf, and Europe, to avoid full-scale war[3].

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Institute for the Study of War, TIME, and multiple mainstream news outlets have documented the rising risk of a direct Israel-Iran confrontation in 2025 but emphasize that the most probable scenario is continued brinkmanship and indirect confrontation rather than outright war resulting in massive fatalities[1][3].
- US military posturing (such as positioning B-2 bombers at Diego Garcia) underscores the seriousness of the threat but may serve mainly as deterrence[4].

### Limitations and Uncertainties in Measurement

- Escalation risks remain high: a collapse in diplomatic talks or miscalculation could rapidly lead to conflict with high casualties.
- Accurate attribution of deaths as directly caused by Israel-Iran military confrontation (excluding proxy actions) may be challenging in practice.
- The situation is dynamic and subject to rapid change depending on political decisions or unforeseen events.

### Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

- The probability of at least 1,000 deaths from direct Israel-Iran conflict in 2025 is higher than in previous years, reflecting increased tensions and preparations for potential strikes[1][5].
- However, the most likely scenario remains continued indirect confrontation or limited direct strikes, with both sides likely to avoid a sustained, high-casualty war[3].
- The chance of exceeding the 1,000-death threshold is below 50% but meaningfully elevated (e.g., in the 10–30% range), conditional on no abrupt escalation or breakdown in diplomacy.
