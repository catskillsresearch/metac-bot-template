# Forecasting Taiwan's Allied Military Support in a China Conflict Scenario

As of September 16, 2021, several key factors would influence the likelihood of Taiwan receiving direct military support from allied nations in the event of a conflict with China resulting in over 100 deaths before 2050.

## Current Strategic Landscape

The question of whether allied nations would militarily support Taiwan in a conflict with China involves complex geopolitical considerations. As of 2021, Taiwan maintains informal but substantial defense relationships with several countries, particularly the United States, which has historically been Taiwan's primary security partner.

### U.S.-Taiwan Relations

The United States maintains a policy of "strategic ambiguity" regarding Taiwan's defense, deliberately avoiding explicit commitments to military intervention while maintaining strong unofficial ties. This approach is codified in the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979, which commits the U.S. to provide Taiwan with defensive arms but does not explicitly guarantee military intervention.

Key considerations include:

- The U.S. has consistently sold advanced weapons systems to Taiwan, including a $1.8 billion arms package approved in October 2020
- U.S. naval vessels regularly conduct freedom of navigation operations in the Taiwan Strait
- Official U.S. policy acknowledges the PRC position that Taiwan is part of China (the "One China Policy") while maintaining unofficial relations with Taiwan

### Other Potential Allied Support

Japan, Australia, and other Indo-Pacific democracies have increasingly signaled concern about China's assertiveness toward Taiwan:

- Japan's 2021 Defense White Paper explicitly mentioned the importance of Taiwan's security for the first time
- The Australia-U.S.-Japan Trilateral Strategic Dialogue has increasingly emphasized regional security concerns related to China
- The Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad) between the U.S., Japan, Australia, and India has been revitalized, though without explicit commitments regarding Taiwan

## Factors Affecting Likelihood of Military Support

### Military Capabilities and Readiness

China's military modernization has accelerated, potentially creating a narrowing window for effective allied intervention:

- The PLA Navy has undergone significant expansion and modernization
- China's anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) capabilities have improved, potentially complicating allied intervention
- Taiwan's own defense capabilities, while improving, would likely be overwhelmed without external support in a full-scale invasion scenario

### Political Will and Domestic Considerations

The willingness of allied nations to engage militarily would be influenced by:

- Domestic political support for military intervention
- Economic relationships with China
- Assessment of broader strategic implications
- The specific circumstances of the conflict initiation

### International Law and Legitimacy

The nature of the conflict and international perception would influence support:

- Whether China's actions are viewed as clear aggression
- Taiwan's international standing (despite limited formal diplomatic recognition)
- United Nations positions and potential resolutions

## Precedents and Indicators

Historical precedents provide limited guidance:

- No direct military confrontation has occurred between China and Taiwan's potential allies over Taiwan
- The U.S. deployed carrier battle groups to the Taiwan Strait during the 1995-1996 Taiwan Strait Crisis
- Allied responses to other regional crises (South China Sea disputes, Hong Kong's autonomy) have generally been limited to diplomatic and economic measures

## Assessment and Forecast

Based on information available as of September 2021, several scenarios could unfold if a China-Taiwan conflict with over 100 deaths occurs before 2050:

1. **Limited Allied Response**: Diplomatic condemnation, economic sanctions, and increased arms sales to Taiwan, but no direct military intervention

2. **Naval Support Operations**: Allied naval forces could establish a presence to deter further escalation, possibly including enforcement of no-fly zones or maritime security operations

3. **Direct Military Intervention**: The most escalatory scenario, involving allied forces directly engaging Chinese military assets

The likelihood of scenario #3 (which would satisfy the resolution criteria) would depend heavily on:

- The nature and scale of China's actions
- The international political climate at the time
- The strategic calculations of allied leaders
- The military balance of power when the conflict occurs

Given the strategic ambiguity maintained by the U.S. and other potential allies, combined with the significant costs and risks of direct military confrontation with China, the probability of direct military support meeting the resolution criteria appears moderate but uncertain.
