### Key Factual Information as of February 6, 2025

- **Debt Ceiling Status**: The US debt ceiling was reinstated at $36.1 trillion on January 2, 2025, after a suspension that began in June 2023. The Treasury began using extraordinary measures and cash on hand to avoid default starting January 17, 2025[1][2].
- **Extraordinary Measures Timeline**: Treasury's extraordinary measures and cash reserves are projected to last at least through March 14, 2025, possibly longer, depending on tax receipts and government outlays. The Bipartisan Policy Center and other analysts suggest the "X Date"—when the government would be at risk of default—will likely fall after tax season, with some estimates placing it as early as June 2025, but more likely later in the year[1][4].
- **Legislative Activity**: As of February 6, 2025, there is no enacted law raising or suspending the debt ceiling. There is no public reporting of a bipartisan agreement or imminent legislative action to address the debt ceiling before March 17, 2025[1][3][4].
- **Political Dynamics**: The Republican-controlled House is divided, and any agreement to raise or suspend the debt ceiling is expected to involve significant negotiation, likely including spending cuts or other fiscal concessions. Previous debt ceiling episodes have involved brinkmanship and last-minute deals, but these typically occur closer to the projected X Date[3].
- **Historical Precedent**: In recent years, Congress has tended to act only as the X Date approaches and the risk of default becomes imminent. In 2023, extraordinary measures lasted several months, and the debt ceiling was suspended only after extended negotiations[1][4].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- The exact duration of extraordinary measures depends on unpredictable factors such as tax receipts, disaster relief outlays, and other cash flow variables. Unexpected shortfalls or emergencies could accelerate the X Date, but as of February 6, 2025, no such developments have been reported[1][4].
- Political negotiations can move quickly if market pressure or public concern rises, but there is no current evidence of imminent legislative action before March 17, 2025[1][3][4].

### Authoritative Sources

- Bipartisan Policy Center, EPIC, and The Conference Board provide ongoing analysis and projections regarding the debt ceiling timeline and political dynamics[1][3][4].

### Conclusion

Based on all available information as of February 6, 2025, there is no evidence that the US debt ceiling will be raised or suspended before March 17, 2025. Extraordinary measures are expected to last at least until mid-March, and the X Date is projected to occur after that. No law addressing the debt ceiling has been enacted, and there is no public reporting of imminent legislative action before the specified date.
