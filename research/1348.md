## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Past spacecraft (Voyager, Galileo, Hubble) provided compelling evidence of Europa’s subsurface ocean and potential habitability, fueling scientific interest in a dedicated mission[2][4].
- As of August 2018, NASA’s Europa Clipper was the most advanced mission in planning, targeting multiple close flybys of Europa in the 2020s, not a landing[2][4][5].
- The European Space Agency’s JUICE mission, launching in 2022, was also designed for flybys of Europa (two planned), with its primary target being Ganymede[2].

## 2. Recent Announcements and Policies (as of 2018)

- Europa Clipper was proceeding through design and early construction with formal approval and funding for a flyby/orbiter. Its launch was targeted for the mid-2020s, with arrival at Jupiter in 2030[2][4][5].
- There was significant scientific and public interest in a Europa lander, and NASA had conducted preliminary studies, but no Europa lander mission had been formally selected, funded, or scheduled for launch by 2030 as of August 2018.
- The technical challenges cited included the need for radiation-hardened lander systems, precision landing on a hazardous icy surface, planetary protection protocols, and the high cost relative to orbiters or flybys[4][5].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- NASA’s official Europa Clipper mission page and updates
- ESA’s JUICE mission documentation
- The Planetary Society and peer-reviewed literature on planetary mission planning and funding

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- Announcements or funding commitments after August 2018 could not be incorporated in this assessment.
- Major technological or policy breakthroughs could accelerate a lander mission, but such developments were not evident as of the reference date.
- Space program delays are common, especially for complex outer solar system targets; even approved missions frequently slip by years.

## Probabilistic Assessment

### Reference Cases
- **Europa Clipper** (launched 2024): Focused on flybys. No lander component[2][4][5].
- **JUICE** (launched 2023): Only flybys of Europa[4].
- **Historical trend**: Decadal timescales between mission concept, funding, and launch for outer solar system landers, with even longer for new technologies or high-cost projects.

### Key Differences Affecting the Forecast
- No Europa lander was approved, funded, or scheduled for launch by 2030 as of August 2018.
- Existing missions (Europa Clipper, JUICE) are not landers.
- The technical, budgetary, and programmatic barriers for a lander are much higher than for orbiters or flybys.

### Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given these factors, the probability that a mission to land a spacecraft on Europa would launch by December 31, 2029 was **very low** as of August 2018—likely under 10%. The most probable scenario was that only flyby/orbiter missions would launch before 2030, with any lander mission remaining at the proposal or early study phase for years to come.

> **Forecast:**  
> It is highly unlikely that a mission to land a spacecraft on Europa will launch by 2030 based on the factual situation as of August 2018.
