### Key Factual Information for Forecasting

**1. Historical Trends and Current Status**
- The frequency and scale of Chinese ADIZ violations have increased substantially since 2021. Monthly averages rose from 81 in 2021 to 178 in recent months, with notable spikes during periods of heightened tension[2].
- After President Lai Ching-te's inauguration on May 20, 2024, daily averages jumped: 2 per day before the January 2024 election, 6 per day before the inauguration, and 10 per day in the 30 days after[3].
- The highest daily total on record is 56 aircraft (July 10, 2024), matching a previous record from October 4, 2021[4].
- June 2024 saw 325 violations (second-highest monthly total ever), and May had 289 (third-highest)[4]. The record remains August 2022 (446), which followed a major geopolitical event[4].
- Large spikes (over 50 aircraft in a day) have historically been associated with major PLA exercises or as a reaction to political developments, such as high-profile visits or new policies[5].

**2. Recent Announcements and Policies**
- There is no public announcement of a major PLA exercise or political event scheduled between August 15 and September 15, 2024, as of the knowledge cutoff.
- However, the PLA has maintained high operational tempo and coercive pressure since Lai's inauguration, with frequent "punishment" flights and increased rhetoric[3][4].
- The current elevated baseline means that even without a major event, the probability of another >50-aircraft day is higher than in previous years.

**3. Authoritative Sources for Verification**
- The [PLATracker spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qbfYF0VgDBJoFZN5elpZwNTiKZ4nvCUcs5a7oYwm52g/edit?usp=sharing) is the primary source for daily violation counts, specifically the "Total Aircraft Tracked in de facto ADIZ" column on the "Daily Totals" tab.
- Taiwan's Ministry of National Defense (MND) publishes official daily reports, which are used to verify and supplement the tracker[3][4].

**4. Limitations and Uncertainties**
- The timing and scale of PLA actions are subject to political decisions and may not follow predictable patterns.
- Not every period of tension results in a >50-aircraft day; some spikes are reactionary and event-driven[5].
- Reporting excludes aircraft near outlying islands and only counts those entering the de facto ADIZ, possibly undercounting total PLA activity[3][4].

### Summary Table: Recent High-Volume Days

| Date         | Aircraft Count | Context                          |
|--------------|---------------|----------------------------------|
| July 10, 2024| 56            | Joint air-sea training           |
| May 23-24, 2024 | 82 (over 2 days) | "Joint Sword 2024A" exercise |
| August 2022  | 446 (monthly) | Pelosi visit, record spike       |

### Conclusion

- The probability of more than 50 Chinese aircraft violating Taiwan's ADIZ in a single day between August 15 and September 15, 2024, is elevated due to the current high operational tempo and recent precedent for such spikes.
- While not guaranteed, the combination of a higher baseline, recent record-setting days, and the ongoing coercive campaign makes another >50 day plausible in the forecast window.
