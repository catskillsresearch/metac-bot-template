### 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status (as of 2020-01-30)

- Betelgeuse is a red supergiant star nearing the end of its life and is expected to eventually explode as a supernova. However, the timescale for this event is uncertain but generally estimated to be within the next 100,000 years[3].
- In late 2019 and early 2020, Betelgeuse underwent a dramatic dimming, decreasing to about 40% of its usual brightness. This event prompted speculation about an imminent supernova[3][4].
- By February 2020, Betelgeuse had stopped dimming and began to rebrighten. Observations indicated no significant change in its infrared emission, suggesting the dimming was not due to intrinsic stellar changes related to core collapse[3][5].
- The leading scientific explanation for the dimming was the presence of a cloud of circumstellar dust or the appearance of large starspots, not processes immediately preceding a supernova[3][4].
- Betelgeuse’s brightness is known to vary irregularly, and such variability has been observed before without leading to a supernova event[3].

### 2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- Astronomers, including Phil Plait, publicly stated that despite the unusual dimming, Betelgeuse was almost certainly not about to explode, with estimates suggesting a supernova is "probably about 100,000 years" away[3].
- The 2019–2020 dimming episode was thoroughly investigated and ultimately attributed to non-terminal events (dust, starspots), and Betelgeuse returned to normal brightness within months, dispelling immediate concerns about a supernova[4][5].

### 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The Astronomer's Telegram, Wikipedia, and published statements by astronomers (as reported in the sources) provide primary documentation and real-time updates on Betelgeuse’s status[3].
- EarthSky, StarWalk, and detailed analyses by astronomers (e.g., Phil Plait) corroborate the scientific consensus and offer accessible summaries of the situation[2][4].

### 4. Limitations or Uncertainties in Measurement

- The precise timing of a red supergiant’s supernova is inherently uncertain; while models suggest Betelgeuse is near the end of its life, “near” in astrophysical terms can mean tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of years[3][5].
- Astronomers do not expect dramatic visual dimming or dust events to directly precede core collapse; neutrino bursts and other signatures would be needed to confirm an imminent explosion[1].
- Betelgeuse’s irregular variability complicates predictions based solely on lightcurve analysis[3].

### Key Differences Affecting the Forecast

- In historical reference cases for supernovae, rapid and terminal changes in a star’s core, not external dimming events, precede an explosion. Betelgeuse’s dimming was caused by circumstellar dust or surface activity, not by imminent supernova processes[3][4].
- There is no evidence of core collapse or other precursor activity specific to an imminent supernova in Betelgeuse’s recent behavior[3][4].

### Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the above, the consensus as of 2020 was that there was no credible evidence Betelgeuse was about to explode. The probability of Betelgeuse being observed to go supernova before January 1, 2030 is extremely low—on the order of less than 1 in 10,000—consistent with the scientific view that such an event is not expected for at least tens of thousands of years barring unforeseen developments[3][4][5].
