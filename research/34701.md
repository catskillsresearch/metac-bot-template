# Bitcoin Dominance Forecast Analysis: February-March 2025

Based on the available data as of February 8, 2025, I can provide the following analysis regarding Bitcoin dominance and whether it will exceed 63.0% during February or March 2025.

## Current Status and Recent Trends

Bitcoin dominance has already reached a recent peak of 64.3% in early February 2025 before settling around 61%[4]. This represents a significant increase from January 2025, when Bitcoin's dominance was reported to be near 55%[5]. The metric has been on an upward trajectory since December 2024, when it established a bottom below 55%[4].

Historical data shows that Bitcoin dominance steadily declined in April 2024 to below 50%, amid rumors circulating in the cryptocurrency market[2]. However, since then, it has been steadily increasing, with a notable surge of approximately 6% from early December 2024 to early February 2025[4].

## Factors Affecting Bitcoin Dominance

Several factors appear to be contributing to Bitcoin's increasing market dominance:

1. **Investor Sentiment**: As Bitcoin's price remained relatively strong despite broader economic uncertainty, investors have shown preference for Bitcoin over altcoins[4].

2. **Institutional Support**: JPMorgan analysts led by managing director Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou stated in a January 2025 report that they "expect bitcoin's dominance over Ethereum and other alternative tokens to continue this year for several reasons"[5].

3. **Market Dynamics**: The end of what Rekt Capital called a "mini Altcoin Season" in late 2024 has contributed to Bitcoin's strengthening position relative to other cryptocurrencies[4].

## Expert Predictions

Expert opinions on Bitcoin dominance through 2025 are somewhat mixed:

- **JPMorgan**: Their analysts expect Bitcoin's dominance over ether and altcoins to persist through 2025, as stated in a report published on January 16, 2025[5].

- **Rekt Capital**: This popular trader and analyst has warned that altcoins are struggling to hold ground against Bitcoin's increasing dominance, suggesting this trend may continue[4].

- **Benjamin Cowen**: In contrast, Cowen predicted in late 2024 that Bitcoin dominance "will go down" at some point in 2025, though he did not specify exactly when this might occur[3].

## Conclusion

Based on the available data, Bitcoin dominance has already exceeded 63.0% in February 2025, reaching 64.3%[4]. This directly answers the question of whether Bitcoin dominance will exceed 63.0% on any single day in February or March 2025. With Bitcoin dominance currently at elevated levels and multiple analysts projecting continued Bitcoin dominance through 2025, there is strong evidence suggesting that the 63.0% threshold has been and may continue to be exceeded during the specified timeframe.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

It's important to note several limitations in this analysis:

1. Cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile and can change rapidly in response to news, regulatory developments, or market sentiment.

2. Different data sources may calculate Bitcoin dominance slightly differently, potentially leading to variations in reported figures.

3. While Bitcoin dominance has already reached 64.3% according to available data, the sustainability of this level remains uncertain, especially given some conflicting expert opinions about dominance trends later in 2025.
