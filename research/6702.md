## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The legal framework for a Northern Ireland reunification referendum is established by the Good Friday Agreement and the Northern Ireland Act 1998. A referendum (commonly called a "border poll") can only be called by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland if it appears likely that a majority would vote in favor of reunification[1][5].
- Only one border poll has occurred, in 1973. It resulted in a large majority for remaining in the UK, but was boycotted by most nationalists and had only 59% turnout[5].
- As of March 2021, no referendum is scheduled. There is no automatic timetable; the decision is at the discretion of the Secretary of State based on public sentiment[1][5].
- Opinion polling as of early 2021 did not show a sustained majority for reunification in Northern Ireland[3].
- The Good Friday Agreement requires consent "freely and concurrently given" in both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, interpreted as simultaneous referenda if one is called[5].

## 2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- No UK government or Secretary of State for Northern Ireland has announced an intention to hold a border poll as of March 2021[1][5].
- Political debate around reunification has increased, especially post-Brexit, but official policy remains that a poll will only be called when a majority for reunification appears likely[1].
- No significant legislation or policy changes had occurred by March 2021 to alter the process or likelihood of a referendum being called.

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The text of the Good Friday Agreement and the Northern Ireland Act 1998[1][5].
- Academic and governmental analysis, such as from the Institute for Government and UCL Constitution Unit[2][5].
- Ongoing opinion polling tracked on Wikipedia and other news sources[3].

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- The threshold for calling a poll is not precisely defined. It is up to the subjective judgement of the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, based on a range of evidence, including opinion polls and political developments[1][5].
- Public opinion can shift rapidly in response to unforeseen political or economic events.
- The impact of Brexit and future political negotiations could alter the likelihood, but as of March 2021, no such shift had occurred.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the historical rarity of referenda, lack of a clear majority for reunification in opinion polls as of March 2021, and the discretionary power of the Secretary of State, the probability of a Northern Ireland reunification referendum being held before 2030 is low but not zero. Absent major political upheaval or a sustained shift in public opinion, the default scenario is no referendum before 2030â€”though the situation could change if polling shifts or political dynamics evolve.
