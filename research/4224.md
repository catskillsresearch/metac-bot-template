### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The Nobel Prize in Physics is awarded for discoveries that have been experimentally confirmed and recognized as having a profound impact on the field. There is often a substantial delay between initial publication and Nobel recognition, particularly for theoretical work, as the committee typically waits for experimental validation.
- As of April 23, 2020, the Wolfram Physics Project had just been launched. The project proposes a new computational approach to fundamental physics, led by Stephen Wolfram, with Jonathan Gorard and Max Piskunov as co-authors.
- The project is highly speculative and had not, as of that date, produced experimentally confirmed predictions or gained broad acceptance in the physics community.

### Recent Announcements and Policies

- The Wolfram Physics Project was announced in April 2020, with significant attention in the popular press and online, but without peer-reviewed publications or experimental results confirming its predictions.
- The physics community’s initial response was cautious to skeptical, highlighting the absence of testable predictions and peer review.
- No major funding policies, institutional endorsements, or experimental programs had been launched in direct response to the project as of April 2020.

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The Nobel Prize’s official website and press releases are the definitive sources for prize announcements.
- Peer-reviewed journals and citation databases track the scientific impact and acceptance of new theories.
- Statements and reviews from major physics organizations and leading physicists provide context on community acceptance.

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- The project was in its infancy as of April 2020, making it difficult to assess its future impact.
- The Nobel Committee’s decisions are conservative and favor work that has been both theoretically and experimentally validated.
- If the Wolfram Physics Project leads to a dramatic, experimentally confirmed discovery, the probability of Nobel recognition would increase, but such an outcome is highly uncertain and would likely take many years to materialize.

| Precedent for similar recognition       | Rare, only after experimental validation                  |

### Conclusion

As of April 23, 2020, the probability that Stephen Wolfram, Jonathan Gorard, or Max Piskunov will receive the Nobel Prize in Physics before 2036 for work related to the Wolfram Physics Project is low, due to the lack of experimental confirmation, early stage of the project, and the Nobel Committee’s historical conservatism in awarding prizes for unverified theoretical work.
