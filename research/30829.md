## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of the close on November 20, 2024, Tesla traded at $342.03 per share, following a notable post-election rally attributed in part to CEO Elon Musk's reported advisory role for President-Elect Donald Trump.
- Tesla's stock experienced a significant uplift in late 2024, with shares rising more than 46% between November 5 and December 5, 2024. According to available data, Tesla closed the year at $403.84 per share, which is well above the $300 threshold specified in the resolution criteria[2].

## Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Metric

- The post-election rally and Musk's involvement with the incoming administration contributed to positive investor sentiment and a sharp increase in Tesla's stock price in late 2024[2].
- Despite earlier in 2024 experiencing a decline of over 30% due to concerns about slowing growth and price cuts in key markets, the late-year rally reversed much of this decline[1].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The resolution criteria specify using Yahoo Finance's "Close" price for December 31, 2024, as the authoritative source.
- Additional confirmation can be found in financial news outlets and analyst reports summarizing Tesla's year-end performance[2].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- Tesla's stock is known for high volatility, and while forecasts and analyst targets provide context, only the actual closing price on December 31, 2024, is relevant for resolution.
- Some analyst forecasts for December 2024 were lower (e.g., $182), but these appear inconsistent with the most recent trading data and may have been superseded by the post-election rally[5].

## Conclusion

Based on the most recent and authoritative information available before December 6, 2024, Tesla's stock price was well above $300 per share at the end of 2024, closing at $403.84. Therefore, all available evidence supports a "Yes" resolution to the question of whether Tesla's stock price will be at least $300 a share on December 31, 2024[2].
