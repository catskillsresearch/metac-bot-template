## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- **1996–2001:** Pakistan was one of only three countries (alongside Saudi Arabia and the UAE) that formally recognized the previous Taliban regime (Taliban 1.0) in Afghanistan[2].
- **2021–2025:** Following the Taliban’s return to power in August 2021, no country—including Pakistan—has formally recognized the Taliban as the government of Afghanistan (Taliban 2.0), though many countries, including Pakistan, have engaged in informal contacts and pragmatic diplomacy[2][3][5].
- The international community, including the United Nations, has articulated conditions for formal recognition: establishment of an inclusive government, respect for human rights (especially women’s rights), and commitments on counterterrorism[3][5].
- Diplomatic engagement (as opposed to recognition) with the Taliban is increasing and is described as the “new normal” for many countries, including regional players[5].

## 2. Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Forecast

- **Pakistan’s Stance:** As of mid-2023, Pakistan has not formally recognized the Taliban regime, though it continues to maintain pragmatic engagement with Taliban officials, partly for regional security and economic reasons[2][5].
- The Pakistani government has repeatedly called for the international community to engage with the Taliban, but has not moved unilaterally towards recognition, instead aligning with broader international expectations and conditionality.
- No significant shift in Pakistan’s official position or new policy announcements indicating imminent formal recognition have been observed through early 2025[4][5].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- **Brookings Institution**: Analysis of international law and government recognition post-Taliban takeover[1].
- **International Law Journals**: Detailed review of recognition criteria and state conduct regarding the Taliban government[2].
- **Parliamentary and Congressional Briefings**: Document recent developments, regional security concerns, and the status of diplomatic engagement vs. recognition[4][5].

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- **Fluid Security Situation**: The Taliban’s ability to maintain control in Afghanistan is challenged by groups such as Islamic State-Khorasan Province (IS-K), which could influence Pakistan’s calculations[5].
- **International Pressure**: Pakistan faces significant pressure from Western and regional actors to adhere to conditionality, especially on human rights and counterterrorism commitments[5].
- **Distinction Between Engagement and Recognition**: Increased diplomatic engagement does not equate to formal recognition, and Pakistan has so far maintained this distinction[5].
- **Domestic Factors**: Changes in Pakistan’s own domestic politics or security priorities could result in policy shifts not currently forecasted.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

- Given the above, the probability that Pakistan formally recognizes the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan before 2030 remains **significantly lower than it was in the late 1990s**. While informal engagement is robust, formal recognition is closely tied to the Taliban’s compliance with international norms and Pakistan’s alignment with broader international consensus.
- **Conditional Probability Estimate** (as of May 2025): There is a moderate-to-low likelihood (roughly 20–35%) that Pakistan will formally recognize the Taliban regime before 2030, barring a major shift in Taliban policies or international consensus.
