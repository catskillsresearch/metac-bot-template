# Forecasting Analysis: Trump's Attendance at NATO Summit June 2025

Based on the available information as of June 4, 2025, I can provide the following analysis regarding whether Donald Trump will attend the NATO Summit in The Hague in June 2025.

## Current Status

The White House has officially confirmed that US President Donald Trump will attend the NATO summit scheduled for June 24-25, 2025, in The Hague[1][4]. This confirmation was made by Caroline Levitt, spokesperson for the U.S. presidential administration, during a briefing for journalists on June 3, 2025, where she explicitly stated: "I can confirm that he will go to the NATO summit, yes."[2]

Trump had previously informed Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof of his attendance, which the Dutch government had already announced prior to the White House confirmation[1][5].

## Recent Developments

Prior to the official confirmation, there had been uncertainty about Trump's attendance at the summit. The President had previously left it unclear whether he would participate in the conference of the Western military alliance in the Netherlands[1].

Trump had reportedly linked his attendance to a demand that NATO members increase their defense spending from the current 2% of GDP to 5%. According to Der Spiegel, he had threatened that if the other 31 member states did not agree to his proposed standard, he would not travel to The Hague[1]. However, despite this earlier threat, Trump did not follow through and has now confirmed his attendance regardless.

## Key Discussion Topics at the Summit

The NATO summit will focus on the established standard of how much countries should spend on defense as a percentage of their GDP. Currently, this financial commitment is set at 2% of GDP, a target that many countries have not met for years[1].

NATO leaders will debate raising this target during the summit. Trump has been advocating for an increase to 5% of GDP[1].

## Scale and Attendance

The NATO Summit in The Hague is expected to be a major diplomatic event:
- Approximately 45 heads of state and government are expected to attend
- Around 45 foreign ministers and 45 defense ministers will be present
- The combined size of all delegations will be around 6,000 people
- A NATO Public Forum will be held alongside the summit with about 500 attendees
- About 2,000 journalists from around the world will cover the event
- In total, around 8,500 people are expected to participate[3]

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has also received an invitation and plans to attend the summit[2].

## Forecast Assessment

Based on the multiple official confirmations from both the White House and the Dutch government, there is very strong evidence that President Trump will attend the NATO Summit in June 2025. The confirmation comes from authoritative sources including:

1. The White House official announcement on June 3, 2025[1][2]
2. Direct confirmation from White House spokesperson Caroline Levitt[2]
3. Confirmation from Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof[5]
4. Multiple news sources reporting the confirmation[1][2][4][5]

While there was previous uncertainty about Trump's attendance due to his demands regarding NATO defense spending, these concerns appear to have been resolved or set aside, as the President has now firmly committed to attending the summit.

Given the multiple official confirmations from authoritative sources and the proximity of the event (less than three weeks away), the probability that Trump will attend the NATO Summit in June 2025 is extremely high.
