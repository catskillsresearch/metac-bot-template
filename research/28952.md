## Historical Trends and Current Situation

- As of late May 2025, the World Health Organization (WHO) has not designated any new SARS-CoV-2 Variant of Concern (VOC) since Omicron in November 2021. All previously designated VOCs (Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, Omicron) have been de-escalated, and none of the currently circulating variants are classified as VOCs[1][2][3].
- The current landscape includes two Variants Under Monitoring (VUMs): BA.2.86 and JN.1, and seven Variants of Interest (VOIs): JN.1.7, KP.2, KP.3, KP.3.1.1, JN.1.18, LB.1, and XEC[1][3][5].
- The WHO updated its variant classification system in March 2023 to focus on risk-based tracking and escalation. Since then, escalation from VOI or VUM to VOC has not occurred for any new lineage[3][5].

## Key Differences Affecting the Forecast

- The period from late 2021 through mid-2025 has been characterized by relative stability: no variant has exhibited the combination of increased transmissibility, severity, or immune evasion required for VOC classification[1][2][3].
- Enhanced global immunity (from both vaccination and prior infection), as well as improved surveillance protocols, have likely contributed to this stability.
- Unlike the rapid turnover of VOCs observed in 2020–2021, recent years have seen new lineages emerge and be monitored or designated as VOI/VUM, but none have prompted major global concern or system-wide impact[1][2][3][5].
- Global sequencing and surveillance activities, while reduced from pandemic peaks, continue to monitor for significant genetic or epidemiological shifts[1][3].

## Probabilistic Assessment

- Given the absence of any current WHO consideration or warning regarding a candidate VOC, and more than three years since the last VOC designation, the probability that a new VOC will be designated before July 1, 2025, is low.
- However, SARS-CoV-2 remains capable of unpredictable evolution, and reduced genomic surveillance in some regions introduces uncertainty. It is not possible to rule out an unexpected development, but current trends and the available data do not suggest imminent escalation of any known variant to VOC status[1][2][3][5].

**Adjusted Probability:**  
Based on historical trends, current variant statuses, and the absence of warning signals from WHO and ECDC, the likelihood that the WHO will designate a new COVID-19 Variant of Concern before July 1, 2025, is estimated to be low (roughly 5–15%).

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- Surveillance gaps and reporting delays could mean a novel variant is not detected or classified promptly.
- The virus remains unpredictable over longer timeframes, and public health responses, as well as variant characteristics, could change rapidly.
