# Will Serbia Announce a General Election Before April 1, 2025?

Serbia is currently experiencing political turmoil following the resignation of Prime Minister Miloš Vučević on January 28, 2025, amid mass student protests that were triggered by the deadly collapse of a railway station canopy in Novi Sad in November 2024[1][5]. This situation has created uncertainty about whether the country will hold snap parliamentary elections in the coming months.

## Current Political Situation

As of February 20, 2025, the Serbian parliament had not yet met to confirm Prime Minister Vučević's resignation[1]. Once the resignation is confirmed, a 30-day deadline begins for the parliament to elect a new government[1]. If parliament fails to elect a new government within this timeframe, President Aleksandar Vučić would be required to call snap elections[1].

On January 30, 2025, President Vučić announced that the ruling Serbian Progressive Party (SNS) would make a decision within 10 days on whether to call an election or form a new government through the existing parliament[5]. The SNS had not yet put forward a candidate for prime minister at that time[5].

## Factors Influencing the Decision

Several factors are likely to influence whether Serbia will announce general elections before April 1, 2025:

**Arguments against snap elections:**

1. Most political commentators believe that snap elections are currently a less likely option and would not contribute to resolving the ongoing crisis[1].

2. The Serbian opposition is united in refusing possible elections, citing unfair election conditions including media dominance by the ruling party, command over country resources, unresolved issues with the voter registry, and organizational weaknesses of the opposition[1].

3. The ruling SNS has "strongly hinted" that it plans to elect a new government with the majority it still commands in parliament rather than call new elections[1].

4. The current political situation is described as "still too volatile for Vučić's liking," suggesting he may prefer to stabilize the situation before calling elections[1].

5. Student protesters are unlikely to stop their demonstrations even if elections are announced, as new elections or even the resignation of the government are not among their demands[1].

**Arguments for snap elections:**

1. Snap elections might be an attractive option for the ruling SNS since it would still be a favorite to win, owing to its loyal party base and the tilted playing field[1].

2. President Vučić may see snap elections as a way to consolidate power and reaffirm his legitimacy, potentially putting an end to his biggest crisis yet[5].

3. The ruling party has often strategically resorted to snap elections in the past[1].

## Timeline and Procedural Considerations

If the parliament confirms Vučević's resignation (which had not happened as of February 20, 2025), the 30-day deadline would extend into late March 2025[1]. This means that if parliament fails to elect a new government, the announcement of snap elections could occur very close to the April 1, 2025 deadline specified in the question.

## Conclusion

Based on the information available as of February 27, 2025, it appears that the ruling SNS party is leaning toward forming a new government through the existing parliament rather than calling snap elections[1]. However, the situation remains fluid, and President Vučić has explicitly kept the option of snap elections on the table[5]. The timeline for confirming the prime minister's resignation and the subsequent 30-day period for electing a new government means that any announcement about elections would likely come very close to the April 1, 2025 deadline.
