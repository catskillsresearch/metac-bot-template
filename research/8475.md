## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- **Whole Brain Emulation (WBE or "ems")**: As of November 2021, there was no demonstrated instance of whole brain emulation—no human or animal brain had been fully scanned and successfully run as a software emulation. The technical requirements for WBE—including high-resolution brain scanning, synaptic connectivity mapping, and simulation at scale—remain far beyond current capabilities. Expert consensus generally places functional WBE as a possibility for the latter half of the 21st century or later[2][4].

- **Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)**: AGI refers to AI systems capable of performing any intellectual task that a human can. While no AGI yet exists, progress in machine learning and narrow AI has been rapid. Forecasts for AGI arrival vary widely, with some credible estimates suggesting a 5–35% chance of AGI by 2100, and a central estimate around 20% by that date[5]. Many experts expect AGI, if it arrives, to precede successful WBE[2][5].

- **US Labor Force Participation Rate**: In 2021, the US labor force participation rate was around 61%, having declined only gradually over decades. A drop below 10% would represent an unprecedented transformation, likely driven by massive automation or demographic change. The timeline for such a drop is highly uncertain; many forecasts suggest this is likely centuries away absent extreme technological disruption[2].

## 2. Recent Announcements or Policies

As of November 2021, there were no major technological breakthroughs or policy initiatives suggesting an imminent leap in either whole brain emulation or AGI development. Investment and research in AI—especially deep learning—continued to outpace that in brain emulation. There were no significant shifts in the scientific consensus or funding landscape for WBE[2][4].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Metaculus and related forecasting sites document expert and community predictions about AGI timelines, WBE, and related labor market shifts[2][4].
- Academic literature in neuroscience and AI, as well as public commentary from leading figures in each field, support the current assessment that AGI is generally considered more tractable in the near- to medium-term than WBE[2][5].

## 4. Limitations or Uncertainties in Measurement

- **Definitions**: The distinction between "em-like" and "AGI-like" automation is not sharply defined in the bet, and could be subject to interpretation[2].
- **Timelines**: Both AGI and WBE timelines are highly uncertain and subject to unforeseen breakthroughs or societal changes.
- **Resolution timing**: The bet triggers only when US labor force participation drops below 10%, which could be many decades or even centuries away, adding additional uncertainty.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given current trends, expert consensus, and the state of technology as of November 2021:

- The probability that AGI will arrive and become economically dominant before whole brain emulation is generally assessed as much higher than the reverse[2][5].
- The long timeline until the bet's trigger (labor participation under 10%) increases uncertainty, but also gives more time for AGI-like automation to develop and dominate the economy.
- Barring unforeseen breakthroughs in brain emulation technology, it appears substantially more likely that "AGI-like" automation will contribute more to GDP than "em-like" automation at the relevant threshold.

**Therefore, as of November 2021, the probability that Robin Hanson will win the bet (i.e., that ems will be economically dominant before AGI-like automation) appears low—likely below 20%—given the available evidence and expert forecasts[2][5].**
