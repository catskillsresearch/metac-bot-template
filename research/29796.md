# Will Matt Eberflus Cease to be the Chicago Bears Head Coach Before January 1, 2025?

Based on the available information as of November 8, 2024, here is an analysis of whether Matt Eberflus will remain the Chicago Bears head coach through the end of 2024.

## Current Status and Historical Context

Matt Eberflus has faced significant criticism during the 2024 NFL season, particularly following two consecutive disappointing losses - a Hail Mary defeat against Washington and a blowout loss to Arizona[1]. These performances have led to widespread fan dissatisfaction and media speculation about his job security.

The Chicago Bears organization has a notable historical precedent that may influence this situation: they have never fired a head coach during an NFL season[4]. This organizational tradition suggests a preference for stability and reluctance to make mid-season coaching changes.

## Recent Announcements and Reports

The most significant recent report comes from NFL Network's Adam Rank, who stated in early November 2024 that he had spoken with sources close to Bears GM Ryan Poles who indicated that "regardless of what happens at all, Matt Eberflus is coming back regardless" for the remainder of the 2024 season[3]. This suggests that despite poor performance, the Bears' front office may be committed to maintaining continuity through the end of the current season.

Earlier in November 2024, there was speculation that Eberflus might remain the head coach "for at least the next season," despite the team's struggles[1]. However, contradicting this view, other analysts have suggested that while Eberflus might finish the 2024 season, his return in 2025 is highly unlikely[4].

## Authoritative Sources

The most authoritative sources on this matter would be:

1. Official statements from the Chicago Bears organization
2. Reporting from established NFL insiders with connections to the Bears front office
3. The Chicago Bears official website coaching roster

As of early November 2024, NFL Network's Adam Rank has provided the most direct insight into the organization's thinking, citing sources close to GM Ryan Poles[3]. ESPN's Adam Schefter has also weighed in on related matters, discussing potential coaching candidates should the position become available[3].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors create uncertainty in predicting Eberflus' status through the end of 2024:

1. **Team Performance**: Further deterioration in the Bears' performance could potentially override the historical reluctance to make mid-season changes.

2. **Ownership Influence**: The McCaskey family, who owns the Bears, has been characterized as prioritizing stability and organizational reputation over making difficult but necessary changes[4]. This suggests they may allow Eberflus to complete the season regardless of results.

3. **League Trends**: Other NFL teams have already made significant coaching changes during the 2024 season, including the Las Vegas Raiders (fired offensive coordinator) and New Orleans Saints (fired head coach)[4]. These moves could potentially influence the Bears' decision-making.

## Conclusion

Based on the most recent and reliable information available as of November 8, 2024, it appears unlikely that Matt Eberflus will cease to be the Chicago Bears head coach before January 1, 2025. The most authoritative reporting indicates that the Bears' front office intends to retain him through the end of the 2024 season[3], and the organization's historical reluctance to make mid-season coaching changes further supports this conclusion[4]. However, this situation remains fluid and could change if team performance significantly deteriorates further.
