# Forecasting Howard Marks' 2024 Returns vs. Politicians Tracked by Quiver Quantitative

Based on available information as of December 2024, here's an analysis to help forecast whether Howard Marks' 2024 returns will exceed those of politicians tracked by Quiver Quantitative.

## Howard Marks and Oaktree Capital Performance

Howard Marks is the co-chairman of Oaktree Capital Management, a leading global alternative investment management firm. Recent performance data shows that Oaktree Capital Management experienced a -12.15% return in Q4 2024[3]. This negative quarterly performance is a significant data point when considering the full-year outlook.

In October 2024, Marks made a case for increased credit allocations, noting that returns start at roughly 7% on public credit and 10% on private credit, which he considered competitive with historical equity returns[5]. This suggests that while Marks sees opportunity in credit markets, actual performance may have faced challenges in the latter part of 2024.

## Market Context and Investment Strategy

The Federal Reserve reduced interest rates for the first time in over four years in September 2024, which has implications for debt markets[4]. Despite this rate cut, Oaktree experts observed a bifurcating corporate credit market, with some companies likely to struggle with refinancing their debt[4]. This market environment could have affected Marks' portfolio performance in 2024.

At Oaktree's biennial client conference in 2024, various topics were discussed including "the next frontier of private credit, dislocation in India's corporate debt markets, and the potentially once-in-a-generation opportunity in commercial real estate"[1]. These focus areas may indicate where Marks has positioned his investments, potentially affecting his 2024 returns.

## Comparison to Politicians' Trading Performance

Unfortunately, the available information does not provide specific data on the trading performance of the politicians tracked by Quiver Quantitative (Nancy Pelosi, Josh Gottheimer, Donald Beyer, Dan Meuser, Tom Carper, Tina Smith, Shelley Moore Capito, or Sheldon Whitehouse).

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several significant limitations affect this forecast:

1. The available data only shows Oaktree Capital Management's performance for Q4 2024, not the full year.
2. It's unclear whether Howard Marks' personal portfolio performance directly mirrors that of Oaktree Capital Management.
3. No comparative data is available for the politicians' trading performance in 2024.
4. The search results don't provide information about Quiver Quantitative's methodology for tracking returns.

## Conclusion

Based on the limited available information, it's difficult to make a confident forecast about whether Howard Marks' 2024 returns will exceed those of any politicians tracked by Quiver Quantitative. The -12.15% Q4 performance for Oaktree Capital Management suggests challenges in the latter part of the year[3], but without comprehensive data for both Marks and the politicians for the full year, a definitive comparison cannot be made.

For a more accurate forecast, additional data would be needed on:
- Full-year 2024 performance for Howard Marks
- 2024 trading performance for each of the politicians
- Historical comparative performance between Marks and these politicians
- Market trends affecting both Marks' investment strategy and the sectors where politicians have concentrated their investments
