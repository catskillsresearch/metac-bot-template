## Spirit Airlines Bankruptcy Forecast Before January 1, 2025

**Key Historical Trends and Current Status**

- Spirit Airlines has been unprofitable since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, with operating losses persisting through 2024[4][5].
- In Q2 2024, Spirit reported a net loss of $192.9 million, a dramatic increase from a $2.0 million loss in the same period the previous year[5].
- The airline faces rising costs, ongoing union negotiations, and operational disruptions due to a recall of Pratt & Whitney engines, all contributing to heavy cash burn[5].
- As of October 2024, Spirit has $3.3 billion in outstanding debt and is engaged in talks with bondholders to avoid bankruptcy[5].

**Recent Announcements and Policies**

- The proposed merger with JetBlue, which could have provided financial relief, was blocked by a federal court in January 2024 due to antitrust concerns. Both airlines have since abandoned the deal[5].
- Spirit recently extended the deadline to complete debt renegotiations, signaling ongoing financial distress and the need for creditor cooperation to avoid default[5].
- Fitch Ratings downgraded Spirit Airlines to 'CCC' in May 2024, citing heightened risk of default and refinancing challenges. Fitch expects Spirit's financial metrics to remain weak through at least 2025[1][2].

**Authoritative Sources for Verification**

- Fitch Ratings and Macroaxis both highlight a very high risk of bankruptcy, with Macroaxis estimating Spirit's probability of distress at over 80% based on financial models and recent filings[1][2][3].
- News outlets and financial analysts consistently report that Spirit is in active negotiations with creditors to stave off bankruptcy, but as of October 22, 2024, no bankruptcy petition has been filed[5].

**Limitations and Uncertainties**

- While all indicators point to severe financial distress and a high risk of bankruptcy, the actual timing of a filing depends on the outcome of ongoing negotiations with bondholders and any potential last-minute financing or restructuring deals.
- Quantitative models (e.g., Altman Z-Score) provide probabilistic, not deterministic, forecasts and may not account for all off-balance-sheet arrangements or emergency interventions[3].
- No public record exists of a bankruptcy filing by Spirit Airlines as of October 22, 2024.

## Summary

Spirit Airlines faces extreme financial distress, with mounting losses, heavy debt, and a failed merger removing a key lifeline. Credit ratings and quantitative models indicate a high probability of bankruptcy, and the company is actively negotiating with creditors to avoid default. However, as of October 22, 2024, Spirit Airlines has not filed for bankruptcy, and the precise likelihood of a filing before January 1, 2025, remains uncertain and contingent on the outcome of ongoing negotiations.
