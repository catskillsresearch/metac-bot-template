## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Turkey and Afghanistan have shared diplomatic relations since 1921, with Turkey being one of the first countries to establish an embassy in Kabul after Afghanistan’s independence[1][3][4].
- The relationship historically included strong symbolic gestures of friendship and cooperation, such as joint celebrations of diplomatic anniversaries as recently as March 2021[3].
- Turkey maintained a non-combat role in Afghanistan during the NATO mission, focusing on operational and humanitarian support, and deliberately avoided direct conflict with the Afghan population, including the Taliban[2].

## 2. Recent Announcements and Policies

- After the Taliban takeover in August 2021, Turkey withdrew its troops ahead of the deadline and expressed interest in maintaining a role at Kabul airport, signaling a willingness to engage pragmatically with the new authorities[2].
- However, as of May 2024, Turkey suspended its visa exemption agreement for diplomatic passport holders from Afghanistan, which affects Taliban officials and suggests a cooling or at least a formal distancing of diplomatic engagement[5].
- Turkish authorities have not formally recognized the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan as the legitimate government, and Turkey's recent actions (such as the suspension of visa privileges) indicate caution, especially in the context of irregular migration and international scrutiny[5].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs official statements and press releases[1][3].
- International media coverage on Turkey’s diplomatic and security policy in Afghanistan[2][5].
- Regional analysis from think tanks and academic sources on Turkey’s historical and current Afghanistan policy[4].

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- Recognition of governments, particularly those formed by force or not widely accepted internationally, is influenced by many unpredictable factors, including changes in the Taliban’s conduct, international pressure, Turkish domestic politics, and broader geopolitical shifts.
- Turkey has historically balanced pragmatic engagement with international obligations (e.g., as a NATO member and EU candidate), which may constrain formal recognition of an unrecognized regime.
- Recent cooling in diplomatic privileges does not preclude future recognition if the Taliban government undergoes substantive changes or gains broader international acceptance.

## 5. Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

- Compared to reference cases (e.g., Turkish recognition of controversial regimes), the current pattern suggests that Turkey is likely to maintain engagement short of formal recognition.
- The suspension of diplomatic visa agreements and lack of formal recognition as of mid-2025 signal a low probability of Turkey moving to official recognition in the immediate future[5].
- However, Turkey’s pragmatic foreign policy leaves open the possibility of a policy change if international dynamics shift.

**Assessment:**  
As of May 2025, the probability that Turkey will recognize the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan before 2030 appears low but nonzero, contingent on significant changes in Afghanistan’s international standing or Turkish strategic calculations. Current trends weigh against recognition, especially given recent policy reversals[5].
