## 1. Comparison to Reference Cases

Historically, "AI Winters" occurred following periods of inflated expectations, when funding, research output, and public attention sharply declined. These downturns were marked by:

- Steep decreases in research publication and funding
- Withdrawal of business investment
- Substantial drop in media and public interest

In prior winters, such declines were usually triggered by technological disappointments and failure to deliver on grand promises.

## 2. Key Differences Affecting the Forecast

### Current Trends (as of mid-2025):

- **AI Publications**: The total number of AI publications continues to grow. Between 2013 and 2023, AI publications in computer science and related fields nearly tripled, from ~102,000 to over 242,000. There is no indication of a decline; China leads in sheer volume, and the US leads in influential research[2].
- **AI Investment**: Industry investment is robust and rising. Nearly 90% of notable AI models in 2024 were developed by industry, up from 60% in 2023. 78% of organizations reported using AI in 2024, up sharply from 55% in 2023. There is no evidence of a >50% drop in year-over-year private investment compared to the 2020–2022 average[2].
- **Google Trends (AI Mentions)**: While specific 2024 Google Trends scores are not cited, recent reports and news coverage indicate AI remains a front-page topic in 2024 and 2025. No evidence suggests a collapse in public interest to pre-2021 levels[5].

### Key Differences from Previous Winters:

- Industry, not just academia, now leads AI development and investment, providing greater resilience to funding shifts[2].
- AI is more integrated across sectors (healthcare, finance, sustainability), with widespread business adoption, making a sudden bust less likely[4][2].
- No major policy or regulatory shocks have been announced that would dramatically curtail investment or research output in the near term.

## 3. Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

### Criteria Recap

A "Yes" answer requires at least two of the following by end of 2025:
- >50% drop in AI private investment (2024/2025 vs. 2020–2022 avg)
- >50% drop in AI publications (2024/2025 vs. 2020–2022 avg)
- 2024 Google Trends score within 5 points of 2004–2020 mean

### Assessment

- **AI Investment**: No sign of a qualifying drop[2].
- **AI Publications**: Still increasing[2].
- **Google Trends**: No indication of a collapse in interest[5].

Given current data (as of April–May 2025), none of the three metrics appear close to meeting their “AI Winter” trigger thresholds.

**Probability of Resolution as "Yes" by end of 2025: <5%.**

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- Data for full-year 2025 is not yet available; sudden regulatory or market shocks could alter trends.
- Google Trends is sensitive to public events and may fluctuate, but a sustained collapse is unlikely given ongoing media coverage.
- If the AI Index Report ceases publication, substitute data quality may vary.
