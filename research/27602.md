# Will Russia Confirm Clade I Mpox Infections Before October 1, 2024?

## Current Status of Mpox in Russia

As of August 19, 2024, Russia has reported a total of three monkeypox cases "over the entire past period"[1]. The available information does not specify which clade these cases belong to, but they are likely part of the ongoing global outbreak of clade II that began in 2022, rather than the newer clade I outbreak that has recently spread beyond Africa.

Russia's official position on the mpox threat is notably dismissive. Anna Popova, the head of Rospotrebnadzor (Russia's consumer protection watchdog), stated on August 19, 2024, that there is "no risk of mpox spreading in Russia," attributing this to the country's "traditional values"[5]. This statement appears to reference the fact that the current global outbreak has disproportionately affected men who have sex with men, with Popova suggesting that Russia's conservative social policies would prevent similar spread within its borders.

## Global Spread of Clade I Mpox

The global mpox situation has evolved significantly in recent months:

- In June 2024, 934 new laboratory-confirmed cases of mpox and four deaths were reported to WHO from 26 countries worldwide[2].
- By the end of July 2024, a cumulative total of 99,176 confirmed mpox cases, including 208 deaths, had been reported by 116 countries globally[3].
- On August 13, 2024, Africa CDC declared mpox a Public Health Emergency of Continental Security[3].
- On August 14, 2024, WHO declared the mpox outbreak a public health emergency of international concern[3].

Of particular concern is the spread of clade I mpox, which has historically been more severe than clade II. On August 15, 2024, Sweden reported an imported case of mpox due to Monkeypox virus clade Ib[3]. This represents the first confirmed case of clade I mpox outside the African continent, indicating that international spread has begun. European health authorities are now rushing to contain this outbreak of the more severe strain[4].

## Russia's Response and Risk Factors

Russia's official stance appears to downplay the risk of mpox spread within its borders. Popova's statement that Russia's "traditional values" will protect the country from mpox[5] suggests that Russian health authorities may not be implementing robust surveillance or prevention measures specifically for this disease.

However, several factors could potentially increase Russia's risk of detecting clade I mpox cases:

1. International travel connections between Russia and affected regions
2. The demonstrated ability of clade I to spread internationally (as evidenced by the case in Sweden)
3. The fact that Russia has already detected three mpox cases previously, showing that the country is not immune to the disease despite official rhetoric

## Assessment of Likelihood

Based on the available information, several factors would influence whether Russia confirms clade I mpox infections before October 1, 2024:

**Factors decreasing likelihood:**
- Russia's limited reporting of mpox cases to date (only three total cases reported)
- The very recent international spread of clade I (first case outside Africa reported on August 15, 2024)
- Russia's apparent lack of concern about mpox spread, which might translate to limited testing and surveillance

**Factors increasing likelihood:**
- The rapid geographic expansion of clade I mpox in recent weeks
- The declaration of public health emergencies by both Africa CDC and WHO
- The presence of clade I in Europe (Sweden), which increases the risk of spread to neighboring regions

The timeframe for this forecast (until October 1, 2024) is relatively short, giving approximately 6 weeks for potential detection of clade I in Russia from the current date. Given the recent detection in Sweden and the time needed for international spread, testing, and confirmation, this represents a narrow window.
