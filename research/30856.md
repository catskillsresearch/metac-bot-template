## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Since the detection of HPAI H5N1 in US commercial poultry in February 2022, nearly 97 million farmed birds have died or been culled to contain the virus[3].
- The largest wave of depopulations occurred in 2022, with substantial but somewhat reduced numbers in 2023 and continuing outbreaks in 2024, including large events (e.g., 2.1 million birds culled in a single California incident in November 2024)[2].
- As of late May 2025, HPAI remains active in US poultry and wild birds, with ongoing detections and rapid response protocols in place[1][2][4].
- The virus has also spread to non-avian species, including dairy cows and alpacas, raising concerns about new reservoirs and transmission pathways[5].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- In May 2024, the US government announced nearly $200 million in new funding to contain the outbreak, including $98 million from the USDA to support rapid response and depopulation efforts[5].
- The USDA policy remains to depopulate all affected and exposed poultry, using methods such as water-based foam or carbon dioxide gas, with the goal of completing depopulation within 24 hours of detection[3].
- Enhanced surveillance and biosecurity protocols are in effect, but the risk of large-scale outbreaks persists due to the scale and density of US poultry operations[2].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The USDA [Confirmed HPAI Detections table][2] provides real-time tracking of affected flocks and the number of birds culled.
- The CDC [poultry detections page][2] and [current situation summary][1] offer additional context and data.
- News and USDA reports document specific large-scale culling events and federal response measures[5].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- The true number of birds killed depends on the scale and frequency of outbreaks, which are influenced by viral evolution, biosecurity, and environmental factors.
- The emergence of HPAI in non-avian species introduces new uncertainties regarding transmission and outbreak persistence.
- Data reporting may lag or be subject to revision, particularly for events late in the calendar year.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment for 2025

Given the ongoing presence of HPAI, recent large-scale culling events, and the unchanged depopulation policy, it is likely that the number of farmed birds killed in the US due to bird flu in 2025 will be substantial, though probably below the 2022 peak. A reasonable central estimate would be in the range of 20 million to 35 million birds, with a right-skewed risk distribution allowing for rare, large outbreaks to push the total higher, particularly if the virus continues to circulate in wild birds and new reservoirs. The probability of exceeding 50 million appears low unless there is a major change in viral dynamics or containment failure.
