## Comparison to Reference Cases

- In 1913, John D. Rockefeller’s wealth was about 2% of US GDP, a level of relative wealth not seen since by any individual. In 2018, Jeff Bezos, the richest person, had a net worth of $112 billion, while 2% of US GDP was approximately $400 billion—a gap of nearly 4x[1].
- As of March 2025, Elon Musk is the world’s richest person with a net worth of $328.5–$332 billion[3][4]. The US GDP in 2025 is estimated at roughly $28 trillion, making 2% equal to about $560 billion. Thus, even the richest person in 2025 holds a net worth significantly below the 2% threshold[3][4].

## Key Differences Affecting the Forecast

- **Growth of Net Worth vs GDP**: While billionaire net worths have increased rapidly (Bezos at $112B in 2018 vs Musk at $328B in 2025), US GDP has also grown, keeping the 2% threshold out of reach[3][4].
- **Market Capitalization Limits**: Most ultra-high net worth individuals derive their wealth from equity in large technology companies. The size of these companies, though massive, faces natural and regulatory constraints.
- **Regulatory Environment**: Increased scrutiny of monopolies and calls for wealth taxation may limit further concentration of wealth.
- **Wealth Diversification and Succession**: Founders tend to diversify or distribute wealth over time (e.g., through philanthropy or inheritance), making it less likely for a single individual to concentrate so much wealth.
- **Innovation Uncertainty**: Unforeseen technological or economic disruptions could create new ultra-billionaires, but such events are unpredictable.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

- As of 2025, the richest individual's net worth stands at about 1.2% of US GDP. To reach 2% by 2033, this person (or another) would need net worth growth to outpace US GDP growth by a significant margin over the next 8 years.
- Given current trends, regulatory pressures, and the sheer scale required, the probability that the richest person in 2033 will have a net worth of ≥2% of US GDP is **very low**—likely well below 10%, barring unforeseen economic transformations or asset bubbles.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- Net worth calculations depend on volatile asset prices, especially for those whose wealth is tied to equity in large firms.
- US GDP projections are subject to macroeconomic shocks (recession, inflation, etc.).
- Policy changes (such as wealth taxes or antitrust actions) could dramatically affect billionaire wealth accumulation rates.
- Unpredictable technological breakthroughs or financial innovations could alter the landscape.

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The Forbes Billionaires List and Bloomberg Billionaires Index track highest net worths globally[1][3][4].
- US GDP figures are available from the US Bureau of Economic Analysis and major economic databases.
