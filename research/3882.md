## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The sun's output is \(3.86 \times 10^{26}\) watts; one millionth is \(3.86 \times 10^{20}\) watts[1].
- As of 2017, global photovoltaic (PV) capacity captured about \(3.03 \times 10^{11}\) watts—roughly a quadrillionth (10⁻¹⁵) of the sun's output, far below the one-millionth threshold[1].
- By 2023, global installed PV capacity reached 1412 GW (or \(1.412 \times 10^{12}\) W), with 345 GW added in 2023 alone and 520 GW projected for 2024[5].
- Despite rapid growth (compound annual growth rate of over 12%)[5], total human primary energy consumption (all sources, not just solar) remains less than \(2 \times 10^{13}\) W—still seven orders of magnitude short of the threshold.

## 2. Recent Announcements and Policies

- The International Energy Agency (IEA) notes that to meet net-zero targets, annual solar PV additions would need to quadruple by 2030[2].
- Global solar manufacturing capacity is expanding, but even aggressive net-zero scenarios envision humanity using only a tiny fraction of the sun's output by 2050[2].
- Policy momentum is strong, but current targets and supply chain expansions cannot close the multi-order-of-magnitude gap in the near or medium term[2][5].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- International Energy Agency (IEA) annual reports[1][2]
- International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) data[5]
- Peer-reviewed energy analysis and techno-futurist literature

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- The largest uncertainty is technological: Only a breakthrough (such as a Dyson swarm or advanced orbital solar collectors) could enable such a leap.
- Social, political, and environmental constraints may slow growth.
- The forecast assumes continuity in civilization; extinction or catastrophic events would render the question ambiguous by resolution criteria.

## Reference Cases and Key Differences

| Case                        | Energy Usage Level             | Timeframe (estimate)       | Key Limitation/Assumption                    |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Current solar growth trend  | ~\(10^{12}\) W (2023)         | Present–2050+              | Exponential material & land use required     |
| Net-zero scenario           | ~\(10^{13}\) W (all sources)  | 2050                       | Still vastly less than \(10^{20}\) W         |
| Kardashev Type I            | ~\(10^{16}\) W (Earth's total) | 22nd century+ (optimistic) | Radical tech, global coordination            |
| Dyson sphere/super-civilization | \(>10^{26}\) W                | Far future, centuries+      | Speculative, requires postbiological leap    |

- Key difference: Technological paradigm shifts (e.g., self-replicating space industry) are required to approach the one-millionth threshold, not just scaling current trends.

## Probabilistic Assessment (as of 2020-03-21)

- **Probability of exceeding \(3.86 \times 10^{20}\) W before 2100**: <0.01%
- **Probability before 2200**: <0.1%, barring transformative advances
- **Probability before 3000**: Moderate (~10-20%), allowing for unforeseen breakthroughs or posthuman expansion
- **Most likely resolution**: Not before several centuries, possibly never unless radical technological and societal changes occur
