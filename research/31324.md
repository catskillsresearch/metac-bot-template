# Forecast Analysis: Mifepristone Restrictions in the US Before 2026

As of May 2025, the question of whether mifepristone will become significantly restricted or illegal for abortion use across the US before 2026 requires careful analysis of current trends, political developments, and regulatory actions.

## Current Status and Recent Developments

Mifepristone remains legal at the federal level as of May 2025, though significant efforts to restrict its availability are underway. In January 2023, the FDA actually expanded access by lifting restrictions that had prevented patients from obtaining medication abortion pills at retail pharmacies[2]. However, this expansion is under serious threat from multiple directions.

The most significant threat comes from Project 2025, a comprehensive policy agenda developed by the Heritage Foundation and 109 other right-wing organizations, which explicitly calls for:

1. Reinstating medically unnecessary restrictions on mifepristone that require in-person dispensing and limit who can prescribe and receive the medication[1]
2. Completely revoking mifepristone's FDA approval, which would remove the drug from the market entirely[1]

This is particularly concerning as medication abortion accounts for nearly two-thirds of all abortions provided by clinicians, with the vast majority using the combined regimen of mifepristone and misoprostol[1].

## State-Level Restrictions as Potential Precursors

Several Republican-led states are implementing a concerning strategy that could serve as a model for federal action. States including Idaho, Oklahoma, Tennessee, and Texas have introduced measures to classify mifepristone and misoprostol as Schedule IV controlled substances under state Controlled Dangerous Substances laws, following Louisiana's lead[5].

This reclassification places these medications under the same regulatory framework as sedatives and barbiturates, despite clear scientific evidence that they do not pose risks for addiction or abuse[5]. This approach represents a novel strategy to restrict access that could potentially be expanded to the federal level.

## Congressional Activity

There are competing forces in Congress. On January 24, 2025, the House of Representatives introduced H.Res.65, which "affirms the existing authority to distribute medication abortion under Federal law"[4]. This suggests some congressional support for maintaining access, though a resolution alone provides limited protection against executive branch actions or judicial decisions.

## Probability Assessment

Given the current political landscape and the specific resolution criteria, I assess the probability of mifepristone becoming significantly restricted or illegal for abortion use across the US before January 1, 2026 as follows:

**Probability: 35-45%**

Key factors supporting this assessment:

1. **Project 2025 Implementation**: If elements of Project 2025 are implemented by a supportive administration, the FDA could be directed to revoke or severely restrict mifepristone's approval[1][3].

2. **State-Level Momentum**: The growing trend of states classifying these medications as controlled substances creates momentum for federal action and normalizes severe restrictions[5].

3. **Mitigating Factors**: Congressional resistance, as evidenced by H.Res.65, and the limited time remaining before the January 2026 deadline (approximately 7 months) make nationwide implementation challenging[4].

4. **Judicial Pathways**: Previous legal challenges to mifepristone's approval reached the Supreme Court in 2024. Similar cases could be expedited through the federal court system, potentially resulting in restrictions before the deadline.

## Key Uncertainties

1. **Administrative Actions**: The FDA's willingness to reverse its previous decisions on mifepristone access.

2. **Congressional Balance**: The ability of pro-access legislators to block restrictive legislation.

3. **Judicial Decisions**: Potential court rulings on pending or future challenges to mifepristone's approval.

4. **Implementation Timeline**: Even if restrictions are approved, whether they would take effect before January 1, 2026.

This forecast recognizes that while significant efforts to restrict mifepristone are underway, complete nationwide restrictions face substantial procedural and political hurdles within the timeframe specified.
