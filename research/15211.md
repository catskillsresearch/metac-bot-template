# Forecasting Analysis: Russian Territory Reduction by 2040

As of May 2025, I'll analyze the probability that Russian territory will be reduced by at least 1% before 2040, requiring a reduction of at least 170,982 square kilometers from Russia's total area of 17,098,246 square kilometers.

## Historical Context and Precedents

The Russian Federation emerged from the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, which itself was a successor to the Russian Empire. Both predecessor states experienced significant territorial reductions during transitions of power:

- The Russian Empire collapsed following the 1917 Revolution, losing Finland, Poland, the Baltic states, and temporarily several other regions.
- The Soviet Union's dissolution in 1991 resulted in 14 new independent states separating from Russia.

These historical patterns suggest that major political upheavals in Russia have frequently led to territorial changes.

## Current Geopolitical Situation

### Ukraine Conflict

The ongoing conflict in Ukraine represents a significant strain on Russian resources and stability:

- As of April 2025, Russia's territorial gains in Ukraine have been slowing, with March 2025 showing a 40% reduction in captured territory compared to February[4].
- Military analysts note signs of "Russian exhaustion" in the conflict, with difficulties maintaining the pace of operations[4].

### Economic Pressures

Russia faces severe economic challenges that could potentially destabilize the regime:

- Inflation rates between 20-25% are approaching hyperinflation levels as of early 2025[4].
- Economic forecasts suggest Russia's liquid reserves could be depleted by late 2025 or early 2026[4].
- The military campaign is straining Russia's economy through high costs of recruitment and equipment replacement[4].

### Internal Separatist Movements

Several regions within Russia have active separatist movements that could potentially gain momentum under conditions of central government weakness:

- Ethnic and religious separatist movements exist in various regions, including the North Caucasus, Tatarstan, and parts of Siberia.
- These movements could be emboldened if the central government's authority weakens due to military setbacks or economic collapse.

## Expert Assessments

Several notable assessments provide context for this forecast:

- In February 2023, George Soros predicted that "a Ukrainian victory would result in the dissolution of the Russian empire"[1].
- As of May 2025, some analysts predict Russia could face a "breaking point" before 2026 due to "dwindling supplies, labor shortages, and growing domestic unrest"[3].
- The Metaculus forecasting community, as of March 2023, estimated a 33% probability (with a confidence interval of 15-40%) that Russian territory would be reduced by at least 1% before 2040[1].

## Counterbalancing Factors

Several factors could reduce the likelihood of territorial reduction:

- Russia maintains a significant nuclear arsenal, which serves as a deterrent against external attempts to claim territory.
- The government is investing in strategic infrastructure projects, including ports along the Northern Sea Route scheduled for completion by 2026[5].
- Climate change may actually benefit Russia in some respects, potentially opening new shipping routes and resource extraction opportunities that could strengthen the economy[5].

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on the available information, I assess the probability of Russian territory being reduced by at least 1% before 2040 at approximately 40-45%.

This represents an increase from the 33% Metaculus community prediction from March 2023, primarily due to:

1. Worsening economic conditions in Russia through 2025, with potential reserve depletion by 2026
2. Continued military challenges in Ukraine showing signs of Russian exhaustion
3. Growing internal pressures that could trigger separatist movements if central authority weakens

The most likely scenarios that could lead to territorial reduction include:

- Internal collapse following economic exhaustion and military defeat
- Negotiated settlements resulting in border adjustments
- Successful separatist movements in peripheral regions

However, significant uncertainty remains due to Russia's nuclear deterrent, potential for economic stabilization through resource development, and the historical resilience of the Russian state despite periodic crises.
