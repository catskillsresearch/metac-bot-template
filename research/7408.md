## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The only two offensive detonations of nuclear weapons (Hiroshima and Nagasaki, 1945) occurred during active, large-scale conventional conflict between the US and Japan in WWII[2][3][5].
- Since 1945, thousands of nuclear weapons tests have been conducted, but all subsequent detonations have been identified as tests or demonstrations, not for offensive purposes[5].
- During the Cold War and after, despite numerous crises and limited conventional conflicts involving nuclear-armed states (e.g., Korean War, Sino-Soviet border clashes, India-Pakistan conflicts), none resulted in offensive nuclear use[2][5].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- The Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW), entering into force in 2021, explicitly bans the use, threat, and possession of nuclear weapons; however, none of the current nuclear-armed states are parties to this treaty[1].
- Doctrines in nuclear-armed states vary: some (e.g., US, Russia) reserve the right to use nuclear weapons first under certain circumstances, while others (e.g., China, India) have declared “no first use” policies, though the credibility and permanence of these policies are debated.
- There is increased concern about accidental, unauthorized, or inadvertent use due to cyber risks, command/control failures, or escalation during crises, highlighted in academic and policy literature.

## Key Differences Affecting the Forecast

- The 1945 context involved a total war with existential stakes; today’s nuclear-armed states possess more robust deterrence mechanisms, second-strike capabilities, and advanced warning systems.
- Non-state actors and nuclear security risks (e.g., theft, internal sabotage) add a new dimension absent in 1945, increasing the theoretical risk of a detonation outside conventional conflict.
- Modern crises often involve limited, ambiguous, or proxy conflicts rather than declared wars, complicating the definition of “conventional conflict” and the direct linkage to nuclear use.
- The strong historical taboo and international opprobrium against offensive nuclear use have grown, but this may be offset by emerging regional rivalries and technological shifts.

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- United Nations Office for Disarmament Affairs and the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW)[1].
- History of nuclear weapons—Wikipedia and International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN)[2][3].
- Nuclear weapons testing records and recent nuclear test data[5].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- Offensive use of nuclear weapons by states is extremely rare, providing only two data points for historical reference.
- Changing doctrines, proliferation risks, and the possibility of accidental/inadvertent detonation introduce significant uncertainty.
- Measurement depends on clear, timely, and reliable attribution of intent and context by official and media sources; some scenarios may fall into gray areas regarding “conventional conflict.”

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given all historical offensive nuclear detonations followed conventional conflict, and recent decades have seen robust deterrence and safeguards, the probability that the next state nuclear use—if it occurs—will be immediately preceded by conventional conflict remains higher than the alternative. However, the increasing salience of accidental, unauthorized, or non-state actor use means that while a “Yes” outcome is more likely, the risk of a “No” cannot be dismissed.

- Baseline (based on historical precedent): High likelihood of conventional conflict preceding any offensive nuclear use.
- Adjustment (accounting for modern risks): Some probability for accidental/inadvertent/non-conflict scenarios, but still less likely than deliberate use during conflict.

**Forecast:** There is a strong (but not absolute) probability (>70%) that the next non-test detonation of a state’s nuclear weapon will be immediately preceded by conventional conflict, based on all available evidence as of June 25, 2021[2][3][5].
