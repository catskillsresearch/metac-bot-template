## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of March 27, 2024, the Federal Reserve's balance sheet was $7.5 trillion, having declined by $517 billion over the previous six months[1].
- The reduction since September 2023 has averaged about $86 billion per month[1].
- Since the start of quantitative tightening in June 2022, the Fed's balance sheet has shrunk by about $1.3 trillion[5].

## Recent Announcements and Policy Signals

- The Federal Reserve has reaffirmed its intention to slow and eventually halt the balance sheet runoff when reserve balances are "somewhat above the level it judges to be consistent with ample reserves," suggesting a deceleration of reductions as that threshold approaches[5].
- Fed officials have indicated that the size and composition of the balance sheet will be influenced by factors such as demand for reserve balances, growth in currency in circulation, and Treasury cash management[5].
- External estimates, such as those from CaixaBank Research, project a 20% reduction in the Fed's balance sheet by the end of 2024 compared to its peak, which would place the total near or just below $6.8 trillion[3].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The Federal Reserve's H.4.1 statistical release is the definitive source for weekly balance sheet data and will provide the official figure for resolution[1].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- The pace of balance sheet reduction is subject to change based on economic conditions, financial stability concerns, and policy decisions.
- The Fed may slow or pause reductions if reserve balances approach the "ample" threshold sooner than expected[5].
- Growth in non-reserve liabilities, such as currency in circulation and Treasury balances, could offset reductions in securities holdings[5].
- Projections are based on current trends and policy guidance, but unforeseen events could alter the trajectory.

## Summary Table: Balance Sheet Reduction Scenario

| Date             | Total Assets (Trillions USD) | Notes                                    |
|------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Sep 27, 2023     | 8.0                         | Start of recent reporting period[1]      |
| Mar 27, 2024     | 7.5                         | $517B reduction over 6 months[1]         |
| Dec 2024 (est.)  | ~6.7â€“7.0                    | If current pace continues, but may slow[1][3][5] |

## Conclusion

Based on the current rate of decline and policy guidance, it is plausible that the Federal Reserve's balance sheet could fall below $6.8 trillion by the end of December 2024. However, there is significant uncertainty due to the Fed's stated intention to slow or halt reductions as reserve balances approach ample levels, and due to unpredictable changes in non-reserve liabilities. The outcome will depend on the Fed's actions in the latter half of 2024 and evolving market conditions.
