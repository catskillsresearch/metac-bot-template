## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Since World War II, direct attacks by nuclear-armed great powers on each other's territory have been avoided, with conflict instead taking the form of proxy wars, limited engagements, or economic pressure.
- China has steadily increased military activities and exercises near Taiwan, including “softening the battlespace” tactics and psychological operations, but has not initiated direct conflict with the US[5].
- As of early 2025, the probability of a full-scale Chinese invasion of Taiwan is assessed at about 35%. Most experts expect either a blockade or limited conflict, rather than an outright invasion[4].
- US military intervention in a Taiwan conflict remains a subject of debate, but President Biden has publicly stated the US would defend Taiwan if invaded, triggering strong warnings from China but no explicit threats of direct attack on US territory[2][5].

## 2. Key Differences Affecting the Forecast

- Unlike Cold War US-Soviet confrontations, China’s leadership under Xi Jinping has demonstrated a greater willingness to use coercive force, but remains highly risk-averse regarding attacks that could trigger nuclear escalation or all-out war with the US[2][4].
- China’s economy is deeply integrated with the US and global markets, raising the cost of escalation.
- Chinese statements emphasize “firm actions” and “safeguarding sovereignty,” but do not specify direct retaliation against US territory in response to US intervention in Taiwan[2][5].
- The military balance in the Taiwan Strait is shifting, but US forces remain capable of striking targets in and around China, making direct attacks on the US homeland a high-risk strategy.

## 3. Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

- Based on available expert analyses and public statements as of mid-2022 to early 2025, the probability that China would attack US territory in direct retaliation for a US military intervention in Taiwan before 2035 is **low but nonzero**.
- Most forecasts and risk assessments suggest China’s response would likely remain limited to the immediate theater (Taiwan area), cyber operations, or indirect means, rather than an offensive physical attack on US soil[4][5].
- A rough probabilistic assessment, consistent with Metaculus and expert commentary, would place the odds of direct Chinese attacks on US territory at **well below 20%** in this scenario, likely in the low single digits.

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- Wartime decision-making may be unpredictable, especially if Chinese leadership perceives existential threats or regime instability.
- Public Chinese statements may not reflect classified war plans.
- Escalation dynamics could shift quickly if the situation spirals out of control, but as of 2022-2025, no authoritative source indicates a policy or doctrine favoring direct attacks on US soil in response to intervention.
