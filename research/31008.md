# December 2024 Precipitation Forecast for Houston, Texas

As of mid-December 2024, Houston's precipitation patterns show interesting developments that can help us forecast the total rainfall for the month. Here's a comprehensive analysis based on historical data, current measurements, and meteorological factors.

## Historical Context and Current Status

Houston typically receives approximately 4.03 inches of rainfall during December, based on historical normals[5]. The current measurement of 0.41 inches recorded at William P. Hobby Airport (as mentioned in the question) represents only about 10% of the normal December precipitation with roughly half the month elapsed.

Historical data shows considerable variability in December rainfall for Houston:
- December 2023 recorded 3.56 inches of rain, slightly below the normal average (-0.18 inches)[5]
- December 2022 saw 3.88 inches, also slightly below normal (-0.15 inches)[5]

Weather Underground's historical data for December 10, 2024, shows temperatures slightly above historical averages, with an actual high of 67°F compared to the historic average of 66.2°F[3]. While this single data point doesn't directly indicate precipitation patterns, temperature variations can correlate with precipitation tendencies.

## Influencing Factors

Several meteorological factors are likely to influence the remainder of December 2024's precipitation:

1. **La Niña Conditions**: The expected La Niña, which typically brings drier winter conditions to the southern United States, has been weaker than initially forecast. This weakened La Niña could result in less pronounced drying effects than originally anticipated.

2. **Recent Drought Recovery**: Houston has recently experienced enough rainfall to be declared no longer in drought conditions according to the US Drought Monitor. This shift in moisture patterns could indicate changing atmospheric conditions over the region.

3. **Historical December Patterns**: December precipitation in Houston often comes from frontal systems rather than tropical influences. The timing and strength of cold fronts moving through the region during the remainder of December will significantly impact the final precipitation total.

## Forecast Considerations

Given the current measurement of 0.41 inches and historical patterns, several scenarios are possible for December 2024's final precipitation total:

1. **Continued Dry Pattern**: If the current dry trend continues, December 2024 could indeed end up as one of the driest Decembers in recent history, potentially finishing with less than 1 inch of total precipitation.

2. **Return to Normal Pattern**: A shift in weather patterns could bring several rain events in the latter half of December, potentially bringing the monthly total closer to the normal 4.03 inches.

3. **Significant Weather Event**: A single major rain event could dramatically change the monthly total. Houston's precipitation often comes in concentrated events rather than evenly distributed rainfall.

The National Weather Service Houston/Galveston provides regular updates on precipitation data for Houston Hobby Airport, which will be the authoritative source for the final December 2024 precipitation total[2].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors limit the precision of this forecast:

1. **Weather System Unpredictability**: Individual weather systems can develop and change rapidly, making precise precipitation forecasts beyond 7-10 days challenging.

2. **Spatial Variability**: Precipitation in Houston can vary significantly across the metropolitan area, with the official measurement at Hobby Airport potentially not representing conditions across the entire region.

3. **Climate Pattern Evolution**: The evolution of the weaker-than-expected La Niña could shift in ways not fully predictable based on current data.

Based on the available information, December 2024 appears likely to finish below the normal precipitation amount of 4.03 inches, but the exact total will depend significantly on weather patterns developing in the latter half of the month.
