# Boeing Starliner Commercial Crew Program Status Assessment

As of early September 2024, the Boeing Starliner Commercial Crew program faces significant challenges following multiple technical issues with its Crew Flight Test (CFT) mission. Below is a comprehensive analysis of the available information that could help forecast the program's near-term future.

## Current Status of the Starliner Program

The Boeing Starliner Crew Flight Test, which launched on June 5, 2024, has experienced serious technical difficulties that have dramatically altered the mission profile[5]. What was originally planned as an approximately eight-day mission had extended into its second month in orbit by early August 2024[5]. The mission carried NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Sunita Williams to the International Space Station (ISS), docking on June 6, 2024[5].

On August 24, 2024, NASA held a press conference to announce a major decision regarding the mission: the Starliner spacecraft would return to Earth uncrewed in early September 2024, while astronauts Wilmore and Williams would be reassigned to the SpaceX Crew-9 Dragon mission, scheduled to return in February 2025[3]. This decision came after extensive evaluation of the spacecraft's propulsion system issues[3].

## Technical Issues and NASA's Response

The primary concerns with the Starliner spacecraft involve its propulsion system. As of July 30, 2024, the integrated Starliner team was still assessing the spacecraft's propulsion system performance before scheduling its undocking from the ISS[2]. The specific problems include "helium and thruster anomalies" as mentioned by Mark Nappi, Boeing's Vice President and commercial crew program manager, during a status conference on July 25, 2024[5].

These technical issues were serious enough that NASA determined it was safer to return the spacecraft without crew aboard. NASA's decision to reassign the astronauts to a SpaceX mission represents a significant vote of no confidence in the current Starliner vehicle's ability to safely transport crew back to Earth[3].

## Future Plans and Implications

Despite these setbacks, there is no explicit information in the available sources indicating that NASA or Boeing have made a decision to cancel the Starliner program before October 1, 2024. The most recent information shows that:

1. NASA is proceeding with plans for the uncrewed return of the Starliner spacecraft in early September 2024[3].

2. The agency has reassigned the CFT astronauts to a future SpaceX mission rather than terminating their mission assignments altogether[3].

3. Boeing continues to describe the Starliner as "setting the foundation for commercial passenger spaceflight services," with NASA as its "anchor customer"[4].

The decision to return Starliner uncrewed represents a significant technical and public relations setback for Boeing's space program. However, the available information does not indicate a formal cancellation of the program as of early September 2024.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several important limitations exist in the available information:

1. The search results do not contain any statements from NASA or Boeing about the long-term future of the Starliner program following the decision to return the current vehicle uncrewed.

2. There is no information about whether NASA will require additional test flights before certifying Starliner for regular crew rotation missions.

3. Financial implications of the extended mission and technical issues for Boeing are not detailed in the available sources.

4. The status of the planned Starliner-1 operational mission (mentioned in the query but not in the search results) is unclear from the available information.

The decision to return the current Starliner uncrewed while transferring its crew to a competitor's vehicle represents a significant blow to the program, but based solely on the available information as of early September 2024, there is no confirmation of program cancellation before October 1, 2024.
