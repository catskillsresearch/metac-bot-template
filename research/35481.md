# Forecasting Analysis: Will PEPFAR Cease to Exist Before January 1, 2026?

As of May 12, 2025, PEPFAR faces unprecedented challenges that threaten its continued existence. This analysis examines the current situation and provides a probabilistic assessment of whether PEPFAR will cease to exist before January 1, 2026.

## Current Status

PEPFAR's congressional reauthorization expired on March 25, 2025, placing the program in an uncertain position despite having been reauthorized five times previously[5]. Although the authorization has expired, it's important to note that PEPFAR remains a permanent part of U.S. law[2]. Congress has appropriated funding through the end of September 2025 via the continuing resolution passed in March[5].

The program currently operates in a precarious environment following two significant developments:

1. On January 20, 2025, the U.S. Department of State announced an immediate 90-day pause for all U.S. foreign assistance, including PEPFAR activities[4].
2. On January 24, 2025, the U.S. government froze all foreign aid programs, including PEPFAR[3].

## Key Factors Affecting PEPFAR's Future

### Funding Environment

PEPFAR now faces a significantly more uncertain funding environment than in previous years[1]. The entire U.S. government is operating under a continuing resolution through March 28, 2025, requiring Congress to either agree on a FY 2025 budget or adopt another continuing resolution to prevent a government shutdown[1].

Reports indicate that Republicans are seeking deep budget cuts, which changes the overall funding calculus for PEPFAR not only for FY 2025 but beyond[1]. This political pressure represents a departure from previous years when PEPFAR enjoyed stronger bipartisan support.

### Administration Priorities

President Trump's first budget request for FY 2026, expected to be released soon, will likely call for funding cuts to global health programs including PEPFAR, as occurred during his first term[1]. While Congress previously rejected such proposed cuts, the current fiscal and political environment makes congressional opposition to these cuts less certain[1].

### Structural Questions

Significant uncertainty exists regarding how the State Department will operate PEPFAR amid reported proposals to create a new U.S. Agency for International Humanitarian Assistance[5]. This potential restructuring could fundamentally alter PEPFAR's operational framework and potentially satisfy one of the resolution criteria if PEPFAR's functions are merged into another agency.

## Impact on Implementation

The current uncertainty has significant operational implications. Health ministries, implementing partners, and community-based organizations across PEPFAR-supported countries must attempt to deliver lifesaving care without the stability that long-term U.S. commitments previously provided[5]. This operational challenge may accelerate a decline in program effectiveness.

Experts warn that PEPFAR funding cuts could lead to up to 74,000 excess HIV deaths in Africa by 2030[3], highlighting the potential human cost of program disruption or termination.

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on the available information as of May 12, 2025, I assess the probability of PEPFAR ceasing to exist before January 1, 2026 as follows:

**60-65% probability** that PEPFAR will cease to exist before January 1, 2026.

This assessment is based on:

1. The expired authorization creating a window for program termination or significant restructuring
2. The administration's historical preference for reducing foreign aid spending
3. The reported proposals to create a new agency that could absorb PEPFAR's functions
4. The current funding environment favoring budget cuts
5. The program currently operating in "purgatory" status where officials could terminate or significantly curtail it[5]

## Key Uncertainties

Several factors could significantly alter this forecast:

1. Congressional action on a new authorization bill
2. The specific details of the FY 2026 budget proposal
3. Potential court challenges to any executive actions affecting the program
4. International pressure to maintain HIV/AIDS funding commitments
5. The actual implementation of the proposed new U.S. Agency for International Humanitarian Assistance

## Conclusion

PEPFAR faces an unprecedented level of uncertainty regarding its future. While the program remains legally established despite its expired authorization, multiple factors suggest a significant risk of termination or consolidation before January 1, 2026. The next few months, particularly decisions around the FY 2026 budget and any administrative reorganization, will be critical in determining PEPFAR's fate.
