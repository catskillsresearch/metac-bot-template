# 2025 Goldsmith Prize for Investigative Reporting: Finalist Analysis

The 2025 Goldsmith Prize for Investigative Reporting, one of journalism's most prestigious awards, will announce its winner on April 3, 2025[1][3]. This prize honors investigative reporting that promotes more effective and ethical conduct of government, the making of public policy, or the practice of politics[3]. The winner receives $25,000, while the five finalists each receive $10,000[1][3].

## Current Status and Finalists

On March 5, 2025, the Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy at Harvard Kennedy School announced the finalists for the 2025 Goldsmith Prize[1][5]. Among the finalists are two investigations from the San Francisco Chronicle:

1. **"Fast and Fatal"** by Jennifer Gollan and Susie Neilson - This investigation documented thousands of deaths in recent years caused by police pursuits, with many of those killed being passengers or bystanders[5].

2. **"Right to Remain Secret"** by Katey Rusch and Casey Smith (published in collaboration with UC Berkeley's Investigative Reporting Program) - This investigation exposed a system of secret legal settlements that has enabled more than 100 California police officers with records of misconduct to be rehired at other law enforcement agencies or as security guards[5].

The selection process for the 2025 prize was rigorous, with the judging committee reviewing over 120 entries before narrowing down to semifinalists and then finalists[2].

## Additional Context

The Goldsmith Prize is administered by the Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government, with financial support provided by an annual grant from the Goldsmith Fund of the Greenfield Foundation[3].

In addition to the investigative reporting prize, Anderson Cooper, CNN anchor and CBS 60 Minutes correspondent, will be honored with the 2025 Goldsmith Career Award for Excellence in Journalism at the same ceremony[4].

## Limitations in Forecasting the Winner

Based on the available information as of March 17, 2025, it is difficult to predict which finalist will win the prize. The search results do not provide historical data about past winners that might reveal patterns or preferences of the judges. Additionally, while we have detailed information about the two San Francisco Chronicle investigations, we lack equal information about the other finalists' work to make a comprehensive comparison.

The winner will be announced at the awards ceremony in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on April 3, 2025[5].
