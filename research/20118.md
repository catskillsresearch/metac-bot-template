## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Major new religions historically take decades or centuries to attract tens of millions of adherents. Examples include Mormonism (founded in 1830, now ~17 million members) and the Baháʼí Faith (founded in the 19th century, now several million members). No recent new religion—especially one founded in the digital era—has gained 20 million followers within just 10–15 years.
- AI is currently employed as a tool in religious contexts, such as generating sermons or providing guidance to clergy. There are active experiments with AI-generated religious content, but no evidence of AI independently originating a new, distinct religion or movement with mass appeal[4][5].
- Recent studies indicate that increased exposure to automation and AI is correlated with declining religiosity, rather than the emergence of new mass religious movements[3].

## 2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- There are no known major announcements or policy changes as of December 2023 indicating support, recognition, or mass adoption of AI-generated religions.
- Religious organizations and commentators are discussing the implications of AI for spirituality, but the consensus is that AI currently serves as a supplement or tool, not a source of independent religious innovation[1][5].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The resolution requires validation by major international news outlets or reputable polling organizations. As of the end of 2023, there are no reports from such entities of any AI-created religion attracting millions of adherents.
- Most coverage describes AI as an aid for established religions, not a founding source of new, mass-followed faiths[5].

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties in Measurement

- Measuring religious affiliation, especially for new or decentralized digital movements, is challenging. Official statistics may lag actual trends, and self-reporting can inflate numbers.
- The resolution criteria are strict: the religion must be *independently* created by AI (not by humans using AI), have clear doctrine, and verification must come from credible, independent sources.
- If a movement arises but its follower count or origin (AI vs. human) is disputed, the question will resolve as **No**.

## 5. Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

- Given the lack of precedent, current trends indicating declining religiosity with increased AI exposure, the technical and social barriers to mass adoption, and the strict resolution standards, the probability that 20 million people will follow a new, AI-created religion by the end of 2035 is estimated to be **well below 1%**.
