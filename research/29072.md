## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- North Korea has conducted six nuclear tests: 2006, 2009, 2013, twice in 2016, and 2017. No nuclear tests have been confirmed since 2017[2].
- In 2024, North Korea has focused on expanding its nuclear arsenal, testing new missile systems, and increasing production of nuclear materials, as stated by Kim Jong Un and reported by state media[2][3].
- North Korea has conducted multiple missile tests in 2024, including a solid-fuel intermediate-range missile and a multiple warhead missile system, but none have been confirmed as nuclear detonations[4][5].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- Kim Jong Un has vowed to ramp up production of plutonium and uranium and to intensify weapons tests in 2024, aiming for "overwhelming" war readiness[3].
- North Korea has pledged to further build up its nuclear arsenal in response to U.S. and South Korean activities, and has justified expansion as necessary for deterrence[2].
- Analysts suggest North Korea may increase provocations ahead of the U.S. presidential election, but no specific nuclear test has been announced or confirmed[3].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The International Monitoring System (IMS) of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO) is the primary authority for detecting and confirming nuclear tests.
- Wikipedia's "List of nuclear weapons tests of North Korea" is a widely referenced secondary source for historical test records.
- Major news agencies and specialized outlets (e.g., Arms Control Association, NK News) provide timely updates on North Korean military activities[2][4].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- North Korea's state media sometimes claims technological advances or tests that are not independently verified.
- The regime's decision-making is opaque, and sudden provocations are possible.
- As of October 22, 2024, there are no credible, independently verified reports of a new North Korean nuclear test.

## Summary

As of October 22, 2024, there is no confirmed evidence that North Korea has tested a nuclear weapon since 2017. While North Korea has increased its nuclear rhetoric, expanded missile testing, and pledged further nuclear buildup, no credible source has reported a new nuclear detonation. The risk of a test remains, especially given political motivations, but the absence of confirmation from authoritative monitoring systems is decisive for forecasting up to the cutoff date.
