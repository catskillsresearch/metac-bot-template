# Forecasting F1's Opening Weekend Domestic Box Office

Based on current data as of June 5, 2025, I'll analyze the expected opening weekend performance for the upcoming film "F1" starring Brad Pitt.

## Current Status and Key Indicators

"F1" (also marketed as "F1 the Movie") is scheduled for domestic release on June 27, 2025, in the United States and Canada[5]. The film is a sports drama directed by Joseph Kosinski with a screenplay by Ehren Kruger, featuring Brad Pitt as Sonny Hayes, a former Formula One driver who comes out of retirement to mentor a rookie prodigy named Joshua "Noah" Pearce for the fictional Apex Grand Prix team[5].

The most recent box office tracking data from mid-May 2025 projects an opening weekend of "$47M+" for the film[4]. This forecast comes approximately six weeks before the scheduled release, which is a relatively reliable timeframe for box office projections.

## Comparative Analysis

While direct comparisons are limited in the available data, we can consider:

1. **Star Power**: Brad Pitt's involvement as the lead actor typically provides a significant boost to opening weekend numbers, particularly in action-oriented films targeting adult audiences.

2. **Director Track Record**: Joseph Kosinski previously directed "Top Gun: Maverick," which was a massive commercial success, suggesting potential audience interest in his high-octane filmmaking style.

3. **Genre Performance**: Sports dramas with high production values have shown variable performance. The Formula One setting provides visual spectacle that could drive theatrical attendance.

4. **Current Market Conditions**: For context, other 2025 releases like "One of Them Days" opened with $14 million (slightly under its $15M prediction) over a four-day MLK weekend and went on to earn over $50 million domestically[1]. However, this film targeted a different demographic and was released in a different season.

## Forecast Assessment

Based on the available data, the most reliable projection for F1's domestic opening weekend is in the $45-50 million range, with $47 million representing the current consensus forecast[4]. This aligns with the tracking data from mid-May 2025.

Several factors could influence this projection:

- **Positive Factors**: Brad Pitt's star power, Formula One's growing popularity in North America, high production values, and Warner Bros.' marketing campaign.

- **Potential Limitations**: Competition from other late June releases, audience interest in motorsport themes, and critical reception (reviews typically begin appearing 1-2 weeks before release).

## Uncertainties and Limitations

The forecast contains several uncertainties:

1. **Pre-Release Marketing**: The final marketing push in the three weeks leading up to release could significantly impact opening weekend performance.

2. **Critical Reception**: Early reviews and audience word-of-mouth from international screenings (beginning June 25, 2025)[5] could influence domestic performance.

3. **Competing Releases**: The full competitive landscape for late June 2025 isn't detailed in the available data.

4. **Formula One Calendar**: The film releases just before the 2025 Austrian Grand Prix[5], which could create synergistic interest among motorsport fans.

## Conclusion

Based on current tracking data and contextual factors, F1 is most likely to earn between $45-50 million in its domestic opening weekend, with the most precise current estimate being $47 million[4]. This forecast has moderate confidence given the proximity to release date and the established tracking data, but remains subject to change based on marketing effectiveness and critical reception in the coming weeks.
