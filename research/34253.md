# Texas Drought Forecast Analysis: February 2025

Based on available data as of January 28, 2025, here is an analysis to help forecast whether Texas will have 15.0 million or more residents living in drought conditions by February 28, 2025.

## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

As of January 21, 2025, drought conditions (ranging from moderate D1 to exceptional D4 per the U.S. Drought Monitor) covered 42.29% of Texas[1]. This significant coverage suggests that a substantial portion of the state's population is currently experiencing some level of drought.

In specific regions, the situation varies in severity:
- Far west Texas is experiencing severe (D2) to extreme (D3) drought conditions as of early January 2025[2]
- The broader South region, which includes Texas, had moderate to exceptional drought covering 25.9% of its area in January 2025, showing a decrease from December 2024 levels[4]

The drought has affected water resources significantly. For example, Elephant Butte storage was at only 9.8% capacity in early January 2025, which, while an increase from the previous month, remains well below the 30-year median[2].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

Governor Greg Abbott renewed a drought disaster proclamation on January 22, 2025, officially recognizing persistent drought conditions in numerous Texas counties[3]. The proclamation listed over 70 affected counties, including major population centers such as Bexar (San Antonio), Travis (Austin), and El Paso counties[3].

Local water authorities have implemented conservation measures in response to the drought:
- The Central Texas Groundwater Conservation District imposed mandatory reductions of 15% for permitted water users effective January 1, 2025, through December 31, 2025[5]
- Public water supply entities are required to implement their drought plans and provide proof of water conservation measures[5]

These widespread policy responses indicate that officials anticipate drought conditions to persist in the near term.

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

The following sources provide reliable data for monitoring drought conditions in Texas:
- U.S. Drought Monitor data available through Water Data for Texas[1]
- National Weather Service drought information statements[2]
- Texas Division of Emergency Management drought confirmations (referenced in the Governor's proclamation)[3]
- National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) monthly climate reports[4]
- Local groundwater conservation district assessments[5]

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors create uncertainty in forecasting drought conditions for February 28, 2025:

1. The available data does not directly translate percentage of land area under drought to population affected, making it difficult to precisely estimate how many residents are impacted.

2. Short-term weather patterns could significantly alter drought conditions between late January and late February 2025.

3. The search results do not include specific forecasts extending to February 28, 2025.

4. While we know drought conditions covered 42.29% of Texas as of January 21, 2025, we don't have information about the population density in those specific affected areas.

5. The Palmer Hydrological Drought Index (PHDI) mentioned as a monitoring tool by the Central Texas Groundwater Conservation District could provide additional insights, but specific recent PHDI values aren't included in the available information[5].

Given the extensive coverage of drought conditions across Texas (42.29% of the state) and the inclusion of major population centers in the Governor's disaster declaration, there is a significant possibility that the 15 million resident threshold could be met by February 28, 2025, but precise population figures in drought areas would be needed for a definitive forecast.
