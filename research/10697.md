## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- In 2020, China set a goal for half of all new car sales in 2035 to be electric vehicles (EVs), with the remainder hybrids, effectively ending the sale of internal combustion-only vehicles[1].
- The share of new car sales that were electric in China was 5% in 2019 and 5.7% in 2020[2].
- By 2024, battery electric vehicles (BEVs) accounted for 27.61% of China's passenger car retail sales, reflecting rapid growth in market share[1].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- In April 2025, a multi-agency Chinese government guideline explicitly set the target for BEVs to become the mainstream in new car sales by 2035, marking a shift from earlier policy that grouped hybrids and BEVs together[1].
- The policy aims to integrate clean energy and transportation and promote charging and battery-swapping infrastructure, supporting a low-carbon transition[1].
- The 2025 guideline emphasizes scientific and technological innovation as a key support for this transition[1].

## Authoritative Forecasts

- Counterpoint Research (2025) projects BEV sales penetration in China to exceed 60% by 2035, with plug-in hybrid (PHEV) sales expected to decline as BEVs become dominant[4].
- Market research projects continued strong growth in the overall EV market through 2035, consistent with these trends[5].
- The International Energy Agency (IEA) projected in 2020 that under current policies the EV sales share in China could reach 33.8% by 2030, and up to 42.4% with more aggressive policy measures[2]. These projections are being outpaced in real-world developments.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- The specific breakdown between BEVs, PHEVs, and fuel-cell vehicles in 2035 is still subject to market and policy shifts.
- Policy changes, unforeseen technological advances, or supply chain disruptions could affect the adoption rate.
- Wholesale vs. retail sales data may introduce minor discrepancies.
- The IEA’s actual reported figures in 2035 will be used for resolution; current forecasts are the best available indicators.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Based on current trends, government targets, and authoritative forecasts, it is highly probable (>70% likelihood) that at least 60–65% of new car sales in China in 2035 will be plug-in electric (BEV or PHEV) or fuel-cell vehicles, with BEVs alone likely exceeding 60%. The policy shift and market momentum suggest the total share (including PHEVs and fuel-cell vehicles) could reach or surpass 70% by 2035, barring major disruptions[1][4][5].
