### Key Historical Trends & Current Status

- **Animal Evidence**: In rodents and other animals, caloric restriction (CR) without malnutrition can extend lifespan by 30–50%[5]. Some primate studies also show delayed aging and increased lifespan, though results are heterogeneous[2].
- **Human Evidence**: As of 2020, no randomized controlled trial in humans has demonstrated a direct increase in lifespan from CR due to the impractical length such studies would require. The CALERIE trial, a two-year RCT, showed improvement in metabolic health and aging biomarkers but did not measure lifespan extension[5][4].
- **Healthspan Effects**: Short-term human studies indicate improved cardiometabolic health, reduced inflammation, and changes in biological aging markers (e.g., telomere maintenance), suggesting potential for slowed aging but not quantifying added years[3][5].

### Key Differences Affecting Forecast

- **Biological Complexity in Humans**: Unlike genetically similar lab animals, humans have diverse genetic backgrounds, lifestyles, and environments, likely reducing the effect size and increasing variability[2].
- **Adherence and Long-Term Feasibility**: Sustained, lifelong CR is challenging for most people, which could reduce observed benefits in real-world or even RCT settings.
- **Genotype Dependence**: Some evidence suggests CR benefits may be larger in certain genetic subgroups, introducing further variability[2].
- **Translatability from Models**: While animal data suggest large lifespan gains, translation to humans is not straightforward; most experts expect smaller gains[5][2].

### Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

- **Expected Lifespan Gain**: Given the above, the expected mean lifespan gain reported in a high-quality, long-term human RCT (with strict adherence and early initiation, excluding late starters and dropouts), is likely to fall in the range of **1.0 to 2.0 years**, with a central estimate around **1.5 years**.
- **Upper Bound**: It is highly unlikely, based on current knowledge, that a well-conducted human RCT will report mean lifespan gains approaching the 8-year upper bound or the 30–50% relative increases seen in rodents[5].
- **Uncertainties**: The true gain could be lower or, less likely, moderately higher if future research uncovers stronger effects or better CR protocols. Genotype, adherence, and long-term side effects remain key unknowns[2][5].
