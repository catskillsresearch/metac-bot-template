# Forecasting: Who Will Control Gaza City by August 31, 2025?

As of May 25, 2025, the situation in Gaza continues to evolve rapidly, with several key developments that significantly impact the forecast for who will control Gaza City by August 31, 2025.

## Current Situation Assessment

Since the collapse of the January 2025 ceasefire in mid-March, Israel has launched a new military operation called "Gideon's Chariots," which has resulted in escalated bombardment and expanded ground operations across the Gaza Strip[2]. As of now, approximately 81% of the Gaza Strip is within Israeli-militarized zones or under displacement orders[2]. The Israeli government appears to be planning a further expansion of operations with the stated goal of taking military control of the entire Gaza Strip[1].

On May 5, 2025, Israel's security cabinet approved a large expansion of military operations in Gaza, including the call-up of tens of thousands of reservists. This expansion aims to move most of the Gazan civilian population to the southern part of the Gaza Strip, south of Gaza City, with possible annexation of parts of the territory. Israel's Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich explicitly stated, "we are finally going to conquer the Gaza Strip."

## Key Factors Affecting Control of Gaza City

### Israeli Military Operations

The Israeli military has significantly intensified its operations since March 18, 2025. Recent reports indicate that:

- Bombardment has escalated from air, land, and sea across the Gaza Strip[2]
- Ground operations have expanded as part of the "Gideon's Chariots" military operation[2]
- Israeli forces have reportedly approved plans that would include "flattening" buildings and displacing Gaza's entire population into a single "humanitarian area" if no deal with Hamas is reached by mid-May 2025[5]
- Strikes have intensified in North Gaza, Khan Younis, and Deir al Balah[2]

### Humanitarian Crisis

The humanitarian situation has deteriorated severely, which may impact governance capabilities:

- Humanitarian aid and supplies have not entered Gaza for over ten weeks (since March 2, 2025)[4]
- The UN has warned that the 10-month-long Israeli blockade has exposed around 2.1 million Palestinians to a "critical risk" of famine[3]
- On May 18, 2025, Israel announced it would allow a "basic amount of food" to enter Gaza[3]
- Displacement patterns show people are confined to ever-shrinking spaces[2]

### International Response

Several international developments could influence the outcome:

- The European Parliament is debating the EU's response to Israel's plan to seize Gaza[3]
- France has recognized Palestine, potentially setting a precedent for other nations[1]
- European Parliament political group leaders have expressed serious concern over the threat of further military escalation[3]
- Human Rights Watch has called on parties to the Genocide Convention to take stronger measures, including ending weapons sales and military assistance to Israel[5]

## Probabilistic Assessment of Control Scenarios

Based on the available information as of May 25, 2025, here is a probabilistic assessment of who will likely control Gaza City by August 31, 2025:

### Israel (~65% probability)

Israel appears most likely to control Gaza City by the target date for several reasons:

- The significant military escalation since March 18, 2025, with Operation "Gideon's Chariots"[2]
- The explicit statements from Israeli officials about their intention to "conquer the Gaza Strip"
- The already extensive control of territory (81% of Gaza under Israeli military control or displacement orders)[2]
- The approval of plans to expand military operations and move the civilian population southward
- The severe weakening of Hamas's capabilities after over a year of intense conflict

### Contested (~20% probability)

A contested scenario remains possible if:

- Israeli forces face stronger resistance than anticipated
- International pressure leads to a partial pullback
- Military operations stall due to logistical or political constraints
- Fighting becomes protracted urban warfare with no clear controller of the majority of Gaza City

### Hamas (~5% probability)

Hamas retaining control seems unlikely given:

- The intensity of Israeli military operations
- The stated Israeli goal of eliminating Hamas
- The deteriorating humanitarian situation limiting Hamas's operational capacity
- The extent of territorial control already lost to Israeli forces

### Palestinian Authority/Fatah (~5% probability)

PA/Fatah control could emerge if:

- International pressure forces Israel to accept a PA-led governance solution
- A rapid agreement is reached for PA to take control as Israel withdraws
- This would likely require significant changes in Israeli policy and international intervention

### International Government (~3% probability)

An international governance arrangement faces significant hurdles:

- No concrete plans for international peacekeeping forces have been implemented
- Israel has shown resistance to international intervention
- Establishing such a force would require extensive diplomatic negotiations that seem unlikely to conclude by August

### Shared Power (~2% probability)

A power-sharing arrangement appears least likely given:

- The stated Israeli goal of eliminating Hamas
- The historical tensions between Hamas and Fatah
- The absence of any framework for shared governance in current discussions

## Key Uncertainties

Several factors could significantly alter this forecast:

1. Potential ceasefire negotiations that might emerge before August
2. Changes in US policy or pressure on Israel
3. Unexpected military developments or resistance
4. Further international recognition of Palestine affecting diplomatic dynamics
5. Internal Israeli political changes affecting military strategy

Given the current trajectory of military operations, the explicit statements from Israeli officials, and the extent of territorial control already established, Israel appears most likely to have de facto control of Gaza City by August 31, 2025, barring significant shifts in military strategy or international intervention.
