### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- In the first two months of 2025, irregular border crossings into the EU dropped by 25%, totaling nearly 25,000 arrivals (about 12,500 per month on average)[1][2][3].
- The Central Mediterranean route saw a significant 48% year-on-year increase in arrivals, bucking the overall downward trend[1][4].
- The Eastern Mediterranean and Western Balkan routes experienced substantial declines, with the Eastern Mediterranean down 35% and the Western Balkans down 64%[4].
- In March 2024, the Central Mediterranean route alone recorded around 6,700 arrivals, with the total for the first quarter nearly 11,400 (a 59% year-on-year decrease)[5].
- The Western African route posted record numbers, with over 13,500 arrivals in the first quarter of 2024[5].

### Recent Announcements and Policies

- EU leaders have discussed stricter measures to curb asylum seeker arrivals, which may impact future flows, but as of March 2025, the main effect has been a general decline in arrivals except on the Central Mediterranean route[1][2][3][4].
- Increased enforcement and adverse winter weather have contributed to reduced flows on most routes except the Central Mediterranean[4].

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The Mediterranean Refugees/Migrants Data Portal (UNHCR) is the definitive source for monthly arrival figures, as specified in the resolution criteria.
- Frontex provides monthly updates on irregular migration statistics[1][5].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- Data for March 2025 is not yet available; forecasts rely on trends from Januaryâ€“February 2025 and March 2024.
- Seasonal effects (e.g., improved weather in spring) could increase arrivals in March compared to winter months.
- Policy changes or sudden geopolitical events could alter flows unpredictably.

### Forecast

Based on the most recent data and trends, the number of Mediterranean migrants and refugees entering Europe in March 2025 is most likely to fall in the range of **12,000 to 14,000**.
