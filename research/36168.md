### Key Facts Supporting the Forecast

- Registered sea arrivals to Europe dropped sharply in 2024, with only 66,475 for the entire year, averaging about 5,500 per month[5].
- Irregular border crossings into the EU fell by 25% in the first two months of 2025, totaling nearly 25,000, or about 12,500 per month, but this includes all routes, not just the Mediterranean[3][4].
- The Central Mediterranean route saw a notable increase (+48% year-on-year), but this is offset by declines elsewhere[3][4].
- UNHCR data for Spain (partial Mediterranean arrivals) shows only 323 arrivals in March 2025, indicating low numbers for some routes[2].

### Forecast

Based on the above, the most supported forecast for the number of Mediterranean migrants and refugees entering Europe in March 2025 is:

**Option: 'Under 10,000'**

This is justified by the sharp decline in arrivals throughout 2024, the continued downward trend into early 2025, and the lack of evidence for a significant surge in March 2025 across all Mediterranean routes[3][4][5].

### Verification Source

- The Mediterranean Refugees/Migrants Data Portal by UNHCR is the authoritative source for monthly arrival figures[1].

### Limitations

- Figures are provisional and may be revised.
- Data for March 2025 is not yet final as of the knowledge cutoff.
- Sudden policy changes or external events could alter flows unexpectedly.
