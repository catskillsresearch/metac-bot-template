## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Since the 1979 normalization of US-PRC relations, there has been no major armed conflict between Taiwan and the PRC, though there have been repeated crises and military standoffs[3].
- The last significant military clashes in the Taiwan Strait (the 1950s Taiwan Strait Crises) resulted in hundreds of deaths, showing that even brief armed exchanges can quickly exceed the 100-death threshold.
- In the 2010s and 2020s, the PRC has sharply increased military flights and naval activity near Taiwan, and Taiwan has regularly scrambled aircraft and reinforced civil defense[5].
- Several analysts and military officials (e.g., retired Japanese General Kunio) have suggested timelines for possible conflict, often tied to symbolic years such as the PLA’s centenary in 2027 or the PRC’s 100th anniversary in 2049[1][2].

## Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- As of 2021, Taiwan’s military and international analysts highlighted 2025 as a year by which China could be militarily ready to attempt an invasion[2].
- Taiwan’s government has intensified whole-of-society civil defense drills and explicitly labeled China a hostile force[5].
- Global Guardian and other expert groups have estimated the probability of an all-out invasion by 2030 at around 35%[2], while Metaculus forecasters put the probability of any invasion attempt by 2030 at about 43%[4].
- Scenario planning by futures analysts warns of increasing pressure points, including internal PRC politics, Taiwan’s chip industry, and US strategic commitments[3].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Military and government statements from Taiwan, China, Japan, and the US.
- Expert forecast aggregators (Metaculus, Global Guardian).
- Major think tanks and scenario analyses (Council on Foreign Relations, Brookings, etc.).
- Credible news sources reporting on any armed exchanges and casualties.

## Limitations or Uncertainties in Measurement

- “Armed conflict” is clearly defined, but many incidents (e.g., accidental exchanges, limited clashes) may not be immediately confirmed by three credible government or news sources.
- The probability estimates are based on expert judgment and scenario modeling, not on deterministic data.
- Potential for under- or over-reporting of casualties due to propaganda or information control.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

- Armed conflict resulting in at least 100 deaths is plausible, especially given increased military activity, symbolic milestones, and explicit expert forecasts of 35–43% probability of invasion or major conflict by 2030[2][4].
- The 100-death threshold could be exceeded in even brief or accidental military exchanges, not just in a full-scale invasion.
- However, the risk is not a certainty: significant deterrence exists due to US involvement, economic interdependence, and the global consequences of war.
- Considering expert probabilistic assessments, escalation incentives, and historical reference cases, a reasonable binary forecast as of mid-2021 would assign a probability in the range of 35–45% that at least 100 deaths will result from armed conflict between Taiwan and the PRC before 2050.
