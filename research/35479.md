# Will Andrew Cuomo Run for Mayor of New York City?

As of February 2025, former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo is seriously considering entering the 2025 New York City mayoral race, though he has not yet made a formal announcement. Multiple sources indicate that Cuomo is positioning himself as a potential frontrunner in a race that has been significantly impacted by incumbent Mayor Eric Adams' legal troubles.

## Current Status and Timeline

As of February 19, 2025, Cuomo was reported to be "seriously considering running for New York City mayor" and was planning a family meeting with his three daughters to discuss the potential run and make a decision together[1]. The timing of this decision is particularly significant because:

- Petitioning to gather signatures to run for mayor started on February 21, 2025, and continues until April 3, 2025[1]
- The Cuomo campaign was reportedly looking at the possibility of entering the race in early March 2025, after his family meeting[1]
- According to reports from February 10, 2025, Cuomo remained "undecided" about running[4]

By mid-February 2025, the New York City mayoral race was described as being in a "holding pattern" as candidates waited to see if Cuomo would jump into the race[3].

## Polling and Political Position

Multiple polls show Cuomo with substantial support if he were to enter the race:

- A poll by Progressives for Democracy in America showed Cuomo leading potential Democratic candidates with 32% support, far ahead of his closest competitor Scott Stringer at 10%[1]
- After five rounds of ranked choice voting simulation in the same poll, Cuomo won with 51%, with Stringer in second place at 16%[1]
- Another poll from late January 2025 by Bold Decision showed Cuomo with 33% support, 23 points ahead of Mayor Eric Adams, his next closest competitor[2]

These strong polling numbers suggest Cuomo would enter the race as the frontrunner, despite not being an official candidate yet.

## Political Context

The political landscape in New York City has shifted significantly in Cuomo's favor due to:

1. **Mayor Adams' Legal Troubles**: Incumbent Mayor Eric Adams is facing federal corruption charges and is set to go on trial in April 2025[2]. Adams has also drawn criticism from Democrats for his overtures toward President Trump[2].

2. **Cuomo's Public Reemergence**: Cuomo has been making moves consistent with a potential candidate. On Valentine's Day 2025, he posted a video on social media that was described as resembling a campaign commercial[1].

3. **Organized Opposition**: Despite not being an official candidate, Cuomo is already the target of attack ads from groups like "United for a Brighter Tomorrow," indicating that political opponents view him as a serious threat[2].

## Potential Challenges

Any Cuomo mayoral run would face significant challenges related to his controversial exit from the governor's office:

- Cuomo resigned as governor of New York in 2021 following sexual harassment allegations, which he continues to deny[1][3]
- Critics have also raised concerns about his handling of nursing home deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic[2]

## Analysis

Based on the available information as of February 28, 2025, there are several factors suggesting Cuomo is likely to run:

1. His serious consideration of a run and campaign-like activities
2. Strong polling numbers showing him as the frontrunner
3. The weakened position of incumbent Mayor Adams
4. The timing of his decision-making process aligning with petition deadlines

However, there are also factors that could prevent him from running:

1. The potential impact of past controversies on a campaign
2. The need for family support in his decision
3. The significant political opposition already mobilizing against him

The decision timeline suggests that if Cuomo intends to run, an announcement would likely come in early March 2025, shortly after the February 28, 2025 cutoff date for this analysis.
