# Will "Tariff" Disappear from NYT and WSJ Front Pages Before July 2025?

Based on the current tariff landscape and recent developments, I'll analyze the likelihood of the word "tariff" disappearing from the front pages of both The New York Times and Wall Street Journal on any single day between May 19 and July 1, 2025.

## Current Tariff Landscape (as of May 19, 2025)

The United States is currently experiencing a significant escalation in tariff implementation under President Trump's second term. Current US tariffs are approximately 1.5 times higher than when Trump began his second term in January 2025[3]. This renewed focus on tariffs has created substantial economic impacts and policy responses both domestically and internationally.

Key tariff measures currently in effect include:
- 25% tariffs on automobiles and auto parts, implemented on April 2, 2025[5]
- Partially suspended "reciprocal" tariffs with a 10 percentage point increase applying to most trading partners[4]
- Country-specific measures targeting China, with exemptions for Mexico and Canada[4]
- Temporary exemptions for pharmaceuticals and electronics, though sector-specific measures are expected in coming months[4]

## Recent Developments and Timeline

Several recent developments suggest tariffs will remain a prominent news topic through June 2025:

- **May 8, 2025**: The European Union launched a public consultation on potential countermeasures to US automotive, reciprocal, and aluminum tariffs[1]
- **May 12, 2025**: Analysis showed the 2025 tariffs disproportionately affecting clothing and textiles, with consumers facing 15% higher shoe prices and 14% higher clothing prices[2]
- **May 19, 2025**: J.P. Morgan Research published analysis on President Trump's tariff proposals and their economic impact[5]

Importantly, on April 9, Trump's "reciprocal" tariffs were partially suspended for a 90-day grace period[4]. This grace period will end in early July 2025, just after the resolution timeframe for this question. During this window, a flat 10 percentage point increase still applies to most trading partners.

## Economic Impact Assessment

The economic significance of these tariffs makes them likely to remain prominent in financial news coverage:

- J.P. Morgan Research revised its growth forecast, predicting a 0.2 percentage point hit to US GDP (lowering 2025 growth to 1.3%)[5]
- PCE price inflation for 2025 is expected to climb to 2.7% (up 0.2 percentage points)[5]
- Core PCE inflation is forecast to increase 0.3 percentage points to 3.1%[5]
- Under a "full" implementation scenario, the effective tariff rate on US imports could rise to nearly 38%[4]
- US light vehicle prices could potentially rise by approximately 11.4% on average[5]

## Forecast Analysis

Given the evidence available, it appears highly unlikely that the word "tariff" will disappear from the front pages of both The New York Times and Wall Street Journal on any single day between May 19 and July 1, 2025.

Key factors supporting this assessment:
1. The recency and magnitude of tariff implementations (described by experts as "exceptionally high even by historical standards")[4]
2. Ongoing international responses to US tariffs, including EU countermeasures under consideration[1]
3. The approaching end of the 90-day grace period in early July, which will likely generate anticipatory coverage
4. Expected implementation of additional sector-specific measures for pharmaceuticals and electronics in the "coming months"[4]
5. Significant economic impacts affecting consumers and businesses, making this a prominent news story

While news cycles can be unpredictable, the combination of economic significance, international tensions, and upcoming policy deadlines makes it highly probable that tariffs will remain on at least one of the two newspapers' front pages throughout the specified period.

## Probability Assessment

Based on the available evidence, I assess there is approximately a 10-15% chance that the word "tariff" will disappear from both newspapers' front pages on at least one day between May 19 and July 1, 2025. This low probability reflects the prominence and ongoing nature of the tariff story, while acknowledging that brief news cycle shifts due to major unrelated events remain possible.
