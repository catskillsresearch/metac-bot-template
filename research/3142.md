# Forecasting Human Moon Landings by 2030

As of October 2019, only 12 humans have ever set foot on the lunar surface, all American astronauts who landed during NASA's Apollo program between 1969 and 1972. After nearly five decades without human presence on the Moon, several major initiatives are underway that could significantly increase this number by 2030.

## Current Status and Historical Context

The last human to walk on the Moon was Apollo 17 astronaut Eugene Cernan in December 1972. Since then, no human has returned to the lunar surface, creating a 47-year gap in lunar exploration as of 2019. The 12 Apollo moonwalkers represent the baseline for our forecast.

## Planned Lunar Missions (as of October 2019)

### NASA's Artemis Program

The United States is actively pursuing a return to the Moon through the Artemis program, with stated goals of landing "the first woman and the next man" on the lunar surface by 2024. The program includes:

- Artemis I: An uncrewed test flight of the Orion spacecraft and Space Launch System (SLS) rocket planned to travel around the Moon
- Artemis II: A crewed lunar flyby mission
- Artemis III: A crewed lunar landing mission targeted for 2024

If successful, the initial Artemis III mission would add at least 2-4 new lunar explorers to the historical total.

### International Efforts

Several other nations have expressed interest in sending humans to the Moon:

- China has been methodically building its lunar exploration capabilities through the Chang'e robotic mission series, with long-term goals of establishing a human presence on the Moon
- Russia has shown interest in lunar exploration, though specific crewed landing timelines were not firmly established as of 2019
- The European Space Agency (ESA) and Japan's JAXA have participated in discussions about international lunar exploration

### Private Initiatives

Multiple private companies are developing capabilities that could enable human lunar landings:

- SpaceX is developing the Starship vehicle, which could potentially support human lunar missions
- Blue Origin is developing the Blue Moon lunar lander, which could serve as a delivery system for cargo and eventually humans
- Other private companies are pursuing various components of lunar mission architecture

## Forecast Analysis

Based on information available in October 2019, I assess the following factors affecting the forecast:

1. **Program Timelines**: Space programs historically experience delays. The 2024 Artemis landing target is ambitious given the development status of key systems.

2. **Mission Frequency**: After initial landings, the cadence of subsequent missions will significantly impact the total count.

3. **Crew Sizes**: Apollo missions typically included two moonwalkers per landing. Modern missions might include 2-4 lunar surface crew members.

4. **International Participation**: The likelihood of non-US astronauts reaching the lunar surface by 2030 depends on the pace of international programs and potential cooperation.

5. **Private Sector Role**: Commercial capabilities could either accelerate the timeline or experience their own delays.

## Probabilistic Assessment

Given the information available as of October 2019, I estimate the following probability distribution for the total number of humans who will have landed on the Moon by January 1, 2030:

- 12 people (no new landings): 15% probability
- 13-16 people (1-2 successful missions): 35% probability
- 17-24 people (3-6 successful missions): 30% probability
- 25-36 people (7-12 successful missions): 15% probability
- 37+ people (>12 successful missions): 5% probability

The median estimate is approximately 18 people, suggesting about 6 new lunar explorers by 2030. This assessment reflects the significant technical, budgetary, and political challenges facing lunar return missions, balanced against the substantial resources being committed to these efforts.

Key uncertainties include potential budget constraints, technical challenges in developing new lunar landers, political continuity in supporting these programs, and the pace at which private capabilities mature.
