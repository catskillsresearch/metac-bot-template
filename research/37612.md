# US Crude Oil Production Forecast Assessment: April 2025

As of June 6, 2025, I've analyzed the available data regarding US field production of crude oil for April 2025. Based on the most recent reports and forecasts, I can provide the following assessment.

## Current Production Trends

The US Energy Information Administration (EIA) has recently revised its crude oil production forecast in its May 2025 Short-Term Energy Outlook (STEO). According to this latest projection, US crude oil production is expected to average 13.42 million barrels per day for the full year 2025[5]. This represents a downward revision from the April 2025 STEO, which had previously forecast 13.51 million barrels per day for 2025[5].

For context, US crude oil production averaged 13.21 million barrels per day in 2024[5]. The current forecast still indicates growth compared to 2024, but at a more modest pace than previously expected.

## April 2025 Production Assessment

While specific April 2025 figures aren't explicitly stated in the available data, we can make an informed assessment based on recent trends and revisions:

1. The International Energy Agency (IEA) noted in its April 2025 Oil Market Report that global supply growth for 2025 has been cut by 260,000 barrels per day to 1.2 million barrels per day, partially due to a decrease in US output[2].

2. The downward revision in the EIA's annual forecast from April to May suggests that actual production in the early months of 2025 may have been lower than initially projected.

3. S&P Global has indicated that US crude oil production is now expected to decline in 2026[5], which may reflect a leveling off or early signs of decline already manifesting in 2025.

Given these factors, it appears most likely that US field production of crude oil for April 2025 falls in the range of **13,400 to 13,600 thousand barrels per day, inclusive**. This assessment is based on:

- The annual projection of 13.42 million barrels per day for 2025[5]
- Production typically fluctuates month to month, and April may be slightly above the annual average
- The downward revision of forecasts suggests caution in projecting higher numbers

## Factors Influencing Production

Several factors are currently influencing US crude oil production:

- The EIA notes that increasing oil production is outpacing annual oil demand growth, which is projected to rise by around 1.0 million barrels per day in both 2025 and 2026[1].

- In their April 2025 STEO, the EIA revised their expectation of global oil consumption to increase by 0.9 million barrels per day in 2025 and 1.0 million barrels per day in 2026[3].

- Price projections indicate Brent crude oil prices averaging about $66 per barrel in 2025 and about $59 per barrel in 2026[4], which may affect production decisions.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

This assessment comes with several limitations:

1. The available data provides annual averages rather than specific monthly figures for April 2025.

2. Production can be affected by short-term factors not captured in annual forecasts, such as maintenance schedules, weather events, or temporary shutdowns.

3. The EIA typically releases official monthly production data with a lag of approximately two months, meaning the official April 2025 figures should be available by June 2025, but aren't reflected in the search results.

Given these factors and the information available as of June 6, 2025, the most likely range for US field production of crude oil in April 2025 is 13,400 to 13,600 thousand barrels per day, inclusive.
