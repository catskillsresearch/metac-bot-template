# Boeing Starliner Commercial Crew Program Status Assessment

As of late 2024, Boeing's Starliner program continues to face significant challenges in its journey to become fully operational within NASA's Commercial Crew Program. The program has experienced multiple delays and technical issues that have impacted its timeline for operational status.

## Current Program Status

Boeing's Starliner spacecraft completed its Crew Flight Test (CFT) in mid-2024, which represented a critical milestone in the certification process. The mission launched NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams to the International Space Station[2]. However, following the launch, the integrated Starliner team had to assess the spacecraft's propulsion system performance, indicating technical challenges were encountered during the mission[1].

As of October 2024, Boeing's Starliner has not yet been certified for regular operational missions to the ISS. According to available information, "the first operational flight has not been scheduled" and depends on the successful completion of the final test flight requirements[5]. The certification process requires NASA to evaluate the performance of the spacecraft before approving it for regular crew rotation missions[2].

## Timeline and Operational Readiness

The Commercial Crew Program development process requires four successful demonstrations to achieve human rating for each system:
1. Pad abort test
2. Uncrewed orbital test
3. Launch abort test
4. Crewed orbital test[5]

While Starliner has made progress through these requirements, the timeline for full operational status has been repeatedly pushed back. Current projections indicate that Starliner will not become operational until "no earlier than 2026"[5], which is significantly later than originally planned when the program began in 2011.

## Technical Challenges

The Starliner spacecraft has faced persistent technical issues throughout its development and testing phases. Most recently, following the Crew Flight Test, NASA and Boeing teams have been working to assess propulsion system performance issues[1]. These technical challenges have contributed to the extended timeline for certification.

Despite these challenges, Boeing continues to work on the Starliner program in collaboration with NASA. The spacecraft was designed to accommodate up to seven passengers or a mix of crew and cargo for missions to low-Earth orbit, with the capability to carry four NASA-sponsored crew members for ISS missions[4].

## Program Continuation Outlook

Based on the available information, there is no indication that NASA or Boeing have announced plans to cancel the Starliner program before 2025. The program continues to progress, albeit slowly, through its testing and certification phases. Both NASA and Boeing appear committed to completing the certification process, with teams actively working to address technical issues identified during the Crew Flight Test[1].

However, it's important to note that the timeline for the first operational mission (Starliner-1) has been pushed significantly beyond the original projections. With operational status now projected for no earlier than 2026[5], the program faces a substantial delay compared to its commercial crew counterpart, SpaceX's Crew Dragon, which has been conducting regular operational missions since November 2020[5].

## Limitations in Assessment

There are several limitations in this assessment:

1. The search results provide information only up to October 2024, and more recent developments may have occurred.

2. The specific details about the propulsion system issues encountered during the Crew Flight Test and their severity are not fully described in the available information.

3. Budget considerations and NASA's long-term planning for the Commercial Crew Program beyond what's publicly announced could impact the program's future.

4. Boeing's internal decision-making regarding the financial viability of continuing the program is not fully transparent in public sources.

Based on the available information as of October 2024, the Boeing Starliner program appears to be continuing its development path toward eventual operational status, though with significant delays that push full operational capability beyond 2025. There is no explicit indication in the search results of plans to cancel the program before 2025, though the technical challenges and extended timeline present ongoing concerns for the program's future.
