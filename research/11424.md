1. **Key Historical Trends and Current Status**
   - Andrew Yang, after gaining national attention in the 2020 presidential primaries and 2021 NYC mayoral race, has not held elected office and lost both high-profile campaigns[1][2].
   - In October 2021, he left the Democratic Party and founded the Forward Party, aiming to challenge the two-party system and promote centrist, reform-oriented policies[1][3].
   - The U.S. electoral system heavily favors two major parties; third-party and independent candidates almost never win high federal office. Notable exceptions (e.g., Senators Angus King, Bernie Sanders) usually have strong local bases or switch party affiliations after election.

2. **Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric**
   - Yang’s Forward Party focuses on electoral reforms such as ranked-choice voting and nonpartisan primaries, which, if widely adopted, could modestly improve third-party prospects[1][3].
   - As of early 2025, there is no evidence of major federal electoral success for Yang or Forward; Yang has not announced a successful bid for federal office[1][3].

3. **Authoritative Sources for Verification**
   - Wikipedia’s ongoing Andrew Yang entry documents his career and electoral history[1].
   - Media interviews and coverage of Yang and the Forward Party provide insights into strategy and challenges[3].

4. **Limitations and Uncertainties**
   - U.S. political dynamics are volatile; new parties have occasionally surged, especially during periods of major-party realignment.
   - Systemic barriers (ballot access, funding, media) for third parties remain high.
   - The probability could change if ranked-choice voting or similar reforms become widespread, or if Yang aligns with a major party or wins a unique special election.

**Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment:**  
Given the structural obstacles faced by third-party candidates, the lack of prior electoral victories, and the early-stage nature of the Forward Party as of June 22, 2022, the probability that Andrew Yang will hold high federal office before February 1, 2037 is low—estimated at under 5%. This probability could increase modestly if significant electoral reforms are adopted or if Yang joins a major party and secures a nomination, but such developments are speculative as of the stated date.
