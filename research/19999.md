As of November 18, 2023, there is extremely limited information available to assess the likelihood of Sam Altman being indicted before 2026, as his firing from OpenAI just occurred on November 17, 2023.

## Available Information as of November 18, 2023

The only factual information we have as of November 18, 2023, is:

1. Sam Altman was removed as CEO of OpenAI on November 17, 2023
2. OpenAI's board stated he was "not consistently candid in his communications with the board"
3. The board claimed this hindered their ability to exercise their responsibilities
4. The specific areas in which Altman was allegedly not candid remain unknown

## Forecasting Analysis

Without additional information from the November 2023 timeframe, it's difficult to make a well-grounded forecast about potential legal consequences. The board's statement uses the phrase "not consistently candid," which is intentionally vague and could encompass a wide range of behaviors - from simple communication failures to potentially more serious misrepresentations.

**Key considerations that would affect this forecast:**

- The nature and severity of the alleged non-candid communications is unknown
- Whether these communications involved any potentially illegal activities cannot be determined
- No regulatory investigations had been publicly announced as of November 18, 2023
- No information about financial impropriety or other potentially criminal matters was mentioned in the board's statement

## Limitations of This Assessment

This assessment is severely constrained by:

1. The extremely limited information available just one day after Altman's firing
2. The absence of any specific allegations of criminal wrongdoing in the board's statement
3. No indication of any law enforcement or regulatory interest as of November 18, 2023

Without more specific information from the November 2023 timeframe about the nature of Altman's alleged lack of candor, it is not possible to make a meaningful probabilistic assessment regarding potential indictment before 2026.

The search results provided contain information from 2025, which would not have been available on November 18, 2023, and therefore cannot be used for this historical forecasting exercise.
