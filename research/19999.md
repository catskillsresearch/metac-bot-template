## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- **Sam Altman's Firing and Return:** On November 17, 2023, Sam Altman was fired as CEO of OpenAI for not being "consistently candid" with the board, according to the board's public statement. The specific areas where candor was lacking have not been disclosed, and no public allegations of criminal activity accompanied the firing. By May 2025, Altman is back in control at OpenAI, with a board now more closely aligned with him[1][2].
- **Legal Scrutiny and Civil Litigation:** OpenAI, and by extension Altman, is currently under scrutiny from the attorneys general of California and Delaware and faces civil lawsuits, including a high-profile legal dispute with Elon Musk. The Musk lawsuit is scheduled for trial in March 2025, but the nature of all known actions is civil, not criminal, as of the latest reporting[3][4][5].

## Recent Announcements or Policies Affecting the Metric

- **OpenAI Corporate Governance:** Recent governance changes have tightened Altman's control over the board, making a repeat of the 2023 ouster unlikely, but also potentially increasing regulatory and public scrutiny of OpenAI's decision-making and compliance practices[2].
- **Legal Proceedings Timeline:** Attorneys for both Musk and Altman have indicated that, aside from the March 2025 trial date, full legal resolution could extend beyond 2026, underscoring the slow pace typical of complex tech litigation[4][5].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- News outlets such as Business Insider, Axios, and court documents provide up-to-date coverage of OpenAI's governance and legal situation[1][2][5].
- Public statements from the OpenAI board and filings in the Musk lawsuit are primary sources for recent developments[4][5].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- **Lack of Public Criminal Allegations:** As of May 2025, there are no public criminal investigations or indictments against Sam Altman. Regulatory scrutiny and lawsuits are ongoing, but these are civil in nature.
- **Opaque Board Concerns:** The precise nature of Altman's alleged lack of candor remains undisclosed, leaving open the possibility (albeit apparently remote as of now) that future revelations could trigger criminal investigations.
- **Comparison to Reference Cases:** Criminal indictments of high-profile tech CEOs (e.g., Elizabeth Holmes, Sam Bankman-Fried) have historically followed public revelations of major fraud or misconduct. No such revelations have occurred concerning Altman as of the current date.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the facts as of May 2025:
- There is currently no public evidence or credible report of an active criminal investigation into Sam Altman.
- All known legal actions are civil, and the timeline for lawsuits indicates a slow legal process.
- Regulatory scrutiny could, in theory, uncover criminal conduct, but this remains speculative.
- Compared to reference cases, the absence of public criminal allegations makes indictment before 2026 unlikely.

**Adjusted probability: The likelihood that Sam Altman will be indicted before January 1, 2026, appears low based on all currently available information. However, this assessment is subject to change if new facts emerge.**
