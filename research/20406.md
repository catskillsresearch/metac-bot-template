## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- **Presidential Incumbency and Re-election:** Historically, U.S. presidential elections are influenced by incumbency, party loyalty, and public sentiment. As of December 2023, polling showed a very close race between Donald Trump and Joe Biden, with a Quinnipiac poll showing Biden at 47% and Trump at 46%, "too close to call" at that time[3]. Other polls from the period also indicated a highly competitive race, with neither candidate holding a decisive lead[1][2].

- **Constitutional Limits:** The U.S. Constitution's 22nd Amendment limits an individual to two elected terms as President, creating a high barrier to any legal retention of "supreme executive power" beyond eight years.

- **Historical Precedents:** No U.S. president has successfully sought a third term since the 22nd Amendment's ratification. Notably, American institutional resilience has historically prevented any single individual from establishing a dictatorship or emperor-like role.

## 2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- **Trump's Own Statements:** Trump has made ambiguous statements regarding term limits. While he has joked about staying beyond two terms and cited grievances justifying an extension, he has also publicly stated he would not seek a third term and downplayed the need for more than four years.

- **Public/Media Discourse:** Commentary, such as Robert Kagan's article, has raised concerns about a drift toward authoritarianism, but these are largely cautionary analyses rather than evidence of imminent constitutional subversion.

- **2024 Election Polling:** As of late 2023, polling indicated a highly polarized electorate. Women, for example, increasingly favored Biden over Trump, while men leaned more toward Trump, and independent voters were split[3]. No evidence suggested overwhelming popular support for permanently extending Trump's tenure.

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- **Polling Data:** Quinnipiac University, Monmouth University, Reuters/Ipsos, PRRI, and Wikipedia's aggregation of polling data[1][2][3][4][5].
- **Legal Analysis:** The U.S. Constitution, relevant amendments, and scholarly legal discussion on eligibility and succession.
- **Media Reports:** Coverage of Trump's statements and public responses.

## 4. Key Differences Affecting the Forecast

- **Legal Barriers:** The 22nd Amendment and the broader U.S. constitutional structure create immense obstacles to any individual holding power beyond two elected terms, short of extraordinary and unprecedented constitutional crisis or coup.

- **Institutional Resilience:** The U.S. military, judiciary, and civil bureaucracy have historically defended constitutional succession and resisted extra-legal usurpation of power.

- **Political Will and Public Support:** While Trump's base is large and loyal, there is no evidence as of December 2023 of majority support for abolishing or circumventing term limits or for accepting an indefinite Trump tenure[3][5].

- **Precedent:** Unlike in the cases of Caesar, Napoleon, or Hitler, the U.S. has no tradition or mechanism for establishing a new "supreme executive" office outside constitutional norms.

## 5. Limitations and Uncertainties

- **Black Swan Events:** Scenarios such as large-scale civil unrest, military intervention, or constitutional crisis could upend precedents, but are historically rare and not forecastable with high confidence.

- **Ambiguous Statements:** Trump's varying public comments leave room for speculation but do not constitute a policy or plan for extra-constitutional retention of power.

- **Measurement Uncertainty:** Polls capture intent at the time but may not predict turnout, electoral college outcomes, or extraordinary events.

## 6. Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

- **Trump Winning the 2024 Election:** As of December 2023, the probability is close to 50%, reflecting a highly competitive and polarized political environment[3][5].
- **Trump Retaining "Supreme Executive Power" Past 2028:** Given the 22nd Amendment and absence of any plausible mechanism or majority support for constitutional subversion, the likelihood is extremely low (well below 5%) absent a catastrophic breakdown of democratic institutions.

## Summary Table

| Scenario                        | Probability (as of Dec 2023) |
|----------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Trump wins 2024 election         | ~50%                         |
| Trump retains power past 2028    | <5%                          |
