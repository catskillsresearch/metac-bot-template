# Forecast Analysis: Kalshi's Daily Baseball Markets in June 2025

As of May 31, 2025, I've analyzed the available information to assess whether Kalshi will offer markets on daily baseball games throughout June 2025.

## Current Status and Historical Trends

Kalshi has been rapidly expanding its sports prediction market offerings in 2025. The platform launched moneyline betting on single baseball games in April 2025, including a full schedule of 15 games on a Wednesday and 10 games on Thursday[4]. More recently, as of May 23, 2025, Kalshi has expanded to offer MLB win totals[2].

Since launching sports event contracts in late January 2025, Kalshi has processed approximately 2.2 million trades worth a collective $653 million across all sports categories[5]. However, it's worth noting that baseball betting volume was described as "anemic" compared to other sports, generating just over $400,000 in trading over a two-day period with a full schedule of games[4].

## Recent Developments and Strategic Direction

Kalshi has demonstrated a clear strategic commitment to expanding its sports betting offerings. A Kalshi spokesperson indicated that "in general it is safe to assume that if there is a major sporting event, we will likely have an offering on it"[5]. This suggests the company intends to maintain coverage of MLB games, which are major daily sporting events throughout June.

The company appears undeterred by potential regulatory challenges. As noted in recent reporting, "Kalshi keeps expanding; neither the CFTC nor the courts have shown any interest in slowing any of it down, to date"[2]. This indicates organizational confidence in their ability to continue offering these markets.

However, Kalshi is also learning about "the seasonality of sports betting," with industry analysts noting that "the next four months will see fairly minimal betting action until football returns in September"[2]. This seasonal lull might affect how aggressively Kalshi promotes its baseball offerings, though not necessarily whether they offer them at all.

## Regulatory Environment

The regulatory landscape remains somewhat uncertain. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) scheduled a meeting with tribal gaming interests on May 29, 2025[2], which could potentially impact Kalshi's operations. Additionally, legal experts have identified "multiple ways state regulators could stop Kalshi"[5].

A judge has indicated he will "move quickly on Kalshi prediction market case," suggesting an imminent ruling that could affect Kalshi's ability to offer sports prediction markets. However, the specific timeline and potential outcomes of this case remain unclear from the available information.

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on the available evidence, I assess a **high probability (approximately 80-85%)** that Kalshi will offer markets on daily baseball games every day in June 2025, for the following reasons:

1. Kalshi has already demonstrated the technical capability to offer daily baseball markets[4]
2. The company has explicitly stated its intention to cover major sporting events[5]
3. MLB games represent the primary daily professional sports content available in June
4. Despite "anemic" trading volume, baseball represents an important vertical during the summer months when other major sports are in their offseason
5. There is no indication in recent reporting that Kalshi plans to discontinue or interrupt its baseball offerings

The primary uncertainties that could prevent this outcome include:
- A sudden adverse regulatory ruling from the pending court case
- Technical or operational issues that might interrupt service
- Strategic decision to pause baseball markets due to low trading volume

## Limitations and Uncertainties

This forecast is limited by several factors:
- Lack of specific information about Kalshi's internal plans for June 2025
- Uncertainty around the timeline and outcome of pending regulatory actions
- Limited data on the profitability and sustainability of Kalshi's baseball markets
- Potential for MLB schedule changes or interruptions that could affect market availability
