# IMF Global Recession Forecast Analysis: 2025-2026

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has recently updated its economic projections, providing valuable insights for assessing the likelihood of a global recession before 2026. As of the latest available data from April 2025, the IMF has not declared a global recession, though economic indicators show concerning trends.

## Current Economic Outlook

The IMF has significantly downgraded its growth projections in its April 2025 World Economic Outlook report. Global economic growth is now forecast at just 2.8% for 2025, representing a substantial reduction from the 3.3% projected in January 2025[5]. For 2026, the IMF projects global growth of 3%, also below previous estimates of 3.3%[5].

IMF Chief Economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas has characterized the current situation as entering "a new era" where "the global economic system that has operated for the last eighty years is being reset"[4]. This language signals a recognition of fundamental shifts in the global economic landscape.

## Recession Probability Assessment

While the IMF is not currently forecasting a global recession, the organization has explicitly increased the probability of such an outcome:

- The likelihood of a global recession in 2025 has increased to 30%, up from 17% in October 2024[4]
- For the United States specifically, recession probability has risen to 37%, up from 25% in October 2024[4][5]

These probability increases reflect growing concerns about economic stability but fall short of an outright recession prediction.

## Key Risk Factors

Several factors are contributing to the deteriorating outlook:

1. **Trade Policy Uncertainty**: The IMF specifically cites uncertainty over trade policies as a major driver of economic slowdown projections. The forecasts were finalized on April 4, 2025, shortly after the announcement of sweeping tariffs by the Trump administration[4].

2. **Tariff Escalation**: The IMF has warned that "America's tariff war with trade partners" represents "a major negative shock to growth" and that further escalation could impede both near-term and long-term economic expansion[4].

3. **Divergent Economic Performance**: While global growth is slowing, there are significant differences between advanced economies and emerging markets. This uneven performance contributes to systemic instability[1].

## Comparison to Historical Indicators

The current situation exhibits some concerning parallels with pre-recession periods, particularly in terms of policy uncertainty and trade tensions. However, it's worth noting that the IMF's baseline forecast still shows positive growth through 2025 and into 2026, albeit at reduced rates.

## Conclusion

Based on the latest IMF projections, a global recession before 2026 is possible but not currently the most likely outcome according to the IMF's official position. The organization has explicitly increased the probability to 30%, reflecting heightened risk, but maintains a baseline forecast of continued positive growth. The situation remains fluid, with trade policy developments representing a particularly significant variable that could further alter the outlook.

The IMF has not used the term "recession" to describe its current global forecast for 2025-2026, which is a key criterion for resolving the forecasting question. Instead, they have characterized the situation as a slowdown with increased recession risk.
