Based on the latest IMF forecasts and economic indicators, I'll assess the likelihood of a global recession before 2026.

## Current Economic Situation

The International Monetary Fund's April 2025 World Economic Outlook presents a concerning picture of global economic health. The IMF has significantly downgraded its growth projections, forecasting global growth of just 2.8% for 2025, a substantial reduction from its January 2025 projection of 3.3%[3][5]. This represents a marked slowdown from previous years and indicates deteriorating economic conditions worldwide.

The IMF's chief economist, Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, has characterized the current situation with gravity, stating: "We are entering a new era. This global economic system that has operated for the last eighty years is being reset."[4][5] This language suggests a fundamental shift in global economic dynamics rather than a temporary slowdown.

## Recession Probability Assessment

While the IMF has not yet explicitly declared a global recession, they have significantly increased their assessment of recession risk:

- The probability of a global recession in 2025 has increased to 30%, up from 17% in October 2024[4]
- For the United States specifically, recession probability has risen to approximately 37-40%, up from 25% in late 2024[4][5]

These probability increases reflect growing concerns about economic stability, particularly in light of trade tensions and policy shifts.

## Key Contributing Factors

Several specific factors are driving the deteriorating outlook:

1. **Trade Conflicts**: The escalating trade war initiated by the Trump administration is identified as a primary driver of economic slowdown. The IMF explicitly states that this represents "a major negative shock to growth"[4].

2. **Declining Trade Growth**: Global trade growth is projected to fall to just 1.7% in 2025, a significant downward revision from previous forecasts[3].

3. **Widespread Growth Downgrades**: Major economies are experiencing substantial forecast reductions:
   - U.S. growth reduced to 1.8% for 2025, down 0.9% from January forecasts and a full percentage point below the previous year's projection[4]
   - China's growth outlook cut to 4% for both 2025 and 2026, approximately half a percentage point lower than previous forecasts[5]

## Forecast Assessment

Based on the available information, while the IMF has not yet declared a global recession, the economic indicators show a clear negative trajectory. The significant downward revisions to growth forecasts, increased recession probabilities, and explicit warnings about trade tensions suggest the global economy is approaching a potential tipping point.

The IMF's language about "entering a new era" and the "reset" of the global economic system indicates structural rather than cyclical concerns. This suggests that even if a technical recession is avoided in the immediate term, the economic outlook remains precarious.

It's important to note that for the forecasting question to resolve as "Yes," the IMF would need to explicitly use the word "recession" when referring to the global economy in an official capacity before January 1, 2026. While recession probabilities have increased substantially, the IMF has not yet made such a declaration as of May 2025.

Given the deteriorating indicators, increasing recession probabilities, and explicit concerns about trade conflicts, there is a significant and growing risk that the IMF may declare a global recession before 2026, though they have not yet done so.
