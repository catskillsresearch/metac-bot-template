# Forecasting World Records at the 2024 Paris Olympics

Based on historical data and current athletic performances, this analysis examines the likelihood of at least 24 world records being broken at the 2024 Paris Olympics.

## Historical Trends

The number of world records broken at recent Summer Olympics shows a relatively consistent pattern:
- London 2012: 32 world records
- Rio de Janeiro 2016: 23 world records
- Tokyo 2020: 27 world records

This gives an average of approximately 27 world records per Olympic Games over the last three editions, suggesting that the threshold of 24 records is historically achievable.

## Potential Record-Breaking Events in Paris 2024

Several athletes and events have been identified as having strong potential for world record performances at the Paris Olympics:

### Swimming
- **Women's 100m Backstroke**: Analysis indicates this is the event most likely to see a new world record set at the Paris Games[5]
- **Men's 1500m Freestyle**: Ahmed Hafnaoui and Bobby Finke came very close to breaking Sun Yang's 2012 world record last year, creating a "reasonably high probability" that this long-standing record will fall in Paris[5]
- **Women's Swimming Events**: Data analysis shows that women's swimming events generally have greater chances of world records being broken compared to men's events[5]

### Track and Field
- **Pole Vault**: Mondo Duplantis (nicknamed "Unstoppable 'Mondo'") is specifically mentioned as a threat to break the world record[1][2]
- **100m Hurdles**: The women's event features multiple potential record breakers:
  - Tobi Amusan (current record holder)
  - Keni Harrison (former record holder)
  - Jasmine Camacho-Quinn (reigning Olympic Champion)
  - Danielle Williams (reigning World Champion)
  - Masai Russell and Brittany Anderson (rising 23-year-old talents)[2]

## Factors Influencing Record-Breaking Potential

Several factors could influence the total number of world records broken:

1. **Olympic Year Effect**: Historical data suggests that Olympic years often see heightened performances as athletes peak for the Games

2. **Competitive Depth**: In events like the women's 100m hurdles, the intense competition among multiple elite athletes could push performances to record levels[2]

3. **Technological Advancements**: While not explicitly mentioned in the search results, advancements in equipment, training methods, and recovery techniques typically contribute to improved performances

4. **Event Scheduling**: Some events, like the 100m hurdles, are strategically scheduled (on the final day of the Olympic schedule in Paris) which can create optimal conditions for record attempts[2]

## Limitations and Uncertainties

The prediction of Olympic world records faces several limitations:

1. **Unpredictable Conditions**: Weather, pressure, and competition dynamics can significantly impact performances

2. **Selective Information**: The search results highlight only a handful of potential record-breaking events rather than providing a comprehensive analysis across all Olympic sports

3. **Historical Variability**: The significant variation between recent Olympics (23-32 records) demonstrates the unpredictability of record-breaking performances

Based on the historical average of 27 world records per Olympics and the specific events identified as having record potential, there appears to be a reasonable possibility that at least 24 world records could be broken at the 2024 Paris Olympics. However, the actual outcome will depend on numerous factors including athlete form, competition conditions, and the unpredictable nature of elite sports performance.
