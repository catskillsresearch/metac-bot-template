## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of the two-week period ending October 12, 2024, the CDC’s Nowcast estimate for XEC in the US was 10.7%, up sharply from 2.3% in the prior period. KP.3.1.1 remains the dominant variant, with a Nowcast estimate of 57.2% and a weighted estimate of 41.2%[2].
- CDC projections as of October 26, 2024, indicate XEC represents 14–22% of circulating viruses and is increasing, while KP.3.1.1 is at 54–60% and its growth is slowing[2].
- XEC has demonstrated a rapid growth advantage, with some experts and a recent preprint study suggesting it could outcompete KP.3.1.1 and other major lineages[2].
- Historically, new variants with a significant growth advantage (such as JN.1) have been able to reach dominance within a few months, but the pace and ceiling of XEC’s rise remain uncertain[4].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- The CDC and other health authorities are closely monitoring XEC due to its rapid increase and unique spike protein mutations, which may impact transmissibility and immune escape[2][3].
- No major new public health policies specifically targeting XEC have been announced as of early November 2024, but ongoing genomic surveillance and vaccine updates continue[4].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The CDC’s COVID Data Tracker variant proportions page is the definitive source for weighted estimates and will be used to resolve this question[2][4].
- Additional context and updates can be found in CDC situation reports and peer-reviewed or preprint studies on XEC’s virological characteristics[2][3].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- The CDC’s weighted estimates lag behind real-time trends due to the time required for sample processing and sequencing. As a result, rapid changes in variant proportions may not be immediately reflected in the weighted data[2].
- Nowcast estimates, while more current, are model-based and not used for official resolution due to their greater uncertainty.
- The competitive dynamics between XEC and KP.3.1.1, as well as the potential emergence of new variants, introduce additional unpredictability.
- The CDC only reports a lineage separately if it exceeds 1% weighted prevalence and has spike mutations of concern, which XEC currently meets[2].

## Summary

- XEC is rapidly increasing in prevalence and has a plausible path to dominance, but as of the latest available data, it remains well below 50% in the CDC’s weighted estimates.
- KP.3.1.1’s growth is slowing, and XEC’s growth advantage is supported by both empirical trends and laboratory studies.
- Whether XEC will reach at least 50% of the weighted CDC variant proportions before January 5, 2025, remains uncertain and will depend on its continued growth relative to KP.3.1.1 and other emerging variants.
- The CDC’s weighted estimate is the only metric that will be used for resolution, and it is subject to reporting delays.
