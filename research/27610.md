# Ukrainian Forces in Kursk Oblast: Forecasting Potential Capture of Kursk Nuclear Plant

As of mid-August 2024, Ukrainian forces have made significant advances into Russia's Kursk Oblast, creating a situation that requires careful analysis regarding the potential capture of the Kursk Nuclear Plant before October 1, 2024.

## Current Status and Recent Developments

Ukrainian forces launched a major cross-border operation into Russia's Kursk Oblast in early August 2024, representing the most significant push into Russian territory since the beginning of the war. As of August 12, 2024, Ukrainian forces had reportedly seized 28 settlements in Kursk Oblast and advanced approximately 12 kilometers deep along a 40-kilometer-long front, according to Kursk Oblast Governor Alexei Smirnov[2].

Geolocated footage has confirmed Ukrainian forces operating up to 24 kilometers from the international border[2]. The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) has observed claims that Ukrainian forces had advanced into roughly 800 square kilometers of Russian territory as of August 12, though ISW does not assess that Ukrainian forces control all areas within the maximalist extent of claimed advances[2].

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has acknowledged the ongoing operation in Kursk Oblast and mentioned that the Ukrainian government is preparing plans to address humanitarian issues in areas where Ukrainian forces are operating[2].

## Nuclear Safety Concerns

The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi has appealed to all sides to "exercise maximum restraint in order to avoid a nuclear accident with the potential for serious radiological consequences"[1]. This statement came as Ukrainian forces were reported to be in the vicinity of Russia's Kursk nuclear plant[1].

This concern for nuclear safety parallels ongoing issues at Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which has been under Russian control. A fire was reported at one of Zaporizhzhia's cooling towers in mid-August 2024, with IAEA staff witnessing smoke and reporting multiple explosions at the facility[1].

## Russian Response and Defensive Measures

Regional Russian officials have offered notably frank assessments of the Ukrainian incursion. Belgorod Oblast Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov expressed concern on August 12 about "alarming" Ukrainian activity along the border with Belgorod Oblast[2].

While specific information about Russian defensive measures around the Kursk Nuclear Plant is limited in the provided search results, the precedent at other nuclear facilities suggests Russia would likely prioritize defending such strategic infrastructure.

## Factors Affecting Potential Capture

Several factors may influence whether Ukrainian forces could capture the Kursk Nuclear Plant before October 1, 2024:

1. **Rate of Advance**: Ukrainian forces demonstrated rapid initial progress, advancing up to 24 kilometers from the border within days of the incursion[2]. The sustainability of this pace remains uncertain.

2. **Russian Counteroffensive Capability**: Russia's ability to stabilize frontlines and mount effective counteroffensives will significantly impact Ukrainian progress.

3. **International Pressure**: Given IAEA concerns about nuclear safety, international diplomatic pressure may influence military operations near the nuclear facility[1].

4. **Strategic Objectives**: It remains unclear whether capturing the Kursk Nuclear Plant is a primary objective of the Ukrainian incursion or if other strategic goals take precedence.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several significant limitations affect forecasting this outcome:

1. **Fog of War**: Information from active combat zones is often incomplete, delayed, or contradictory.

2. **Dynamic Situation**: The military situation in Kursk Oblast remains highly fluid, with frontlines potentially shifting rapidly.

3. **Strategic Intentions**: Ukrainian military leadership has not publicly declared specific objectives regarding the Kursk Nuclear Plant.

4. **Distance Considerations**: The search results do not specify the exact distance between the furthest Ukrainian advance and the Kursk Nuclear Plant as of mid-August 2024.

The situation in Kursk Oblast continues to evolve rapidly, and developments in late August and September will be critical in determining whether Ukrainian forces can reach and capture the Kursk Nuclear Plant before October 1, 2024.
