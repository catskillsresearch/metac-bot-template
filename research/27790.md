### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- OpenAI's most recent flagship model, GPT-4o, was announced on May 13, 2024.
- As of late May 2024, OpenAI confirmed it was training its next major model, sometimes referred to as the "next frontier model," but did not officially name it GPT-5 or release any performance results[2].
- Business Insider reported in March 2024 that OpenAI was expected to launch GPT-5 "mid-year, likely during summer," and that enterprise demos had occurred[3]. However, no public announcement or official documentation from OpenAI about GPT-5 was released as of August 29, 2024.

### Recent Announcements and Policies

- No official OpenAI blog post, paper, or video announcing GPT-5 or describing its performance results has been published as of August 29, 2024.
- Community and industry sources suggest that while training is underway, the public release or announcement of GPT-5 is not imminent before September 30, 2024[2][3][5].

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- OpenAI's official blog and press releases
- Major technology news outlets (e.g., Business Insider)
- Community forecasting platforms (e.g., Metaculus)

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- OpenAI could make a surprise announcement at any time, but as of August 29, 2024, there is no qualifying document or official statement meeting the resolution criteria.
- Forecasts and rumors do not constitute an official announcement.

### Conclusion

Based on all available factual information as of August 29, 2024, there is no evidence that OpenAI has announced GPT-5 or published any document describing its performance results. The consensus among industry observers and forecasting communities is that a public announcement is more likely after September 30, 2024.

**Therefore, the answer is: No, OpenAI is unlikely to announce GPT-5 before September 30, 2024, based on all information available as of August 29, 2024.**
