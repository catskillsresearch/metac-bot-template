## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Bashar al-Assad and his family have ruled Syria for decades, maintaining power through repression and tightly controlled elections[4].
- The 2024 parliamentary elections, held in July, were organized by Assad's regime and widely criticized as lacking credibility. Assad remained in power after these elections, appointing a new prime minister in September 2024[1][2].
- The Syrian constitution, as of 2012, would have allowed Assad to remain president until 2028, barring extraordinary developments[2].

## Recent Announcements and Developments

- In late November and early December 2024, a coalition of armed opposition factions launched a major offensive in northern Syria, capturing hundreds of towns and cities, including Aleppo, Syria's second-largest city. Regime front lines collapsed rapidly[3].
- Authoritative sources report that Assad's regime fell on December 8, 2024, following this offensive[5].
- Amnesty International confirms that Bashar al-Assad was ousted from power in December 2024, ending decades of Assad family rule[4].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Amnesty International and the Council on Foreign Relations both report Assad's ouster in December 2024[4][5].
- Foreign Policy details the rapid collapse of regime control and the loss of major territory to opposition forces in early December 2024[3].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- While the sources are authoritative and consistent, the precise date of Assad's removal is reported as December 8, 2024[5]. There is no credible evidence that Assad remained president after this date.
- The situation in Syria is highly fluid, and information can be difficult to verify independently. However, the convergence of multiple reputable sources supports the conclusion.

## Conclusion

Based on all available factual information as of December 5, 2024, Bashar al-Assad will not be President of Syria on December 31, 2024. He was ousted from power in early December 2024 following a rapid rebel offensive and regime collapse[4][5][3].
