## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Mark Carney became Canadian Prime Minister in spring 2025, leading the Liberal Party to a notable electoral turnaround[1][2][3].
- Since his swearing-in, Carney has led in approval polls, with the Liberal Party's popularity rising, culminating in their electoral victory[1].
- A March 2025 Ipsos poll showed 44% of Canadians selected Carney as "best Prime Minister," a double-digit lead over his main opponent[4].
- Carney is perceived as the best leader for economic management and for navigating tough relations with the US under President Trump[4]. His approval is bolstered by his reputation as a pro-business, pragmatic leader[1][4].

- Donald Trump, meanwhile, has returned to the US presidency. While no direct 2025 approval ratings are cited, historically his approval ratings have been highly polarized and, in Morning Consult's global tracker, often lower than those of most G7 peers.

## Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- Carney’s new cabinet (announced May 13, 2025) departs from Trudeau’s model, featuring fewer ministers and new secretaries of state, signaling a focus on efficiency and economic growth[1].
- Carney has emphasized pro-business policies and is moving to distance his leadership from the Trudeau era[1].
- Ongoing Canada-US tensions, with Carney seen as a strong negotiator in dealing with Trump, likely boost his domestic approval[4][5].
- Trump’s policies and rhetoric continue to spark controversy and division, both domestically and internationally, which has historically depressed his approval ratings.

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The resolution source is Morning Consult’s Global Leader Approval tracker, updated monthly and referenced by Metaculus for resolution after July 1, 2025.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- No direct Morning Consult approval numbers for Carney or Trump from May 2025 were found; all inferences are from secondary polling and historical trends[1][4].
- Approval ratings may shift significantly in the run-up to July 1, 2025, especially given the volatility of Trump’s ratings and the unpredictability of new governments.
- Morning Consult’s seven-day moving average smooths but does not eliminate the impact of short-term events.

## Probabilistic Assessment

Given:
- Carney’s strong public standing post-election,
- Favorable perception as a leader during economic and diplomatic challenges,
- The historical tendency for Trump’s approval to lag behind other G7 leaders,

It is moderately likely (estimated 65–75%) that Mark Carney will have a higher Morning Consult approval rating than Donald Trump on July 1, 2025, barring unforeseen domestic or international crises that could sharply affect either leader’s standing.
