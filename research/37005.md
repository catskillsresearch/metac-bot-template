### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The Liberal Party, led by Mark Carney since March 2025, has seen a significant surge in support following his succession of Justin Trudeau. This leadership change, combined with a strong stance against U.S. tariffs, has shifted public opinion markedly in the Liberals' favor[1][2].
- At the time of Parliament's dissolution, the Liberals held 153 seats. The threshold for a majority is 170 seats[1].
- Recent projections indicate the Liberals are likely to win 196 seats, well above the 172-seat threshold in question. The Conservatives are projected at 122 seats, with the Bloc Québécois and NDP at 19 and 5 seats, respectively[1].
- The probability of the Liberals winning a majority is estimated at 86%, with only a 12% chance of winning the most seats without a majority, and just a 1% chance for a Conservative majority[1].

### Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Metric

- Mark Carney's ascension to party leadership and his government's strong policy positions, particularly regarding trade with the U.S., have been credited with the recent surge in Liberal support[1][2].
- Polls conducted during the campaign show the Liberals with a double-digit lead over the Conservatives, with national support levels (46–49%) that typically translate to a majority government[3][5].
- The Liberals are leading in key regions: Ontario, Quebec, Atlantic Canada, and British Columbia, with especially strong support among women, university graduates, and older Canadians[3][5].

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- 338Canada Federal Projection (Philippe J. Fournier)
- Ipsos polling data[3]
- EKOS Research Associates[5]
- Major news outlets such as NDTV and CTV News[1][4]

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- All projections are based on current polling data, which can change before election day due to campaign events, debates, or unforeseen developments.
- Regional volatility, particularly in British Columbia and Alberta, could affect seat counts, though current trends show the Liberals with a stable lead[5].
- While there is little evidence of a "soft" Liberal vote, turnout and last-minute shifts remain inherent risks in any electoral forecast[5].
