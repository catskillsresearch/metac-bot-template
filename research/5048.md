## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status (as of September 2020)

- The UK formally left the EU on January 31, 2020, after a 2016 referendum (52% leave, 48% remain) and a complex parliamentary process. As of September 2020, the UK was in a transition period set to end on December 31, 2020, with the future relationship still under negotiation[1].
- Opinion polling in the months after Brexit showed some increase in "regret" and support for rejoining, but not at unequivocally high or sustained levels. Political divisions remained deep, with significant portions of the public and most major political parties not advocating re-accession[1].
- Re-accession would require a formal application under Article 49 of the Maastricht Treaty, unanimous support from all EU member states, and likely new terms—potentially including obligations to join the euro and Schengen Area, and with fewer opt-outs than the UK previously had[1].
- No precedent exists for a former member state rejoining after full withdrawal, especially so soon after leaving.

## 2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- As of September 2020, the Conservative Party (in government) and Labour Party (largest opposition) had no policy supporting rejoining the EU. Only smaller parties, such as the Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru, and the Green Party, advocated re-accession[1].
- EU officials and commentators signaled that any UK application would face significant scrutiny and require clear, sustained public support (at minimum, sustained 60%+ support in opinion polls), as well as political stability[1].
- There were no formal government statements or legislative moves indicating imminent interest in rejoining.

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Wikipedia: "Potential re-accession of the United Kingdom to the European Union" provides an overview of the process, party positions, and public opinion as of 2020[1].
- Academic analysis (e.g., writings by political scientist Anthony Salamone) and policy think tanks (e.g., LSE Brexit blog) further detail the procedural hurdles and likely EU requirements for re-accession[1].

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- Political volatility: UK party positions or public opinion could shift rapidly due to economic, geopolitical, or social events.
- EU context: The EU’s willingness to readmit the UK may depend on the bloc’s own evolution and priorities, as well as member states' attitudes.
- No historical precedent: The lack of a template for a "rejoin" process makes timing and requirements highly uncertain.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment (as of September 2020)

Given the above, the probability of the UK rejoining the European Union—with an accession treaty in force—before 2030 was low. Key factors included the absence of political momentum in major parties, the complexity and duration of the accession process, and the likely requirement for clear, sustained public support. A plausible estimate (as of 2020) would be well below 20%, barring dramatic and unforeseen political changes.
