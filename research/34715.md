# Forecasting the National Weather Service's Adoption of "Gulf of America"

Based on information available as of February 9, 2025, here is an analysis of whether the National Weather Service (NWS) will refer to the "Gulf of America" instead of the "Gulf of Mexico" before April 1, 2025.

## Current Status

As of February 5, 2025, President Donald Trump issued an executive order to rename the Gulf of Mexico to the "Gulf of America."[1] However, at that time, it was not yet policy for the National Weather Service and other government agencies to use the new term. Weather forecasts from the agency's meteorologists across the country were still referring to the "Gulf of Mexico" or simply "the gulf."[1]

## Implementation Process

The implementation process involves the U.S. Department of Interior adding the new term "Gulf of America" to the database of geographic names and removing all references to the "Gulf of Mexico."[1] Once this change is made in the official database, agencies including the Weather Service will be expected to abide by the change.[1]

## Timeline and Likelihood

The executive order was issued on February 5, 2025, leaving less than two months until the April 1, 2025 deadline. While the order directs the change to occur, there is no specific timeline provided for when the Department of Interior will update its database or when the National Weather Service must implement the change in its communications.

Government agencies typically require time to implement such changes across their systems and communications channels. The NWS operates numerous forecast products, websites, and automated systems that would need to be updated to reflect the new terminology.

## Historical Context

This is not the first case of geographic name disputes. Professor Mark Monmonier notes that North and South Korea have been in dispute with Japan over the naming of the Sea of Japan/East Sea since the 1990s, and Iran has sought to rename the Persian Gulf to the Gulf of Iran.[1] However, Monmonier indicates that given how long-standing the Gulf of Mexico name has been, he doesn't see a logical reason to change it.[1]

## Uncertainties

Several factors could affect whether the NWS will implement this change before April 1, 2025:

1. The speed at which the Department of Interior updates its geographic database
2. Administrative procedures and technical requirements for implementing the change across NWS systems
3. Potential legal or political challenges to the executive order
4. Coordination with international bodies and neighboring countries that also border the Gulf
