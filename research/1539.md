## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of 2018, the global average temperature had already increased by approximately 1°C above pre-industrial levels (relative to 1850–1900)[5].
- Greenhouse gas emissions continued to rise, driven by population and economic growth, with no significant additional global mitigation commitments beyond the Paris Agreement pledges[1][4].
- The IPCC’s AR5 synthesis (2014) projected that, **without additional mitigation**, median warming by 2100 would reach between **3.7°C and 4.8°C** above the 1850–1900 average, with a likely range that includes values above 4°C for high-emissions scenarios[5].
- Climate models showed a “fat right tail” in temperature projections: while the median warming might be 3.7°C, there is a non-trivial probability of exceeding 4°C or even 6°C if climate sensitivity is high or feedbacks are stronger than expected[2].

## 2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- As of 2018, **no major new international treaties or nationally determined contributions (NDCs)** had been implemented to close the gap between pledged emissions reductions and the 2°C target.
- The United States initiated withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, signaling potential weakening of global mitigation efforts[1].
- Global emissions trajectories remained on a path consistent with “baseline” or “current policies” scenarios, which do not include substantial additional mitigation[1][3].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The **IPCC AR5 Synthesis Report (2014)** and subsequent updates remain the gold standard for emissions and temperature projections up to 2100.
- NASA’s GISS surface temperature dataset is the reference for global temperature anomalies relative to the specified baselines.
- The **Climate Action Tracker** and **climateanalytics.org** provide real-time policy-based warming projections.

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- **Model Uncertainty**: Climate sensitivity and feedback mechanisms (e.g., permafrost melt, cloud cover changes) introduce substantial uncertainty, especially in the “tail risk” of extreme warming[2].
- **Socioeconomic and Policy Uncertainty**: Future economic growth, energy transitions, and unforeseen policy changes could either accelerate or decelerate emissions growth.
- **Measurement Uncertainty**: Small differences in baseline definitions (e.g., 1850–1900 vs. 1861–1880) and adjustments for biases in historic temperature records can affect the calculated anomaly.
- **Natural Variability**: Decadal climate variability (e.g., El Niño/La Niña cycles) can cause fluctuations, but a 5-year average smooths much of this noise.

## Comparison to Reference Cases & Key Differences

| Factor                      | Reference Case (2014 IPCC Baseline)     | 2018 Situation                                               | Implication for Forecast                |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Emissions Trajectory        | High, unmitigated                       | Still on high (current policies), no new major efforts        | No meaningful deviation from baseline   |
| Projected 2100 Warming      | 3.7–4.8°C (median)                      | Median 3.7–4.8°C; possible “fat tail” higher                 | High likelihood of >3.6°C warming       |
| Policy Momentum             | Paris Agreement (insufficient pledges)  | Some backsliding (e.g., US withdrawal); no stronger pledges  | Risk of even higher emissions           |
| Climate Sensitivity         | 2.0–4.5°C per CO₂ doubling              | Same, but fat tail still plausible                           | Non-negligible chance of >4°C           |

## Probabilistic Assessment (as of 2018)

- Baseline (no additional mitigation): **Median probability is high** (>50%) that the **global mean temperature anomaly will exceed 3.6°C before 2100**[5].
- Given natural variability, it is **very likely** that at least one 5-year period will have an average exceeding 3.6°C above the 1861–1880 baseline, barring aggressive new mitigation.
- **Tail risks** (e.g., >6°C warming) are non-negligible, possibly in the 5–10% range, increasing the probability of exceeding the threshold even further[2].
- **Limiting factors**: Substantial, unexpected mitigation or climate engineering, or if climate sensitivity is at the low end of current estimates, could reduce the probability.

## Summary

Given the emissions trajectory as of 2018, the absence of stronger mitigation policies, and the central projections from the IPCC, the **adjusted probabilistic forecast is that there is a high likelihood (>70%) that a 5-year period with a global mean temperature anomaly >3.6°C above the 1861–1880 baseline will occur before 2100**. This probability could be revised downward only if significant mitigation is implemented or if future research drastically revises climate sensitivity estimates downward.
