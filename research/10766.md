# Forecast Analysis: Georgian Control of South Ossetia and Abkhazia by 2028

As of April 2022, the prospect of Georgia regaining control over South Ossetia and Abkhazia faces significant challenges. This analysis examines the current geopolitical landscape and historical context to assess the likelihood of Georgian control before 2028.

## Historical Context and Current Status

South Ossetia and Abkhazia have been de facto independent from Georgia since the early 1990s following the dissolution of the Soviet Union. This separation was solidified after the 2008 Russo-Georgian War, when Russia formally recognized both regions as independent states. As of 2022, Georgia lacks de facto control over either territory, though most UN nations continue to recognize them as part of Georgia.

The European Court of Human Rights determined in January 2021 that Russia has held "effective control" of both regions since August 2008. The court estimated that in 2020, Russia maintained approximately one soldier per eight residents in South Ossetia, indicating substantial military presence and influence.

## Key Factors Affecting the Forecast

### Russian Integration Efforts

In March 2022, South Ossetian President Anatoliy Bibilov proposed a referendum on formally joining the Russian Federation, stating: "Unification with Russia is our strategic goal, our path, the hope of our people, and we will move on this path." This development suggests South Ossetia is moving toward deeper integration with Russia rather than reconciliation with Georgia.

Abkhazia appears to be taking a different approach. In response to questions about following South Ossetia's path, Abkhazian Parliamentary Speaker Valery Kvarchia stated: "Russia is our strategic partner, a dear and close state, but we in the republic (of Abkhazia) have no intention of joining the Russian Federation." This indicates Abkhazia prefers maintaining its de facto independence rather than either joining Russia or returning to Georgian control.

### Military Balance

Russia maintains significant military forces in both regions, which would present a substantial obstacle to any Georgian attempt to assert control by force. The 2008 war demonstrated Russia's willingness to intervene militarily to protect these territories from Georgian control, and Russia's military capabilities have only increased since then.

### International Support

While Georgia has widespread international diplomatic support for its territorial claims, this has not translated into meaningful pressure on Russia to withdraw. Western powers have been unwilling to take actions that would significantly increase the likelihood of Georgian reintegration of these territories.

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on the available evidence as of April 2022, the probability of Georgia controlling both South Ossetia and Abkhazia before 2028 is low, estimated at 10-15%. This assessment is based on several factors:

1. **Russian Military Presence**: Russia maintains significant military forces in both regions and has demonstrated willingness to use them.

2. **Local Political Will**: Both regions have consistently opposed reintegration with Georgia for decades, with South Ossetia now actively pursuing integration with Russia.

3. **International Dynamics**: Despite diplomatic support for Georgia's territorial integrity, there is little evidence of effective international pressure that would change the status quo.

4. **Georgian Capabilities**: Georgia lacks the military capacity to retake the territories by force against Russian opposition.

5. **Negotiation Prospects**: There is no significant progress in negotiations that would suggest a diplomatic resolution returning the territories to Georgian control.

The most plausible path to Georgian control would involve a major change in Russia's strategic posture or internal political situation, which cannot be reliably predicted but appears unlikely in the given timeframe.
