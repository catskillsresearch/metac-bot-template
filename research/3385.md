## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Humanity has maintained a continuous off-Earth presence aboard the International Space Station (ISS) since November 2000.
- As of 2019, the ISS was still operational and had just received a funding and operational extension to at least 2024, with NASA and international partners exploring technical options for further extensions potentially out to 2030 or beyond[1][2].
- No other human-occupied platforms existed or were operational in orbit as of 2019, making the ISS the single point of failure for continuous human presence in space.

## 2. Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Metric

- In January 2014, the Obama Administration approved NASA’s request to extend ISS operations to at least 2024, with experts arguing there was no technical reason it could not continue to 2030 or even 2050, assuming adequate funding and maintenance[1].
- NASA’s official transition plan as of 2024 aims for a seamless handover from the ISS to commercially operated platforms, with the ISS serving as a bridge until at least 2030. This transition is expected to provide the continuity required for a permanent human presence in low Earth orbit[2].
- China has released long-term space science and human spaceflight plans projecting activity through 2050, including potential national space stations and lunar missions, increasing the odds of at least one human-occupied platform being operational off Earth at any given time[4][5].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- NASA publications and transition plans for the ISS[2]
- Public statements and technical assessments by senior NASA officials and international partners[1]
- Official Chinese government and space agency announcements regarding long-term space science infrastructure[4][5]

## 4. Limitations or Uncertainties in Measurement

- The forecast depends critically on continued funding, international political cooperation, and the successful deployment and occupation of at least one replacement platform as the ISS ages and eventually retires.
- Technical risks (e.g., catastrophic failure of space station infrastructure), geopolitical instability, or a loss of interest/funding could lead to a gap in human presence.
- As of 2019, no commercial station had demonstrated continuous human occupation, and replacement readiness timelines were speculative.
- Redundancy is low: with only one crewed platform as of 2019, any extended gap in occupation (even a few hours) would resolve the forecast negatively.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment (as of 2019-12-03)

Given the strong historical precedent, near-term funding commitments, emerging commercial and national plans, but significant mid- to long-term uncertainty, a reasonable probabilistic estimate (as of 2019) for humanity maintaining an unbroken off-Earth presence through 2050 is approximately:

- 60–70% probability, contingent on at least one major infrastructure transition succeeding and sustained political/economic support.
