# Forecasting the Time from AGI to Superintelligent AI

As a forecasting analyst examining the question of how many months might elapse between the creation of AGI and superintelligent AI, I've analyzed available evidence as of December 30, 2021. This analysis focuses on reference cases, key differences affecting the forecast, and a probabilistic assessment.

## Current Situation and Reference Cases

As of late 2021, no artificial general intelligence system exists, though significant progress has been made in narrow AI domains. The question of how quickly superintelligence might follow AGI has been debated extensively in academic and futurist circles.

### Key Historical Frameworks

Several prominent thinkers have proposed frameworks for understanding this transition:

- **I.J. Good (1965)** introduced the concept of an "intelligence explosion" where an ultraintelligent machine could improve itself recursively, suggesting a potentially rapid transition.

- **Nick Bostrom (2014)** categorized potential "takeoff" scenarios into three types:
  - Slow takeoff: decades or centuries
  - Moderate takeoff: months or years
  - Fast takeoff: minutes, hours, or days

- The **2016 AI Impacts survey** of AI researchers found:
  - 20% median probability of dramatically increased technological improvement within two years of human-level machine intelligence
  - 80% median probability of such acceleration within thirty years

### Current Expert Predictions

As of 2020, the Metaculus prediction community estimated:
- Weakly general AI by 2026
- General AI by 2030[1]

These predictions suggest AGI might be developed within the next decade, but they don't directly address the speed of transition to superintelligence.

## Key Differences Affecting the Forecast

Several factors would influence the timeline from AGI to superintelligence:

### 1. Recursive Self-Improvement Capabilities

If an AGI system can meaningfully improve its own architecture or code, this could potentially lead to rapid capability gains. As of 2021, current AI systems show limited ability to improve their own code, but this remains a theoretical possibility for AGI.

### 2. Hardware Constraints

The transition speed will depend partly on whether additional hardware would be needed for superintelligence. If substantial new computing infrastructure is required, this could introduce delays of months or years[1].

### 3. Architectural Changes Required

If superintelligence requires fundamental architectural innovations beyond those used for AGI, the transition could take longer. If it primarily requires scaling existing AGI architecture, the transition might be faster.

### 4. Safety Measures and Deployment Decisions

Human decisions about testing, safety verification, and controlled deployment could significantly extend the timeline between technical AGI capability and publicly acknowledged superintelligence.

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on the available information as of December 2021, I can provide the following probabilistic assessment of the time between AGI creation and superintelligence:

- **10% probability**: Less than 1 month (very fast takeoff scenario where recursive self-improvement leads to rapid capability gains)
- **25% probability**: 1-6 months (fast takeoff requiring minimal architectural changes)
- **40% probability**: 6-36 months (moderate takeoff requiring significant engineering work)
- **20% probability**: 3-10 years (slower development requiring new paradigms or extensive safety measures)
- **5% probability**: More than 10 years (very slow development with major obstacles)

This distribution reflects the significant uncertainty in the field, with most experts acknowledging that the transition could occur anywhere from very quickly to over several years.

## Key Uncertainties

Several fundamental uncertainties affect this forecast:

1. **Definition ambiguity**: The exact capabilities that constitute the boundary between AGI and superintelligence remain somewhat subjective.

2. **Unknown scaling laws**: How capabilities scale with computing resources remains unclear.

3. **Secrecy factors**: Development might occur in private before public announcement, making the true timeline difficult to ascertain.

4. **Regulatory environment**: Potential government intervention could significantly alter deployment timelines.

The median estimate from this analysis suggests a transition period of approximately 1-3 years from AGI to superintelligence, but with substantial probability mass on both shorter and longer timeframes, reflecting the deep uncertainty in this domain.
