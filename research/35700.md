## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- **Cube-shaped UFO sightings are rare but documented:** According to the NUFORC, cube-shaped UFOs have been reported, though infrequently. For instance, December 2024 saw six cube-shaped sightings, which is notable given their historical rarity[1].
- **NUFORC database is regularly updated:** The NUFORC databank is the largest independently collected set of UFO/UAP sighting reports and is updated periodically as new reports are processed[2]. Reports are accessible by shape, date, and location, allowing for tracking of trends in specific sighting types.
- **Recent activity:** As of late December 2024, the database had been updated with nearly 400 new reports, indicating continued public engagement and active data collection[1].

## Recent Announcements or Policies

- **No recent policy changes:** There is no evidence of any recent announcements or policy changes at NUFORC that would affect the reporting or publication of cube-shaped UFO sightings[1][2].
- **Ongoing review process:** NUFORC staff review each report and highlight particularly credible or interesting cases, but most reports are posted as received, except for obvious hoaxes[2].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- **NUFORC official website:** The primary source for confirming whether a cube-shaped UFO sighting is reported in March 2025 is the NUFORC event index, which allows filtering by date and shape[1][2].
- **Shape-specific index:** The NUFORC database includes an index by shape, making it straightforward to verify the presence of cube-shaped reports for any given month[2].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- **Self-reported data:** NUFORC relies on public submissions, which can be inconsistent and subject to reporting bias[2].
- **Unpredictability of sightings:** UFO sightings, especially of specific shapes like cubes, are inherently unpredictable and depend on both actual events and public willingness to report them.
- **Processing lag:** There may be a delay between the date of a sighting and its appearance in the public database, depending on NUFORC's processing schedule[2].

## Summary

- Cube-shaped UFO sightings are rare but have occurred, including a cluster in December 2024.
- The NUFORC database is comprehensive and regularly updated, with no recent changes affecting reporting.
- The main uncertainty lies in the unpredictable nature of both UFO events and public reporting.
- Verification is straightforward via NUFORC's official event index.
