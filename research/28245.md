The yield curve, particularly the spread between 10-year and 2-year Treasury yields, is a closely watched economic indicator. As of September 13, 2024, this spread stood at 0.09, indicating a positive but very narrow gap between long-term and short-term rates[3]. To determine whether the yield curve will be inverted by September 27, 2024, we need to examine recent trends and upcoming factors that could influence Treasury yields.

## Recent Yield Curve History

The U.S. Treasury yield curve had been inverted for an unprecedented 783 consecutive days before turning positive again in early September 2024[4]. This represents the longest inversion period in U.S. history, significantly exceeding previous inversion durations. The spread between the 10-year and 2-year Treasury yields had grown as negative as 108 basis points in July 2023 before gradually narrowing[5].

As of early August 2024, the spread was approaching zero[5], and by September 13, 2024, it had moved into positive territory with a reading of 0.09[3]. This recent "uninversion" marks a significant shift in the yield curve's trajectory after more than two years of inversion.

## Factors Affecting Near-Term Yield Curve Movement

Several key factors could influence whether the yield curve remains positive or reverts to inversion by September 27:

**Federal Reserve Policy**: The Federal Reserve was anticipated to implement its first rate cut at the September 18 FOMC meeting, with a reduction of 0.25% to 0.50%[4]. This policy action would directly impact short-term rates and could affect the yield curve configuration.

**Economic Outlook**: Some economists, including Campbell Harvey, have suggested the U.S. economy might be "on the edge of a slowdown that could lead to a recession in the fourth quarter of 2024, the first quarter of 2025"[1]. Such economic concerns could drive investors toward longer-term Treasuries, potentially pushing long-term yields lower.

**Market Dynamics**: Timothy High, a senior rates strategist at BNP Paribas, noted that "The more we steepen, the more that the Fed has to cut, the more that the Fed cuts is the response to a weaker economy"[5]. This suggests a potential feedback loop between yield curve steepening, Fed policy, and economic conditions.

## Probability Assessment

The probability of yield curve inversion in the near term remains significant. According to simulation data, there was a 20.2% probability of an inverted yield curve in the future (though this refers to a longer time horizon)[3]. 

It's worth noting that while the 10-year/2-year spread has uninverted, other measures of the yield curve, such as the 10-year/3-month spread, remained deeply negative as of August 2024[5]. This divergence between different yield curve measures adds complexity to the overall assessment.

## Conclusion

Given the very narrow positive spread of 0.09 as of September 13, 2024, the yield curve remains vulnerable to inversion by September 27, 2024. The anticipated Fed rate cut on September 18 will be a crucial factor, as will market reactions to economic data released between September 13 and September 27. While the yield curve has technically uninverted, its proximity to zero suggests that even modest market movements could push it back into negative territory.

The historical pattern of yield curve behavior following long inversions does not provide a clear precedent given the unprecedented duration of the recent inversion. However, the combination of economic uncertainty, potential recession concerns, and the transitional nature of monetary policy creates conditions where reinversion remains a distinct possibility before September 27, 2024.
