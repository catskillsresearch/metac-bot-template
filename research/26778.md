### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- From 2014 to 2023, the Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue metro area experienced between 0 and 11 days per year in Q3 with an AQI above 150, with notable spikes in 2017, 2018, 2020, and 2022 (7–11 days), and lower counts in other years (0–3 days)[1].
- The primary cause of these high AQI days is wildfire smoke, which typically affects the region in mid-to-late summer, sometimes resulting in the worst air quality globally, as seen during the 2022 Bolt Creek Fire[1].
- As of July 29, 2024, there has been 1 day in Q3 2024 (July 5) with an AQI above 150 (AQI 166)[1].

### Recent Announcements and Policies

- No significant new policies or interventions have been reported as of August 1, 2024, that would substantially alter the risk of wildfire smoke or high AQI days for the remainder of Q3 2024[1].
- Ongoing air quality monitoring and public health advisories continue to be provided by the Washington State Department of Ecology and the EPA[1].

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The EPA’s outdoor air quality data tool provides daily AQI readings for the Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue area, including historical and current data[1].
- The Washington State Department of Ecology maintains a network of monitoring stations and publishes real-time and historical AQI data[1].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- Wildfire activity, the main driver of high AQI days, is highly variable and depends on weather, lightning, human activity, and wind patterns, making precise forecasting difficult[1].
- While the measurement methodology is robust (using the highest daily AQI from all monitoring sites), localized smoke events or rapidly changing conditions can affect daily readings[1].
- The count for Q3 2024 will be finalized only after September 30, 2024, when the EPA’s data is complete and accessible[1].

### Summary

Based on historical data, the Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue area has experienced 6 or more days with AQI above 150 in 4 of the past 10 years, but only 1 such day has occurred so far in Q3 2024 as of July 29. The likelihood of reaching 6–10 days by the end of Q3 will depend on wildfire activity in August and September, which remains unpredictable. The EPA’s outdoor air quality data tool will provide the definitive count after the quarter ends[1].
