## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The Tuesday and Wednesday before Thanksgiving are historically among the busiest travel days in the US. In 2023, TSA screened 2,647,461 passengers on Tuesday, November 21, and 2,741,610 on Wednesday, November 22, for a combined total of 5,389,071[3].
- In 2023, the Sunday after Thanksgiving set a new single-day record for TSA screenings, with over 2.9 million travelers[4][5].
- For 2024, travel industry forecasts and TSA data indicate that demand for air travel is even higher. Several days in 2024 have already surpassed previous single-day records for TSA screenings[4].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- The TSA and travel industry analysts are projecting that the 2024 holiday travel season will be the busiest ever, with more than half of Americans planning to travel during the Thanksgiving and Christmas period[2][4].
- There are no reports of new travel restrictions or significant airline capacity reductions that would negatively impact passenger volumes for Thanksgiving 2024.

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The TSA publishes daily checkpoint travel numbers, which are the official source for verifying passenger volumes[1].
- Archived 2023 TSA passenger volume numbers are available for direct year-over-year comparison.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- The forecast is based on trends, projections, and available data as of November 5, 2024. Actual numbers will be confirmed once the TSA publishes the official data for November 26 and 27, 2024.
- Unforeseen events (such as severe weather or sudden disruptions) could impact actual passenger volumes, but no such events are anticipated as of the knowledge cutoff.

## Conclusion

Based on all available information as of November 5, 2024, US airline passenger volume for the Tuesday and Wednesday before Thanksgiving 2024 is expected to be up year over year, according to the TSA. This is supported by record-breaking trends in 2024, strong travel demand forecasts, and the absence of negative policy changes or disruptions[2][4][5].
