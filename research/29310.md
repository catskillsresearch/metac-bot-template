# Forecasting a US Public Health Emergency Declaration for Marburg Virus Disease

The question asks whether the US Department of Health and Human Services will declare a public health emergency for Marburg virus disease before January 1, 2025. Based on available information as of October 2024, here are the key factors to consider:

## Current Status of the Marburg Outbreak in Rwanda

Rwanda reported its first Marburg virus disease (MVD) outbreak on September 27, 2024[2]. This is the country's first recorded outbreak of the disease. As of October 17, 2024, Rwanda had reported:

- 62 confirmed cases of Marburg virus disease[4]
- 15 deaths, resulting in a case fatality rate of 24.2%[4]
- 43 recoveries from the disease[4]
- Over 800 contacts under monitoring as of October 14, 2024[4]

A significant concern is that approximately 80% of the cases were among healthcare workers, according to data as of October 15, 2024[3]. Most cases have been reported from three districts in Kigali city, Rwanda's capital[4].

## Risk Assessment for the United States

The CDC has conducted a risk assessment for the United States regarding this outbreak. Key findings include:

- There are currently no known cases of Marburg virus disease in the United States[1]
- The CDC acknowledges "a risk of potential spread from Rwanda to the United States through other countries, via travelers from Rwanda who may be infected"[1]
- The risk could increase if there is broader spread in Rwanda, especially in Kigali, which has more travel links to other countries[1]
- There are no direct commercial flights from Rwanda to the United States, and the daily number of passengers whose flights originate in Rwanda is low[1]

The CDC notes uncertainty in the implications for the United States, including "limited visibility on the epidemiology of the current outbreak in Rwanda, and whether adequate measures are in place to limit transmission in the country and in the surrounding region"[1].

## Current US Government Response

The CDC has already implemented several measures in response to the outbreak:

- Posted information and electronic messages in airports[1]
- Sending text messages to advise travelers arriving from Rwanda about the importance of seeking care if they develop symptoms[1]
- Conducting public health entry screening at designated U.S. airports[1]
- Facilitating "recommended post-arrival management of U.S.-based healthcare workers and other travelers arriving from Rwanda"[1]

These measures suggest the US government is taking the outbreak seriously but has not yet deemed it necessary to declare a public health emergency.

## International Response

The World Health Organization (WHO) has deployed a surge team to Rwanda in October to support the in-country response across various functions, including epidemiology, health operations, case management, logistics, vaccines research, and infection prevention and control[4].

Based on its risk assessment, the WHO has advised against any travel or trade restrictions with Rwanda[4].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several uncertainties could affect the likelihood of a US public health emergency declaration:

- The CDC notes "limited visibility on the epidemiology of the current outbreak in Rwanda"[1]
- There is uncertainty about "whether adequate measures are in place to limit transmission in the country and in the surrounding region"[1]
- The CDC also mentions uncertainties around "affected districts in Rwanda and travel patterns between affected districts and other countries"[1]
