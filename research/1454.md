## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of 2018, China's aggregate Freedom House score was 14 (0/40 for Political Rights, 14/60 for Civil Liberties) for the 2017 reporting year[2].
- Political Rights have reached their lowest point in at least 15 years, with a score of 0, reflecting complete absence of any electoral competition or political pluralism[2].
- Civil Liberties have gradually declined over more than a decade, with ongoing restrictions on media, the internet, religion, and civil society[2].
- The overall trend from 2005–2018 is one of steady or accelerating repression.

## 2. Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Metric

- Implementation of the Cybersecurity Law and stricter real-name registration rules have intensified online surveillance and censorship[2].
- New religious regulations in 2018 further constrained religious freedoms, especially for children[2].
- The security crackdown in Xinjiang expanded, with up to a million Uighurs reportedly detained in re-education camps and new restrictions on expression, movement, and worship for ethnic minorities[2].
- The Chinese Communist Party showed no signs of liberalization, instead consolidating power and tightening ideological controls[2].

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- Forecast assumes no major liberalizing reforms or political shocks before 2028.
- Minor year-to-year fluctuations in Civil Liberties are possible, but the structural factors suggest further decline or stagnation at a low level.
- The scoring methodology and Freedom House reporting are assumed to remain unchanged.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the above, the most probable aggregate Freedom House score for China in the calendar year 2028 is **12–14**, with the highest likelihood at **14**, assuming no significant positive political transformation. The Political Rights score is likely to remain at 0, and Civil Liberties may stay at 14 or slip slightly lower due to continued or enhanced repression. The aggregate score will almost certainly remain among the lowest globally.
