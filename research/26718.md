## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The global average life satisfaction, as measured by the Cantril ladder and reported by the World Happiness Report, has been relatively stable in the 5.0–6.0 range for the past decade.
- World averages change slowly, even during major global events (e.g., the COVID-19 pandemic caused a slight dip, but levels recovered within a few years).
- Major technological shifts, such as the spread of the internet or smartphones, have generally corresponded with small, gradual improvements in global well-being, though with substantial variation across regions and demographics.

## 2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- As of mid-2024, there are no global policies ensuring the equitable distribution of advanced AI or AGI benefits. Investment and development are concentrated in a few countries and companies[1][2].
- A recent international study (June 2024) found a strong positive correlation between frequent mobile AI use and higher self-reported life satisfaction: 75% of frequent users rated their lives as "good to very good," compared to 45% of rare users. However, only 16% of respondents were frequent users, indicating a digital divide[4].
- No major international initiatives have yet addressed the risk of AI-induced inequality or mass unemployment.

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The [World Happiness Report](https://worldhappiness.report/archive/) and [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/happiness-cantril-ladder?tab=chart&country=~OWID_WRL) are the primary sources for tracking the Cantril ladder score globally.
- The Samsung Galaxy/Symmetry/Goldsmiths study (2024) provides the most recent empirical data on the relationship between AI adoption and subjective well-being[4].

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties in Measurement

- Self-reported life satisfaction is influenced by cultural, economic, and social factors, and is subject to reporting biases.
- The Cantril ladder is a broad measure and may not fully capture changes in inequality, mental health, or existential risk.
- Forecasting happiness after AGI involves high uncertainty due to the unprecedented nature of AGI, unknowns about political/economic adaptation, and potential for both utopian and dystopian outcomes.

## 5. Key Differences Affecting the Forecast

- Previous technological advances have been incremental and broadly distributed over decades, whereas AGI could induce rapid, large-scale shifts in employment, wealth, and power structures.
- Early evidence suggests AI can improve well-being for users, but also risks exacerbating inequality if access is limited[4].
- The risk of social disruption (e.g., mass unemployment, loss of agency, or psychological effects of AGI) may counterbalance material gains.

## 6. Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

- **Baseline**: If current trends continue and AGI's benefits are unevenly distributed, global life satisfaction might rise only modestly (e.g., from ~5.5 to ~6.0) within five years post-AGI.
- **Optimistic scenario**: If AGI's benefits are equitably distributed (e.g., universal abundance, improved health, reduction in global conflict), average life satisfaction could rise more significantly (6.5–7.0).
- **Pessimistic scenario**: If AGI leads to increased inequality, widespread unemployment, or social unrest, life satisfaction could stagnate or even decline (5.0–5.5).

**Central forecast (conditional on no extinction):**  
- Five years after AGI, the most likely outcome is a modest increase in global life satisfaction, with the world average rising to **5.8–6.2** on the Cantril ladder.  
- However, the distribution of happiness may become more unequal, with some populations experiencing large gains and others facing stagnation or decline[4].
