# Forecasting Analysis: Discontinuity in AI Progress Leading to AGI

As of August 28, 2018, the question of whether we'll see surprising discontinuities in AI progress requires careful examination of historical patterns, current research trajectories, and potential inflection points.

## Historical AI Development Patterns

The history of AI has shown both periods of steady progress and occasional breakthroughs that significantly accelerated capabilities:

- The field has experienced multiple "AI winters" followed by resurgences, suggesting non-linear development patterns
- Deep learning breakthroughs around 2012 (particularly AlexNet's performance in the ImageNet competition) represented a significant discontinuity in computer vision capabilities
- AlphaGo's 2016 victory over Lee Sedol came earlier than many experts predicted, representing another potential discontinuity

These historical examples suggest that discontinuities are possible, though not necessarily predictable in timing or magnitude.

## Current State of AI Research (as of 2018)

As of mid-2018, several trends are worth noting:

- Deep learning approaches continue to dominate, with increasing model sizes and computational requirements
- Transfer learning and multi-task learning are showing promising results
- Reinforcement learning has demonstrated impressive capabilities in games and simulated environments
- Industry investment in AI is accelerating, with major tech companies establishing dedicated AI research labs

## Factors That Could Lead to Discontinuities

Several factors could potentially contribute to discontinuous progress in AI:

**Algorithmic Breakthroughs**
Novel algorithmic approaches could produce substantial capability jumps. Historical precedents include backpropagation, convolutional neural networks, and attention mechanisms.

**Computational Scaling**
The relationship between compute, data, and AI capabilities appears non-linear in some domains. OpenAI's research suggests that computational resources have been doubling approximately every 3.5 months in the largest AI training runs, far outpacing Moore's Law.

**Cross-Domain Integration**
Integration of techniques from different AI subfields (reinforcement learning, unsupervised learning, etc.) could produce emergent capabilities greater than the sum of their parts.

**Hardware Innovations**
Specialized AI hardware (TPUs, neuromorphic chips, etc.) could create step changes in what's computationally feasible.

## Probability Assessment

Based on information available as of August 28, 2018, I assess:

1. **Likelihood of significant discontinuities**: Moderate (30-40%)
   - Historical precedent shows occasional discontinuities in AI capabilities
   - Current research directions could enable non-linear progress

2. **Likelihood of these discontinuities affecting AGI predictions specifically**: Low-to-moderate (15-25%)
   - The gap between current AI systems and AGI remains substantial
   - Most current research focuses on narrow AI applications

3. **Likelihood of meeting the specific criteria (tripling of odds within 2 months)**: Low (10-15%)
   - Such rapid consensus shifts would require extraordinary evidence
   - The Metaculus community tends to update gradually rather than suddenly

## Key Uncertainties

Several important uncertainties affect this forecast:

1. **Hidden Research**: Private labs may have unpublished capabilities that could be revealed suddenly
2. **Definition Challenges**: The precise definition of "human-level machine intelligence" remains contested
3. **Measurement Problems**: Progress toward AGI lacks clear, agreed-upon metrics
4. **Feedback Effects**: Perception of progress can create investment cycles that accelerate actual progress

## Conclusion

Based on information available as of August 28, 2018, while discontinuities in AI progress are certainly possible, the specific criteria for this question (tripling of odds within a 2-month period for both Metaculus and community predictions) sets a high bar. Historical patterns suggest that even significant breakthroughs typically take time to be fully understood and integrated into community forecasts.

The most likely scenario for meeting this criteria would involve a public demonstration of capabilities that dramatically exceed current expectations, similar to but more significant than the AlphaGo moment. However, the requirement for both Metaculus and community predictions to update so dramatically in tandem makes this a relatively low probability event.
