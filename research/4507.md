## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- In July 2020, only 16% of top 50 US colleges were test-optional, with the vast majority requiring SAT/ACT scores for freshman admission. This changed rapidly after the University of California announced plans to phase out standardized test requirements, catalyzing a nationwide shift toward test-optional policies, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic[2].
- By late 2021 and into the pandemic, over 90% of top 100 US colleges had adopted test-optional policies, according to Metaculus and other sources[2]. Many institutions, including Harvard, temporarily suspended testing requirements for multiple admission cycles[3].
- As of early 2025, there is a notable reversal: several prominent universities—including Harvard, MIT, Stanford, Brown, Dartmouth, Yale, and others—have announced the reinstatement of SAT/ACT requirements for the 2025–26 application cycle[1][4][5]. Public universities in states like Florida and Georgia, as well as military academies, also require standardized tests[4][5].

## Recent Announcements and Policy Changes

- The University of Pennsylvania, Harvard, Brown, Caltech, Cornell, Dartmouth, MIT, and others have announced a return to mandatory SAT/ACT submissions for applicants beginning with the 2025–26 cycle[1][4][5].
- Some universities remain committed to test-optional (Columbia) or test-blind (most of the University of California system) policies[4][5].
- The landscape remains dynamic, with some schools reconsidering their policies based on legal, social, and institutional pressures.

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Crimson Education, Elite Prep, and Carnegie Prep provide up-to-date lists of schools requiring or waiving SAT/ACT for 2025 and beyond[1][4][5].
- Metaculus aggregates probabilistic forecasts from the expert and public community, though its predictions may lag rapid policy changes[2].
- US News & World Report rankings define the “top 50” colleges in question.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- College admissions policies are in flux. Announcements to reinstate testing requirements may be reversed or further modified by 2030.
- Legal challenges (e.g., around affirmative action, equity) and shifting public sentiment could prompt more schools to reconsider test requirements.
- The definition of "requirement" varies: some schools are “test-flexible” or “test-blind,” and policies may differ for domestic vs. international applicants[5].
- Forecasts from community platforms like Metaculus may not fully reflect the latest policy reversals, potentially overstating the future prevalence of test-optional admissions[2].

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the reversal trend among many elite universities but persistence of test-optional policies at a significant minority (including the entire UC system), the best probabilistic estimate for January 2030 is:

> **Approximately 40%–60% of top 50 US colleges will not require the SAT or ACT for freshman admission in 2030.**

This estimate is below the pandemic-era peak but substantially above the pre-2020 baseline. The midpoint of the range—**50%**—is a reasonable single-number forecast, with the caveat that further policy swings are possible.
