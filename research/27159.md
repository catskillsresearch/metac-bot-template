# Forecasting Human-to-Human Transmission of H5N1 Before September 30, 2024

The following analysis provides factual information available as of August 14, 2024, to help forecast whether human-to-human transmission of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 will be reported globally before September 30, 2024.

## Current Status of H5N1 Cases

As of late July 2024, the United States has reported a significant increase in human H5N1 cases associated with the ongoing outbreak in dairy cattle and poultry:

- A total of 13 human cases of H5 bird flu have been reported in the United States since April 2024[1][2]
- Four cases were associated with exposure to infected dairy cattle, and nine cases were linked to affected poultry[1][2]
- The first human case linked to dairy cows was reported on April 1, 2024, in Texas, representing the first known human infection with H5N1 from a cow globally[1]
- Additional cases were identified in Michigan (May 22 and May 30, 2024) and Colorado (July 3, 2024)[1]
- On July 25, 2024, CDC reported three new human cases of H5 bird flu in Colorado workers involved in a poultry egg operation[2]

## Transmission Patterns and Risk Assessment

Current evidence indicates that all human infections have been associated with direct animal exposure:

- All reported cases have been traced to direct contact with infected animals and were mild cases in affected individuals[4]
- The joint FAO/WHO/WOAH assessment as of July 18, 2024, assessed the global public health risk of influenza A(H5N1) viruses to be low[3]
- The risk of infection for occupationally exposed persons is considered low to moderate, depending on risk mitigation measures in place[3]
- All H5N1 human cases reported in Europe and North America were either asymptomatic or had mild symptoms ranging from fatigue or conjunctivitis to mild respiratory symptoms[3]

## Risk Factors and Concerns

Despite the current absence of human-to-human transmission, some risk factors have been identified:

- There is mounting evidence for cross-species and cow-to-cow transmission, and new evidence indicating potential for airborne transmission[2]
- The Center for Outbreak Research and Innovation (CORI) judges that the overall opportunity for adaptation of H5N1 to efficiently spread among humans appears to be increasing[2]
- CORI has assessed the H5N1 outbreak in cattle as being within "Scenario 3," meaning the risk to the general public and healthcare workers is low, but the risk to farm workers is moderate to high[2]

## Historical Context

The current outbreak should be viewed in the context of the global history of H5N1:

- From 2003 to April 1, 2024, a total of 889 cases and 463 deaths (case fatality rate of 52%) caused by influenza A(H5N1) virus have been reported worldwide from 23 countries[5]
- The first human case of H5N1 bird flu in the United States was reported on April 28, 2022, in a person in Colorado who had direct exposure to poultry[1]
- This 2022 case was not related to the current dairy cow outbreak[1]

## Conclusion

As of August 14, 2024, there have been no confirmed cases of human-to-human transmission of H5N1 in the current outbreak. All human infections have been linked to direct animal exposure. However, health authorities note increasing opportunities for viral adaptation that could potentially lead to human-to-human transmission. The situation continues to be closely monitored by global health organizations.
