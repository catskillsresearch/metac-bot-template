### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- In 2024, U.S. state legislatures introduced nearly 700 AI-related bills, with about 20% enacted, focusing on high-risk AI uses, deepfakes, and government use of AI. However, these are state-level actions, not federal mandates[3][4].
- At the federal level, several bills have been introduced to address AI security, including a September 2024 bipartisan bill by Representatives Ross and Beyer aimed at establishing an AI Security Center and updating cybersecurity reporting systems to include AI[2].
- Despite this legislative activity, as of October 29, 2024, there is no federal law requiring all U.S. actors in possession of powerful AI models to implement cybersecurity measures. The legislative efforts remain at the proposal or committee stage and have not been signed into law[2][3][4].

### Recent Announcements and Policies

- The U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) released guidance in early 2024 on preventing and mitigating cyberattacks on AI systems, but this is non-binding guidance, not legislation[5].
- The European Union’s AI Act, effective August 2024, imposes cybersecurity requirements on high-risk AI, but no equivalent federal law exists in the U.S. as of the cutoff date[5].
- State-level activity is robust, and experts expect continued momentum in 2025, but consensus and action at the federal level have not materialized[3][4].

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Legislative trackers and policy reports from BSA | The Software Alliance, NCSL, and government press releases confirm the absence of a relevant federal law as of October 29, 2024[1][2][3][4].
- Legal analyses highlight the gap between U.S. federal action and the EU’s regulatory approach, noting that U.S. efforts are currently limited to guidelines and proposed bills[5].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- There is a possibility that federal legislation could be enacted in late 2024, but as of the cutoff date, no such law exists.
- State laws may impose cybersecurity requirements for AI, but these do not satisfy the resolution criteria, which require a federal law.
- The rapidly evolving legislative landscape means this status could change quickly, but the answer is based strictly on information available as of October 29, 2024.

### Conclusion

As of October 29, 2024, the United States has not passed a federal law requiring cybersecurity measures specifically for powerful AI models. While there is significant legislative activity at both the state and federal levels, and federal bills have been introduced, none have been enacted into law that meet the resolution criteria before 2025[2][3][4][5].
