### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The average peak bloom for DC's cherry blossoms typically occurs between the last week of March and the first week of April[1][5].
- In 2024, peak bloom was reached on March 17, which was earlier than usual due to warmer winter temperatures[2][5].
- For 2025, colder winter conditions are expected to delay the bloom compared to the previous year[2].

### Recent Announcements and Policies

- On February 27, 2025, the National Park Service officially announced that the projected peak bloom dates for 2025 are March 28 to March 31[2][3][5].
- This forecast is based on ongoing monitoring of bud development and historical weather data by NPS horticulturists and urban forestry experts[3][5].

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The National Park Service's "Bloom Watch" page is the definitive source for peak bloom status and updates[1].
- Major local news outlets such as WJLA and NBC Washington report directly on NPS announcements and provide additional context[2][3].
- The NPS updates its predictions as the season progresses, especially as weather conditions change[1][4].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- Forecasting peak bloom more than 10 days in advance is inherently uncertain, as the timing depends heavily on short-term weather patterns, especially temperature fluctuations[5].
- Extreme weather events (such as late frosts, heavy rain, or wind) can accelerate or delay peak bloom, or shorten the duration of the blossoms[5].
- The NPS defines peak bloom as when 70% of the Yoshino cherry trees are in flower, and this can be affected by microclimates around the Tidal Basin[2][5].

**Conclusion:**  
As of March 4, 2025, the best available information from the National Park Service forecasts that cherry blossoms in Washington, DC, will reach peak bloom between March 28 and March 31, 2025. This aligns with the "March 28 or 29" and "March 30 or 31" options, with the highest probability within this window[2][3][5].
