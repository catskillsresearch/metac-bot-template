## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The first gene-edited babies, twin girls known as "Lulu and Nana," were reportedly born in China in October 2018, edited using CRISPR/Cas9 to confer resistance to HIV[4].
- As of November 2019, these twins are the only publicly confirmed gene-edited human births, though a possible third pregnancy was mentioned by Dr. He Jiankui, but its outcome was unconfirmed at that time[4].
- The scientific community reacted with overwhelming condemnation, and the case led to widespread calls for moratoriums and stricter oversight on germline gene editing in humans[4].

## 2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- After the 2018 announcement, most countries reinforced bans or strict regulations on human germline genome editing. China tightened its regulations, and researchers involved faced legal penalties[4].
- Regulatory bodies in the US, UK, and EU have maintained prohibitions on clinical germline editing, though research on embryos (not brought to term) continues under strict oversight.
- Globally, only a handful of jurisdictions lack explicit bans, but even there, significant legal and ethical uncertainty remains.
- Despite these regulatory barriers, the gene-editing market and research sector have seen substantial growth, with large investments in CRISPR and related technologies (market projected to reach $19–21 billion by 2029)[2][5].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Authoritative counts will likely rely on major international health organizations, scientific journals, or credible investigative journalism.
- The Metaculus forecasting platform tracks community estimates on this question and is a useful aggregator of expert and crowd sentiment[1].

## 4. Limitations or Uncertainties in Measurement

- Enforcement of reporting is uneven; clandestine procedures are possible, especially in countries with weak oversight, meaning the true number could exceed official counts.
- Some births may not be disclosed for years, or may only be revealed through retrospective investigation.
- The definition of "gene-edited" babies for this forecast refers to babies born from embryos edited at the genetic level, not those receiving somatic (non-heritable) gene therapies.

## 5. Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment (as of late 2019)

- Reference case: Only 2 confirmed gene-edited babies born worldwide as of November 2019[4].
- Key differences vs. comparable biotechnologies: Unlike IVF or mitochondrial replacement, public and regulatory opposition is much stronger for germline gene editing.
- Adjusted forecast: Given the high regulatory barriers, intense scrutiny, and severe consequences for violators, it is unlikely that large numbers of gene-edited babies will be born openly through 2029. However, technical ease and potential for unregulated clinics raise the possibility of additional, possibly undisclosed, cases.

### Probabilistic Estimate

- The most likely scenario is that by the end of 2029, the total number of gene-edited babies born worldwide will be in the **single digits to low double digits** (i.e., less than 20), unless a major regulatory shift or technological breakthrough enabling safe, widely accepted procedures occurs[1].
- There is a small but non-trivial probability of higher numbers (tens to hundreds) if clandestine or unregulated clinics operate undetected, but no evidence as of 2019 indicates this has begun[1].
