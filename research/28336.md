# Analysis of Prince Tom Iseghohi's Prospects in the Edo Gubernatorial Election

Based on the information available as of September 19, 2024, I can provide the following analysis regarding Prince Tom Iseghohi's chances in the upcoming Edo state gubernatorial election.

## Current Status

Prince Tom Iseghohi initially secured the Action Alliance (AA) gubernatorial ticket in April 2024, positioning himself as a contender in the September 21, 2024 Edo state gubernatorial election[1]. He had previously been a gubernatorial aspirant on the platform of the Labour Party (LP) before switching to the Action Alliance.

However, according to reports from September 16, 2024, Prince Tom Iseghohi Okojie has withdrawn from the gubernatorial race[2]. This development significantly impacts any forecast regarding his chances of winning the election.

## Recent Developments

The most critical recent development is that Prince Tom Iseghohi has not only withdrawn from the race but has also pledged his support for the All Progressives Congress (APC) candidate, Monday Okpebholo[2]. As part of this endorsement, he promised to mobilize approximately 65,000 people to vote for the APC candidate[2].

This withdrawal occurred just days before the scheduled September 21, 2024 election, making it a significant late-stage development in the electoral process.

## Analysis and Forecast

Based on the available information, Prince Tom Iseghohi cannot win the September 21, 2024 Edo state gubernatorial election as he is no longer a candidate in the race. His withdrawal and subsequent endorsement of the APC candidate effectively eliminates any possibility of him becoming the next governor of Edo State through this election.

The earlier characterization from April 2024 suggesting that Iseghohi was a frontrunner is now outdated given his withdrawal from the race entirely.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

The information available is limited to news reports, and while the withdrawal appears to be definitive, there could theoretically be additional developments between September 16 and the election date that aren't captured in the available sources. However, given the proximity to the election date, a reversal of his withdrawal would be highly unusual in the Nigerian electoral context.
