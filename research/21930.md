## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Since the end of World War II, Western European countries have not experienced civil wars with mass fatalities; even during periods of severe unrest (e.g., the Troubles in Northern Ireland), death tolls have remained well below 10,000.
- As of July 2024, political violence in Europe is low by global standards. The ACLED Conflict Index does not rank any Western European country among the world’s most conflict-prone nations[1].
- The Global Conflict Risk Index (GCRI) by the European Commission continues to rate most Western and Southern European countries as extremely low risk for violent conflict over the next 1–4 years[2].
- The International Crisis Group’s major conflict watchlist for 2024 does not identify any Western European country as at high risk for civil war[3].

## 2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- NATO and EU security cooperation remains robust, and affluence in the region is high—these factors historically correlate with lower internal conflict risk[4].
- Rising political polarization and populism are noted, but institutional resilience (strong democracies, rule of law) remains intact in these countries[4].
- While there are warnings about the potential for social unrest, especially around immigration and identity issues, no credible authority predicts civil war on the scale specified in Caplan’s bet (10,000 deaths)[4][5].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- ACLED Conflict Index (tracks real-time political violence)[1]
- Global Conflict Risk Index from the European Commission[2]
- International Crisis Group’s annual conflict watchlist[3]
- Academic and policy analysis (e.g., LSE, Social Europe) contextualizing warnings and differentiating between unrest and true civil war[4][5]

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- While current trends are favorable, risk is not zero. Unforeseen geopolitical shocks, institutional collapse, or external interventions could alter the outlook, though these remain highly unlikely in the countries specified by Caplan’s bet.
- Measurement relies on media reporting and international consensus on what constitutes a “civil war” and when the casualty threshold is met, as specified by the bet’s resolution criteria.

## 5. Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Based on all available data as of early 2024, the probability that Caplan will win his bet—i.e., that there will be no qualifying civil war in a non-communist European country by 2046—remains very high. The structural and historical resilience of these countries, supported by current conflict indices and expert analysis, suggests the likelihood of such a civil war is extremely low (well under 5% by conventional expert judgment). However, this is not absolute: rare, systemic shocks or cascading crises could increase risk marginally over the next two decades, but there is currently no evidence of an imminent or medium-term threat that would meet the bet’s criteria[1][2][3][4][5].
