## Key Trends and Current Status

- The Inflation Reduction Act’s Section 45V established a 10-year, tiered tax credit for clean hydrogen, with the highest credits reserved for production processes meeting strict greenhouse gas (GHG) emission thresholds[3][5].
- In early 2025, the Biden administration finalized regulations that somewhat eased the original “three pillars” standards, broadening eligibility for the credit to more hydrogen production methods, including some using blue hydrogen and certain legacy renewable and nuclear sources[3][5].
- Despite these regulatory adjustments, political opposition to the tax credit has intensified, with critics arguing it is costly and insufficiently targeted.

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- On May 22, 2025, the US House of Representatives passed a bill to repeal the 45V clean hydrogen tax credit entirely, placing almost all US green hydrogen projects at risk[1].
- This action represents a major legislative step toward repeal, though the bill’s fate now depends on Senate approval and presidential action.
- The most recent regulatory changes (as of early 2025) did not forestall these repeal efforts[3][5].

## Factors Affecting the Forecast

- The move to scrap 45V passed the House but has not yet passed the Senate; further negotiation is possible, particularly over whether a safe harbor for existing projects will be included.
- Previous tax credit repeals often feature safe harbor provisions to protect projects already underway, suggesting a non-negligible probability of such a measure being added.
- The industry consensus is that loss of the credit would be highly disruptive, potentially influencing lawmakers to soften the impact via grandfathering.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

- With the House’s approval of a repeal bill, the most probable scenario is that the 45V credit will be repealed or sunset prior to 2026.
- The likelihood of a "2025-2026 sunset with safe harbor" is moderate to high, reflecting both political momentum for repeal and historical precedent for protecting ongoing investments.
- The possibility of no sunset reduction before 2026 is now considerably lower, barring Senate gridlock or presidential veto.

### Probabilistic Ranking (as of 2025-05-25):

| Outcome                                 | Likelihood (Qualitative) |
|------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| 2025-2026 sunset w/ safe harbor          | High                     |
| 2025-2026 sunset w/o safe harbor         | Moderate                 |
| No sunset reduction before 2026          | Low                      |
| Other options (2027-2031 sunsets)        | Very low                 |

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- Final outcome depends on Senate negotiation and presidential signature.
- The safe harbor provision’s inclusion remains uncertain until bill passage.
- Political dynamics and industry lobbying could still alter the legislative endgame.
