## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The Section 45V Clean Hydrogen Production Tax Credit was established by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 to incentivize low-carbon hydrogen production, with credits up to $3.00/kg depending on carbon intensity[1][5].
- Final regulations for 45V were issued by the IRS and Treasury in January 2025, after extensive public comment and interagency collaboration. These regulations increased flexibility for hydrogen producers but retained strict requirements for eligibility, such as incrementality, hourly matching, and deliverability for renewable energy certificates[5].
- The Biden administration had previously loosened some qualifying rules for 45V, allowing more carbon-intensive hydrogen production methods to qualify[2].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- With the transition to the Trump administration, there is significant uncertainty regarding the future of 45V. The administration and Congress are actively considering budget cuts, and the repeal or reduction of IRA energy tax credits, including 45V, is under discussion[2][3][4].
- The Congressional Review Act could be used to overturn the final regulations, but this would not itself repeal the statutory credit or change its scheduled sunset[5].
- As of early May 2025, no legislation has been enacted to repeal or accelerate the sunset of 45V. However, the possibility of such action remains high, given political dynamics and fiscal pressures[2][3][4].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- IRS and Treasury final regulations (January 2025)[1][5]
- Congressional and policy analysis from CSIS and EFI Foundation[2][4]
- Legal commentary from Morgan Lewis and Baker Botts[1][3]

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- There is high uncertainty about Congressional action before January 1, 2026. While repeal or sunset acceleration is possible, no such legislation has been enacted as of May 2025.
- The Congressional Review Act could overturn the final regulations but would not itself change the statutory sunset date.
- No evidence of a safe harbor provision being included in any current legislative proposals.

## Forecast

Based on all available factual information as of April-May 2025, the most likely outcome is:

**No sunset reduction before 2026**

No legislation has yet been enacted to reduce the planned phase-out date of 45V or repeal it, though the risk of such action remains high in the near future.
