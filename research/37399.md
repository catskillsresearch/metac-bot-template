# River Avon Level Forecast Analysis for July 1, 2025

As of May 29, 2025, I'm analyzing the forecast for the River Avon water level at Bath Destructor Bridge for July 1, 2025. This analysis examines current conditions, historical patterns, and contextual factors to generate a probabilistic assessment.

## Current Status

The River Avon at Bath Destructor Bridge is currently experiencing high water levels. As of 6:45 PM on May 29, 2025, the river level stands at 4.52m with a rising trend, and the state is classified as "High"[1]. This measurement significantly exceeds the upper threshold of the normal range (3.81m), above which low-lying land flooding becomes possible[1].

However, there is some conflicting data regarding the immediate trend. While the official government measurement indicates a rising trend, another monitoring source reports the river has been "trending down" over the most recent 3-hour period, showing a measurement of 4.46m as of 5:30 PM on the same day[5].

## Historical Context

The River Avon at this location has established parameters that help contextualize the current situation:

- **Normal Range**: The usual range is between 3.40m and 3.81m, which represents the levels observed 90% of the time since monitoring began[2]
- **Recent Typical Range**: Over the past 12 months, the typical level has been between 3.43m and 3.64m[2]
- **Historical Maximum**: The highest ever recorded level was 5.41m, reached on December 24, 2013[2]

The current level of 4.52m is therefore:
- 0.71m above the upper normal threshold
- 0.88m above the recent typical upper range
- 0.89m below the historical maximum

## Forecast Considerations

Several factors must be considered when projecting the river level for July 1, 2025:

1. **Seasonal Patterns**: The transition from spring to summer typically brings changing precipitation patterns. While the search results don't provide specific seasonal data for this river, general UK patterns would suggest declining river levels as summer approaches.

2. **Regional Exception**: The BBC reports that "Almost all of the UK is expected to have below normal or low river levels in May, apart from the south-west of England and southern Wales." Bath is located in the south-west of England, suggesting this area might continue to experience higher-than-average river levels compared to the rest of the country.

3. **Current Elevated State**: The river is currently significantly above normal levels. Even with a natural decline toward summer conditions, the starting point is unusually high.

4. **Trend Uncertainty**: The conflicting short-term trend data (rising vs. falling over the last 3 hours) creates uncertainty about immediate direction.

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on the available data as of May 29, 2025, my assessment for the River Avon level at Bath Destructor Bridge on July 1, 2025, is:

- **High (25% probability)**: If current elevated levels persist due to ongoing regional precipitation patterns in the south-west that differ from national trends, the river could remain above the 3.81m threshold.

- **Normal (60% probability)**: The most likely scenario is that the river will return to its normal range (3.40m-3.81m) over the next month as seasonal patterns typically bring drier conditions approaching summer. The river has substantial room to fall (0.71m) before reaching normal range.

- **Low (15% probability)**: While the BBC reports suggests low river levels nationally, the south-west is noted as an exception. Therefore, while possible, it seems less likely that the river would fall below the 3.40m lower threshold of the normal range.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors limit the precision of this forecast:

1. The search results don't provide historical seasonal patterns specific to this river location
2. There's limited information about rainfall forecasts for the coming month
3. The conflicting trend data creates uncertainty about immediate direction
4. No information is available about planned water management activities that might affect river levels
