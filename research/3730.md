## Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of March 2020, five countries—China, Cuba, Laos, Vietnam, and North Korea—meet the strict criteria for being communist states: explicit constitutional commitment to socialism, UN membership, and single-party Marxist rule[1][2][3][4].
- This number has been stable since the early 1990s, following the collapse of the Soviet Union and communist regimes in Eastern Europe. No new states have joined this group in the past three decades, and several previously communist states have transitioned to other forms of government[2][4].

## Key Differences and Recent Developments

- North Korea's 2009 constitutional revision removed explicit references to Marxism-Leninism, though its ruling party's ideology remains rooted in Marxist-Leninist tradition[3].
- Ongoing communist insurgencies in countries like the Philippines, India, Peru, Paraguay, and Colombia have failed to establish new communist states in recent decades and currently lack the capacity to do so[3].
- Global political trends since 1990 have favored democratization and market reforms, with few signs of a renewed wave of successful communist revolutions or single-party Marxist takeovers[4].
- The five existing communist states have shown institutional resilience, but face economic, demographic, and legitimacy challenges that could threaten regime continuity, particularly in Cuba and North Korea.

## Probabilistic Assessment

- The most likely scenario is continued stability or a slight decline: there is a high probability that the number of communist states in 2050 will remain at five or fall to four or three due to regime change or ideological shifts in existing states.
- The emergence of new communist states remains unlikely without major geopolitical upheaval or successful insurgencies, which current trends do not support.
- A reasonable probabilistic range for January 1, 2050, is 2–5 communist states, with the single most probable outcome being 4 or 5.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- Predicting regime change, especially in closed or authoritarian states, involves significant uncertainty.
- Changes in constitutional language or party ideology, as seen in North Korea, can blur the classification of a "communist state."
- Unexpected geopolitical, economic, or technological developments could alter the forecast.
