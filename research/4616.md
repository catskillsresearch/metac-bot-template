## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- US life expectancy at birth has risen from 68.2 years in 1950 to about 79.25 years in 2024[1].
- Life expectancy peaked near 79 years prior to 2020, but recent years saw declines due to factors including chronic disease, opioid overdoses, suicides, and notably the COVID-19 pandemic[4][5].
- During the pandemic, life expectancy dropped from 79.7 years in 2017 to 76.1 years in 2021[5].
- By 2022, provisional CDC data showed a rebound to 77.5 years, and in 2023, it increased to 78.4 years—approaching pre-pandemic levels[2][4][5].

## 2. Reference Cases and Key Differences

**Reference Case:**  
From 1950–2019, the US experienced a mostly upward trend in life expectancy, with a slowing and brief reversal in the late 2010s and early 2020s.

**Key Differences Affecting the Forecast:**
- The COVID-19 pandemic caused a rare, sharp, but short-term drop in life expectancy, which is already rebounding[5].
- Structural issues (chronic disease, drug overdoses, suicides) remain, but their impact, while significant, has not driven life expectancy below 76 years in recent history[4].
- Projections from the CDC and other sources expect a gradual increase, not a further decline, with life expectancy projected to reach 80.4 years by 2050[1].

## 3. Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

- The lowest recent life expectancy was 76.1 years in 2021, during peak COVID-19 mortality[5]. Even this acute public health crisis did not drop the measure below 75 years.
- Projections for the coming decades, incorporating current health challenges, estimate US life expectancy will rise modestly, not fall[1].
- For the US to record a value below 75 years, it would require a decline of more than 2 years from the lowest pandemic-era value, sustained or worsened by new, large-scale public health crises or dramatic negative shifts in mortality trends.
- No authoritative forecast (UN, CDC, SSA) expects such a decline under current trajectories.

**Assessment:**  
The probability that US life expectancy at birth for both sexes will fall below 75 years at any point before 2040 is very low (estimated probability: <5%).

## 4. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- CDC FastStats regularly reports US life expectancy[2].
- United Nations and WHO publish global life expectancy statistics.
- US Social Security Administration publishes annual actuarial life tables[3].

## 5. Limitations and Uncertainties

- Life expectancy can change rapidly due to unforeseen events (e.g., pandemics, wars, environmental disasters).
- Social and healthcare policy shifts could affect mortality but would need to be extreme to drive a >3-year drop from current levels.
- Data accuracy and reporting lags may affect year-to-year comparisons, but long-term trends are well-tracked.
