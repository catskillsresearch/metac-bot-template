### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- OpenAI has operated under a hybrid structure: a nonprofit parent (OpenAI Nonprofit) fully controls a for-profit subsidiary (OpenAI LP), with the nonprofit board as the governing body[3].
- This structure was designed to align investor incentives with OpenAI's mission while enabling capital raising[1][3].

### Recent Announcements and Policies

- In late 2024, OpenAI announced plans to restructure its for-profit arm into a Delaware public benefit corporation (PBC) with ordinary shares, separating business operations from nonprofit board control[4][1].
- The nonprofit will retain shares in the new PBC, and the mission will be codified as the public benefit[4].
- Sam Altman told staff the nonprofit structure would change in 2025, but no specific date for the legal transition was provided[2].

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The Delaware Division of Corporations entity search (file number 5902936) is the definitive source for OpenAI's legal status and "Exempt" designation as of March 31, 2025.

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- As of February 12, 2025, there is no public confirmation that OpenAI's new public benefit corporation will be listed as "Exempt" by Delaware.
- The restructuring is planned for 2025, but the exact date of legal effect is not specified in available sources.
- "Exempt" status in Delaware is typically reserved for nonprofits and certain qualifying entities; not all PBCs are exempt from franchise taxes.
- The continued involvement of the nonprofit as a shareholder may or may not affect exemption status, depending on Delaware law and the specifics of the filing.

### Summary

Based on all available information as of February 12, 2025, OpenAI is in the process of restructuring into a Delaware public benefit corporation, but there is no definitive evidence that it will be listed as "Exempt" by the Delaware Division of Corporations on March 31, 2025. The outcome depends on the timing of the legal transition and Delaware's classification of the new entity, both of which remain uncertain.
