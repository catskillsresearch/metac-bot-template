# Forecasting Bloc Québécois vs Conservative Party Seat Count in Quebec

Based on available polling and analysis as of mid-April 2025, here's an assessment of whether the Bloc Québécois will win more seats in Quebec than the Conservative Party in the upcoming 2025 Canadian federal election.

## Current Status and Polling Trends

As of late March 2025, polling data indicates that the Bloc Québécois is positioned ahead of the Conservative Party in Quebec, though both parties trail behind the Liberal Party. According to Nanos Research polling from March 30, 2025, the Liberals lead in Quebec with 41% support, followed by the Bloc Québécois at 26%, while the Conservatives sit at 22%[1]. This suggests the Bloc maintains a 4-point advantage over the Conservatives in the province.

However, there are indications that the Bloc Québécois is facing challenges. Analysis from "The Writ" on April 3, 2025, explicitly states that "The Bloc is in trouble"[4]. This assessment comes amid a broader political landscape where the Conservatives have reportedly "surrendered most of the gains they made in 2023 and 2024 to the Liberals"[4].

## Seat Projections and Regional Dynamics

Temple Scott Associates' seat projection from March 24, 2025, forecasts that the Bloc Québécois will lose seats in the upcoming election[5]. While specific numbers comparing Bloc and Conservative seat counts in Quebec aren't provided, this projection suggests a weakening position for the Bloc.

The same analysis identifies La Prairie—Atateken in Quebec as "one of the closest races in the country between the Bloc Québécois and the Liberal Party," noting that "the Bloc may be playing defence in this one"[5]. This indicates that the Bloc's primary electoral battle in at least some ridings is against the Liberals rather than the Conservatives.

## Gender and Demographic Factors

National polling data shows significant gender divides that could impact Quebec results. According to Angus Reid Institute data from March 31, 2025, the Conservatives lead by two points among men nationally, while the Liberals lead by 19 points among women[2]. Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre faces challenges with female voters, with 61% of women viewing him unfavorably[2]. This gender gap could be particularly significant in Quebec, where the Bloc has traditionally relied on a diverse coalition of voters.

## Overall Electoral Context

The broader electoral context shows the Liberals under Prime Minister Mark Carney with a strong position nationally, leading the Conservatives by 8 percentage points (46% to 38%) according to Angus Reid[2]. The Bloc Québécois' national support sits at 7%[2], which is consistent with their regional concentration in Quebec.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors create uncertainty in forecasting the Quebec results:

1. The available polling data is from late March/early April 2025, and voter intentions may shift significantly before election day.

2. The search results don't provide detailed seat-by-seat projections for Quebec, making it difficult to precisely compare potential Bloc versus Conservative seat counts.

3. Regional variations within Quebec could create unexpected outcomes in individual ridings that aren't captured in province-wide polling.

4. The search results suggest a fluid political situation with the Bloc facing challenges, but don't definitively indicate whether they will outperform the Conservatives in seat count.

Based on the available information, the Bloc Québécois appears to have a polling advantage over the Conservatives in Quebec, but is facing significant challenges that could affect their final seat count. The primary threat to the Bloc appears to be from the Liberals rather than the Conservatives, but without more detailed seat projections, it's difficult to make a definitive forecast about whether they will win more seats than the Conservatives in Quebec.
