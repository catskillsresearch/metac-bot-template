Based on the available information as of April 21, 2025, here's an analysis to help forecast whether the Bloc Québécois will win more seats in Quebec than the Conservative Party in the upcoming 2025 Canadian federal election.

## Current Electoral Landscape

The 2025 Canadian federal election is currently underway, with parties actively campaigning across the country. In Quebec specifically, the electoral dynamics show significant shifts compared to previous elections.

### Current Seat Distribution

Prior to the dissolution of Parliament, the seat distribution was as follows:
- Liberal Party: 153 seats
- Conservative Party: 120 seats
- Bloc Québécois: 33 seats
- NDP: 24 seats[4]

It's important to note that the Bloc Québécois only runs candidates in Quebec, as it is a Quebec-focused sovereigntist party. The party's entire seat count of 33 was from Quebec constituencies.

### Current Projections

The most recent polling data as of April 20, 2025, indicates a significant shift in the projected outcome:
- Liberals are projected to win 196 seats
- Conservatives are projected to win 122 seats
- Bloc Québécois is projected to win 19 seats
- NDP is projected to win 5 seats[4]

This represents a substantial decline for the Bloc Québécois, potentially losing 14 seats from their previous position. The current projections suggest the Bloc's influence in Quebec is waning.

## Key Factors Affecting the Bloc's Performance

### Liberal Resurgence Under Mark Carney

The Liberal Party has experienced a significant boost in support following the leadership transition from Justin Trudeau to Mark Carney. This surge in Liberal popularity has come "largely at the expense of the NDP and the Bloc."[4]

The Carney government's strong stance against US President Donald Trump and his tariffs has resonated with Canadian voters, including those in Quebec, further strengthening Liberal support at the expense of other parties.[4]

### Bloc Québécois Campaign Strategy

The Bloc launched its election campaign in March 2025 with the slogan "Je choisis le Québec" (I choose Quebec), emphasizing its nationalist focus.[3] However, this messaging appears to be less effective in the current political climate than in previous elections.

### Conservative Presence in Quebec

While specific data on Conservative seats in Quebec is limited, we know they hold some constituencies in the province, such as Portneuf—Jacques-Cartier.[2] The Conservative Party maintained relatively stable support nationally, with projections showing a slight increase from 120 to 122 seats.[4]

## Forecast Analysis

Based on the available data, the Bloc Québécois appears to be losing ground in Quebec, with projections showing a reduction from 33 to 19 seats.[4] While we don't have specific numbers for how many Quebec seats the Conservatives are projected to win, the overall national projection shows them maintaining or slightly increasing their seat count.

The probability analysis from polling data indicates:
- 86% probability of Liberals winning a majority
- 12% probability of Liberals winning the most seats but not a majority
- Only 1% probability of Conservatives winning a majority
- 1% probability of Conservatives winning the most seats[4]

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors could still influence the outcome:
- Polling data has inherent margins of error
- Voter turnout can significantly impact results
- Regional variations within Quebec are not fully captured in national polling
- Campaign developments between now and election day could shift voter intentions

The available information suggests the Bloc Québécois is facing significant challenges in maintaining its previous level of representation, but specific comparative data between Conservative and Bloc performance specifically in Quebec is limited in the search results.
