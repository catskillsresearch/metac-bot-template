# Google Search Market Share Analysis: Forecast for 2025

Based on the latest data available as of May 2025, I'll analyze whether Google's search market share is likely to drop below 85% during the remainder of 2025.

## Current Market Share Status

Google's global search market share has been experiencing a gradual decline over recent months. As of April 2025, Google holds 89.65% of the worldwide search engine market[1]. This represents a continuation of a trend that began in late 2024 when Google's market share first dropped below 90% - a threshold it had consistently maintained since 2015[3].

Looking at the most recent data available:
- April 2025: 89.65% global market share[1]
- March 2025: 79.1% market share on desktop devices specifically[2]
- February 2025: 90.15% global market share (a slight rebound)[5]

For most of 2025 so far, Google's market share has remained in the "high 89% range"[5]. According to ContentGrip, Google has been below the 90% threshold for six of the last seven months as of mid-April 2025[5].

## Historical Trend Analysis

The data shows a clear downward trajectory in Google's market dominance:
- December 2023: 91.6% (mentioned in the question)
- Q4 2024: Averaged 89.6%[3]
- Early 2025: Predominantly in the high 89% range[5]

This represents approximately a 2 percentage point decline over about 16 months. While the decline is notable, the rate of change appears gradual rather than precipitous.

## Competitive Landscape

The market share being lost by Google is being distributed among several competitors:

As of Q4 2024:
- Bing: 4.0%[3]
- Yandex: 2.6%[3]
- Yahoo!: 1.3%[3]
- Others: 2.4%[3]

The most recent data from April 2025 shows:
- Bing: 3.89%[1]
- Yandex: 2.53%[1]
- Yahoo: 1.33% (as of April 2025)[5]
- DuckDuckGo: 0.79% (as of April 2025)[5]

## Factors Affecting Google's Market Share

Several factors appear to be contributing to Google's gradual decline:

1. **Regional shifts**: Industry analysis points to Asia as a region where Google has experienced three months of decline[3].

2. **Competitive gains**: Main search rivals including Bing and Yahoo! have gained share during the same period that Google has declined[3].

3. **AI-native competitors**: The rise of AI search alternatives may be creating "cracks" in Google's long-held dominance, though the impact is still relatively small[5].

## Measurement Limitations

It's important to note the limitations in how search market share is measured, particularly regarding AI-powered search tools. As explained in the question:

1. The primary measurement methodology tracks search engine referrals (clicks to websites) rather than actual search queries.

2. AI search tools like Bing Chat may provide answers directly without requiring users to click through to websites, potentially underrepresenting their actual usage in market share statistics.

## Forecast Analysis

Based on the available data, Google's search market share has declined from approximately 91.6% in December 2023 to 89.65% in April 2025 - a drop of about 2 percentage points over 16 months. This represents a decline rate of roughly 0.125 percentage points per month.

At this rate of decline, it would take approximately 37-38 months from April 2025 to reach 85% market share (4.65 percentage points รท 0.125 points per month). This timeline extends well beyond the end of 2025.

However, several factors could potentially accelerate this decline:
- Continued innovation from competitors
- Further adoption of AI search alternatives
- Regional shifts in search preferences, particularly in Asia

## Conclusion

Based on the current trend, Google's search market share is unlikely to drop below 85% during 2025. The current rate of decline is too gradual to reach this threshold within the remaining months of 2025. While Google has experienced a notable decline from its peak market share, dropping below 90% for the first time in nearly a decade, the current trajectory suggests it will maintain a market share above 85% through the end of 2025.

That said, the search landscape is evolving rapidly with the integration of AI technologies, and unexpected disruptions or accelerated adoption of alternative search methods could potentially change this forecast.
