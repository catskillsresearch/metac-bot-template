**1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status**

- As of March 2025, Google's global search engine market share is 89.74%, according to Statcounter data[2][5].
- This represents a decline from 91.6% in December 2023 and 89.7% in December 2024, indicating a drop of approximately 1.9 percentage points in one year[2].
- Google’s global share has consistently stayed below 90% for most of the last seven months, the first time this has happened in over a decade[5].
- Major competitors remain Bing (4.00%), Yandex (2.49%), Yahoo! (1.33%), and DuckDuckGo (0.79%), with Bing showing notable growth, driven by AI integration[2][5].

**2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric**

- Bing's integration with AI (notably ChatGPT) has contributed to its growth in market share, particularly in the U.S., but global gains remain relatively modest[2].
- Google and other traditional search engines have also implemented new AI features to retain users and compete with AI-native search tools[2][5].
- There have been no major announcements indicating an imminent, drastic shift in search market share distribution as of early May 2025.

**3. Authoritative Sources for Verification**

- Statcounter Global Stats and Statista remain the primary sources for monthly global search engine market share data[1][2][5].
- These sources are used for official measurement and will determine the resolution of the forecast according to the question's criteria.

**4. Limitations and Uncertainties in Measurement**

- Statcounter measures search engine market share based on website referrals, not direct search queries—AI tools that answer within their interface may not generate measurable referrals, potentially underestimating their impact[2].
- Statcounter notes that Bing Chat and similar AI tools currently account for a negligible share of web referrals (less than 1/100 of 1 percent), suggesting their real-world effect on measurable search share is still limited as of early 2025[2].
- If AI-native search adoption accelerates and shifts user behavior rapidly, current measurement methods may lag in reflecting the true impact.

**Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment**

- Given the slow rate of decline (about 2 percentage points per year) and stabilization in the high 89% range, it is unlikely that Google's global search market share will fall below 85% in any month of 2025 unless there is an unexpected, sharp acceleration in user migration or a disruptive shift in measurement methodology.
- The probability of Google's share dropping below 85% in 2025 is low, barring unforeseen developments.
