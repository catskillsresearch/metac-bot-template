### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Intuitive Machines' first lunar mission, IM-1, successfully landed the Nova-C class lander (Odysseus) on the Moon in 2024, marking the first commercial soft landing. However, the lander tipped over, which affected the ability of some payloads to operate as intended[3].
- The IM-2 mission, using a similar Nova-C class lander named Athena, is the company's second lunar mission and is intended to deliver NASA payloads as part of the Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) initiative[3].
- As of January 28, 2025, the IM-2 lander had been delivered to Cape Canaveral, Florida, for launch preparations[3].

### Recent Announcements and Policies

- The IM-2 mission's launch window opens no earlier than February 26, 2025, with the possibility of backup opportunities if conditions are unfavorable[3][4].
- The mission aims to validate resource prospecting, mobility, and communications infrastructure at the Moon's Mons Mouton region[3].
- The mission is scheduled very close to the April 1, 2025, deadline, leaving little margin for delays or post-landing operations[3][4].

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Official press releases from Intuitive Machines and NASA, as well as reputable news outlets and launch tracking forums, confirm the delivery of the lander and the planned launch window[3][4].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- As of February 1, 2025, there is no public evidence that the IM-2 mission has launched, landed, or operated its payloads on the Moon.
- The tight timeline between the earliest possible launch (February 26, 2025) and the April 1, 2025, deadline leaves little room for delays, transit time to the Moon (typically several days), landing, and the required 24-hour payload operation window.
- The IM-1 mission demonstrated the technical challenges of lunar landings, as the lander tipped over, impacting payload operations. The Nova-C design remains relatively unproven for perfect landings and fully operational payload delivery as defined by the resolution criteria[3].
- Any delay in launch or post-landing issues could prevent the mission from meeting the criteria before April 1, 2025.

### Conclusion

Based on all available factual information as of February 1, 2025, Intuitive Machines has not yet landed with fully working payloads on the Moon before April 1, 2025. The IM-2 mission is scheduled for launch no earlier than February 26, 2025, making it unlikely—given transit, landing, and operational requirements—that the criteria will be met before the deadline. There is no evidence of a successful, perfect landing with all payloads operating as intended for 24 hours as of the cutoff date.
