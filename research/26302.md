# Forecasting Potential Large-Scale Riots in the US (July-September 2024)

The question of whether the United States will experience a large-scale riot between July 17 and September 30, 2024, requires analysis of current political tensions, historical patterns, and expert assessments. This period coincides with critical events in the 2024 election cycle, including national party conventions and the lead-up to the November election.

## Historical Context and Current Status

Recent American history has seen relatively few events that would qualify as "large-scale riots" under the specified criteria. The 1992 Los Angeles riots, mentioned in the question description, resulted in more than 60 deaths, 2,350 injuries, and 12,000 arrests. The January 6, 2021 Capitol attack, while significant, resulted in 5 deaths and did not meet the numerical thresholds defined in the question.

The current political climate in the United States shows signs of heightened tension. Experts have noted that the 2024 election is occurring in a context of increasing polarization that has "stoked threats against several communities and prompted the mobilization of militias and militant social movements"[5]. This polarization has led some observers to warn about the possibility of political violence during this electoral season.

## Key Risk Factors and Potential Triggers

Several specific events during the July-September 2024 timeframe present elevated risks:

1. **National Party Conventions**: The Republican National Convention in Milwaukee in July and the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in August are identified as potential flashpoints. These events will host "the largest collections of party members and leaders throughout the entire election cycle and could therefore attract individuals or groups with a vendetta"[4].

2. **Legal Proceedings**: Dates associated with former President Trump's legal challenges could "trigger violent extremists"[4]. The unprecedented situation of a presidential candidate facing legal troubles has been identified as a potential accelerant for violence.

3. **Extremist Group Mobilization**: There are concerns about armed militia groups potentially gathering at political events or polling places, similar to how Oath Keepers gathered at polling places in 2020[4].

## Expert Assessments

Security officials have expressed concern about the potential for violence:

- FBI Director Christopher Wray has suggested growing concerns about "the potential for a coordinated attack here in the homeland, not unlike the ISIS-K attack we saw at the Russian concert hall back in March"[1].

- The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has warned that "threat actors" will likely "converge on 2024 election season"[1].

Despite these warnings, experts generally assess that while some level of violence is "almost certain," a full-scale civil war is unlikely in the United States[1]. Geographic distinctions between potential opposing factions today run urban-rural rather than north-south, which would make it difficult for any seditious movement to establish the geographical safe haven needed for nationwide conflict[1].

## Monitoring and Preparedness

In response to these concerns, monitoring efforts have been established:

- The Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED) has relaunched its US Crisis Monitor specifically to track election-related violence and unrest ahead of the November 5, 2024 elections[5].

- This monitoring includes monthly in-depth reporting on key election-related themes and their potential impact on trends of violence in the US, with particular attention to demonstration trends and militia activity in key states[5].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors complicate forecasting efforts:

1. **Rhetoric vs. Reality**: While political rhetoric has included references to potential violence (including statements shared by Trump suggesting that 2024 might resemble 1776), experts note that "punditry is not prophecy"[1].

2. **Unpredictable Triggers**: While certain dates and events present elevated risks, the specific triggers for large-scale unrest are difficult to predict with precision.

3. **Scale Threshold**: The criteria for a "large-scale riot" as defined in the question set a high threshold that few historical events in modern US history have reached. While smaller-scale unrest may occur, events meeting the specified criteria (50+ deaths, 10,000+ arrests, or $1B+ in damages) remain statistically rare.

The most urgent warning sign of impending violence, according to experts, will be "the words of the candidates themselves"[4]. Political rhetoric that explicitly or implicitly endorses violence could significantly increase the likelihood of unrest.
