### Key Factual Information as of 2024-09-19

**1. Historical Trends and Current Status**
- Since the October 7, 2023 attacks, Israel has faced a dramatic increase in hostilities, including over 10,000 rocket attacks by early 2024, with a similar rate continuing through September 2024[1].
- Despite the high volume of attacks, Israel's air and missile defense systems have largely prevented mass-casualty incidents within its borders. Notable exceptions, such as the 2024 Iranian and Houthi attacks, resulted in zero and one fatality, respectively, within Israel[1].
- The deadliest recent attacks within Israel's borders (excluding the October 7 event) have not reached the five-fatality threshold required by the question[1].

**2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric**
- There have been no significant changes in Israeli defense policy or posture that would suggest a sudden increase in vulnerability to mass-casualty attacks.
- International actors (e.g., Canada) continue to impose sanctions and maintain pressure on groups like Hamas, but these measures have not directly altered the immediate risk of large-scale attacks within Israel[3].

**3. Authoritative Sources for Verification**
- The Congressional Research Service provides detailed casualty figures and context for ongoing hostilities[1].
- The Global Terrorism Index 2024 notes a global increase in terrorism deaths, but also highlights that the Middle East has seen a decrease in the number of incidents, even as attacks have become deadlier on average[4].
- UN bulletins and other international reports confirm ongoing violence but do not report any mass-casualty attacks within Israel's recognized borders in recent months[5].

**4. Limitations and Uncertainties**
- The possibility of a sudden, coordinated, or mass-casualty attack cannot be ruled out, given the volatile security environment and the history of surprise attacks in the region.
- The strict geographic and fatality criteria of the question exclude many attacks in adjacent territories or those causing fewer than five deaths.
- Information on attacks may be delayed or incomplete due to reporting restrictions or ongoing investigations.

### Summary Table: Recent Major Attacks Within Israel (Post-Oct 7, 2023)

| Date         | Attack Type         | Fatalities (within Israel) | Notes                                      |
|--------------|--------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Oct 7, 2023  | Hamas incursion    | 1,200+                    | Not within forecast window                 |
| Apr 2024     | Iranian missile    | 0                         | No deaths reported[1]                      |
| 2024         | Houthi drone       | 1                         | Single death reported[1]                   |
| Sep 2024     | Hezbollah escalation (Lebanon) | 0 (in Israel)              | Mass casualties in Lebanon, not Israel[1]  |

### Conclusion

As of September 19, 2024, there is no evidence of a deadly attack within Israel causing at least five deaths since the October 7, 2023 attacks. While the risk remains elevated due to ongoing hostilities and recent escalations, Israel's defenses have so far prevented such incidents within its recognized borders. The possibility of a mass-casualty attack cannot be ruled out, but no credible reports indicate that such an attack is imminent or has occurred as of the current date.
