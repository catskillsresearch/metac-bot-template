## 1. Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of September 2021, the European Army was a long-debated but unrealized concept. The EU’s Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) enabled cooperation but left defense as a national prerogative[3][5].
- The idea gained renewed attention after the AUKUS pact and public statements from EU leaders, including Ursula von der Leyen and the prime ministers of France, Italy, and Greece, who called for deeper integration and discussed frameworks like a “European Defence Union”[3].
- No concrete legislative steps had been taken toward creating a European Army as defined—i.e., one of at least 30,000 troops, with supranational command, and legislation passed in at least five European countries (including France, Germany, or the UK).

## 2. Recent Announcements and Policies

- In March 2025, the European Commission introduced the ReArm Europe Plan/Readiness 2030, aiming to boost defense spending and joint procurement among EU states. The plan allows EU countries to allocate up to 1.5% of GDP to defense spending and provides €150 billion in loans for joint military purchases[1].
- The European Parliament supports these initiatives, pushing for strategic autonomy and a more robust EU security posture, particularly in response to the ongoing war in Ukraine[1][2].
- Despite these advances, these measures focus on capability-building, not on the legislative integration or formation of a standing army under supranational command.

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- European Parliament and Commission policy documents and statements[1][2]
- News reporting on recent defense summits and bilateral agreements[3][4]
- Academic and think tank analyses on EU defense integration[5]

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- The forecast is sensitive to unforeseen geopolitical shocks (e.g., escalation of conflict near EU borders) that could accelerate integration.
- Domestic politics in key member states (France, Germany, UK) remain unpredictable; changes in government could shift the policy landscape.
- Measurement hinges on specific legislative actions, not just policy statements or joint projects.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the available information as of May 2025, the probability that a European Army (as defined in the resolution criteria) will be established before January 1, 2032, remains low—estimated at around 10–20%. Integration efforts have accelerated, but no legislative foundation for such an army is in place, and sovereignty concerns persist in major member states. The most likely scenario is further incremental defense integration, without the creation of a full European Army by 2032.
