## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- **Recent History**: China and India have had a long-standing border dispute, most notably erupting into violence in the 2020 Galwan Valley clash, which resulted in casualties but not near the 1,000 battle-related deaths threshold for a 'war' as defined here.
- **2024–2025 Status**: As of late 2024 and into 2025, relations have shown signs of thawing, with a border agreement reached in late 2024 and ongoing diplomatic engagement. However, underlying tensions and mistrust remain, particularly concerning unresolved territorial claims and the establishment of buffer zones along the Line of Actual Control (LAC)[2][4].
- **Military Posture**: Both sides maintain significant military deployments along the disputed border. China possesses infrastructure and logistical advantages in troop mobilization, which can constrain Indian responses. This asymmetry was evident during the 2020 standoff and remains a concern[4].

## 2. Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Metric

- **Border Agreement (Late 2024)**: There has been a recent (late 2024) border agreement that has led to some de-escalation, though it is not a comprehensive resolution. Both sides have agreed to certain mechanisms to prevent escalation, though implementation and verification remain contentious[2].
- **Buffer Zones/No-Patrol Areas**: The introduction of no-patrolling zones (buffer zones), largely perceived by India as on its side of the LAC, is a source of friction, as it limits Indian access to previously patrolled areas[4].
- **Military Modernization**: Both nations continue to upgrade their military capabilities, including China's rapid force induction abilities in border regions. The recent India-Pakistan conflict (May 2025) also demonstrated China’s willingness to support allies and test new military technologies, albeit indirectly[1].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Reports from international think tanks (e.g., Chatham House, IISS).
- Agreements and statements from Indian and Chinese governments.
- Observations from reputable news agencies and multinational institutions.
- Uppsala University Department of Peace and Conflict Studies for conflict definitions and battle-death data.

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- **Measurement Uncertainty**: Information on casualties in remote border regions may be delayed or subject to dispute. Official numbers can be concealed or manipulated for political reasons.
- **Policy Ambiguity**: While agreements exist, implementation and adherence to de-escalation protocols are not guaranteed, and incidents could escalate quickly.
- **External Factors**: Involvement of third parties (e.g., China’s indirect support for Pakistan) could impact risk calculations, though only direct India-China deaths count per the resolution criteria[1].
- **Strategic Calculations**: Both sides appear to prefer limited skirmishes over full-scale war due to the risks and costs involved, which historically has contained violence below the war threshold.

## Comparative Assessment

| Factor                          | 2020 Situation            | 2025 Situation                 | Implication for Forecast   |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Diplomatic engagement           | Low                       | Improved (border agreement)    | Reduces risk              |
| Military deployments            | High tension, mobilized   | Still high, but more managed   | Slightly reduces risk     |
| Confidence-building measures    | Weak, eroding             | Some restoration, but fragile  | Risk of breakdown remains |
| Buffer zone disputes            | Emerging issue            | Continuing source of friction  | Sustains tension          |
| Trust and transparency          | Low                       | Slight improvement             | Still a vulnerability     |

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the recent thawing of relations, the existence of new border-management agreements, and ongoing—but managed—military deployments, the probability of a China-India war (≥1,000 battle-related deaths in a single year) by 2035 is lower than in the immediate aftermath of the 2020 clashes. However, persistent distrust, unresolved territorial issues, and asymmetrical military advantages suggest that the risk is not negligible.

- **Adjusted Probabilistic Estimate**: The likelihood of a China-India war (as defined) by 2035 is moderately low, but not zero. Improved diplomatic channels and recent agreements are positive, but the presence of unresolved disputes and quick-escalation potential along the LAC keeps the probability above negligible levels.
