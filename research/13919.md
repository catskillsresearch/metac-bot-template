## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Between 1969 and 1972, a total of 12 people landed on the Moon, with no human landings since then as of December 2022[3].
- The Artemis program (NASA) aims to return humans to the Moon, targeting crewed landings as early as 2025–2026, with plans for a "base camp" concept but not a permanent settlement by 2030[1][3].
- Other initiatives, such as ESA's Moon Village and the China-Russia International Lunar Research Station (ILRS), propose permanent or semi-permanent lunar bases, but their timelines for significant human presence start after 2030 (ILRS human-tended base planned for 2036–2045)[3].
- SpaceX's Starship is positioned as a transport vehicle for lunar missions, but as of 2022, there is no confirmed schedule for large-scale lunar habitation[3].

## Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- NASA's Artemis program plans for recurrent crewed landings and potentially longer stays, but mission manifest details suggest initial missions will be short and crews will be small (2–4 astronauts per mission)[1].
- The Artemis Base Camp concept envisions expanded lunar surface operations, but not a continuous presence before 2030[1][3].
- China and Russia's ILRS roadmap (as of 2022) does not anticipate routine human presence until well after 2030[3].
- No credible program as of December 2022 supports the deployment of infrastructure to support more than 4 simultaneous crew on the lunar surface by 2030[1][3].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- NASA Artemis program documentation and official announcements[1][3].
- ESA and CNSA/ROSCOSMOS official lunar base plans[3].
- Historical lunar mission records and public statements[3].

## Limitations or Uncertainties

- All forecasts are conditional on continued funding, political support, and technical progress; delays are common in space programs.
- The actual number of people simultaneously on the Moon depends on mission overlap and possible emergency scenarios.
- Commercial or unexpected national efforts could, in principle, increase crew size, but as of 2022, none are credible for >4.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

- The maximum number of people simultaneously on the Moon in 2030 is most likely to be between 2 and 4, with a best estimate of 4, corresponding to a single Artemis or similar mission on the surface. The likelihood of more than 4 is low, barring a major acceleration in lunar program schedules announced after 2022[1][3].
- Probability breakdown (qualitative):
  - 0: Unlikely (unless all programs are delayed/cancelled)
  - 1–2: Possible (minimum viable crew for a landing mission)
  - 3–4: Most likely (standard crew size for Artemis-class missions)
  - >4: Very unlikely (no infrastructure or plans as of 2022 to support this by 2030)
