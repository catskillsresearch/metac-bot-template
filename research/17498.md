## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Greece and Turkey have a long history of hostilities, including direct military conflicts (notably the Greco-Turkish wars and the 1974 Turkish invasion of Cyprus)[2][5].
- Since the 1970s, there has been no major war between these states, though tensions remain high, particularly over the Aegean Sea and Cyprus[2][5].
- The Cyprus issue, stemming from the 1974 Turkish invasion, is unresolved. The island remains divided, and diplomatic efforts have so far failed to reach a settlement[2][5].
- Turkey recently identified Greece and Cyprus as the top threats to its national security, with ongoing intelligence gathering and threat assessments maintained at high levels[1].
- Over the past decades, both sides have routinely engaged in military posturing—such as airspace violations, naval maneuvers, and intelligence operations—but have generally avoided direct large-scale armed clashes[3].

## 2. Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Metric

- As of May 2024, Turkish military intelligence continues to monitor Greece and Cyprus for early signs of military activity, marking both as persistent threats[1].
- Threat assessments for both Greece and Cyprus indicate “risks and threats” to Turkish national security, with Cyprus ranked higher (orange triangle) than Greece (yellow square), but neither currently assessed at the highest level of imminent threat[1].
- There is no public evidence of imminent escalation to full-scale war, but the status quo remains tense, with both sides preparing for contingencies[1][3].
- Ongoing EU and UN engagement in the Cyprus dispute acts as a moderating factor, aiming to prevent escalation[5].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The Uppsala Conflict Data Program (UCDP) will serve as the reference for conflict death tallies and classification of state-based violence, as specified in the resolution criteria.

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties in Measurement

- Intelligence-based assessments can change rapidly in response to political or military developments, introducing uncertainty to forecasts[1].
- The opaque nature of military planning and intelligence operations on both sides limits open-source forecasting accuracy.
- Third-party interventions (e.g., by NATO, the EU, or the UN) could either escalate or de-escalate a crisis, adding further unpredictability.
- The UCDP’s definitions and reporting thresholds (1,000 deaths in a one-year period from state-based violence) are clear, but rapid, large-scale escalation—though unlikely based on recent decades—remains a “tail risk.”

## Probabilistic Assessment (as of September 2023)

- **Historical precedent**: Major state-based violence between these actors (causing 1,000+ deaths in a year) is rare post-1974, with most incidents remaining below this threshold[2][5].
- **Current trend**: Ongoing tensions and intelligence warnings, but no concrete signs of imminent war[1][3].
- **Moderating factors**: International mediation, NATO membership (for Greece and Turkey), and economic interdependence lower the baseline risk.
- **Escalation risk**: While a sudden crisis (e.g., over the Aegean or Cyprus) could escalate, the prevailing pattern is crisis management and avoidance of full-scale war[3].

### Adjusted Probability Estimate

Based on available evidence, the probability that an armed conflict between Greece, Turkey, and/or Cyprus will cause 1,000 or more deaths in a one-year period before 2035 is **low to moderate**—likely in the range of 5% to 15%. The risk is not negligible due to persistent tensions and periodic crises, but recent history and ongoing international engagement argue against a high-probability forecast.
