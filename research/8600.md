### 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Semaglutide, a GLP-1 receptor agonist, is already FDA- and EMA-approved for both type 2 diabetes (oral and injectable forms) and obesity (injectable, as Wegovy)[3].
- Oral semaglutide (Rybelsus) is approved for diabetes, but not yet for obesity.
- As of May 2025, Novo Nordisk submitted an NDA for a 25 mg oral semaglutide formulation (oral Wegovy) for chronic weight management to the FDA. The FDA accepted the application, setting an action (decision) date in Q4 2025[1][4].
- Novo Nordisk indicated its intention to seek approval from both the FDA and EMA for oral semaglutide in obesity as early as 2023[2].

### 2. Recent Announcements and Policies

- The FDA’s acceptance of the NDA in May 2025 is a critical regulatory milestone, signaling that the application is complete and under review[1][4].
- The application is based on robust phase 3 trial data (OASIS 4) demonstrating efficacy for weight management in adults with obesity or overweight and comorbid conditions[1].
- Injectable semaglutide shortages have been resolved as of February 2025, indicating improved supply chain stability, which could favor regulatory confidence[5].

### 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- FDA and EMA regulatory announcements and official drug approval records[1][3][4].
- Novo Nordisk press releases and statements regarding regulatory submissions[1][2].
- Peer-reviewed clinical trial results cited in regulatory filings.

### 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- The main risk is regulatory: unforeseen safety issues or efficacy concerns could delay or prevent approval.
- Manufacturing or large-scale supply issues could also affect launch but are less likely given recent resolution of shortages[5].
- EMA approval timelines and submission status are less transparent, but concurrent or subsequent approval is typical for major therapeutics in this class.
- Policy or competitive landscape changes could shift priorities, but current trends strongly favor GLP-1 therapies for obesity.

### Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the accepted FDA filing, established efficacy in phase 3, and precedent of injectable semaglutide approvals, the probability that oral semaglutide will be approved for obesity by the FDA or EMA by 2027 is high—estimated at 85-95%.
