## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Senolytic therapies, which selectively eliminate senescent cells, have shown promise in preclinical and early clinical studies for age-related diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and osteoarthritis[1][3].
- The most studied senolytic agents in humans are dasatinib (an FDA-approved leukemia drug) and quercetin (a plant flavonoid), often used in combination (D+Q)[1][3].
- Early-phase clinical trials (Phase 1) have been conducted to assess safety, feasibility, and biomarker effects in small cohorts, such as patients with mild Alzheimer's disease[1][2]. These studies have demonstrated safety and some promising biomarker changes, but are not designed to establish efficacy for regulatory approval[1][2].
- Other senolytic candidates, such as fisetin, are also in early clinical development, but none have advanced to pivotal Phase 3 trials required for FDA approval[3].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- There are no reports of any senolytic therapy having completed Phase 3 trials or submitted a New Drug Application (NDA) to the FDA as of July 24, 2024[1][2][3].
- The only recent FDA approvals in the neurodegenerative/aging space are for non-senolytic drugs, such as lecanemab for Alzheimer's disease[2][4].
- Unity Biotechnology, a leading company in the field, has senolytic candidates in early clinical phases, but none have reached the stage of regulatory submission for approval[1].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Peer-reviewed articles and reviews on senolytic clinical trials and drug development pipelines[1][2][3][4].
- Clinical trial registries and FDA approval announcements.
- Company pipeline disclosures (e.g., Unity Biotechnology).

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- The field is rapidly evolving, but as of July 24, 2024, no senolytic therapy has completed the necessary clinical and regulatory milestones for FDA approval.
- Early-phase trials are ongoing, and while results are promising, pivotal efficacy data and regulatory submissions are still pending.
- FDA approval for first-in-class therapies typically requires robust evidence from large, well-controlled Phase 3 trials, which have not yet been reported for senolytics.

## Conclusion

Based on all available factual information as of July 24, 2024, there is no evidence that a senolytic therapy has been, or is likely to be, approved by the US FDA for commercial sale before September 30, 2024. The field remains in early clinical development, with pivotal trials and regulatory submissions still forthcoming.
