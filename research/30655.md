## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Generative AI adoption and research progress have surged since 2022, with labs like OpenAI, Google DeepMind, Anthropic, and Meta explicitly targeting AGI as a research goal[5][3].
- No major AI lab has yet made a formal, top-leadership claim of AGI as defined by the resolution criteria.
- Surveys of AI experts show wide disagreement: while a majority (76%) believe AGI is "unlikely" to result from simply scaling current methods, a substantial minority and some prominent lab leaders predict AGI could arrive as early as 2025–2028[2][4].
- Sam Altman (OpenAI CEO) publicly stated in late 2024 that AGI is now "just an engineering problem" and could be achieved in 2025, reflecting increasing confidence among some leaders[5].
- Technical progress in large language models, autonomous agents, and robotics fuels the perception of rapid approach to AGI, but as of late 2024, these systems still lack general human-level flexibility and autonomy[4].

## 2. Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Metric

- OpenAI, DeepMind, Meta, and xAI have all publicly discussed AGI timelines, with some leaders (Altman, Musk) suggesting 2025–2028 as plausible dates[2][5].
- There have been isolated claims from employees or outside commentators that AGI has been achieved, but none from qualifying lab leaders or in the requisite formal capacity as of December 2024[2].
- No significant new regulations or standards have been set requiring labs to announce AGI, but growing societal and governmental scrutiny may influence lab communication strategies.

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Leadership interviews (e.g., Altman interview, Y Combinator[5])
- Industry surveys and meta-analyses of AGI predictions[2][4]
- Public statements and official blogs from major labs (OpenAI, DeepMind, Meta)
- Media reports on AI industry milestones and claims[1][3]

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties in Measurement

- **Definition ambiguity:** AGI remains a contested and fuzzy concept; what constitutes a "claim" depends on interpretation and context[5].
- **Incentives and caution:** Labs may hesitate to make official AGI claims due to reputational, regulatory, or commercial concerns.
- **Survey uncertainty:** Expert timelines vary widely; while confidence in near-term AGI is rising, most still expect it later (post-2030)[2][4].
- **Benchmarking:** No universally accepted test for AGI exists, making claims subject to debate even if made.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

- The probability that a major AI lab will claim to have developed AGI in 2025 is **substantially higher than in previous years**, likely in the range of 10–30% given current trends and recent leadership rhetoric, but **most experts still expect formal AGI claims to occur later**, unless there is a strategic or competitive incentive for a lab to make such a declaration[2][4][5].
