## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Major AI labs (OpenAI, Google DeepMind, Anthropic, Meta, etc.) have made rapid progress in generative AI and large language models, fueling speculation about AGI timelines.
- Public adoption of AI tools has surged, with widespread use in writing, decision-making, and business applications[5].
- Several lab leaders have made optimistic public predictions: OpenAI’s Sam Altman and DeepMind’s Demis Hassabis have each suggested AGI could arrive as soon as 2025–2030, with Anthropic’s Dario Amodei predicting “singularity” by 2026[2][4][3]. 
- However, despite these forecasts, no lab has made an official, unambiguous claim that they have achieved AGI as of May 2025.
- Expert surveys continue to show a wide range of predictions, with medians often in the 2030–2040 range, and ongoing debate about what constitutes AGI[2][4].

## 2. Recent Announcements and Policies

- In April 2025, DeepMind’s CEO reiterated a 5–10 year AGI timeline, not an immediate claim[2].
- A December 2024 OpenAI employee made a personal claim that AGI had arrived, but this did not meet the official or leadership criteria required for this forecast[2].
- Growth in AGI-focused companies, investment, and research has accelerated, but technical bottlenecks—such as context understanding, common sense, and generalization—remain unsolved[3][5].
- No major lab CEO or equivalent has publicly stated on behalf of their organization that they have developed AGI as of this date.

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Official press releases, blog posts, or statements from the listed labs and their CEOs
- Industry news outlets (e.g., The Verge, CBS News) reporting on AI leadership interviews[2][3][4]
- AI market and research reports tracking company focus and milestones[5]

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- The definition of AGI is highly contested, and public claims could be ambiguous or subject to interpretation.
- Labs may be cautious in making such claims due to reputational, regulatory, or ethical considerations[3][4].
- Rapid progress could change the landscape quickly, and insider knowledge of breakthroughs is not always immediately public.
- Claims made in informal contexts (e.g., podcasts, social media) could test the resolution criteria’s boundaries.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given:
- No qualifying claims have been made as of May 2025.
- Optimistic public forecasts from some top leaders, but general expert consensus places true AGI a few years away.
- Technical and reputational barriers to making an official claim.
- Increased probability compared to previous years due to accelerated investment and declared intent by labs.

**Adjusted probability that a major AI lab will claim in 2025 that they have developed AGI: approximately 20–35%.**

The probability is notably higher than in previous years, reflecting both increased ambition and progress, but still below even odds due to the absence of qualifying claims and remaining technical/policy hurdles.
