## US Crude Oil Production Forecast for Q2 2026

**1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status**

- US crude oil production has steadily increased since 2022, led by the Permian Basin. As of early 2025, the EIA projects US crude oil production to average 13.59 million bpd in 2025 and 13.73 million bpd in 2026, with growth slowing due to low prices and industry capital discipline[3][5].
- The Permian Basin is the main driver, expected to add about 300,000 bpd in 2026, while other Lower 48 onshore production is forecast to decline. Gulf of Mexico output is steady at ~1.8 million bpd[5].

**2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric**

- President Trump’s January 2025 national energy emergency declaration orders agencies to maximize domestic energy production, including rapid leasing and permitting on federal lands.
- This policy shift could accelerate production, but the EIA’s May 2025 forecast already incorporates known developments as of its release[1][3].
- Market forces—especially the EIA’s projected Brent crude price of $59/bbl in 2026—may temper production growth even in a permissive policy environment[2][5].

**3. Authoritative Sources for Verification**

- The US Energy Information Administration (EIA) is the definitive source for monthly crude oil production statistics, published in “thousand barrels”[1][3].
- The EIA’s Short-Term Energy Outlook and historical monthly production data provide baseline and actual figures.

**4. Limitations and Uncertainties**

- There is typically a lag of several months to years between policy changes (permitting, leasing) and measurable production increases, especially on federal lands and offshore[5].
- Actual monthly production can fluctuate due to operational, weather, or market-driven factors.
- EIA production data are occasionally revised, but such revisions are minor and immaterial for the initial resolution.

### **Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment**

- The EIA’s May 2025 projection for Q2 2026 is 13.82 million bpd[3].
- Monthly production (in thousand barrels): \(13.82 \text{ million bpd} \times 30.44 \text{ days/month} = 420,534 \text{ thousand barrels/month}\)
- The national energy emergency could accelerate production marginally, but given industry constraints and market prices, a substantial increase over the EIA reference case is unlikely by Q2 2026.

**Best Estimate:**  
The US will produce, on average, **approximately 420,000–425,000 thousand barrels of crude oil per month** in April, May, and June 2026.

- Central value (EIA reference): 420,534 thousand barrels/month
- 80% credible range: 415,000–430,000 thousand barrels/month
