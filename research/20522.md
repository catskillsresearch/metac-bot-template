## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- In October 2023, President Biden issued Executive Order 14110, mandating that companies developing or training large dual-use AI models report development activities, security protections, ownership of model weights, and results of red-teaming to the federal government.
- These requirements were specifically aimed at mitigating risks from highly capable AI systems and ensuring federal oversight of their development and deployment.
- During the 2024 campaign, Donald Trump pledged to revoke this executive order if elected.

## 2. Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Metric

- On January 23, 2025, President Trump signed Executive Order 14179, “Removing Barriers to American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence,” which **explicitly revoked** Executive Order 14110 and directed an immediate review and potential suspension, revision, or rescission of all policies, directives, regulations, and actions derived from EO 14110 if they conflicted with the new administration’s pro-innovation policy[1][4][5].
- The Trump administration’s new AI policy emphasizes U.S. technological leadership, economic competitiveness, and reducing regulatory obstacles, rather than mandating extensive reporting from AI developers.
- In April 2025, the White House Office of Management & Budget issued new memoranda (M-25-21 and M-25-22) setting minimum risk management practices for federal agencies’ use of AI and revising procurement requirements, but these replaced and did not reintroduce the comprehensive private-sector reporting regime of EO 14110[2]. The focus is now on government use and procurement rather than broad private-sector regulation.

## 3. Authoritative Sources

- Executive Order 14179 (January 2025): Revokes EO 14110 and directs review and rescission of related federal policies if inconsistent with the new order’s objectives[1][4][5].
- OMB AI Use and Procurement Memos (April 2025): Replace Biden-era guidance, shift federal policy away from blanket reporting requirements, and focus on agency governance and procurement[2].
- No evidence is available to indicate any new regulation or executive action has reimposed requirements matching the resolution criteria as of May 2025.

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- The Trump administration’s AI policy is still under development, with an AI Action Plan due by July 2025 and public consultation ongoing[4][5]. New regulations are possible but, given the administration’s explicit focus on deregulation and revocation of EO 14110, this appears unlikely.
- Congress could, in principle, pass legislation imposing such reporting requirements, but no such legislative activity is reported as of May 2025.

## Probabilistic Assessment

Given the explicit revocation of EO 14110, the stated policy direction to remove regulatory barriers, and the lack of any replacement regulation meeting the resolution criteria:

> The probability that, if Trump is president, AI foundation model reporting requirements as defined in the question will remain in effect in the US at the end of 2025 is **very low** (estimated <10%).
