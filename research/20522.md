Based on the current situation as of May 12, 2025, I can provide an analysis of whether AI foundation model reporting requirements remain in place under the Trump administration.

## Current Status of AI Regulation

Following his election victory in 2024, President Donald Trump has taken decisive action regarding AI regulation in the United States. On January 23, 2025, the Trump administration officially rescinded President Biden's Executive Order 14110 ("Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence") that had established the foundation model reporting requirements in question[5]. This action was part of President Trump's first week in office during his second term.

In place of the rescinded order, President Trump signed Executive Order 14179, titled "Removing Barriers to American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence"[5]. The new executive order explicitly states: "It is the policy of the United States to sustain and enhance America's global AI dominance in order to promote human flourishing, economic competitiveness, and national security"[5].

## Policy Direction Under Trump Administration

The current administration has demonstrated a clear shift away from the regulatory approach of the previous administration toward AI development:

1. **Emphasis on Innovation Over Regulation**: The Trump administration has moved away from Biden-era guidance on AI, emphasizing minimal barriers to foster innovation and U.S. leadership in artificial intelligence[5].

2. **Focus on National Security and Economic Competition**: Rather than focusing on preventing discrimination, bias, and climate change as the previous administration did, the Trump administration is prioritizing national security and economic competition aspects of AI[3].

3. **Collaboration with Tech Leaders**: The administration is working closely with tech industry leaders and has appointed a tech investor and former executive as the newly created White House AI & Crypto Czar to guide policy development in the AI sector[5].

4. **Educational Initiatives**: On April 23, 2025, President Trump signed another executive order focused on advancing AI education for American youth, further indicating the administration's priority on developing AI capabilities rather than restricting them[4].

## Status of Foundation Model Reporting Requirements

The specific reporting requirements for dual-use foundation models that were established in Biden's Executive Order 14110 have been effectively eliminated with the rescission of that order in January 2025[5]. The new Trump administration policy does not maintain the requirement for companies developing models with more than 10^26 operations to report:
- Activities and plans related to dual-use foundation models
- Information on model weights ownership and security protections
- Results of red-teaming activities

Instead, the administration has adopted an approach that removes what it considers barriers to AI development and innovation[5]. This aligns with campaign promises made by Trump in December 2023 when he stated he would "cancel Biden's artificial intelligence executive order" upon taking office.

## Potential Regulatory Gap

With the federal government taking a less regulatory approach to AI, there is some indication that state legislators may step in to fill perceived regulatory gaps[5]. However, as of May 2025, no state-level regulations have been implemented that would reinstate the specific foundation model reporting requirements at the national level.

Based on these facts, the AI foundation model reporting requirements established in Biden's Executive Order 14110 are no longer in place in the United States as of May 12, 2025.
