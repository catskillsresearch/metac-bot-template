### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- For March 2025, the inventories/sales ratio for US beer, wine, and distilled alcoholic beverage merchant wholesalers (NAICS 4248) was 1.66, down from 1.68 in February 2025, and up from 1.57 the previous year[1][4].
- The ratio has exhibited a mild upward trend since 2024 but has shown signs of stabilization in early 2025, suggesting that wholesalers are gradually balancing inventories with sales[1].

### Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Metric

- Industry analysts report that the sector has been managing an inventory “reset” throughout early 2025, primarily in response to pandemic-era oversupply—especially for mid- to lower-priced wines[5].
- Wholesalers are exercising tighter purchasing practices and focusing on clearing existing inventory, which has led to strategic discounting and slower new order placements[5].
- This process is anticipated to conclude by mid-2025, likely leading to a more balanced inventory position and reducing upward pressure on the inventories/sales ratio[5].
- There are no indications of major regulatory changes or shocks affecting the alcohol wholesale trade as of late May 2025.

### Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the above context:

- The inventories/sales ratio is likely to show a modest decline or further stabilization in April 2025, as the inventory reset phase is reaching completion and sales remain steady but not surging.
- A reasonable probabilistic estimate for the April 2025 ratio is in the range of 1.62 to 1.66, with the most likely value near 1.65, reflecting modest downward movement from March but remaining historically elevated versus pre-pandemic lows.
- This assessment accounts for both the recent slight downward movement and the anticipated inventory normalization process.

### Sources for Verification

- Data should be verified using the US Census Bureau’s Monthly Wholesale Trade Report for April 2025, specifically the table for NAICS 4248, which will provide the official inventories and sales figures[3][4].
- The FRED and YCharts economic databases provide timely updates and historical charts for this ratio[1][4].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- The official inventory/sales ratio may be adjusted retrospectively as the Census Bureau revises data.
- Short-term fluctuations in consumer demand, supply chain disruptions, or unforeseen economic events could affect the ratio but have not been reported as of late May 2025.
- The exact ratio will depend on both numerator (inventories) and denominator (sales), each subject to seasonal and sector-specific dynamics.
