# Will the PRC control at least half of Taiwan before 2050?

As of October 9, 2020, multiple factors indicate a significant but not overwhelming probability that the People's Republic of China (PRC) will control at least half of Taiwan before 2050. Below is an analysis of the current situation, key differences from historical cases, and a probabilistic assessment.

## Current Situation and Historical Context

The cross-strait relationship between the PRC and Taiwan remains tense, with Beijing consistently asserting its claim over Taiwan as part of its "One China" policy. Several military and intelligence experts have provided timelines for potential Chinese action:

- Retired Japan Air Force Commander General Orita Kunio projects China will attempt to annex Taiwan by 2025, followed by a consolidation period from 2025-2040 to control shipping lanes throughout East Asia[1].
- Researcher Deng Yuwen at China's Charhar Institute has identified 2050 as the final deadline for China to take Taiwan, aligning with Xi Jinping's goal of achieving the "great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation" by mid-century[1].
- Xi Jinping's report at the 19th Party Congress in 2017 specifically listed "reunification" as one of 14 key components of China's new era leading to 2050[1].

## Key Differences Affecting the Forecast

Several factors distinguish the Taiwan situation from other historical cases of territorial annexation:

1. **Taiwan's Economic Integration with China**: Despite political tensions, Taiwan's economy remains deeply intertwined with mainland China, creating leverage for Beijing.

2. **US Strategic Ambiguity**: The United States maintains a policy of strategic ambiguity regarding Taiwan's defense, creating uncertainty about international response to Chinese aggression[1].

3. **Taiwan's Public Opinion**: Current polling shows approximately 70% of Taiwanese consider themselves an independent country, with only 6.7% favoring immediate unification with China.

4. **PRC Military Development**: China continues to modernize its military capabilities, particularly focusing on capabilities that would be necessary for an amphibious invasion.

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on available information as of October 2020, I assess the probability of PRC controlling at least half of Taiwan before 2050 as follows:

- **30-40% probability of military conquest**: China appears to be developing capabilities for a Taiwan invasion, with multiple experts suggesting timelines between 2025-2035. However, significant obstacles remain, including potential US intervention and the inherent difficulties of amphibious operations.

- **20-25% probability of political integration**: As China's economic and political influence grows, Taiwan could potentially be gradually integrated into a Chinese sphere of influence without direct military action.

- **35-50% probability of status quo maintenance**: Taiwan's democratic institutions, international support, and strong national identity create significant resistance to PRC control.

Overall probability assessment: **50-65% likelihood** that the PRC will control at least half of Taiwan before 2050.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

This forecast faces several key uncertainties:

1. Future US policy toward Taiwan and the broader Indo-Pacific region
2. Internal political developments in both Taiwan and mainland China
3. Technological developments affecting military capabilities
4. Potential "black swan" events like major economic crises or conflicts elsewhere
