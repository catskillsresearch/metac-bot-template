## Forecast: Margin of Victory in the 2025 South Korean Presidential Election

**Key Historical Trends and Current Status**

- The 2025 South Korean presidential election, scheduled for June 3, is atypical due to the impeachment and removal of President Yoon Suk Yeol, resulting in a snap election[3].
- Lee Jae-myung (Democratic Party) is the clear front-runner in most polls, leading Kim Moon-soo (People Power Party) by double digits. As of May 23, Gallup polling reports Lee at 46% and Kim at 32%, with Lee Jun-seok (Reform Party) at 10-11%[4][5].
- Earlier in May, Lee's lead was as high as 22 percentage points, but this has narrowed to around 12 points in the latest surveys[4][5].
- South Korea uses a single-round, first-past-the-post system, so the winner is determined by simple plurality[3].

**Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric**

- The impeachment and early removal of the incumbent president have increased political volatility and may influence voter turnout and late decision-making[3].
- Lee Jun-seok's surge to double-digit support as a third-party candidate is notable, as it may siphon votes from both major party candidates and affect the margin[4].

**Authoritative Sources for Verification**

- Gallup Korea and National Barometer Survey (as reported by major news outlets and cited in opinion polling summaries)[2][4][5].
- Official election results will be confirmed by the National Election Commission of Korea[2][3].

**Limitations and Uncertainties**

- Polling error, late shifts in voter sentiment, and turnout variability—especially in a politically charged environment—could cause deviations from current projections.
- The presence of a strong third-party candidate (Lee Jun-seok) and the unique context of an impeachment election add additional uncertainty to the forecast[4][3].

**Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment**

- Based on the most recent and reliable polling, the forecasted margin of victory (difference in vote share between the first and second place finishers) is most likely to fall in the **10–14 percentage point range**.
- There is a moderate chance the margin could narrow to **7–10 points** if late shifts or turnout changes occur.
- The probability of a margin below 7 points or above 15 points is low given current trends and historical precedent.
