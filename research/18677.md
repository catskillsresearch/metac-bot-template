# Will any member country leave BRICS before 2035?

As of September 7, 2023, BRICS is at a critical juncture with planned expansion that could significantly alter its internal dynamics and cohesion. This analysis examines the likelihood of any current or future member leaving the bloc before 2035.

## Current Situation and Historical Context

BRICS was originally formed as "BRIC" in 2009 by Brazil, Russia, India, and China, with South Africa joining in 2010 to create "BRICS." For over a decade, the group has maintained stable membership with these five countries, demonstrating remarkable cohesion despite significant geopolitical shifts and occasional tensions between members[1].

As of August 2023, BRICS has invited six new countries to join: Argentina, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, with membership scheduled to take effect on January 1, 2024[1]. This represents the first major expansion in the group's history since South Africa's addition.

## Key Factors Affecting Member Retention

### 1. Divergent Economic and Political Interests

The expansion introduces greater heterogeneity into BRICS, potentially creating fault lines:

- **Economic asymmetry**: China's economy dwarfs those of other members, creating power imbalances that could lead to tension, particularly with India and Brazil who may feel their influence diluted[1].
- **Political alignment**: Several members maintain strong ties with Western nations while others (like Russia and Iran) have adversarial relationships with the West, creating potential for conflicting priorities.

### 2. Domestic Political Changes

Over a 12-year timeframe (until 2035), multiple election cycles will occur in democratic BRICS members:

- Brazil and India have experienced shifts between political parties with different foreign policy orientations.
- Argentina specifically (one of the invited members) has shown significant foreign policy volatility between administrations.

### 3. Competing Multilateral Commitments

Several BRICS members participate in other regional or international organizations that may occasionally have competing interests:

- India's participation in the Quad (with the US, Japan, and Australia)
- Brazil's Mercosur membership
- South Africa's role in the African Union

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on available information as of September 7, 2023, I estimate the following probabilities:

**55-65% probability that at least one country will leave BRICS before 2035**

This assessment is based on several considerations:

1. The unprecedented expansion from 5 to 11 members introduces significant new dynamics and potential for internal conflict.

2. The 12-year timeframe until 2035 is substantial, covering multiple election cycles in democratic member states, increasing the chance of policy shifts.

3. Historical precedent from other international organizations shows that exits do occur:
   - The UK left the European Union
   - Several countries have withdrawn from international treaties and organizations like the ICC

4. The inclusion of countries with dramatically different political systems, economic models, and geopolitical alignments increases the likelihood of irreconcilable differences emerging.

5. The invited member Argentina has a history of policy volatility between administrations, making it a particularly likely candidate for withdrawal if a more Western-aligned government takes power.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors limit the precision of this forecast:

1. Limited historical precedent - BRICS has never experienced a member departure, making it difficult to establish baseline probabilities.

2. Evolving mission - The core purpose of BRICS continues to evolve, which could either strengthen cohesion or create new tensions.

3. Uncertain global context - Major geopolitical shifts between now and 2035 could dramatically alter the value proposition of BRICS membership.

4. Lack of formal withdrawal mechanisms - Unlike some treaties or organizations, BRICS has less formal institutional structure, making both the process and definition of "leaving" somewhat ambiguous.

This forecast should be updated as the planned expansion takes effect and the internal dynamics of the expanded group become clearer.
