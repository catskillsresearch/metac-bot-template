# Will 2025 be the warmest year on record globally?

Based on the latest climate data and forecasts available as of May 24, 2025, here's an analysis of whether 2025 is likely to become the warmest year on record according to ECMWF measurements.

## Current Temperature Status

The global temperature trend continues to show significant warming in 2025. April 2025 was recorded as the second-hottest April on record globally, with temperatures remaining more than 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels[2]. This continues a concerning pattern of exceptionally warm months that has characterized recent years.

The persistence of temperatures above the 1.5°C threshold is particularly notable, as this was the aspirational limit set by the Paris Climate Agreement. The data from Copernicus Climate Change Service (operated by ECMWF) indicates that we are experiencing a "long sequence of months over 1.5ºC above pre-industrial" temperatures[2].

## Summer 2025 Forecast Analysis

ECMWF's seasonal forecasts for Summer 2025 indicate continued warming trends:

- The summer pressure forecast shows a low-pressure area over far northern Europe with a high-pressure system extending across the UK, Ireland, and reaching toward central Europe[4]
- Temperature forecasts predict above-normal temperatures over a large part of the European continent, with the warmest anomalies forecast over central Europe[4]
- The forecasting models indicate "a higher potential for heatwaves than normal" and suggest "a very likely dominance of high-pressure systems"[4]
- Earlier forecasts from March 2025 for the June-July-August period already predicted "warmer-than-normal weather over a large part of the continent"[5]

## Probabilistic Assessment

While the ECMWF provides long-range forecasts up to seven months into the future[1], the available data doesn't allow for a definitive conclusion about whether 2025 will surpass previous annual temperature records. However, several factors are relevant to this assessment:

1. **Current trajectory**: With April 2025 being the second-hottest April on record (not the hottest), 2025 is tracking extremely warm but not necessarily record-breaking in every month.

2. **Summer outlook**: The forecast for above-normal temperatures and increased heatwave potential during summer months could significantly contribute to annual averages.

3. **Limitations**: As noted in the forecasts themselves, while "the ECMWF model is at the top as far as 'reliability' goes... no long-range/seasonal forecasting system can be called 'reliable'"[4][5]. These models examine trends and weather pattern evolution on large scales over longer periods.

## Conclusion

Based on currently available data, 2025 is continuing the trend of exceptional warmth seen in recent years. While temperatures remain significantly elevated above pre-industrial levels, and summer forecasts predict above-normal temperatures across Europe, it's not yet possible to definitively determine if 2025 will exceed the previous annual temperature record.

The resolution of this question will ultimately depend on temperature developments through the remainder of 2025, particularly during the northern hemisphere winter months (which will occur after the current forecast window). The official determination will come from the Copernicus Climate Change Service/ECMWF report expected in early 2026.
