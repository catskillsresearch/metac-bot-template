# Analysis of 2025 Global Temperature Trends

As of May 12, 2025, several key indicators provide insights into whether 2025 will become the warmest year on record globally according to ECMWF data.

## Current Temperature Status

The most recent data shows that April 2025 was the second-hottest April on record globally[3]. This continues a concerning pattern where global temperatures have consistently remained more than 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels[3]. The persistence of these elevated temperatures is notable, as Copernicus Climate Change Service has reported a "long sequence of months over 1.5ºC above pre-industrial" levels[3].

This positioning as the second-warmest April (rather than the warmest) might suggest that 2025 could potentially fall slightly behind the record warmth of the previous year. However, we are only four months into the year, and seasonal variations will play a significant role in determining the final annual average.

## Forecast Trends

The ECMWF forecasting system provides valuable insights into the expected temperature patterns for the coming months:

- Summer 2025 (June-July-August) predictions for Europe show a warmer-than-normal weather pattern over a large part of the continent[5]
- The warmest anomalies are forecast over east-central, southeastern, and northern Europe[5]
- A high-pressure ridge is expected to expand from southern/southeastern Europe towards the north[5]

These forecasts suggest continued above-normal temperatures across significant portions of Europe during the summer months. While these predictions focus on Europe rather than global averages, they align with the ongoing warming trend.

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on the available data as of May 12, 2025, the likelihood of 2025 becoming the warmest year on record remains significant but not certain. Several factors influence this assessment:

1. **Current trajectory**: With April 2025 being the second-warmest April on record, 2025 is already demonstrating extremely high temperatures, though potentially tracking slightly behind the previous record year.

2. **Persistent warming**: The consistent pattern of months exceeding 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels indicates strong underlying warming forces at work.

3. **Summer forecast**: Predictions for Summer 2025 in Europe show continued above-normal temperatures, which could contribute to elevating the annual average.

4. **Remaining uncertainty**: With over seven months left in the year, significant variability could still occur. Weather patterns during the second half of 2025 will be crucial in determining the final outcome.

The ECMWF's extended-range and seasonal forecasting capabilities provide outlooks up to 46 days ahead and up to seven months respectively, offering valuable tools for monitoring this situation as the year progresses[1][4].

Given the current data, 2025 appears likely to be among the warmest years on record globally, with a substantial but not certain possibility of becoming the warmest year. The resolution of this question will depend on temperature patterns through the remainder of 2025, particularly during the Northern Hemisphere summer and fall seasons.
