## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- On election night 2020, Donald Trump repeatedly used the words "win," "won," and "winner" in his public remarks, including saying "won" 15 times, as documented in transcripts and video records[2].
- In the days following the 2020 election, Trump continued to assert that he had won, often using these terms in speeches and public statements[2][5].
- Throughout his political career, Trump has frequently used assertive language about winning, both in victory and in contesting results, as part of his broader communication strategy[2].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- In 2024 campaign events, Trump has continued to use the language of winning. For example, after the 2024 Super Tuesday primaries, he told supporters, "we’re going to win this election because we have no choice"[1].
- Trump’s campaign messaging remains focused on themes of victory and reclaiming the country, with no indication of a shift away from this rhetoric[1][3].
- There is no public evidence as of October 30, 2024, that Trump or his campaign have adopted a policy to avoid using the words "win," "won," or "winner" on election night.

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Official transcripts of Trump’s speeches and public remarks, such as those provided by Rev.com and the White House archives, are reliable sources for verifying his use of specific words on election night[1][2][5].
- Major news outlets and live coverage of election night events will also document and transcribe Trump’s statements in real time.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- The determination of whether Trump utters the specified words depends on his public appearances and the content of his remarks during the defined window (8:00 PM to 5:00 AM Eastern Time).
- If Trump does not make a public statement or if his remarks are not broadcast or transcribed, verification may be challenging.
- The final resolution is subject to the discretion of Metaculus Admins, who will interpret the evidence according to the question’s criteria.

## Summary

Based on Trump’s consistent historical use of "win," "won," and "winner" in election contexts, and his continued emphasis on victory in 2024 campaign messaging, it is highly likely—though not certain—that he will use at least one of these words on election night 2024 if he makes a public statement during the specified timeframe[1][2][5].
