## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Since the first use of nuclear weapons in 1945, the number of nuclear-armed states has increased slowly, with only nine countries—United States, Russia, United Kingdom, France, China, India, Pakistan, Israel, and North Korea—currently possessing nuclear weapons[1][3][4].
- The last confirmed new entrant was North Korea in 2006[4].
- Several former nuclear-armed states (e.g., Belarus, Kazakhstan, Ukraine, South Africa) relinquished their arsenals or programs, largely due to international diplomatic efforts and security guarantees[4].
- The international nonproliferation regime, anchored by the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), has been effective in limiting the spread of nuclear weapons[1][3].

## 2. Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting Proliferation

- As of March 2023, there were no credible reports of new states developing and testing nuclear weapons.
- Ongoing concerns persist about Iran's nuclear program, but there is no verified evidence of a successful nuclear weapons test or arsenal as of this date.
- Notable in recent years (2023–2024) is increased geopolitical instability and a decline in transparency, particularly following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which has heightened nuclear rhetoric and led to greater debate about nuclear sharing but not confirmed new nuclear states[2].
- There have been claims about Russian nuclear weapons potentially being stationed in Belarus; however, Belarus is not recognized as an independent nuclear-armed state and there is no conclusive evidence of direct control, nor has Belarus conducted a nuclear test[2].

## 3. Authoritative Sources and Verification

- The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO), and major intelligence agencies (e.g., CIA, MI6) remain primary sources for verification.
- The International Monitoring System (IMS) of the CTBT provides global detection capability for any nuclear tests.

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- While international monitoring is robust, the possibility of a clandestine program advancing undetected—especially if a state conducts a small or low-yield test—cannot be entirely excluded.
- Political developments, such as a major regional war or collapse of the nonproliferation regime, could rapidly alter the risk landscape.
- The technical and economic barriers to nuclear breakout remain high for most potential candidates.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given:
- The slow historical pace of new nuclear entrants.
- Robust international monitoring and diplomatic pressure.
- Lack of credible evidence as of 2023-03-20 of any new state nearing nuclear test capability.

The likelihood of a new nuclear-armed state emerging before 2030 is possible but remains unlikely. A reasonable probabilistic estimate would be in the 10–20% range, assuming no fundamental shifts in the global security environment or collapse of current nonproliferation norms.
