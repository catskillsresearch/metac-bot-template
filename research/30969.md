# Forecasting the Legality of Polymarket or Manifold for Real-Money Betting in the US in 2025

As of January 10, 2025, the regulatory landscape for prediction markets in the United States remains in flux, with important developments that could influence the legality of platforms like Polymarket and Manifold for real-money betting in the coming year.

## Current Status and Historical Context

The legal status of prediction markets in the US has been characterized by significant regulatory challenges and evolving jurisprudence. Currently, prediction market winnings are taxable and treated as ordinary income for tax purposes, similar to traditional gambling winnings[1]. However, the operational legality of these platforms remains contested.

A pivotal development occurred in September 2024 when the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ruled in favor of Kalshi, a CFTC-regulated prediction market, allowing it to offer Congressional Control Contracts[1]. While the CFTC initially secured an emergency stay, the D.C. Circuit subsequently denied this motion in October 2024, enabling Kalshi to offer contracts before the 2024 US elections[1]. This judicial precedent represents a potential pathway for other prediction markets seeking legal operation.

Notably, Kalshi expanded its offerings to include sports contracts in January 2025, indicating some regulatory flexibility at the federal level[1]. However, this expansion has not eliminated state-level resistance.

## Regulatory Challenges and State Opposition

Despite federal-level developments, significant opposition persists at the state level:

- At least six states—Illinois, Maryland, Montana, Nevada, New Jersey, and Ohio—have issued cease and desist letters directing prediction markets to stop offering their services[2]
- State regulators argue that prediction market activities resemble unauthorized sports wagering[5]
- Operators like Kalshi maintain that their operations are legally sound under federal oversight by the CFTC, asserting their business model is founded on peer-to-peer swaps rather than traditional sports betting[5]

## Factors Supporting Potential Legalization in 2025

Several factors suggest increased possibility for legalization of real-money prediction markets in 2025:

1. **Precedent-Setting Legal Victories**: Kalshi's court victory against the CFTC established a significant legal precedent that could benefit other prediction market platforms[1]

2. **Regulatory Dialogue**: CFTC Acting Chairman Caroline D. Pham has expressed interest in moving toward resolution, stating: "The CFTC must take a forward-looking approach to shifts in market structure to ensure our markets remain vibrant and resilient while protecting all participants"[1]

3. **Planned Roundtable Discussions**: The CFTC is planning prediction markets roundtable discussions that could establish "clear rules of the road and safeguards"[1]

## Factors Against Legalization in 2025

Counterbalancing factors suggest continued challenges:

1. **State-Level Resistance**: The aggressive cease-and-desist actions by multiple states indicate strong resistance that could delay or prevent legalization[2]

2. **Unresolved Federal Litigation**: The case between KalshEx and CFTC remains unresolved as of early 2025, with the court expressing concerns about both arguments while appearing skeptical of the CFTC's broad interpretation of its regulatory authority[1]

3. **Regulatory Classification Dispute**: Fundamental disagreement persists about whether prediction markets constitute gambling (state purview) or regulated commodity trading (federal purview)[5]

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on the available information as of January 10, 2025, I estimate the following probabilities:

- **35-45% probability** that real-money betting on either Polymarket or Manifold will become legal in at least one US state in 2025

This assessment reflects:
- The positive precedent set by Kalshi's legal victories
- The CFTC's apparent openness to dialogue and potential regulatory accommodation
- The significant counterbalance of state-level opposition
- The requirement for a specific change in law or policy (not just risk acceptance by the platforms)

The most likely pathway would be through:
1. A favorable court ruling extending Kalshi's precedent to other platforms
2. A CFTC no-action letter specifically addressing Polymarket or Manifold
3. Individual state legislation carving out exceptions for prediction markets

The probability remains moderate rather than high due to the continued state-level resistance and the need for specific policy changes rather than just regulatory tolerance.
