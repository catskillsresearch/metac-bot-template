## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- **Prediction markets in the US have been subject to tight federal and state regulation, primarily under the CFTC.** Only a few platforms, such as Kalshi, have been approved to operate real-money markets, and even these approvals are narrow and frequently challenged in court[1][3].
- **Polymarket was fined by the CFTC in 2022 and does not currently offer real-money betting to US customers.** Manifold operates with play money and does not allow real-money betting[1].
- **Recent years have seen increased interest in prediction markets, but also heightened scrutiny and enforcement actions at both the state and federal level.** Multiple states, including Illinois, Maryland, Montana, Nevada, New Jersey, and Ohio, have issued cease-and-desist orders to prediction market operators[2][5].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- **Kalshi has won some legal victories, including a preliminary injunction in New Jersey, allowing it to continue operating certain contracts while litigation is ongoing.** However, these wins are platform- and contract-specific and do not represent a broad legal change for the industry[3].
- **The CFTC has signaled openness to revisiting prediction market regulation, planning roundtables and public input, but has not issued new rules or no-action letters that would legalize broader real-money prediction markets as of May 2025[1].**
- **State-level regulators remain skeptical, and enforcement actions continue.** Arizona and North Carolina are actively monitoring the space, and other states maintain or expand their regulatory actions[2][5].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- **Federal court filings and rulings** (e.g., Kalshi’s ongoing litigation with the CFTC and state regulators)[1][3].
- **Official CFTC statements and roundtable announcements**[1].
- **State regulatory actions and public records** (e.g., cease-and-desist letters, statements from state gaming boards)[2][5].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- **The legal landscape is fluid, with ongoing litigation and potential for rapid change if a key court decision, CFTC rule, or legislative act occurs.**
- **Any resolution for Polymarket or Manifold would require a clear, public change in law or policy, such as a new CFTC no-action letter, a successful court challenge, or new state/federal legislation.**
- **Recent legal victories for Kalshi do not automatically apply to other platforms or market types.**

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the above, the probability that Polymarket or Manifold will be able to legally offer real-money betting in the United States in 2025 remains **low (estimated <10%)**. The regulatory environment is evolving, but as of January–May 2025, there is no clear sign of imminent policy change that would allow these platforms to operate legally under the criteria specified in the question[1][2][3][5].
