## Key Factual Information as of July 26, 2024

**1. Historical Trends and Current Status**
- Traditionally, the Commission on Presidential Debates organizes three general election debates. In 2024, Trump and Biden agreed to bypass the commission, scheduling two debates: June 27 (CNN) and September 10 (ABC News)[1][3][4].
- The first debate occurred on June 27, 2024, between Trump and Biden, who was the Democratic nominee at that time[2][3].
- The second debate was scheduled for September 10, 2024, but its status is now uncertain due to Biden's withdrawal from the race[1].

**2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric**
- On July 21, 2024, Biden announced he would no longer seek reelection, creating uncertainty about the Democratic nominee for the September 10 debate[1].
- Trump has publicly stated he would prefer to debate the new Democratic nominee on Fox News rather than ABC, casting further doubt on the scheduled debate[1].
- As of July 26, 2024, no formal, live debate between Trump and the new Democratic nominee has been confirmed or scheduled before October 1, 2024[1].

**3. Authoritative Sources for Verification**
- Major news outlets (Time, NBC, CBS, ABC) confirm the June 27 debate occurred and the September 10 debate was scheduled, but now faces uncertainty due to Biden's withdrawal[1][2][3][4].

**4. Limitations and Uncertainties**
- The Democratic nominee for the September 10 debate is not yet confirmed as of July 26, 2024.
- The debate's occurrence, format, and network are all in flux due to Biden's exit and Trump's stated preferences.
- No additional debates are scheduled before October 1, 2024, and the only completed debate involved Biden as the nominee.

## Conclusion

As of July 26, 2024, only one formal, live debate between Donald Trump and the Democratic nominee (Biden at the time) has taken place. The second debate, originally scheduled for September 10, is in doubt due to Biden's withdrawal and Trump's demands regarding the network and opponent. There is no confirmation of a second debate with the new Democratic nominee before October 1, 2024. Therefore, the available factual information supports the forecast that Trump will debate the Democratic nominee less than twice before October 1, 2024.
