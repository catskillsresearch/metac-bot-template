## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of May 20, 2025, Texas has reported 722 confirmed measles cases since the outbreak began in late January[4].
- The weekly rate of new cases has slowed considerably: only 4 new cases were reported between May 16 and May 20, and just 9 new cases were added in the week prior to April 22, marking the lowest weekly increase since February[3][4].
- The outbreak has been concentrated in West Texas, with Gaines County accounting for over half of all cases. The majority of cases are linked to 10 major outbreaks[2][3].
- The outbreak has resulted in 64 hospitalizations and two deaths among unvaccinated school-aged children[2][3].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- Texas health authorities have implemented public education campaigns, expanded testing, and established vaccination clinics, spending at least $4.5 million on the response[3].
- The Texas Department of State Health Services continues to recommend MMR vaccination, especially for unvaccinated individuals[2][3].
- There are no recent announcements of major policy changes or new outbreaks that would suggest a reversal of the current decelerating trend.

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) provides official measles case counts and outbreak updates[4].
- National data and context are available from the CDC and recent media reports[1][2][3].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- Case counts may be affected by reporting delays, underdiagnosis, or changes in surveillance intensity.
- The possibility of new clusters, especially in under-vaccinated communities, could alter the trajectory.
- The current deceleration could continue, but measles is highly contagious and unpredictable events (e.g., a superspreader event) could cause a spike.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the current trajectory—722 cases as of May 20, a slowing weekly increase, and no evidence of a resurgence—it is reasonable to forecast that the number of measles cases reported by Texas on July 1, 2025, will fall near the lower end of the open bounds.

- **Point estimate:** 735 cases (assuming an average of 1–2 new cases per week over the next six weeks)
- **80% confidence interval:** 725–760 cases (allowing for some uncertainty and potential small clusters)
- **Probability of exceeding 800 cases by July 1:** Less than 10%, unless a new outbreak emerges
