# Will NOAA's Climate.gov Still Be Online on April 1, 2025?

Based on the available information as of March 7, 2025, here's an analysis to help forecast whether NOAA's Climate.gov will remain online on April 1, 2025.

## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

As of early March 2025, Climate.gov appears to be operational and actively publishing content. Evidence of this includes:

- Climate.gov published a U.S. temperature outlook map for March 2025 on March 3, 2025, showing predicted temperature patterns across the country[2].
- The website was confirmed to be "UP and reachable" as of February 26, 2025, according to the Is It Down Right Now? service mentioned in the fine print.
- Climate.gov is listed as a partnership on NOAA's Climate Prediction Center website, which was last updated on January 17, 2025[1].

## Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Status

The search results do not contain specific announcements regarding planned changes to Climate.gov's operational status between March 7 and April 1, 2025. However, contextual information suggests:

- NOAA continues to actively produce climate-related content, as evidenced by their March 2025 climate outlook publications[2][4].
- The Climate Prediction Center released information about ENSO-neutral conditions being favored during the Northern Hemisphere summer, with forecasts extending through August-October 2025, suggesting ongoing operations[1].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

The most reliable sources to verify Climate.gov's status include:

- The Is It Down Right Now? service (isitdownrightnow.com/climate.gov.html) which was used to confirm the site was operational as of February 26, 2025.
- NOAA's official communications channels, including their Climate Prediction Center website (cpc.ncep.noaa.gov)[1].
- NOAA's social media accounts, which were active in early March 2025 sharing climate outlook information[4].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several limitations affect the forecast:

1. The search results do not contain any specific information about planned maintenance, updates, or potential shutdowns of Climate.gov between March 7 and April 1, 2025.

2. The reference to the National Security Archive report from February 6, 2025, about "Disappearing Data" related to climate information removal from government websites suggests potential concerns, but the search results don't provide details on whether this specifically affects Climate.gov.

3. While Climate.gov was operational in early March 2025, this doesn't guarantee its status will remain unchanged through April 1, 2025.

4. Government websites can experience temporary outages for maintenance or technical issues, which wouldn't necessarily indicate a permanent shutdown.

Based on the available evidence, Climate.gov appears to be actively maintained and operational as of early March 2025, with no announced plans for discontinuation before April 1, 2025. However, the forecast carries uncertainty due to the limited information about specific plans for the website in the coming weeks.
