## Limitations and Uncertainties

- The lack of published attendance numbers for 2022 and 2023 introduces uncertainty in trend analysis.
- Attendance may be affected by lingering pandemic-related factors, economic conditions, or unforeseen disruptions.
- The 2024 attendance, while a strong recovery, remains below the pre-pandemic peak, suggesting that a full return to previous highs is not guaranteed in 2025.
