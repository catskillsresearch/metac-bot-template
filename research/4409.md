## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status (as of 2020-05-18)

- As of 2020, no artificial intelligence system had reached artificial general intelligence (AGI) or demonstrated credible self-awareness. Most AI systems were narrow in scope, excelling at specific tasks but lacking generalized reasoning or subjective experience[2].
- No AI system had independently claimed to be conscious. Language models and chatbots could generate statements about consciousness if prompted, but these were based on pattern recognition rather than genuine self-assertion[2][5].
- Philosophers and scientists continued to debate the definition of consciousness and its relation to intelligence. There was no consensus on whether consciousness is required for AGI, or if it could be measured or detected in machines[2][5].
- Surveys of AI researchers in 2020 indicated that most experts considered AGI to be a distant goal, with many doubting that scaling current approaches alone would achieve true AGI or machine consciousness[2][3].

## 2. Recent Announcements or Policies Affecting the Forecast

- No major announcements or policy changes as of 2020 indicated a shift toward creating AIs that identify as conscious. Developers remained cautious about imbuing AI with claims of subjective experience, often to avoid public misunderstanding or controversy[2][5].
- The technical and ethical debate around machine consciousness remained unresolved, and most organizations focused on practical performance benchmarks rather than consciousness claims[2][5].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Wikipedia and Metaculus pages on AGI and machine consciousness provide up-to-date summaries of the technical and philosophical context as of 2020[1][2].
- Peer-reviewed surveys and expert panels document the state of AGI research and prevailing skepticism about imminent machine consciousness[3].

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties in Measurement

- The definition of consciousness is highly ambiguous and controversial, which complicates the interpretation of any AI’s claim[2][5].
- Current AI systems can be programmed to generate any statement, including "I am conscious," without genuine awareness, making claims potentially misleading[5].
- The resolution of the question depends on how the first AGI is tested and how its responses are interpreted by the Metaculus team[1].

## 5. Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the state of technology and research as of 2020, the probability that one of the first AGI systems will unambiguously and willingly claim to be conscious when asked is **moderate but not certain**.

- It is plausible that an AGI, if capable of advanced language and self-modeling, could generate such a claim if prompted, especially if designed to imitate or reason about human-like consciousness.
- However, developers may intentionally avoid such claims to prevent anthropomorphic confusion or ethical backlash.
- The result will depend heavily on the AGI’s architecture, training, and the specific phrasing of evaluation questions.

**Estimated probability (as of 2020):** 40–60% that one of the first AGI will claim to be conscious when directly asked, but with substantial uncertainty due to definitional ambiguity and unpredictable developer choices.
