## Assessing the Likelihood of a Major Nuclear Accident Before 2030

### Historical Context
The INES scale is a crucial tool for evaluating nuclear incidents, with levels ranging from 0 (no safety significance) to 7 (major accidents)[1][2]. The only two level seven accidents have been Chernobyl in 1986 and Fukushima Daiichi in 2011, both of which had significant environmental and health impacts[3][5]. These incidents highlight the potential for major accidents but also underscore the importance of safety measures and regulatory oversight.

### Current Status and Trends
- **Safety Enhancements**: Advances in technology and international cooperation have improved the safety of nuclear facilities. Regulatory bodies continue to update safety standards to mitigate risks[2].
- **Global Cooperation**: The IAEA and other international organizations play a key role in enhancing safety standards and guidelines[2].

### Recent Announcements and Policies
Recent years have seen increased emphasis on safety and regulation. For instance, the IAEA continues to update its guidelines for nuclear safety, and national regulatory bodies are more proactive in enforcing safety standards[2].

### Limitations and Uncertainties
Despite these efforts, there are uncertainties:
- **Subjective Interpretation of INES Ratings**: The severity of incidents can be subject to interpretation, potentially leading to confusion about the actual severity[1].
- **Technological and Human Factors**: Both technological failures and human errors remain significant risks despite enhanced safety measures[5].

### Probabilistic Assessment
Given these factors, while the likelihood of a major nuclear accident cannot be ruled out entirely, it remains relatively low due to ongoing safety improvements and international cooperation. However, the potential for human error or unforeseen technological failures means that some risk remains.
