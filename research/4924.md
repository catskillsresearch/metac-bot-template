## 1. Historical Trends and Current Status

- The LDS Church has consistently taught that marriage is only between a man and a woman[1][2][4].
- Homosexuality is not viewed as sinful in terms of orientation, but same-sex sexual activity and marriage are condemned and can result in discipline[4].
- While the Church reversed some harsh policies in 2019 (e.g., no longer labeling same-sex married members as apostates and allowing children of same-sex couples to be baptized), it has explicitly reaffirmed that its doctrine on marriage remains unchanged[3].
- Members in same-sex relationships are not eligible for temple ordinances or full membership privileges[4].

## 2. Recent Announcements/Policies

- In 2022, the Church publicly supported the Respect for Marriage Act (a U.S. federal law codifying same-sex and interracial marriage), but clarified this was about civil law and did not reflect any change in Church doctrine[3].
- Official Church statements as recently as 2022 assert: “The doctrine of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints related to marriage between a man and a woman is well known and will remain unchanged.”[3]
- Leadership has stated that the doctrine will not change, even while encouraging respect and compassion for LGBT individuals[2].

## 3. Authoritative Sources

- The Church’s official manuals and public statements[1][2][3]
- Independent reporting and academic sources summarizing the Church’s policies and their evolution[4]

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- Church leadership holds sole authority to define doctrine; major changes typically require explicit revelation and broad leadership agreement.
- Social and generational pressures exist, especially among younger members, but there is no evidence of imminent doctrinal reconsideration as of September 2020.
- Some policy reversals (e.g., 2019 changes) illustrate capacity for incremental shifts, but doctrinal change on marriage would be unprecedented in modern Church history.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the strong, repeated doctrinal reaffirmations, the highly centralized structure, and the distinction the Church draws between civic tolerance and religious doctrine, the probability that the LDS Church will officially recognize same-sex marriage by 2030 remains extremely low—likely well below 5%. There are no substantive indicators of impending doctrinal change as of September 2020.
