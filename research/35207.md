## New Hampshire Recreational Marijuana Dispensaries Forecast for April 1, 2025

**1. Historical Trends and Current Status**
- New Hampshire has repeatedly considered but not enacted legislation to legalize recreational marijuana sales. The state remains the only one in New England without legal recreational cannabis[1][3][4].
- Medical marijuana is legal and regulated through Alternative Treatment Centers (ATCs), but these serve only medical patients and do not qualify as recreational dispensaries[1].

**2. Recent Announcements and Policies**
- In 2024, HB 1633, which would have legalized adult-use cannabis and authorized 15 privately run retail marijuana stores, passed both the House and Senate (with amendments) but was ultimately killed in the House[1][3][4].
- In February 2025, the House passed HB 75, which legalizes possession and use for adults 21+ but does not establish a commercial market or dispensaries[2].
- Other bills proposing a regulated and taxed system for recreational sales (e.g., HB 186) remain in committee and have not become law as of the cutoff date[2][4].
- No legislation enabling recreational dispensaries has been enacted or implemented as of February 21, 2025.

**3. Authoritative Sources for Verification**
- The New Hampshire Cannabis Program and state legislative records confirm the absence of recreational dispensaries[1][2][3][4].
- Weedmaps, as of the cutoff date, lists only medical dispensaries in New Hampshire.

**4. Limitations and Uncertainties**
- Legislative activity is ongoing, and new bills could be introduced or passed after the cutoff date, but as of February 21, 2025, no legal framework exists for recreational dispensaries to operate in New Hampshire.
- Even if a bill were passed immediately after the cutoff, regulatory and licensing processes would likely prevent dispensaries from opening by April 1, 2025.

**Conclusion:**  
Based on all available information as of February 21, 2025, New Hampshire will not have any recreational marijuana dispensaries by April 1, 2025, and none will be listed on Weedmaps under the resolution criteria.
