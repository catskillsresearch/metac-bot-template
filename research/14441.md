## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of January 2023, the only operating lithium mine in the US was Albemarle's Silver Peak mine in Nevada, with annual production around 900 tonnes in 2020, about 1% of global output[5].
- The US lagged significantly behind Australia, Chile, and Argentina, which together accounted for 86% of world lithium output in 2020.
- Lithium demand has surged due to the rise of electric vehicles and renewable energy storage, driving interest in new US mines[5].

## 2. Recent Announcements and Policies

- Construction of the Thacker Pass mine in Nevada, the largest known US lithium deposit, began in March 2023. The mine is projected to produce up to 66,000 tons per year at full capacity and has major backing from General Motors[1][5].
- ExxonMobil began drilling its first lithium well in Arkansas in late 2023, signaling substantial corporate interest and likely future production[4].
- As of September 2024, there are reportedly eight active lithium mines in the United States, up from just one in early 2023[5]. This increase is attributed to a combination of public funding, policy incentives, and surging demand for domestic lithium[3].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Company press releases and websites for operational status (e.g., Lithium Americas, Albemarle, ExxonMobil).
- Trade press and reputable news outlets (Canary Media, Reuters, etc.).
- Wikipedia and industry tracking sites for aggregate mine counts and project statuses[5].

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- Community opposition, especially from Native American groups, has slowed or halted several projects, and regulatory hurdles remain significant.
- Some projects listed as "active" may be in early production or ramp-up phases, so full-scale output may lag.
- The number of operating mines may fluctuate, but evidence as of September 2024 already surpasses the three-mine threshold[5].

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given that at least eight lithium mines are reported to be active in the US as of September 2024, the probability that at least three mines will have operated before 2030 is now extremely high. The rapid increase from one to eight mines within less than two years—despite regulatory and local challenges—suggests a robust trend likely to persist barring major, unforeseen setbacks[5]. The forecast should now be considered a strong "Yes."
