### 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of May 28, 2025, Elon Musk’s net favorability rating on the Silver Bulletin polling average is -14.4. This value has remained stable, fluctuating only slightly (between -13 and -16) since April 2025[1][2].
- Historical context: Musk’s public favorability was once positive but has inverted over the past year due to his high-profile support for Donald Trump and his appointment as a “special government employee,” which drew significant public scrutiny and skepticism[1][2][4].
- The polling frequency has decreased recently; YouGov/The Economist ceased weekly favorability tracking after Musk stepped back from his government advisory role in early May 2025[1][2].

### 2. Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Metric

- Musk publicly announced his withdrawal from active government advisory work in early May 2025, which reduced his profile in political discourse[1][2][5].
- There is no evidence that this step-back has improved his popularity: “no sign (yet) that stepping back from government has made Elon Musk more popular”[1][2].
- Both Musk and his companies (notably Tesla) have faced reputational challenges over the past year, further dampening public sentiment[1][2][4].

### 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The authoritative, resolution-specific source is the Silver Bulletin polling average maintained by Nate Silver, updated daily[1][2].
- Additional context and past polling can be verified through YouGov/The Economist archives, but for the purposes of this question, the Silver Bulletin tracker is definitive[1][2][3].

### 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- Recent polling has been limited due to a lack of new surveys since early May and a general reduction in media attention following Musk’s step-back from politics[1][2].
- The polling average is thus less responsive to short-term events, and any sudden, significant change in Musk’s public perception may not be reflected promptly.
- Unpredictable media or business developments between now and June 25, 2025, could alter public opinion, but absent evidence of such events, the trend is likely to persist.

### Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the stability of Musk’s favorability rating (between -13 and -16 net) and the absence of significant upcoming events or polling, it is highly likely that his favorability on June 25, 2025, will fall within the same range as the current value. This suggests his raw “favorable” rating will remain below 38%, as net favorability is negative and the tracker has not indicated any recent upward movement.

**Probabilistic forecast:**
- **Most likely outcome:** Favorability will remain in the lowest band: **'<38.0%'**.
- **Estimated probability:** ~80% for '<38.0%'; ~20% for a slight uptick into the '≥38.0% and ≤40.0%' range, contingent on unforeseen positive developments.
