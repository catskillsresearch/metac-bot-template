### Key Factual Information as of 2024-01-25

**Historical and Current Status**
- The EUR/USD exchange rate was 1.1038 on 01.01.2024, following a period in late 2022 when it briefly dipped below 1.0000.
- Since the 2022 parity breach, the Euro has recovered moderately, but remains below pre-2022 levels.

**Recent Projections and Analyst Views**
- Most forecasts for 2024–2025 expect the EUR/USD rate to stay above parity, with minimum projections generally between 1.06 and 1.08[2][3][4].
- ING revised its EUR/USD outlook to a lower range (1.00–1.05) after the 2024 US election, noting "peak downside risks around the start of 2026" and viewing a parity breach as possible but not their base scenario[5].
- Bullish forecasts (Commerzbank, PandaForecast) suggest moderate Euro appreciation, with lows of 1.0689–1.08 and averages well above 1.10[2][4].
- Bearish scenarios (Goldman Sachs) highlight risks from a strong US economy and Eurozone vulnerabilities, but still place parity as an outer risk, not the core forecast[4].

**Key Differences and Uncertainties**
- The 2022 parity breach was driven by severe energy shocks and aggressive Fed tightening—conditions that have since partially reversed.
- The 2024 US election outcome (Republican win) increases downside risk for the Euro, especially if protectionist policies and tax cuts are enacted, potentially leading to Euro losses[5].
- Energy prices, central bank policy divergence, and unexpected shocks (e.g., global recession) remain major sources of uncertainty.

**Probabilistic Assessment**
- The consensus view is that EUR/USD will trade above parity during 2024–2025.
- However, political shifts and lingering economic risks mean a brief drop below 1.0000 cannot be ruled out, particularly if negative scenarios materialize in late 2025.
- Adjusted probability: The chance of EUR/USD dropping below 1.0000 at any point before 2026 is estimated at 10–30%, with risk highest around late 2025.

**Verification Sources**
- Google Finance, xe.com, and Yahoo Finance are authoritative sources for real-time EUR/USD rates.

**Limitations**
- Exchange rates are highly sensitive to global economic shocks, policy surprises, and unforeseen events. Forecasts are inherently uncertain and subject to rapid revision.
