### Key Factual Information Relevant to Forecasting Recall Closure

**1. Recall Details and Nature**
- Pork Dynasty Inc. issued a recall on September 27, 2024, for approximately 469 pounds of ready-to-eat fried pork skin products due to misbranding and undeclared soy allergen[4].
- The recall was later expanded in October 2024 to include shipments to Oklahoma retailers, but there is no indication of contamination or ongoing health risk[4].

**2. Historical Trends for Similar Recalls**
- FSIS recalls for undeclared allergens or misbranding (as opposed to contamination) are generally resolved more quickly, often within a few months, as they primarily involve product retrieval and relabeling rather than complex investigations[4].
- The relatively small size of this recall (469 pounds) supports the likelihood of a faster closure compared to larger or more complex recalls.

**3. Recent Announcements and Policies**
- There have been no recent FSIS policy changes or public announcements indicating delays or changes in recall closure procedures as of January 2025[1][2].
- The recall expansion in October 2024 suggests active engagement and compliance by Pork Dynasty Inc., which is typically a positive indicator for timely closure[4].

**4. Authoritative Sources for Verification**
- The official FSIS recall status page is the authoritative source for recall closure status[1].
- Industry news and recall tracking reports confirm the recall’s expansion and ongoing management but do not indicate unresolved issues[4].

**5. Limitations and Uncertainties**
- The exact closure date is not available as of January 21, 2025.
- Unforeseen issues (such as discovery of additional affected product or non-compliance) could delay closure, but there is no evidence of such complications as of the knowledge cutoff.
- The recall will only be considered closed when the FSIS status is updated from "Active" to "Closed" on the official recall page.

### Conclusion

Based on the recall’s nature (undeclared allergen/misbranding), its small size, historical FSIS recall closure timelines, and the absence of complicating factors or policy changes, it is likely—but not certain—that the Pork Dynasty Inc. recall will be closed before March 1, 2025. The main uncertainty is the possibility of unforeseen complications, but no such issues are documented as of January 21, 2025.
