## Limitations and Uncertainties

- The Academy has historically been hesitant to award major Oscars to science fiction films, though technical categories are more accessible for genre films[1][3].
- The omission of a Best Director nomination for Villeneuve may reduce the film’s chances in the Best Picture category[1][2][3].

## Summary
