## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Since 1945, there have been only two offensive nuclear detonations (both by the US over Japan). No state or non-state actor has detonated a nuclear weapon offensively since then.
- As of 2021, the US (5,550), Russia (6,257), and China (350) possess the most nuclear warheads globally[1].
- The US has never been the target of a non-test nuclear detonation.

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- The Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) aims to ban all nuclear explosions but has not entered into force due to lack of ratification by key states, including the US[4][5].
- The Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW) prohibits participating in any nuclear weapon activities but has not been adopted by nuclear-armed states[1].
- International norms and treaties provide barriers against nuclear use but are not legally binding for some major nuclear powers.

## Reference Cases

| Case                   | Target        | Fatalities in US? | Outcome                |
|------------------------|--------------|-------------------|------------------------|
| Hiroshima, 1945        | Japan        | No                | Offensive use by US    |
| Nagasaki, 1945         | Japan        | No                | Offensive use by US    |
| All other nuclear use  | None         | No                | Only tests, no offense |

## Key Differences Affecting Forecast

- If a non-test (offensive) nuclear detonation causing fatalities occurs anywhere, it would signal a breakdown in nuclear taboo and could increase the risk of escalation, including potential attacks on US soil.
- Deterrence and second-strike capabilities, along with missile defense and intelligence, reduce but do not eliminate the risk of a fatality in the US.
- Certain scenarios (e.g., large-scale state conflict, successful terrorist acquisition) could directly threaten the US if global nuclear norms fail.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

- The base rate for a non-test nuclear detonation is extremely low, given 75+ years without an incident.
- Conditional on an offensive nuclear detonation causing fatalities anywhere by 2050, the probability of at least one fatality in the US increases but remains lower than the global risk, due to the US’s deterrence posture, defenses, and targeting uncertainties.
- A reasonable expert estimate, considering historical trends, deterrence, and current policies, might place this conditional probability in the range of 10–30%. This reflects increased risk from escalation or copycat events but recognizes that the US is not the most likely first target for non-state or state actors given the complexity of delivery, retaliation risks, and alternative high-value targets.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- Forecasting over a 30-year timeframe is highly uncertain due to potential technological, geopolitical, and strategic shifts.
- The ambiguity in the definition of offensive use, targeting motivations, and future international relations creates wide error bars.
- Data is limited to state-level capabilities and policies as of 2021, not accounting for clandestine or future developments.
