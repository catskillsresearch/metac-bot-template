## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of August 2020, GiveWell listed several deworming charities (notably, Evidence Action's Deworm the World) as top charities and regarded mass deworming as among the highest-value global health interventions, despite controversy over the strength of the evidence base[5].
- GiveWell’s Cost-Effectiveness Analysis (CEA) continued to model deworming’s benefits as primarily due to long-term economic effects observed in a single influential study, though these effects were heavily discounted due to replicability concerns[5].
- By 2022, GiveWell had begun to recommend grants to a broader array of programs, sometimes outside the formal "top charity" list, but continued to channel significant funding to deworming organizations via the All Grants Fund[5].
- Deworming organizations, particularly Deworm the World, have delivered over 1.5 billion treatments since 2014, largely supported by GiveWell-directed funding[5].
- As of 2025, GiveWell's website continues to list deworming charities among its top giving opportunities, indicating ongoing support for mass deworming as a primary intervention[1].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- GiveWell has shifted towards a diversified funding approach, making grants to both top charities and promising new programs through the All Grants Fund[2].
- There have been no public announcements indicating a withdrawal of support or a major downgrade in GiveWell’s view of deworming interventions.
- Deworming remains featured as a cost-effective option, with GiveWell expressing high confidence in reducing worm loads, though expressing more caution about long-term life outcome benefits[5].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The GiveWell website’s "Top Charities" page (as of 2025) lists current top charities and their primary interventions[1].
- Evidence Action’s news updates confirm ongoing recognition and funding from GiveWell for deworming programs[5].
- GiveWell’s All Grants Fund and Top Charities Fund pages provide information on the allocation of donor funds[2][3].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- The main uncertainty is whether GiveWell will maintain the formal "top charities" list or transition fully to a fund-based or discretionary grant model. The resolution criteria account for this by defaulting to a 10% funding threshold for deworming programs if the list is discontinued.
- The evidence base for deworming’s long-term economic impact remains debated; new research could prompt changes in GiveWell’s recommendations, but no major shifts have occurred as of 2025.
- If GiveWell’s organizational structure or public communication changes substantially before the end of 2025, the resolution could be affected.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given current trends, ongoing funding, and the lack of a major shift in GiveWell’s stance or evidence base, the probability that at least one of GiveWell’s top charities at the end of 2025 will have mass deworming as its primary intervention remains high. The probability is estimated at 85–90%, subject to minor downward adjustment if GiveWell accelerates its transition away from formal charity lists.
