# Forecast Analysis: GiveWell's Top Charities and Deworming Interventions

Based on the available information as of the current date (May 12, 2025), I'll assess whether any of GiveWell's top charities will perform mass deworming as their primary intervention at the end of 2025.

## Current Status and Historical Context

As of 2022-2023, GiveWell had been undergoing changes in how it designates and funds deworming programs. Historically, deworming interventions were prominently featured among GiveWell's top charities, with Evidence Action's Deworm the World Initiative being a notable recipient of significant funding over the years.

Since 2013, GiveWell had recognized Deworm the World for its cost-effective impact, stating it "has the strongest track record of demonstrating that its programs are effective" among evaluated deworming charities[5]. Over a nine-year period prior to August 2022, GiveWell's funding for Deworm the World totaled more than $42 million[5].

## Recent Developments and Funding Patterns

In August 2022, GiveWell made changes to its charity designation system. While this represented a shift in how GiveWell categorized its giving options, it did not necessarily indicate a reduction in support for deworming programs[5]. Instead, GiveWell began increasingly directing funding through its All Grants Fund rather than exclusively through the top charities list.

In January 2023, GiveWell made a $2.5 million grant to Evidence Action's Deworm the World Initiative specifically for technical assistance to deworming programs in eight Indian states for the period of 2023-2025[4]. This funding was intended to:

1. Provide exit funding in six states where Deworm the World expected to transition programs to government control over 2-3 years
2. Support deworming in two priority states considered highly cost-effective[4]

This grant was part of a larger $7.7 million funding package to Deworm the World, demonstrating GiveWell's continued financial commitment to deworming interventions through 2025[4].

## GiveWell's Assessment of Deworming

GiveWell's position on deworming has been nuanced. While they have high confidence that deworming reduces worm loads, they express less confidence in the causal relationship between reduced worm loads and improved life outcomes[5]. This has led them to view deworming as less of a "sure bet" compared to some other interventions.

However, GiveWell continues to recognize that "because the impact of deworming is massive if realized, the 'expected value' is very high"[5]. This expected value calculation explains why GiveWell has maintained support for deworming programs despite some uncertainty about long-term impacts.

## Forecast Assessment

Given the evidence available, several factors suggest that GiveWell will likely continue to have at least one top charity performing mass deworming as its primary intervention at the end of 2025:

1. **Ongoing funding commitment**: The 2023 grant specifically covers deworming activities through 2025[4], indicating GiveWell's continued support for these programs at least until the end of the forecast period.

2. **Recognized cost-effectiveness**: Despite some uncertainty, GiveWell continues to view deworming as potentially having very high expected value[5], which aligns with their core mission of supporting highly cost-effective interventions.

3. **Gradual transition approach**: The grant structure shows a measured approach to transitioning programs to government control, suggesting that not all programs will be fully transitioned by the end of 2025[4].

4. **Historical prominence**: Given deworming's historical importance in GiveWell's portfolio and the substantial funding it has received, a complete elimination from top charity status would represent a dramatic shift in GiveWell's approach.

The main uncertainty in this forecast relates to GiveWell's evolving charity designation system. If GiveWell continues to shift funding toward its All Grants Fund rather than maintaining a traditional "top charities" list, the resolution criteria specified in the question would rely on whether at least 10% of GiveWell's regrants go to deworming charities in 2025.

Based on the funding patterns observed in 2023 and GiveWell's continued recognition of deworming's potential high value, it appears likely that deworming will remain a significant component of GiveWell's grantmaking through 2025, either as a top charity or through substantial funding via the All Grants Fund.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several limitations affect this forecast:

1. The information available doesn't provide complete details on GiveWell's most recent evaluations of deworming evidence or any potential shifts in their assessment methodology.

2. We lack information about any new interventions that might have emerged since 2023 that could potentially displace deworming in GiveWell's cost-effectiveness rankings.

3. The exact status of the transition to government control in the six Indian states mentioned is unclear, which affects whether Deworm the World will still be actively implementing programs by the end of 2025.
