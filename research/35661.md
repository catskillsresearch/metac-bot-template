As of early March 2025, Alex Pereira is favored to defeat Magomed Ankalaev at UFC 313 on March 8, 2025. Pereira, the reigning UFC light heavyweight champion, has demonstrated strong recent form with four consecutive knockout wins, while Ankalaev remains undefeated since 2018 and is the top-ranked contender. Betting markets reflect a close but slightly Pereira-leaning outlook, with Pereira at -125 odds and Ankalaev at +105 on BetMGM. The fight is expected to be competitive and likely to end before going the distance, given both fighters' recent history. However, MMA outcomes are inherently uncertain, and Ankalaev's confidence and skill make an upset possible. Overall, the available data supports a forecast that Pereira will likely win and retain his title at UFC 313, but with some uncertainty due to the competitive nature of the matchup[1][2].
