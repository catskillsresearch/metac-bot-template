# Forecasting Analysis: 50% Decline in Global Meat Production by 2040

As a forecasting analyst examining whether global meat production will decline by 50% by 2040 (from 342.42 million tons in 2018 to 171.21 million tons or lower), I'll analyze current trends, key factors, and provide a probabilistic assessment based on available data as of June 2021.

## Current Situation and Historical Trends

Global meat production has shown consistent growth over the past several decades, more than quadrupling since 1961[4]. As of 2018, global meat production reached approximately 342.42 million tons, representing a 46.68% increase since 2000. This upward trajectory has been particularly pronounced in Asia, where meat production has increased 15-fold since 1961, making it the world's largest meat-producing region[4].

Current projections indicate continued growth rather than decline, with world meat production expected to increase by 41 million tons carcass weight equivalent (cwe) to reach an estimated 382 million tons cwe by 2032[3]. This growth is anticipated to be driven primarily by:

- Significant increases in poultry meat production (projected 20 million ton increase)
- Recovery and growth in pigmeat production, particularly in China
- Continued expansion in Asia as the leading growth region

## Key Factors Affecting the Forecast

Several important factors will influence meat production trends through 2040:

**Factors supporting continued growth:**
- Population growth and rising incomes in developing countries
- Increasing meat consumption per capita in many emerging economies
- Projected expansion of production capacity in Asia[3][4]

**Potential limiting factors:**
- Feed and labor costs creating challenges for meat producers worldwide[3]
- Environmental regulations and animal welfare concerns affecting production in some regions, particularly Europe[3]
- Disease outbreaks such as African Swine Fever (ASF) affecting production in parts of Asia[3]
- Growing market share of alternative proteins

## Alternative Proteins Impact

The development of alternative proteins represents a significant variable in this forecast. By 2040, cultured meat consumption is projected to reach 30% of worldwide meat consumption[1]. Another report suggests that by 2040, 60% of global meat consumption will come from vegan or lab-grown sources[5].

However, it's crucial to note that per the question specifications, cultivated meat (produced from in vitro cell culture) would not count toward the overall global meat production figure. Only meat from slaughtered animals is counted in the target metric. This means that even if alternative proteins gain significant market share, they would not directly contribute to the 50% reduction target unless they actively displace conventional meat production.

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on the available evidence, the probability of global meat production declining by 50% by 2040 appears very low (estimated at <10%). This assessment is based on:

1. The strong historical growth trend in meat production (46.68% increase from 2000-2018)[4]
2. Explicit projections showing continued growth to 382 million tons by 2032[3]
3. The specification that cultivated meat doesn't count toward the reduction target
4. Absence of evidence for policies or trends that would drive such a dramatic reduction in conventional meat production

While alternative proteins will likely gain market share, the evidence suggests they will supplement rather than fully replace conventional meat production in the timeframe considered. To achieve a 50% reduction by 2040, we would need to see not just slowing growth but a dramatic reversal of long-established production trends, which current evidence does not support.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors could alter this assessment:

1. Data limitations: Forecasts beyond 2032 are sparse in the available literature
2. Regulatory changes: Potential for dramatic policy shifts affecting livestock production
3. Technological disruption: Unforeseen advances in alternative proteins could accelerate market shifts
4. Climate impacts: Extreme weather events could affect feed availability and production costs
5. Consumer behavior: Potential for accelerated shifts in dietary preferences

## Conclusion

The evidence available as of June 2021 strongly suggests that global meat production will continue to increase rather than decrease through at least 2032, making a 50% reduction by 2040 highly improbable. The most likely scenario is continued growth in conventional meat production, albeit potentially at a slower rate as alternative proteins gain market share.
