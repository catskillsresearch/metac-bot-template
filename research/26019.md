### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- SpaceX’s Starship program has been accelerating its test flight cadence. The gap between the first and second integrated test flights was seven months, while the gap between the second and third was four months. This trend suggests a push toward more frequent launches[4].
- As of March 14, 2024, Starship IFT-3 reached an altitude of 234 km, demonstrating the vehicle’s capability to surpass the 160 km threshold required by the question[4].
- Elon Musk stated in early 2024 that SpaceX hoped to conduct at least six more Starship flights in 2024, though his timelines are often optimistic and subject to change[4].

### Recent Announcements and Policies

- There are no confirmed or officially scheduled Starship launches between July 1 and September 30, 2024, according to the SpaceX official launch manifest and third-party aggregators as of July 11, 2024[1][2][3].
- The only launches explicitly listed for this period are Falcon 9 missions, not Starship[1][2][5].

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- SpaceX’s official launch manifest and mission reports[1].
- Third-party launch tracking sites such as Next Spaceflight[2][3].
- Major space news outlets and aerospace monitoring organizations[4].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- SpaceX’s launch schedules are highly dynamic, with frequent changes due to technical, regulatory, or logistical factors.
- Public launch manifests may not reflect the most current internal planning, and Starship launches are sometimes announced with short notice.
- The absence of scheduled launches as of July 11, 2024, does not preclude the possibility of one or two Starship launches occurring in the target window, but there is no public confirmation to support a definitive forecast.

### Summary

As of July 11, 2024, there is no confirmed evidence that exactly 1 or 2 Starship launches will reach an altitude of at least 160 km between July 1 and September 30, 2024. While the historical trend suggests an increasing cadence and the technical capability is established, the lack of scheduled launches in this window introduces significant uncertainty. The most authoritative sources do not list any Starship launches for this period, making it impossible to forecast with confidence that exactly 1 or 2 such launches will occur.
