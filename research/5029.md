## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- **2014 Independence Referendum**: Scotland voted 55.3% to remain in the UK, with 44.7% voting to leave. The result was seen as decisive at the time, but with a significant minority supporting independence[1][3].
- **Post-2014 Trends**: Since the 2014 vote, support for independence has gradually increased, particularly following the 2016 Brexit referendum. Scotland voted 62% to remain in the EU, in contrast to the UK-wide result, causing political friction and fueling independence sentiment[2][3].
- **Recent Polling (as of 2020)**: By mid-2020, some opinion polls began to show a narrow majority supporting independence, with “Yes” leading in several polls—a reversal from the post-2014 trend, which typically showed “No” ahead[2].

## 2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- **Calls for a Second Referendum**: The Scottish Government, led by the SNP, has repeatedly called for a second referendum, arguing that Brexit constitutes a material change in circumstances[1][3][5].
- **Legal and Constitutional Challenges**: The UK government has consistently refused to grant a Section 30 order (required for a binding referendum), leading to legal uncertainty over whether Scotland can unilaterally hold another referendum[1][3][5].
- **Potential for “De Facto” Referendum**: If a formal referendum is blocked, Scottish parties may attempt to frame a UK general election as a “de facto” independence referendum, though this approach is controversial and its legitimacy is debated[1][3].

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- **Polling Limitations**: While some polls showed “Yes” ahead as of 2020, margins were slim and subject to change. Polls are influenced by the phrasing of questions, current events, and campaign dynamics[2].
- **Legal and Timing Uncertainty**: There was no scheduled referendum as of September 2020. The UK government’s refusal to grant a Section 30 order creates ambiguity over when and under what circumstances a referendum would be held and recognized as legitimate[1][3][5].
- **Campaign Effects**: The outcome would be affected by the intensity and effectiveness of the campaigns, as well as intervening political or economic developments.
- **Voter Turnout**: High turnout in 2014 was seen as a factor in the “No” victory. Future turnout rates are uncertain and could sway the result.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment (as of September 2020)

Given the increasing but still volatile support for independence, the impact of Brexit, and ongoing legal obstacles, if a referendum had been held in late 2020, the probability of a “Yes” (leave) victory would likely be close to 50%, with a slight edge to “Yes” based on recent polling momentum. However, given uncertainties around the campaign context and legal legitimacy, the forecast should be considered highly uncertain and sensitive to future developments.
