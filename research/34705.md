## Forecasting U.S. Accusation of PRC Invasion of Taiwan

### Key Historical Trends and Current Status
- **Tensions and Military Activities**: China has consistently increased its military presence around Taiwan, and Taiwan has been bolstering its defense capabilities. This includes Taiwan conducting tabletop war games simulating a PRC invasion[1][2].
- **Diplomatic Tensions**: The U.S. has been involved in diplomatic efforts, expressing concerns over China's actions towards Taiwan. However, there has been no recent invasion by China[2][3].

### Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric
- **U.S.-China Diplomatic Engagement**: Recent phone calls between U.S. and Chinese leaders have highlighted the ongoing tensions, with China reiterating its sovereignty claims over Taiwan[2].
- **China's Sanctions**: China has imposed sanctions on companies involved in military sales to Taiwan, further escalating tensions[1].

### Authoritative Sources for Verification
- **Council on Foreign Relations (CFR)**: Provides analysis on U.S.-China-Taiwan relations and tensions[2][5].
- **Institute for the Study of War**: Offers updates on military activities and strategic developments in the region[1].

### Limitations or Uncertainties in Measurement
- **Lack of Clear Invasion**: As of the knowledge cutoff, there has been no reported invasion of Taiwan by China. The U.S. accusation would require a significant escalation, such as ground military forces entering Taiwan without consent[2][4].
- **Diplomatic and Military Posturing**: The situation is highly sensitive, with both sides engaging in diplomatic and military posturing. Predicting a specific accusation by the U.S. is challenging without clear evidence of an invasion[3][5].

## Conclusion
Given the current situation, it is uncertain whether the U.S. will accuse China of invading Taiwan before April 1, 2025, without a significant escalation in military actions.
