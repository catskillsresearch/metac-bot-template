### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Bushra Bibi, wife of former Prime Minister Imran Khan, has been repeatedly targeted by Pakistani authorities in high-profile corruption cases. She was previously convicted and held under house arrest, later moved to Adiala Jail at her own request due to concerns over her treatment during house arrest[3].
- In November 2024, a Rawalpindi accountability court issued non-bailable arrest warrants for Bushra Bibi in the GBP 190 million Al-Qadir University Trust corruption case, citing her continuous absence from court hearings[1][2][5].
- The Islamabad High Court had previously granted her bail in a related National Crime Agency settlement case, but the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) has since petitioned to cancel her bail in the Toshakhana case, again citing her failure to appear in court[2].

### Recent Announcements and Policies

- The accountability court's issuance of non-bailable arrest warrants in late November 2024 marks a significant escalation, as these warrants typically authorize law enforcement to arrest the individual at any time[1][2][5].
- The FIA's petition to cancel Bushra Bibi's bail in a separate case further increases her legal jeopardy[2].
- Despite these developments, as of December 4, 2024, there is no public record or authoritative report confirming that Bushra Bibi has been physically arrested under the new warrants.

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Major news outlets such as NDTV, Dawn, and India Today have reported on the issuance of arrest warrants and Bushra Bibi's prior custodial status[1][2][3][5].
- Amnesty International and other human rights organizations have also documented the legal proceedings against Bushra Bibi and Imran Khan[4].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- While non-bailable arrest warrants and bail cancellation petitions significantly increase the probability of arrest, they do not guarantee it. Political considerations, legal appeals, and health-related exemptions could delay or prevent arrest.
- The situation remains fluid, and the lack of confirmation of arrest as of December 4, 2024, means any forecast must acknowledge this uncertainty.

### Summary Table

| Factor                          | Status as of Dec 4, 2024         |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Non-bailable arrest warrants     | Issued (Nov 2024)                |
| Bail status                     | Challenged, cancellation sought  |
| Physical arrest (new warrants)   | Not confirmed                    |
| Prior custody (other cases)      | Yes (house arrest, jail)         |

### Conclusion

As of December 4, 2024, Bushra Bibi faces significant legal risk, with non-bailable arrest warrants issued and bail cancellation sought in multiple cases. However, there is no confirmed report of her arrest under the new warrants. The probability of arrest before January 1, 2025, is elevated, but not certain based on available facts.
