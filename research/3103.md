## Key Historical Trends and Current Status (as of 2019)

- **Clean meat production costs** were reported to have dropped from €650,000/kg in 2013 to about €36,200/kg in 2016, representing an 18-fold reduction in just three years[3].
- Mark Post (Mosa Meat) predicted in 2015 that costs could fall to €60/kg with advances in bioreactor and tissue culture technology[3].
- By 2017, predictions suggested cultured burgers could reach supermarkets at prices comparable to premium beef by the mid-2020s, with initial retail prices of $12–$14 per burger (~$48–$56/kg for a 250g patty) and further declines anticipated as scale improves[3].
- Conventional beef prices in 2019 were about $3.5/lb (~$7.7/kg), but this is artificially low due to subsidies, making it a tough target for clean meat to undercut initially[4].

## Reference Cases and Forecasts

- **Metaculus Community Prediction (as of 2019):** Median forecast for the lowest retail price of a qualifying clean meat product in 2026 was $16.8/kg (25th–75th percentile: $7.46–$38.6/kg), adjusted to 2019 USD[3].
- **Academic/Industry Estimates:** Studies suggested that, at best, cost-competitive clean meat could be produced at €3.3–3.5/kg (Exmoor, 2008), but more recent technical-economic analyses (TEAs) put realistic lower bounds much higher due to input costs, especially for growth media[4][5].
- **Forecasting Organizations:** Reports from 2021 (post-2019) indicate that, as of then, even $11/kg was an optimistic best-case for production costs, not retail price, hinting that the 2019 optimism may have been too strong[5].

## Key Differences Affecting the Forecast

- **Regulatory and Scale-Up Delays:** Regulatory uncertainty and slow approval processes, especially in the US and EU, were already flagged as potential bottlenecks by 2019, and subsequent developments have confirmed delays in widespread adoption[3][4].
- **Input Cost Reduction Progress:** While production costs were falling rapidly (via cheaper growth media and plant-based inputs), significant technical hurdles remained, especially for food-grade, scalable animal-free media[5].
- **Conventional Meat Market:** Beef prices are forecast to rise through 2026 due to supply constraints, which could make clean meat relatively more competitive if it can reach scale[1][2].
- **Consumer Demand:** Growing interest in alternative proteins may support higher price points in the early market phase, but mass adoption requires price parity with conventional options.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

- **Most Likely Range:** The best-supported forecast, given all data as of 2019, is that the lowest retail price in a qualifying supermarket in the US, EU (as of 2019), or Switzerland in 2026 will fall in the $7.5–$39/kg (2019 USD) range, with a median expectation around $17/kg[3].
- **Lower Bound:** Achieving prices below $7/kg would likely require technical breakthroughs in growth media and large-scale regulatory approval by 2026, which, while possible, was seen as a low-probability outcome by expert forecasters[3][4][5].
- **Upper Bound:** Without further breakthroughs, prices could remain above $40/kg, especially if regulatory or supply chain challenges persist, but the trend as of 2019 was strongly downward.
- **Ambiguity Risk:** There is a non-negligible chance that no qualifying product will be sold in supermarkets by 2026, in which case the outcome will be ambiguous as per resolution criteria[3][4].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- **Retail vs. Production Cost:** Most forecasts are for production cost, not final supermarket price, which includes distribution, retail markup, and potential early-market premiums.
- **Regulatory & Market Timing:** The forecast assumes timely regulatory approval and commercial launch in at least one qualifying supermarket, which was highly uncertain as of 2019[3][4].
- **Technological Progress:** Estimates rely heavily on projected cost reductions in bioprocessing and input costs, which may not materialize as fast as optimists hope[5].
- **Price Adjustments:** All prices must be adjusted to 2019 USD using official CPI and FX rates at the time of resolution.

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Credible estimates should come from media reports, supermarket listings, or at least three independent reports (media/social media/Metaculus admin submissions) as per question criteria.
