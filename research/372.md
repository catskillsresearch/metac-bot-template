# Forecasting Analysis: Brain Emulation vs. Other Paths to Human-Level AI

As of November 2016, the question of whether brain emulation will be the first successful route to human-level digital intelligence requires careful analysis of current technological trajectories, research programs, and theoretical considerations.

## Current Status of Brain Emulation Research

Brain emulation (or "whole brain emulation" - WBE) involves creating a functional copy of a brain in a computational substrate. The most prominent large-scale effort in this direction has been the Blue Brain Project, which has faced significant organizational challenges. By 2015, Henry Markram was removed from the leadership position[1], indicating potential difficulties in project execution despite ambitious goals.

The WBE roadmap developed by researchers at the Future of Humanity Institute outlines a two-phase approach:

1. **Development Phase**: Establishing basic capabilities, determining feasibility, required detail levels, and optimal techniques through partial scans and simulations.

2. **Implementation Phase**: Once core methods are developed and an automated scan-interpretation-simulate pipeline is achieved, the first emulations become possible, with subsequent scaling to more complex brains[2].

Key milestones identified in this roadmap include:
- Establishing "ground truth" models
- Determining appropriate simulation levels
- Achieving full cell simulation
- Creating automated pipelines for scanning and interpretation
- Developing validation methods[2]

As of 2016, researchers have made progress on simulating limited neural networks, but complete brain emulation remains distant. The technological requirements for scanning, storage, and computational power present significant challenges.

## Competing Approaches to Human-Level AI

Alternative approaches to achieving human-level AI include:

1. **Deep Learning and Neural Networks**: Since 2012, deep learning has achieved remarkable successes in image recognition, natural language processing, and game playing (including AlphaGo's defeat of Lee Sedol in March 2016).

2. **Hybrid Systems**: Combinations of symbolic reasoning, probabilistic models, and neural networks that aim to incorporate different aspects of intelligence.

3. **Neuromorphic Computing**: Hardware designed to mimic neural structures without necessarily replicating specific human brains.

The Blue Brain Project itself has acknowledged that "neuromorphic engineering based on partial results would be useful in a number of applications such as pattern recognition, AI and brain-computer" interfaces[2], suggesting that neuromorphic approaches may yield practical benefits before full brain emulation.

## Key Differences Affecting the Forecast

Several factors differentiate the brain emulation approach from other paths to human-level AI:

**Data Requirements**:
- Brain emulation requires comprehensive, high-resolution brain scanning data that doesn't yet exist
- Other AI approaches can progress with existing datasets

**Theoretical Understanding**:
- Brain emulation can potentially succeed without complete theoretical understanding of intelligence
- Other AI approaches may require deeper theoretical insights about intelligence

**Scaling Properties**:
- Once the technical hurdles are overcome, brain emulation could potentially scale quickly
- Other AI approaches may face unknown theoretical barriers to reaching human-level performance

**Hardware Requirements**:
- Brain emulation will likely require massive computational resources
- Other AI approaches may achieve intelligence with more efficient computational architectures

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on information available as of November 2016, I assess the following probabilities:

**Brain emulation will be the first route to human-level digital intelligence: 15-25%**

Rationale:
1. The technical challenges for brain emulation are substantial and well-defined, requiring advances in scanning technology, computational power, and neuroscientific understanding[2][3].

2. Alternative AI approaches are showing rapid progress without requiring complete brain mapping, potentially offering a faster path to human-level capabilities.

3. The Blue Brain Project and similar initiatives have encountered significant organizational and technical challenges[1], suggesting longer timelines than initially projected.

4. The WBE roadmap indicates multiple prerequisite milestones that have not yet been achieved as of 2016[2].

5. The debate between experts remains active, with significant disagreement about feasibility timelines, as evidenced by contrasting perspectives in the New York Times editorial and Brain Preservation Foundation response mentioned in the question description.

This assessment reflects considerable uncertainty, as both brain emulation and alternative AI approaches face unknown technical hurdles. The most likely scenario appears to be that incremental advances in deep learning and hybrid systems will reach human-level performance in specific domains before complete brain emulation becomes viable, but this conclusion is far from certain.
