## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Bitcoin has experienced significant volatility in 2024 and early 2025, with recent price dives amid global uncertainty in the cryptocurrency market.
- Despite this, the overall trend since late 2023 has been bullish, with prices reaching new highs and strong institutional interest supporting the market[5].
- Historical cycles show that after major rallies, bitcoin can correct sharply, but support levels tend to form at psychologically significant round numbers (e.g., $100K).

## Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Metric

- Options markets are reflecting bullish sentiment, with some traders betting on extreme highs ($250Kâ€“$300K) by June 2025, though these are considered outlier scenarios[1][2].
- No major regulatory announcements or macroeconomic policy changes have been reported as of late May 2025 that would dramatically alter the bitcoin price trajectory, but ongoing uncertainty remains a risk factor.
