## Key Factual Information Relevant to Forecasting a Fed Rate Cut Before September 30, 2024

**Current Status and Recent Trends**
- The Federal Reserve’s target federal funds rate has been held steady at 5.25%–5.50% since July 2023, the highest level in 23 years[1][5].
- Inflation has eased but remains above the FOMC’s 2% target. The Committee notes “modest further progress” on inflation but remains cautious[1][4].
- The FOMC’s July 2024 Monetary Policy Report states that rate reductions will not occur until there is “greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent”[1].

**Recent Announcements and Policy Guidance**
- The FOMC’s June 2024 Summary of Economic Projections indicates a median expectation of one rate cut in 2024, with the federal funds rate projected at 5.1% by year-end[2][4][5].
- The FOMC’s official statements emphasize a data-dependent approach, with no commitment to a specific timing for the first cut[1].
- Market analysts, such as Morningstar, forecast that the first rate cut could occur at the September 18, 2024, FOMC meeting, contingent on continued progress in inflation data[4].

**Authoritative Sources for Verification**
- The Federal Reserve’s target funds rate history and official FOMC statements are the primary sources for confirming any rate cut announcement[1].
- The FOMC’s meeting calendar and economic projections provide context for policy expectations[2][3].

**Limitations and Uncertainties**
- The FOMC’s decision is explicitly data-dependent, and the Committee has not pre-committed to a rate cut at any particular meeting[1].
- Economic conditions, especially inflation and labor market data, could change unexpectedly, influencing the timing of any rate cut.
- While projections and market expectations suggest a possible cut in September, there is no guarantee; the FOMC could delay action if inflation progress stalls or reverses[1][4].
