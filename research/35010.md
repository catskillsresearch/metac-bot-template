As of May 26, 2025, this question no longer requires forecasting as the Canadian federal election has already taken place in April 2025. Based on the available information, I can provide a definitive answer rather than a probabilistic assessment.

## Election Outcome

Pierre Poilievre was **not elected Prime Minister of Canada** in the 2025 federal election. The Liberal Party, led by Mark Carney, defeated the Conservatives in the April 2025 election[3]. Most significantly, Poilievre not only failed to become Prime Minister but also lost his own parliamentary seat in the riding of Carleton[2][5].

## Pre-Election Context

Prior to the election, polling had shown a competitive race:

- Final polling by Focaldata showed 40.5% support nationwide for Carney's Liberals, with Poilievre's Conservatives trailing at 37.5%[3]
- Liberals held a significant 9-point lead in Ontario (46% to 37%) and led in Quebec (38% compared to Conservatives' 22%)[3]
- Conservatives led in every province west of Ontario, including British Columbia[3]
- The NDP, led by Jagmeet Singh, trailed nationally at 10.7%[3]

## Key Factors in the Election Outcome

Several factors contributed to Poilievre's defeat:

1. **Leadership Differentiation**: Mark Carney successfully distanced himself from former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, with 46% of voters seeing him as "mostly represents something different from Justin Trudeau's leadership"[3]

2. **Regional Dynamics**: The Liberals' strong performance in the populous provinces of Ontario and Quebec proved decisive in the overall result[3]

3. **Voter Commitment**: 71% of Conservative voters considered their preferences final compared to 68% of Liberals, but this advantage was insufficient to overcome the overall polling deficit[3]

## Current Status

Despite losing both the election and his own seat, Poilievre has vowed to remain as Conservative Party leader[5]. While the Conservatives did manage to elect more MPs than in the previous federal election, this increase was not enough to form government[5].

The CBC Poll Tracker had been monitoring the race throughout the campaign, providing seat projections based on polling data and accounting for local factors across Canada's 343 ridings[1].

This outcome represents a significant political development in Canada, as Poilievre had been positioned as a strong challenger to the Liberal government following Justin Trudeau's resignation in January 2025.
