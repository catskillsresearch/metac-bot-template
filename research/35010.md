Based on the most current data available as of May 13, 2025, I can provide a definitive assessment regarding Pierre Poilievre's bid to become Prime Minister of Canada in the 2025 federal election.

## Election Outcome Analysis

The Canadian federal election was held on Monday, May 12, 2025, and the results indicate that Pierre Poilievre will **not** be elected Prime Minister of Canada. The Liberal Party, led by Mark Carney, has won more parliamentary seats than Poilievre's Conservative Party[2]. Most significantly, Poilievre suffered a personal defeat, losing his own parliamentary seat representing his Ottawa district[2].

This outcome represents a dramatic reversal from earlier projections and polling data that had suggested Poilievre was positioned to become Canada's next Prime Minister. As recently as April 26, 2025, polling data showed a competitive race with Liberals at 40.5% support nationwide compared to Conservatives at 37.5%[4].

## Key Factors Influencing the Outcome

Several critical factors contributed to this electoral outcome:

**U.S. Relations and Nationalism**
The single most decisive factor appears to have been the deterioration in U.S.-Canada relations. U.S. President Donald Trump's trade war with Canada and controversial suggestions that Canada should become "the 51st state" provoked a nationalist backlash among Canadian voters[2]. This unexpected international development dramatically altered the election's trajectory, transforming what had appeared to be an imminent Liberal defeat into a fourth consecutive term in power[2].

**Regional Support Distribution**
Pre-election polling showed significant regional variations in support:
- Liberals held a 9-point lead in Ontario (46% to 37%)
- Liberals led in Quebec (38%), ahead of the Bloc Québécois (28%) and Conservatives (22%)
- Conservatives maintained leads in provinces west of Ontario, including an 8-point advantage in British Columbia (42% to 34%)[4]

**Leadership Perception**
Mark Carney successfully differentiated himself from former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, with 46% of voters indicating they saw Carney as "mostly representing something different from Justin Trudeau's leadership"[4]. This distinction proved crucial, as nearly three out of five voters held unfavorable views of the former prime minister[4].

## Campaign Strategy Assessment

Poilievre's campaign strategy appears to have backfired in the final stages of the election. His adoption of a "Canada First" slogan, reminiscent of Trump's "America First" platform, may have ultimately undermined his candidacy when U.S.-Canada tensions escalated[2]. The Conservative leader's Trump-like campaign style became a liability rather than an asset as Canadian voters rallied around nationalist sentiment in response to perceived American threats.

In his victory speech in Ottawa, Mark Carney emphasized Canadian unity in the face of Washington's threats and declared that the previously mutually beneficial system between Canada and the U.S. had ended[2].

## Conclusion

Based on the election results of May 12, 2025, Pierre Poilievre will not become Prime Minister of Canada. The Liberal Party under Mark Carney has secured more parliamentary seats, though it remains unclear whether they have achieved an outright majority (at least 172 seats) or will need to form a coalition government[2]. This outcome represents a significant political reversal for Poilievre and the Conservative Party, who had appeared poised for victory until international developments dramatically shifted the electoral landscape.
