### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- **Miami, FL December Lows:**  
  Miami's lowest December temperatures in recent decades have generally stayed above 40°F, with the most extreme cold snap in recent memory being 30°F on December 25, 1989[1][4]. In the past five years, the lowest December temperatures have typically been in the upper 40s to low 50s °F. For example, in December 2020, the lowest was 47°F[1][4]. Freezing temperatures in December are exceedingly rare in Miami.

- **Anchorage, AK December Highs:**  
  Anchorage's highest December temperatures rarely exceed the low-to-mid 40s °F. While warm spells can push highs into the 40s, it is uncommon for Anchorage to record a December high above 45°F. In 2020, the highest December temperature was 45°F, which is near the upper bound for that month in Anchorage[4].

### Recent Announcements or Policies

- As of late 2024, there have been no significant announcements or climate policy changes specifically affecting December temperature extremes in either Miami or Anchorage.

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The official resolution will use the Iowa State University Mesonet Data Calendars for:
  - Miami International Airport (MIA)
  - Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport (PANC)

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- **Measurement:**  
  Data is highly reliable, but if any required value is missing ("MM"), the question will not resolve as "Yes" or "No" but will be annulled.
- **Unusual Weather Events:**  
  While rare, extreme cold in Miami or extreme warmth in Anchorage could cause an overlap, but this has not happened in the past five years and is statistically unlikely based on recent trends[1][4].
- **Resolution Source:**  
  Only the Iowa State University Mesonet Data Calendars will be used for resolution, regardless of other reports.

### Summary

Based on historical data, it is unlikely—but not impossible—that Miami's lowest December 2024 temperature will be lower than Anchorage's highest December 2024 temperature. The scenario has come close but has not occurred in the past five years, and both cities' recent temperature records suggest the trend will likely continue.
