### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- **NVIDIA** has been the standout performer among the largest tech companies, with its stock rising 171% in 2024 due to surging demand for AI accelerators and data center chips. It was the best-performing S&P 500 stock in 2023 and continued to outperform in 2024, despite a late-year correction[1][4].
- **Apple** and **Microsoft** are close competitors in market cap and are both seen as potential first $4 trillion companies, but their recent growth rates have been more moderate compared to NVIDIA. Apple's growth is driven by its iPhone ecosystem and expanding services, while Microsoft's is fueled by Azure cloud and AI partnerships[3].
- **Amazon** and **Alphabet** remain strong, with Amazon highlighted for its long-term potential and Alphabet for its AI monetization prospects, but neither has matched NVIDIA's recent momentum[3][4].

### Recent Announcements and Analyst Sentiment

- NVIDIA remains a top pick for 2025 among major Wall Street analysts, who cite strong demand for its next-generation Blackwell chips and continued AI infrastructure buildout as key growth drivers[1][4].
- The broader "Magnificent Seven" group is expected to see slower year-over-year growth in 2025 due to tough comparisons with previous years, but NVIDIA is still forecast to outperform its peers[1].
- Goldman Sachs and other analysts expect the group to outperform the rest of the S&P 500, but by a narrower margin than in previous years[1].

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Yahoo Finance provides historical stock price data for all five companies, which will be used to determine the highest relative growth from January 31 to March 31, 2025.
- Analyst reports and financial news outlets (Investopedia, Nasdaq, Economic Times) offer consensus forecasts and recent performance summaries[1][3][4].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- Stock price growth is influenced by market sentiment, macroeconomic conditions, and unforeseen events, which can introduce volatility and unpredictability.
- The measurement is based solely on adjusted closing prices, not underlying business fundamentals or long-term prospects.

### Conclusion

Based on available data and analyst sentiment as of early 2025, **NVIDIA (NVDA)** is the most likely among the five largest companies to see the highest stock price growth in February and March 2025, driven by continued AI demand and strong analyst support[1][4].
