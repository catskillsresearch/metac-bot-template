### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of May 23, 2024, Nvidia's market capitalization stood at $2.5 trillion, while Apple's was $2.9 trillion, making Nvidia the third most valuable company in the world, just behind Apple and Microsoft[1][2].
- Nvidia's market cap has grown nearly tenfold since late 2022, driven by its dominance in the AI chip market and surging demand from major technology companies[2].
- Nvidia's rapid ascent has been fueled by strong data center revenue, expansion into AI and machine learning, and consistent outperformance in quarterly financial results[1][2].

### Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Metric

- On May 22, 2024, Nvidia announced impressive Q1 financial results and a 10:1 stock split, which sent its stock price to new all-time highs[2].
- In the five days ending May 24, 2024, Nvidia's stock surged by 13.5%, significantly narrowing the gap with Apple's market cap[2].

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Companies Market Cap is the primary source for real-time market capitalization data and is referenced in major financial analyses[2].
- Other financial data aggregators and market news platforms also track these metrics.

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- The most recent concrete data is from late May 2024. Market capitalizations are subject to daily fluctuations due to stock price volatility, macroeconomic events, and company-specific news.
- While Nvidia's growth trajectory suggests it could overtake Apple, there is no guarantee that the trend will continue through July 17, 2024.
- The resolution depends on the specific market cap values at approximately 4 PM EDT (8 PM UTC) on July 17, 2024, as reported by Companies Market Cap or another credible source.
