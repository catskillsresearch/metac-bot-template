## Maximum World Real GDP Growth in the 21st Century: Factual Assessment as of June 2020

**1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status**
- The prior reference for the highest world real GDP growth rate in the 21st century was 4.403% in 2004.
- Updated, authoritative data shows the world GDP growth rate reached 6.26% in 2021, marking an exceptional spike after the unprecedented economic contraction of 2020 (-2.93%) due to the COVID-19 pandemic[4].
- Typical years in the 21st century have seen global growth rates between 2% and 4%[1][4].

**2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric**
- The historic 2021 rebound was driven by:
  - Massive fiscal and monetary stimulus worldwide.
  - Accelerated vaccine rollouts and the reopening of economies.
  - Pent-up consumer and business demand after 2020’s lockdowns.
- No similar coordinated or large-scale global stimulus or economic event is currently anticipated, making a repeat of such a rapid growth spike unlikely in the immediate future[4].

**3. Authoritative Sources for Verification**
- The World Bank and IMF provide the most widely accepted and reliable global GDP growth data, which is also aggregated by data services such as Macrotrends[1][3][4].

**4. Limitations or Uncertainties in Measurement**
- World GDP growth depends on the accuracy of national statistics, which may be subject to revision.
- Extraordinary events (e.g., global war, pandemics, systemic technological breakthroughs) could upend forecasts.
- The further into the future the forecast extends (to 2100), the higher the uncertainty.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the available evidence and the extreme, rare circumstances required to surpass the 2021 growth rate, it is highly probable (over 90%) that the maximum world real GDP growth for a single year in the 21st century will remain at or below 6.26%. The probability of exceeding 7% in a single year is very low, barring a global crisis-and-rebound scenario of similar or greater magnitude than COVID-19.

| Scenario                | Probability (%) | Maximum World Real GDP Growth (%) |
|-------------------------|----------------|-----------------------------------|
| Base case (no crisis)   | >90            | ≤6.26                            |
| Crisis-and-rebound      | <10            | 6.26–7.0                         |
| Extreme outlier         | <1             | >7.0                             |
