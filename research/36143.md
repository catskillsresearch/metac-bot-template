# Forecasting Ivy League Success in the 2025 NCAA Men's Tournament

Based on information available as of March 17, 2025, here's an analysis of whether an Ivy League team (Yale, Cornell, Princeton, or Dartmouth) might advance to the second round of the 2025 NCAA men's basketball tournament.

## Current Status of Ivy League Contenders

The 2025 Ivy League Basketball Tournament (Ivy Madness) was held on March 15-16, 2025, at the Pizzitola Sports Center, with the winner receiving an automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament[2]. The tournament featured four teams:

1. **Yale** (1st seed): Entered as the clear favorite with -160 odds to win the Ivy League Tournament[1][3]
2. **Cornell** (2nd seed): Second favorite with +300 odds[1][3]
3. **Dartmouth** (3rd seed): +600 odds[1][3]
4. **Princeton** (4th seed): Longest shot with +1200 odds[1][3]

The semifinals were scheduled for March 15, with Yale facing Princeton and Cornell playing Dartmouth, followed by the championship game on March 16[2].

## Team Strengths and Performance Indicators

Several factors suggest the potential strength of the Ivy League representative in the NCAA Tournament:

- **Yale** has shown significant strength, climbing to No. 6 in the College Insider Men's Mid-Major Top 25 poll and even receiving one No. 1 vote[4]
- Yale guard John Poulakidas ranked 12th nationally in three-pointers made per game (3.26)[4]
- The Ivy League as a conference has demonstrated offensive efficiency, ranking first in assists per field goal made (55.1%) and third in tempo (69.7) among all conferences[2]
- Five Ivy League teams completed non-conference play with winning records: Columbia (11-2), Princeton (11-4), Brown (8-5), Cornell (8-5), and Yale (7-6)[2][4]
- The conference secured victories against teams from major conferences including the ACC, Atlantic 10, Big East, and Big Ten[4]

## Historical Tournament Performance

Historical trends from previous Ivy League tournaments provide some context:

- Favorites of 4 points or more have gone 9-1 outright (5-4-1 against the spread) in Ivy League tournament games, suggesting that higher seeds tend to advance[1]
- Yale was projected as a significant favorite if they were to face Cornell in the championship game, with an implied moneyline of around -359 based on previous matchups[1]

## NCAA Tournament Outlook

While the specific NCAA Tournament seeding for the Ivy League champion is not available in the search results, several factors would influence their chances of advancing to the second round:

1. **Seeding**: Historically, Ivy League champions typically receive seeds in the 12-14 range, which would mean facing a 3-5 seed in the first round
2. **Upset potential**: The Ivy League has produced notable first-round upsets in past tournaments, with Princeton and Yale both having second-round appearances in recent years
3. **Three-point shooting**: With strong three-point shooting across the league (ranking 2nd in conference 3-point percentage at 36.2%)[4], the Ivy representative could have the shooting capability to pull an upset
4. **Experience and continuity**: The Ivy League has the second-best continuity average of all 31 Division I conferences according to KenPom rankings, suggesting teams with established chemistry[4]

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several important limitations affect this forecast:

1. The search results do not include the actual outcome of the Ivy League Tournament, so we don't know which team secured the automatic bid
2. No information is available about the NCAA Tournament bracket, seeding, or matchups
3. Historical performance is not always predictive of future results, especially in single-elimination tournaments
4. The search results don't provide detailed information about key injuries or other late-season developments that might impact tournament performance

## Conclusion

Based on available information, Yale appeared to be the strongest contender to represent the Ivy League in the NCAA Tournament, with Cornell as the next most likely. The Ivy League representative would have reasonable upset potential given the conference's strong offensive metrics, three-point shooting ability, and demonstrated success against major conference opponents. However, without knowing the specific team, their seeding, and first-round matchup, it's difficult to make a definitive prediction about their chances of advancing to the second round.
