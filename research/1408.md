### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The P vs. NP problem is one of the original seven Millennium Prize Problems established by the Clay Mathematics Institute in 2000, with a $1 million prize for a correct solution[4].
- As of September 7, 2018, **no solution to P vs. NP has been accepted by the mathematical community or awarded by the Clay Institute**.
- There is a long record of attempted proofs: as of 2018, Gerhard J. Woeginger’s list included 62 purported proofs that P = NP, 50 that P ≠ NP, 2 that the problem is unprovable, and 1 claiming undecidability. None have been accepted as correct[1].
- The mathematical community, according to a 2002 survey by William I. Gasarch, overwhelmingly believes that P ≠ NP: 61 out of 100 theorists polled believed P ≠ NP, 9 thought P = NP, 4 thought the problem is independent, and the remainder were undecided or offered other views[1].

### Recent Announcements and Policies

- Up to September 2018, **no major announcements or policy changes** had occurred regarding the resolution of P vs. NP.
- The Clay Mathematics Institute remains the authoritative source for prize announcements, and no prize has been awarded for this problem.

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The **Clay Mathematics Institute** is the official arbiter for any solution to the Millennium Prize Problems[4].
- Gerhard J. Woeginger’s list documents the history of claimed proofs, none of which have been accepted as valid[1].
- William I. Gasarch’s survey provides insight into expert opinion[1].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- The problem might be **undecidable or independent** of standard mathematical axioms, which would prevent a definitive resolution.
- Verification of extremely complex proofs could take years, and unrecognized progress may exist but not be widely known.
- The resolution criteria specify that if the problem is proven unprovable or undecidable, the question resolves ambiguously.
