## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Since 2006, NATO’s official defence spending target has been 2% of GDP for each member state, reaffirmed after Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014[1][3].
- By 2024, 22-23 out of 32 NATO members had met or exceeded the 2% target, a significant increase from only three in 2014, largely due to heightened security concerns following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine[3].

## Recent Announcements and Policy Shifts

- NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte has stated that members will need to spend “considerably more than 3 percent” of GDP on defence, signaling a clear intent to raise the target above the longstanding 2% benchmark[4].
- There is growing consensus among NATO officials and analysts that the 2% target is outdated and insufficient to meet current security challenges[1][4].
- The US, under President Trump, has demanded a 5% of GDP target, but this has been met with resistance from key European allies, notably Germany, who argue that such a level is too costly[4].
- Policy analysis and reporting indicate that the most likely scenario for the 2025 NATO summit is agreement on a new defence spending floor of 3.5% of GDP[3].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Multiple sources, including statements from the NATO Secretary General and reputable policy analysis, converge on the likelihood of a new target set at or above 3%, with 3.5% cited as the most probable figure for the 2025 summit[3][4].
- Calls for a 3% threshold are widespread, but the push for “considerably more than 3 percent” and the specific mention of 3.5% in summit scenario planning make 3.5% the most authoritative forecast[1][3][4].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- While the US push for a 5% target is significant, it is unlikely to be adopted due to strong European opposition and practical constraints on rapid increases in defence spending[4].
- If a range is set (e.g., 3–4%), the lower end (3%) would be used per the resolution criteria, but current signals point to a specific floor rather than a range.
- Final agreement depends on political negotiations at the summit, and unforeseen geopolitical developments could still influence the outcome.

## Conclusion

Based on available evidence and authoritative statements as of May 2025, the most likely defence spending target to be agreed upon at the 2025 NATO summit is **3.5% of GDP**.
