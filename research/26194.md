### Key Factual Information for Forecasting

**1. Historical Trends and Current Status**
- As of July 15, 2024, the CDC reported 167 measles cases in the United States for the year.
- By December 31, 2024, the total number of reported cases had risen to 285, indicating a substantial increase in the second half of the year[1].
- The CDC noted 16 outbreaks (defined as 3 or more related cases) in 2024, with 69% of cases being outbreak-associated, compared to only 4 outbreaks in 2023[1].
- The first quarter of 2024 saw a dramatic rise in cases compared to previous years, with 97 cases reported by March 28, 2024, representing a more than seventeenfold increase over the average for the same period in 2020–2023[2].

**2. Recent Announcements and Policies**
- The CDC and public health experts have expressed concern over the spike in measles cases, warning that it threatens the United States’ measles elimination status[4][5].
- There have been calls for enhanced vaccination efforts, especially in communities with low coverage, and for increased vigilance regarding international travel and outbreak response[2][4].

**3. Authoritative Sources for Verification**
- The CDC’s official measles cases and outbreaks page is the primary source for up-to-date and historical case counts and outbreak information[1].

**4. Limitations and Uncertainties**
- The CDC updates its measles case data biweekly, so there may be a lag between case occurrence and reporting.
- Outbreaks can cause rapid increases in case numbers, making short-term forecasts less certain.
- The final case count for September 30, 2024, will depend on the CDC’s reporting schedule and any delays in case confirmation.

### Conclusion

Given the rapid increase in measles cases during 2024, the high number of outbreaks, and the final annual total of 285 cases, it is highly likely that the number of reported measles cases in the United States exceeded 200 by September 30, 2024[1]. The CDC’s data and outbreak trends strongly support this forecast.
