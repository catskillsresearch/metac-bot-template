### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Zillow’s October 2024 rent report indicates that year-over-year rent growth is slowing nationwide, with Los Angeles expected to see continued high levels of concessions and slow rent growth into November 2024[1].
- Zillow’s 2024 housing market outlook predicts a multi-family construction boom, leading to increased rental supply and more competition among landlords, which typically results in slower rent growth and more concessions for tenants[2].
- Nationally, rent prices rose 3.6% year-over-year as of March 2024, but the trend is toward moderation, with growth returning to pre-pandemic levels and landlords offering more incentives to attract tenants[3].
- In Los Angeles County, median rents had declined 1.5% year-over-year as of September 2023, reflecting increased vacancies and new supply, though rents remained historically high[5].

### Recent Announcements and Policies

- There are no major new policies or announcements reported that would significantly accelerate rent growth in Los Angeles before November 2024.
- The ongoing increase in rental housing supply, especially from new multi-family construction, is expected to continue putting downward pressure on rent growth[2][3].

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The Zillow Observed Rent Index (ZORI) for Los Angeles, CA, available via Zillow’s Housing Data resource page, is the authoritative source for the year-over-year rent change[1].
- The CSV file under "ZORI (Smoothed): All Homes Plus Multifamily Time Series" for "Metro & U.S." geography, with the "Los Angeles, CA" region, will provide the definitive figure for resolution.

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- The actual November 2024 ZORI data will only be available after the cutoff date, so this forecast is based on the most recent available trends and projections.
- Seasonal fluctuations and local market dynamics could cause short-term deviations, but the prevailing trend is toward slower rent growth.
- If the chart and CSV differ, the CSV will be used for resolution.

### Conclusion

Based on the most recent data and forecasts, it is unlikely that the year-over-year increase in rent in Los Angeles, CA for November 2024 will be greater than or equal to 2.0% according to Zillow. The prevailing trend is for slow or flat rent growth due to increased supply and competition among landlords[1][2][3][5].
