## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of 2023, about 500 individuals have been cryonically preserved, mostly in the United States, with the process relying on vitrification to reduce ice formation but still causing significant cellular and structural damage[3][4].
- No person cryonically frozen for more than a few hours has been revived; all successful human resuscitations have occurred after short periods of clinical death (e.g., in hypothermia cases), not after days or years of preservation[3].
- Core challenges remain unsolved: reversing ice and cryoprotectant toxicity, restoring neural integrity, and overcoming legal and ethical barriers regarding resuscitation[4].

## 2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- The cryogenic industry and adjacent fields (regenerative medicine, bioprinting, nanotechnology) are growing, with the global cryogenic market expected to reach $17.4 billion by 2027, reflecting increased investment and technological interest[2].
- Vitrification methods are improving, and research in regenerative medicine and bioprinting offers hypothetical future paths for organ and tissue repair, but these technologies are in nascent stages and are not currently applicable to cryonic resuscitation[4].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Academic and industry sources confirm that, as of 2023, no verified case of full resuscitation of a cryonically frozen individual (meeting the specified criteria) has occurred[1][3][4].
- Expert consensus remains highly skeptical, with most scientists viewing the technical hurdles as currently insurmountable[1][4].

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- Measurement is limited by the lack of experimental evidence for long-term cryonic revival in mammals or humans.
- Uncertainties include unpredictable advances in regenerative medicine, nanotechnology, and neuroscience, as well as possible paradigm shifts in legal or philosophical definitions of resuscitation.
- The forecast relies on speculative, long-term projections; "unknown unknowns" could impact the trajectory in unforeseen ways.

## Probabilistic Assessment (as of September 2023)

Given:
- No successful precedent for revival after long-term cryonic preservation.
- Major unresolved technical obstacles, particularly for neural repair and functional restoration.
- Incremental progress in enabling technologies, but no clear roadmap to practical resuscitation within the next 75 years.
- Expert consensus remains pessimistic.

**Estimated probability of a cryonically frozen individual being resuscitated before 2100 (per resolution criteria):**  
**Extremely low (well below 1%).** This reflects both the scale of the technical obstacles and the lack of short- or medium-term breakthroughs[1][3][4].
