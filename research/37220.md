### Key Factual Information for Forecasting April 2025 NICS Background Checks

**1. Historical Trends and Current Status**
- US firearms background checks surged in 2020, then trended downward through 2023, with 29.9 million checks that year, down from the pandemic peak[5].
- From July 2024, year-over-year monthly checks briefly increased, but this reversed in November and December 2024, with declines of 2.2% and further drops, respectively.
- March 2025 saw a 3.8% month-over-month decline in checks, marking the worst March in five years and falling below several pre-pandemic years[2].
- The first quarter of 2025 had the lowest sales-related checks in five years, indicating a sustained downward trend[2].

**2. Recent Announcements and Policies**
- No significant new federal gun control measures or bans have been enacted as of April 2025.
- Legislative efforts to change NICS reporting for veterans are ongoing but not yet law, so no immediate impact is expected[3].
- Economic factors, including tariffs and general uncertainty, may be dampening consumer demand for firearms[2].
- The political climate, with Donald Trump’s election, appears to have reduced urgency among some buyers, as seen in previous cycles[2].

**3. Authoritative Sources for Verification**
- The FBI’s official NICS statistics are the primary source for monthly background check numbers[5].
- The National Shooting Sports Foundation (NSSF) provides adjusted figures for checks directly related to firearm sales[1][4].

**4. Limitations and Uncertainties**
- NICS checks are not a direct proxy for gun sales, as some checks are for permits or multiple firearms, and some sales may not require a check[5].
- Monthly reporting is generally timely, but delays or revisions can occur.

**Summary Table: Key Data Points**

| Month/Year      | NICS Checks Trend                | Notes                                         |
|-----------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| March 2020      | 2.3 million (record high)        | Pandemic surge[4]                             |
| 2023 (full year)| 29.9 million (down YoY)          | Post-pandemic decline[5]                      |
| July 2024       | +4% YoY (1.06 million adjusted)  | First YoY rise since Dec 2023, still below 2020[4] |
| March 2025      | -3.8% MoM, worst March in 5 years| Sales-related checks down, lowest in 5 years[2] |

**Forecast Implication**
- Given the continued downward trend in early 2025, absence of new motivating policy changes, and historical patterns, it is likely that April 2025 NICS background checks will be slightly lower than March 2025, and well below pandemic-era highs. The number is expected to fall within the lower end of the recent monthly range, likely between 1.8 million and 2.2 million checks.
