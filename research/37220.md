# Forecasting FBI NICS Background Checks for April 2025

Based on available data as of April 28, 2025, here's an analysis to help forecast FBI firearms background checks for April 2025:

## Historical Trends and Current Status

The NICS background check system has shown several notable patterns:

- **Recent Decline**: March 2025 data shows a continuing downward trend in firearms background checks, with numbers falling approximately 3.8% compared to February 2025[2].

- **Multi-year Comparison**: March 2025 was the worst-performing March in the last five years, even falling below several pre-pandemic years[2].

- **First Quarter Performance**: The entire first quarter of 2025 showed the poorest performance in five years for gun-sales-related background checks[2].

- **Consistent Volume**: Despite recent declines, the industry has maintained over one million adjusted background checks per month for an extended period. As of data from 2024, this streak had reached 60 consecutive months (five years)[4].

- **Previous Peaks**: The highest monthly record remains March 2020 with 2.3 million background checks, while 2020 as a whole saw over 21 million checks, surpassing the previous record of 15.7 million in 2016[4].

## Factors Affecting April 2025 Forecast

Several factors may influence April 2025 numbers:

- **Economic Pressures**: The general economy has reportedly taken hits from tariffs, which could affect consumer spending in the firearms industry and lead to continued belt-tightening among potential buyers[2].

- **Political Climate**: President Trump's administration may be reducing the sense of urgency among certain segments of gun buyers who previously purchased firearms due to concerns about potential future restrictions[2].

- **Seasonal Patterns**: Historically, spring months can show different patterns than winter months, though the current downward trend appears to be overriding typical seasonal variations.

- **Legislative Developments**: There are ongoing legislative efforts that could affect specific segments of gun buyers, such as bills aimed at safeguarding gun rights for veterans assigned VA fiduciaries[3].

## Authoritative Sources

The most reliable sources for NICS data include:

- **FBI Official Reports**: The FBI publishes monthly NICS figures that provide the official count of background checks.

- **NSSF Adjusted Figures**: The National Shooting Sports Foundation provides adjusted NICS figures that better reflect actual firearm sales by removing checks conducted for purposes other than sales[2][4].

- **Industry Analysis**: Publications like The Reload provide analysis of trends in the firearms market based on these official figures[2].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors create uncertainty in forecasting April 2025 numbers:

- **Processing Capacity**: The FBI has historically faced challenges in processing the volume of background checks, which can affect reporting accuracy. The bureau received supplemental funding in fiscal year 2021 to address staffing and technology needs, but current capacity status is not clear from available data[5].

- **Reporting Delays**: Background check figures can be subject to reporting delays.

- **External Events**: Unforeseen events in April 2025 could significantly impact firearms sales and associated background checks.

- **Measurement Methodology**: The NSSF adjusts raw FBI numbers to better reflect actual sales by removing administrative checks, but this methodology introduces some variability in reported figures[4].

Given the continuing downward trend observed in the first quarter of 2025 and the economic and political factors at play, April 2025 NICS background checks may continue below previous years' levels unless new factors emerge to drive increased firearms purchases.
