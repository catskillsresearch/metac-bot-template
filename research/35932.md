## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The 45Y Clean Electricity PTC, established by the IRA, offers a tech-neutral, performance-based credit for zero-emission electricity generation and is scheduled to sunset for new projects after 2032, or sooner if U.S. electricity sector GHG emissions drop below 25% of 2022 levels[2][4][5].
- The IRS and Treasury finalized regulations in January 2025, confirming eligibility, bonus adders, and safe harbor provisions for projects begun before any future cutoff[1][4][5].
- Historically, attempts to repeal or accelerate sunset of clean energy tax credits under divided government have failed or resulted only in symbolic votes.

## 2. Recent Announcements and Policies

- As of May 2025, House Republicans have advanced a bill seeking to eliminate the PTC (and ITC) for new renewable projects, while extending a separate credit for nuclear through 2031[3].
- The Senate, also under Republican control, has not yet acted on this bill, and no final repeal or sunset change has been enacted.
- Multiple Republican members, especially those from districts benefitting from clean energy investment and jobs, have advocated for retaining credits like 45Y, signaling divisions within the majority[3].

## 3. Authoritative Verification Sources

- IRS, Treasury, and Federal Register documentation confirm the current status and safe harbor mechanisms[1][2][4][5].
- Congressional tracking and legislative analysis confirm the status of repeal/sunset proposals and internal party disagreements[3].

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- The legislative outcome is uncertain given the slim GOP majorities and internal divisions.
- While a bill to sunset or repeal 45Y has been introduced in the House, Senate action and final passage are not guaranteed.
- Precedent and standard tax policy suggest that, even if a sunset is enacted, a safe harbor for ongoing projects is likely.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

- **No sunset reduction before 2026** remains the most probable outcome, given lack of enacted legislation and internal GOP divisions.
- If legislative action occurs, the most likely scenario is a sunset reduction with safe harbor for ongoing projects (most plausibly in the 2025-2026 window, as per active House proposals).
- A full repeal or abrupt sunset with no safe harbor is highly unlikely based on historical practice and the economic/political risks to affected districts.

## Table: Forecasted Outcomes

| Outcome Option                            | Likelihood (Qualitative)         |
|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| No sunset reduction before 2026           | Most likely                      |
| 2025-2026 sunset w/ safe harbor           | Possible if compromise reached   |
| 2025-2026 sunset w/o safe harbor          | Very unlikely                    |
| 2027-2031 sunset (any)                    | Unlikely before 2026             |
