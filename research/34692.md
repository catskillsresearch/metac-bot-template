## Key Factual Information for Forecasting NOAA's February 2025 Tornado Count

**1. Historical Trends and Current Status**
- As of February 6, 2025, NOAA's Storm Prediction Center reported 41 preliminary tornadoes for February, which is above the 1991-2020 average for the month[1].
- February is typically a low-activity month for tornadoes, but La Niña conditions can increase the likelihood of severe weather and tornado outbreaks, especially in the southern and southeastern U.S.[3].
- The climate outlook for February 2025 favored above-average precipitation in regions prone to severe weather, consistent with La Niña patterns[2].

**2. Recent Announcements or Policies**
- There have been no recent policy changes or announcements that would directly affect tornado reporting or the meteorological risk for February 2025.
- The climate outlooks and storm summaries for February 2025 emphasize a La Niña-like pattern, which historically correlates with increased tornado activity in winter months[2][3].

**3. Authoritative Sources for Verification**
- The official, finalized tornado count for February 2025 will be published by NOAA's Storm Prediction Center on their monthly summary page after March 1, 2025.
- Preliminary and finalized tornado counts can also be found in NOAA's Monthly Climate Reports[1].

**4. Limitations and Uncertainties**
- The preliminary tornado count (41 as of February 6) may change as duplicate reports are removed and additional tornadoes are confirmed or disqualified.
- Tornado occurrence is highly variable and influenced by short-term weather patterns, making precise forecasts challenging[3].
- The ENSO (El Niño/La Niña) signal is strongest in winter, but tornado activity remains "noisier" and harder to predict than temperature or precipitation[3].

**Summary Table: February 2025 Tornado Count Forecast**

| Option         | Rationale                                                                 |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0 to 29        | Unlikely, as preliminary count is already 41[1].                          |
| 30 to 54       | Most likely, given current preliminary count and possible minor revisions. |
| 55 to 79       | Possible only if significant additional tornadoes are confirmed.           |
| 80 and above   | Highly unlikely based on current data.                                     |
