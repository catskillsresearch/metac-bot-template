# Forecasting Analysis: PM Modi's G7 Summit Attendance (June 2025)

Based on the current information as of June 3, 2025, I'll analyze the likelihood of PM Narendra Modi attending the upcoming G7 Summit in Canada.

## Current Status

The G7 Summit is scheduled to take place in Kananaskis, Alberta from June 15-17, 2025, hosted by Canada[2][4]. As of June 3, 2025, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has not received an official invitation to attend this summit[1][2]. This situation is notable because it would mark the first time in six years that India would not be present at the G7 Summit[4].

Multiple sources indicate that even if an invitation were to be extended at this late stage, "the Indian side is not inclined to attend"[4]. India's Ministry of External Affairs has twice stated in recent weeks that it had "no information" on any potential visit by PM Modi to the G7 summit in Canada[4].

## Key Factors Affecting Forecast

### 1. Diplomatic Relations

The primary factor affecting Modi's attendance is the strained bilateral relationship between India and Canada. These tensions stem from:

- Canada's allegations of Indian involvement in the killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a pro-Khalistan separatist leader and Canadian citizen, in June 2023[2][4]
- The subsequent diplomatic fallout, including Canada's expulsion of six Indian diplomats, including the head of mission[2]

According to sources familiar with the matter, "The relationship must improve before any such high-profile visit takes place"[4].

### 2. Invitation Status

With less than two weeks remaining before the summit:
- No formal invitation has been extended to India[1][2]
- Countries like South Africa, Ukraine, and Australia have reportedly already confirmed their participation[4]
- The core G7 participants (US, UK, Germany, France, Italy, Japan, Canada) along with the European Union, IMF, World Bank, and United Nations are expected to attend[4]

### 3. Security Considerations

Sources have flagged security concerns should PM Modi travel to Canada, though specific details were not elaborated upon in the available information[4]. This represents an additional barrier to attendance.

### 4. Political Context

The controversy has drawn domestic political attention in India, with opposition Congress leader Jairam Ramesh characterizing the situation as "another big diplomatic bungle"[3].

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on the available evidence, I assess the probability of PM Modi attending the G7 Summit in June 2025 as **very low** (less than 5%) for the following reasons:

1. The absence of an invitation with less than two weeks remaining before the summit
2. The explicit statement that the Indian side is "not inclined to attend" even if invited
3. The continuing diplomatic tensions between India and Canada
4. Security concerns raised by Indian officials
5. The consistent messaging from India's Ministry of External Affairs indicating no plans for attendance

While Canada's new administration under Mark Carney has signaled interest in rebuilding ties[4], the timeframe before the summit appears too short to resolve the significant diplomatic issues that would enable Modi's attendance.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- Last-minute diplomatic developments could still occur
- The full details of security concerns have not been disclosed
- The precise decision-making process within the Indian government regarding G7 attendance is not fully transparent
- Canada's official stance on why an invitation has not been extended remains unclear

Given the current trajectory and the limited time remaining before the summit, all available evidence points to PM Modi not attending the G7 Summit in Canada this June.
