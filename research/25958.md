# Will Jonas Vingegaard win the Tour de France 2024?

As of July 10, 2024, Jonas Vingegaard's prospects for winning the 2024 Tour de France present a complex picture with mixed expert opinions. As a two-time defending champion, Vingegaard naturally enters the race as one of the top contenders, but several factors complicate his path to a potential third consecutive victory.

## Historical Context and Current Status

Jonas Vingegaard enters the 2024 Tour de France as the winner of the previous two editions, establishing himself as "the best grand tour rider in the sport" according to some cycling experts[4]. His rivalry with Tadej Pogačar has produced some of the most thrilling Tour de France storylines in recent years[4].

However, Vingegaard suffered significant injuries in a crash at the Tour of the Basque Country earlier this season, raising serious questions about his form and readiness for the 2024 Tour[4]. The extent of his recovery and current condition has been a major topic of discussion in the cycling world leading up to the race.

## Competition Analysis

The 2024 Tour de France features an exceptionally strong field of general classification contenders:

- Tadej Pogačar (UAE Team Emirates): Two-time Tour winner himself and Vingegaard's primary rival
- Primož Roglič: Grand Tour veteran with multiple victories
- Remco Evenepoel: Rising star with Grand Tour winning credentials

These four riders collectively "have won nine of the last 12 Grand Tours," making this potentially one of the most competitive Tour de France editions in recent memory[3].

## Team Support Considerations

A critical factor in Vingegaard's chances is the changing composition of his team, Visma-Lease a Bike (formerly Jumbo-Visma). The team has lost key domestiques:

- Primož Roglič has left the team
- Nathan van Hooydonck is no longer with the squad
- Wout van Aert may be fatigued from potentially riding the Giro d'Italia earlier in the season[5]

These personnel changes could significantly impact the team's ability to control the race as they did in previous years when they executed a "Jumbo-Visma lockdown" strategy[5]. While Vingegaard still has strong support from riders like Sepp Kuss, forming "the strongest double-act in the peloton," the overall team strength appears diminished compared to previous years[5].

## Expert Predictions

Cycling analysts and publications offer divergent views on Vingegaard's chances:

Some experts believe Vingegaard "will be surprisingly competitive" despite his earlier injuries, citing his proven abilities in Grand Tours[4].

However, other analysts are less optimistic:
- "I don't think Vingegaard will be much of a factor in this year's Tour" - Bicycling staff member[4]
- "Jonas will not be ready and might not even finish the Tour" - another cycling expert[4]
- "Jonas Vingegaard won't win the Tour de France" - Velo prediction[5]

The skepticism largely stems from the combination of his injury recovery timeline and the strengthening of rival teams, particularly UAE Team Emirates, which is "stinging from two-straight defeats" and highly motivated to reclaim the yellow jersey[5].

## Course Considerations

The 2024 Tour de France presents a challenging route that begins in Florence, Italy (the first time Italy has hosted the start) and features:
- Early Alpine challenges including the Col du Galibier as early as stage four
- The Cime de la Bonette (the highest road in Europe) in the queen stage
- A gravel stage
- Pyrenean mountain stages
- A final mountainous individual time trial from Monaco to Nice (breaking tradition by not finishing in Paris)[3]

This demanding course could either favor a fully-recovered Vingegaard, known for his climbing prowess, or expose any lingering weaknesses from his earlier injuries.

## Conclusion

As of July 10, 2024, Jonas Vingegaard's chances of winning a third consecutive Tour de France appear uncertain. While his proven track record and inherent talent make him a natural contender, his recovery from injuries, combined with a stronger field of rivals and diminished team support, create significant obstacles to overcome. The race itself will ultimately determine whether Vingegaard can join the elite group of cyclists who have won three or more consecutive Tours de France.
