## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Soybeans are a major source of plant-based protein, but remain one of the "big eight" allergens, with significant impact on food allergies and market adoption of soy-based products[2].
- Multiple studies have focused on reducing soy allergenicity using processing methods (heat, pressure, enzymatic hydrolysis, UV) or breeding approaches[3]. These methods can significantly reduce, but not always eliminate, immune reactivity.
- Mutant soy lines have been developed that lack certain allergens (e.g., α-subunit of β-conglycinin, Gly m Bd 28K), and some processing techniques can nearly remove Gly m Bd 30K from soymilk. Preliminary trials show about 80% of soy-allergic patients can tolerate these hypoallergenic products, but not all[4].
- CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing has been applied to specifically knock out allergen genes (Gly m Bd 28K and Bd 30K), with reduced allergen accumulation in seeds. This demonstrates proof-of-principle for genetic de-allergenization, but full-scale, peer-reviewed studies confirming elimination of allergic responses are not yet published as of 2021-2025[5].

## 2. Recent Announcements and Policies

- Advances in gene-editing, particularly CRISPR, have accelerated the pace of research in producing hypoallergenic crops, including soybeans[5].
- No regulatory or policy changes as of 2021-2025 have directly mandated or fast-tracked allergen removal in soy, but there is strong commercial and academic interest due to the potential market and public health benefits.

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Peer-reviewed journals in food science, allergy, and genetic engineering (e.g., ACS Food Science & Technology, Frontiers in Allergy) are tracking progress in this field[4][5].
- Bibliometric analyses show soy allergenicity is a central and expanding focus in food allergy research[3].

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- Most interventions (processing, breeding, gene editing) have so far focused on major allergens but may not eliminate all immune-reactive proteins.
- The resolution criteria require peer-reviewed evidence that the immune response to at least one key protein (Gly m Bd 60K, Bd 30K, or Bd 28K) is eliminated to a tolerable level in large-scale human trials, which is a high bar and not yet met as of 2021-2025.
- Off-target effects, regulatory delays, and the complexity of allergenic responses could slow progress.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

- Given the rapid progress in CRISPR and processing technologies, the proof-of-concept successes, and the strong research focus, it is plausible that a peer-reviewed demonstration of successful de-allergenization (for at least one major allergen) could occur before 2030, especially as preliminary human trials are already showing high rates of tolerability[4][5].
- However, as of 2021-2025, there is no published peer-reviewed evidence meeting the strict resolution criteria, and success in other crops has sometimes taken a decade or more from proof-of-principle to publication and regulatory acceptance.
- Adjusted probability (as of 2025): Moderately likely (estimated 60-70%) that soybeans will be successfully de-allergenized (per criteria) before 2030, with the main uncertainties being the rigor of forthcoming human trials and publication timelines.
