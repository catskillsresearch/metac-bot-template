## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- At the end of Q4 2024, the U.S. Net International Investment Position (NIIP) reached –88% of GDP, continuing a two-decade trend of growing negative balances[3].
- The BEA reports IIP data quarterly; the latest available figure (Q4 2024) was released on March 26, 2025, with the next release for Q1 2025 scheduled for June 30, 2025[1].
- The absolute value of the NIIP at the end of 2024 was estimated at around –$19.7 trillion (based on implied ratios and recent GDP estimates), but the exact dollar figure for Q4 2024 should be verified upon official release[3][1].

## Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Metric

- Trade policy uncertainty remains high. New and proposed tariffs, including a 25% tariff on most goods imported from Canada and Mexico and additional tariffs on Chinese imports, threaten to alter the value of U.S. external assets and liabilities by affecting asset prices and exchange rates[2].
- The baseline economic forecast expects business investment to rise 3.4% in 2025, which may support some increase in U.S. foreign assets, but not enough to reverse the negative NIIP trend[2].
- The BEA’s annual data revision in June 2025 will mostly affect historical data and is not expected to significantly change the Q1 2025 estimate[5].

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the persistent trend and absence of major shocks:

- The U.S. NIIP is expected to remain in the range of –$19.5 to –$20.5 trillion for Q1 2025.
- The most likely outcome is a slight deterioration from Q4 2024, due to continued trade deficits, moderate asset price volatility, and ongoing policy uncertainties.
- Point estimate: –$20.0 trillion (rounded to the nearest 0.1 trillion USD).
- 80% confidence interval: [–19.7, –20.3] trillion USD.

## Key Differences Affecting the Forecast

- New tariffs and trade measures could increase U.S. liabilities or reduce the growth in U.S. assets abroad, but effects are likely to be incremental rather than dramatic in a single quarter[2].
- U.S. equity market outperformance in early 2025 could slightly boost the value of U.S. assets held abroad, but dollar strength and global volatility may offset gains[4].
- No major currency shocks or global crises have been reported as of mid-June 2025.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- Final Q1 2025 NIIP will depend on late-quarter financial market movements and any last-minute policy changes.
- BEA’s annual revisions may slightly alter past data, but the initial Q1 2025 release will be the basis for resolution[5].
- Exchange rate fluctuations and asset price swings can introduce quarterly volatility independent of underlying trade or investment flows.
