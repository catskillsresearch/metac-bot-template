### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The CDC has recommended 0.7 mg/L as the optimal level for community water fluoridation since 2015, based on comprehensive health reviews[1].
- This recommendation is not enforceable law but serves as national public health guidance[2].
- As of May 20, 2025, this recommendation remains public on the CDC’s official website[1].

### Recent Announcements and Policy Developments

- In April 2025, HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced plans to direct the CDC to stop recommending water fluoridation, citing health concerns and political pressure[5].
- This statement has prompted advocacy and reaffirmations of support for fluoridation from professional dental organizations[3][4].
- The EPA is conducting a scientific review, but no updated findings or regulatory changes have been issued as of the last update[5].

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The CDC’s Community Water Fluoridation Recommendations webpage is the primary authority for current U.S. guidance[1].
- Position statements from major dental and scientific organizations, such as AADOCR, provide supporting context[3].
- News coverage and press releases document the announced intent to change policy but do not yet confirm a formal change[4][5].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- The CDC’s recommendation could be changed or removed at any time, especially given explicit direction from HHS leadership and political momentum for review[5].
- The actual process of updating or removing a public health guideline may encounter administrative, legal, or political delays.
- If the CDC’s recommendation page is pulled offline by July 1, 2025, with no replacement, the resolution criteria dictate a “No” outcome.
- Public controversy and ongoing scientific review may further complicate or delay the implementation of changes.

### Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

- As of May 20, 2025, the most likely scenario is that the CDC’s 0.7 mg/L recommendation remains in place, but the probability of a change before July 1, 2025, is notably elevated due to explicit HHS directives and heightened political attention.
- The situation is dynamic; close monitoring of CDC communications and the official recommendation page is warranted through June 2025.
