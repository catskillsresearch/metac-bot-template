## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The Cavendish banana has dominated global banana exports since replacing the Gros Michel after the latter’s collapse due to Panama disease (a Fusarium fungus) in the mid-20th century[1].
- As of 2018, Cavendish remains the primary export banana, and recent market reports project continued growth: estimates suggest the Cavendish market will reach $23.7 billion by 2031, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of about 4.5% from 2025 to 2031[2][5].
- Demand is driven by supply chain improvements, increasing consumption in large emerging economies, and health trends positioning bananas as a staple fruit[2][5].

## Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- A new strain of Fusarium wilt (TR4) threatens Cavendish plantations worldwide, raising concerns about a possible repeat of the Gros Michel collapse[1].
- Efforts to combat TR4 include breeding for disease resistance, gene editing, and improved agricultural practices. However, adoption of genetically modified bananas is complicated by regulatory and consumer resistance in several key markets[1].
- No major producing or importing country has announced a ban or significant restriction on Cavendish imports as of 2018, nor have there been large-scale government-mandated transitions to alternative cultivars.

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Trade and export statistics from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), United Nations Comtrade, and national agricultural ministries.
- Market research from IndustryARC and UnivDatos[2][4][5].
- Expert commentary and disease surveillance from academic journals, banana industry groups, and organizations such as Bioversity International.

## Limitations and Uncertainties in Measurement

- Export data may not perfectly distinguish between classic Cavendish and gene-edited or conventionally bred variants that fall within the Cavendish subgroup, per the resolution criteria[1].
- Data reporting lags and lack of cultivar-specific breakdowns in some national export statistics could delay recognition of significant market shifts.
- The trajectory of TR4’s spread and the development or adoption of resistant cultivars (including GMOs) are highly uncertain and will critically affect future forecasts.

## Key Differences Affecting the Forecast

- Unlike the Gros Michel, where no replacement was immediately available, significant resources are being devoted to developing TR4-resistant bananas—though adoption is uncertain[1].
- The Cavendish’s global market entrenchment and robust supply chains make a swift collapse less likely barring an accelerated, pandemic-scale spread of TR4.
- Increased demand from emerging markets may offset some regional production losses, prolonging Cavendish dominance even if certain areas are devastated.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the current dominance of the Cavendish, the slow pace of cultivar replacement, the lack of widespread adoption of alternatives, and the robust projected growth through at least 2031, it is unlikely—though not impossible—that the Cavendish’s share of global banana exports will drop below 50% before 2035. The major wildcards remain the speed of TR4’s spread and the regulatory/social acceptance of genetically modified or new resistant cultivars. As of 2018, the probability that Cavendish will account for less than 50% of global banana exports in any year before 2035 appears low, likely below 20%, unless there is an unforeseen acceleration in disease impact or market transition.
