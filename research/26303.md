# Forecasting Major LLM-Powered Cyberattacks Before September 30, 2024

As of May 2025, there is significant evidence suggesting that Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being weaponized for cyberattacks, creating a new frontier in cybersecurity threats. This analysis examines the current landscape and trends to help forecast whether a major LLM-powered cyberattack meeting the specified criteria will occur before September 30, 2024.

## Current Threat Landscape

### Emergence of AI-Powered Attack Tools

Security researchers have already identified malicious versions of ChatGPT, such as WormGPT, circulating on the dark web in 2023. These tools represent two concerning trends: the development of new malicious LLMs without built-in ethical restraints and their emerging use in threat campaigns[1]. Unlike legitimate AI platforms, these malicious variants are specifically designed to assist in cyberattacks without the ethical guardrails implemented in mainstream models.

### Lowering the Barrier to Advanced Attacks

One of the most significant developments is how LLMs are democratizing access to sophisticated attack techniques. Security experts note that LLMs have "the potential to significantly lower the entry barrier for such attacks, making them accessible to a broader range of threat actors"[4]. This not only expands the pool of potential attackers but also enables already capable threat actors to execute sophisticated attacks more frequently.

A particularly concerning trend is the rise of "script kiddies" utilizing LLMs to craft complex exploit scripts. These individuals, who traditionally had limited hacking skills, are now empowered to execute advanced cyber attacks by simply inputting basic prompts into LLMs to generate intricate code that would have previously required deep technical knowledge[2].

## Predicted Attack Vectors for 2024

### Prompt Injection Techniques

Attackers are developing sophisticated prompt injection techniques to manipulate LLMs into bypassing their built-in safeguards. By cleverly crafting prompts, they can deceive these models into producing exploit codes or attack strategies that align with malicious intents[2]. This technique effectively turns the AI systems against themselves and their security protocols.

### Business Email Compromise (BEC) Escalation

Security researchers anticipate a surge in Business Email Compromise attacks targeting companies of all sizes, including small businesses[4]. With LLMs' ability to generate convincing content that mimics legitimate business communications, these attacks are becoming more sophisticated and harder to detect. The potential financial impact of successful BEC attacks against large corporations could easily exceed the $10 million damage threshold specified in the question.

### AI-Enhanced Social Engineering

Experts predict that 2024 will see generative AI significantly enhancing social engineering attacks. As one source notes, "phishing emails created using the technology are more convincing than those full of typos and grammatical errors," and "profile images created in image synthesizers are increasingly hard to tell apart from the real thing"[3]. These technologies enable cybercriminals to create highly convincing personas and extend their reach through multiple communication channels.

## Critical Infrastructure Vulnerabilities

The potential for LLM-powered attacks against critical infrastructure is particularly concerning. Security experts have highlighted that 2024 is an election year in the United States, making it "a strategic imperative to ensure the resilience of critical infrastructure against AI-powered misinformation and other elusive attacks"[1]. 

While predictions about critical infrastructure vulnerabilities resurface annually, the integration of LLMs into attack methodologies creates new vectors that could potentially disrupt medical facilities, government operations, or large corporationsâ€”all scenarios that would meet the resolution criteria for this question[4].

## Likelihood Assessment

Based on the available evidence, there are several factors suggesting an increased likelihood of a major LLM-powered cyberattack before September 30, 2024:

1. The tools (malicious LLMs) already exist and are being refined
2. The barrier to sophisticated attacks has been significantly lowered
3. Critical infrastructure and high-value targets remain vulnerable
4. The economic incentives for attackers are substantial

However, there are also mitigating factors:

1. Organizations are increasingly aware of these threats and implementing countermeasures
2. Security vendors are developing AI-powered defenses to combat AI-powered attacks
3. The most sophisticated attacks still require significant planning and resources

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several limitations affect this forecast:

1. Attribution challenges: Determining whether an attack specifically used LLMs may be difficult unless attackers explicitly claim this methodology
2. Reporting delays: Major attacks might occur but not be publicly disclosed until after the resolution date
3. Damage assessment: Quantifying whether an attack caused exactly $10 million in damages involves subjective assessments and may not be immediately clear

## Conclusion

While the technology and motivation for major LLM-powered cyberattacks clearly exist, and security experts broadly predict their occurrence, forecasting a specific attack meeting the defined criteria before September 30, 2024, involves significant uncertainty. The trends indicate an increasing probability of such an event, but the specific timing and impact remain difficult to predict with high confidence.

Organizations should prepare for this emerging threat landscape by implementing consolidated security strategies[2], enhancing employee training specifically for AI-powered social engineering[1], and leveraging AI-powered security tools to defend against AI-powered attacks.
