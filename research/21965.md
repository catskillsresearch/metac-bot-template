## Forecast Analysis of Bryan Caplan's Bet on Global Temperature Rise (2015-2029)

### 1. Historical Trends Relevant to the Bet

- From 1850 onwards, Earth’s global temperature has risen about 0.06°C per decade on average[1][2].
- The period 1998-2013 experienced a "pause" or hiatus in warming with a low rate of about 0.04°C per decade, which was anomalously low compared to previous decades.
- However, starting in 2015, global temperatures have set new records each year, with 2015–2024 identified as the warmest decade on record.
- The year 2024 alone was about 1.55°C warmer than the 1850-1900 baseline — the highest since records began[4][5].
- Recent warming rates have accelerated, with a remarkable 0.6°C increase in land-average temperatures just from 2022 to 2024[3].

### 2. Key Differences Affecting the Forecast

- The earlier "pause" period is no longer evident; warming has resumed strongly since 2015.
- Climate models and observational data show sustained warming driven by continued greenhouse gas emissions.
- The decade 2015-2024’s record warmth contrasts sharply with the slower warming of 1998-2013.
- Ocean heat content, sea-level rise, and cryosphere melt trends further confirm ongoing warming.
- The WMO states that the Paris Agreement temperature goals are in grave danger due to current trends[4][5].

### 3. Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

- Given the consistent record-breaking warmth from 2015 through 2024, the probability that the 2015-2029 average temperature increase relative to 2000-2014 will be ≤ 0.05°C is extremely low.
- The data suggests a high likelihood (>90%) that the warming will exceed 0.05°C over this period.
- Thus, Bryan Caplan is very unlikely to win his bet based on current authoritative temperature data and climate science consensus.

### 4. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- NOAA Global Climate Time Series (ncdc.noaa.gov/cag/time-series)
- World Meteorological Organization (WMO) State of the Global Climate 2024 report[5]
- NASA Global Temperature Vital Signs[2]
- Berkeley Earth Global Temperature Reports[3]

### 5. Limitations and Uncertainties

- Measurement uncertainties exist but are relatively small (e.g., ±0.13°C in 2024 estimates).
- Climate variability (e.g., El Niño/La Niña) can cause short-term fluctuations.
- The bet’s outcome depends on NOAA’s chosen dataset and methodology.
- Future policy changes or unforeseen climate feedbacks could affect warming trajectory but are unlikely to reverse current trends substantially within the bet timeframe.

---

In conclusion, the evidence as of early 2025 strongly indicates that global warming since 2015 has been significant and accelerating, far surpassing the minimal threshold of 0.05°C over the 15-year period. Bryan Caplan’s bet that warming would remain minimal is thus forecasted to be lost.
