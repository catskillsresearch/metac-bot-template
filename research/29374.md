# Ohio Issue 1 (2024): Redistricting Amendment Analysis

Ohio Issue 1 on the November 2024 ballot proposes a significant change to how the state draws its legislative and congressional districts. This analysis examines the available information to help forecast whether voters will approve this anti-gerrymandering measure.

## Background and Current Status

Ohio Issue 1 seeks to create an independent citizen commission for redistricting, removing elected officials from the process of drawing legislative and congressional district maps[2][3]. This constitutional amendment would replace the current system where a panel of elected officials, including the governor, secretary of state, and appointees of legislative leaders, controls redistricting[3].

The proposal comes after significant controversy with Ohio's current redistricting process:

- Redistricting experts have identified Ohio's maps as among the most gerrymandered in the nation[2]
- In 2021-2022, the Ohio Supreme Court struck down Republican-drawn maps seven separate times for being unconstitutionally gerrymandered[2][3][4]
- Despite these court rulings, Republican leaders effectively ignored them by running out the clock until a more conservative court was seated after the 2022 midterms[3]

## Support and Opposition

### Support for Issue 1

The amendment is backed by a coalition called "Citizens Not Politicians" and has garnered bipartisan support[4][5]. Notable supporters include:

- Maureen O'Connor, former Chief Justice of the Ohio Supreme Court (a Republican), who helped write the ballot amendment[4]
- Labor organizations including OCSEA, AFSCME, and the Ohio AFL-CIO[4]

Supporters argue that the amendment would:
- End gerrymandering by removing politicians from the redistricting process[4]
- Create a more fair system that better reflects voters' will[3]
- Establish more stringent fairness criteria for the new commission to follow[3]

### Opposition to Issue 1

Opposition is primarily led by Republican elected officials and a group called "Ohio Works"[2]. Their arguments include:

- Claiming the amendment is a "power grab by Democrats"[2]
- Asserting that progress has already been made with the current system[2]
- Suggesting that the proposal throws away existing progress in redistricting reform[2]

## Ballot Language Controversy

A significant factor that may influence the outcome is controversy over the ballot language itself:

- The ballot language was written by Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose and approved by the Republican-controlled Ohio Ballot Board in a party-line vote[5]
- Citizens Not Politicians announced plans to file suit with the Ohio Supreme Court over this language, with their attorney calling it "dishonest" and "blatantly illegal"[5]
- Some voters have reported confusion, claiming the GOP-crafted ballot summary misled them into opposing a reform they actually support[3]

## Uncertainties and Limitations

Several factors create uncertainty in forecasting the outcome:

1. The impact of potentially misleading ballot language on voter understanding
2. The effectiveness of campaigns for and against the measure
3. Voter turnout patterns in the November 2024 election
4. The degree to which voters understand the technical aspects of redistricting

## Conclusion

Ohio Issue 1 represents a significant potential change to Ohio's redistricting process. While it has bipartisan support including from prominent Republicans like former Chief Justice O'Connor, it faces organized opposition from current Republican officials who benefit from the existing system. The controversy over ballot language adds another layer of uncertainty to predicting voter approval.

The outcome will likely depend on voters' understanding of the issue despite potentially confusing ballot language, as well as the effectiveness of campaign messaging from both sides in the final days before the election.
