### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of February 2021, Robin Hanson, Daniel Martin, Calvin McCarter, and Jonathan Paulson's "grabby aliens" model provides the most detailed quantitative forecast for when humanity's descendants might physically encounter "grabby" civilizationsâ€”defined as those consuming at least \(10^{26}\) watts, or Kardashev Type II[1].
- The model is based on three key parameters (expansion speed, appearance rate, and time to become grabby) and leverages the "hard steps" approach to the evolution of intelligent life[1].
- According to the paper, if we are close to becoming grabby ourselves, then the current epoch is near the median origin date for such civilizations, due to selection effects[1].
- Figure 8 of the paper presents cumulative probability distributions for the time until encounter, showing that, under central parameter estimates, there is a roughly 50% chance that humanity's descendants will meet grabby aliens within the next 10^8 (100 million) years[1].

### Recent Announcements or Policies

- No significant new scientific announcements or policy decisions as of February 2021 alter the core astrophysical or technological assumptions underlying Hanson's model.

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The primary source is the original 2021 Hanson et al. arXiv paper, which details the model and its parameter choices[1].
- Scott Aaronson's popular summary provides a clear qualitative explanation of the model's reasoning and implications[2].
- The Kardashev scale is the widely accepted framework for classifying advanced civilizations by energy consumption[3].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- The model's parameters (such as the rate at which grabby civilizations appear and their expansion speed) are only known to within a factor of four, so the forecast carries substantial uncertainty[1].
- The resolution of the question is contingent on humanity's survival; if humanity goes extinct before meeting grabby aliens, the answer is ">10^16" years.
- The definition of "meeting" is strictly physical proximity (within 1 light year), not mere detection at a distance.
- The model does not account for unknown unknowns in astrophysics, the behavior of advanced civilizations, or future technological developments.

### Summary Table: Model Forecast

| Probability | Years from 2021 (approximate, from Figure 8) |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------|
| 10%         | ~10 million                                 |
| 50%         | ~100 million                                |
| 90%         | ~1 billion                                  |

Most likely, according to the model, humanity's descendants will encounter grabby aliens in roughly 100 million years, but the uncertainty spans at least an order of magnitude in both directions[1][2].
