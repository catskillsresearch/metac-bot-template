## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Bitcoin ended 2024 up approximately 125%, starting 2025 at $93,429.20.
- As of May 2025, Bitcoin is trading above $100,000, with technical momentum indicators remaining bullish and forecasts suggesting continued strength as long as $100K is maintained as support[5].
- Analyst projections for year-end 2025 vary, but most cluster in the $100,000–$200,000 range, with some bullish outliers predicting $250,000 or higher. The consensus expects Bitcoin to remain above its opening 2025 price barring a major negative event[1][2][5].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- The Trump administration has issued an executive order to promote digital assets and clarify regulations, aiming to make the US a global leader in crypto technology. This is widely perceived as supportive for digital asset prices, including Bitcoin.
- Increased institutional adoption through spot Bitcoin ETFs and growing acceptance among mainstream finance provide additional tailwinds[1].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The official closing price for Bitcoin on December 31, 2025, will be available on CoinMarketCap, with CoinGecko as a backup source if necessary.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- Bitcoin’s price is historically volatile and susceptible to large corrections, especially during periods of broader market stress or adverse regulatory developments outside the US.
- Predictive models may not fully account for black swan events or sudden shifts in investor sentiment.
- While the pro-crypto US policy stance is a key positive, regulatory or policy changes elsewhere could introduce negative shocks.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Based on current price levels, prevailing momentum, pro-crypto policy developments, and the majority of analyst forecasts, the probability that Bitcoin will close 2025 above $93,429.20 appears high—likely in the 70–85% range. The main risks to this forecast remain sudden global macroeconomic shocks or unforeseen negative regulatory actions.
