# Forecast: Fentanyl Citrate Injection Shortage Status on April 1, 2025

Based on available information as of February 20, 2025, I've analyzed the likelihood of Fentanyl Citrate injections being in shortage according to the FDA on April 1, 2025.

## Current Status and Historical Trends

As of the latest available data, Fentanyl Citrate injections are currently listed on the FDA's drug shortage database. According to the current drug shortages list, Fentanyl Citrate Injection is expected to remain in shortage until at least April 28, 2025[3]. This strongly suggests that the shortage will still be active on April 1, 2025.

The shortage of injectable opioids, including Fentanyl Citrate, has been an ongoing issue. As of November 1, 2024, pain treatments including injectable opioids like fentanyl citrate were confirmed to be facing shortages[5]. This indicates that the shortage has persisted for several months.

## Recent Announcements and Policies

While there are no specific announcements directly addressing the Fentanyl Citrate shortage resolution timeline, the FDA has been actively working on broader drug shortage issues:

1. The FDA has been monitoring and updating its Drug Shortages Database regularly, with several medications having projected shortage end dates extending into 2025[2][3].

2. In response to Hurricane Helene's impact on Baxter's North Carolina manufacturing facility in late 2024, the FDA implemented measures to address various IV solution shortages, including temporarily importing products and expediting reviews of restored manufacturing lines[1]. While this doesn't directly mention Fentanyl Citrate, it demonstrates the FDA's ongoing efforts to address drug shortages.

3. For certain critical shortages, the FDA has released guidance allowing temporary flexibility for compounding drugs without patient-specific prescriptions[5]. This indicates the seriousness with which the FDA is treating current drug shortages.

## Authoritative Sources

The primary authoritative sources for drug shortage information include:

1. FDA Drug Shortages Database - The official source for current drug shortage information maintained by the FDA.

2. ASHP (American Society of Health-System Pharmacists) Drug Shortages List - Provides comprehensive information on current drug shortages[2].

3. Drugs.com Drug Shortages List - Aggregates and presents drug shortage information in an accessible format[3].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors could affect the accuracy of this forecast:

1. The FDA may update its shortage list between now and April 1, 2025, if manufacturing capacity increases or alternative suppliers emerge.

2. The information available doesn't provide detailed reasons for the Fentanyl Citrate shortage or specific manufacturer plans for resolution.

3. Unexpected events (such as natural disasters or manufacturing issues) could either exacerbate or help resolve the shortage before April 1, 2025.

4. The FDA's criteria for declaring a shortage "resolved" requires that supply meets demand consistently, which may take longer than anticipated even if production increases[5].

Based on the current projected shortage end date of April 28, 2025, and the absence of any information indicating earlier resolution, it appears highly likely that Fentanyl Citrate injections will still be listed as in shortage by the FDA on April 1, 2025.
