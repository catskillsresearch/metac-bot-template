# Forecasting FAA Unruly Passenger Incidents for March 23, 2025

To forecast the number of reported incidents of unruly passengers per 10,000 flights for the week of March 23, 2025, I'll analyze historical trends, current status, and relevant policies that might influence this metric.

## Historical Trends and Current Status

The data shows a clear pattern in unruly passenger incidents over recent years:

- 2017: 544 incidents
- 2018: 889 incidents
- 2019: 1,161 incidents
- 2020: 1,009 incidents
- 2021: 5,973 incidents (dramatic spike)
- 2022: 2,455 incidents
- 2023: 2,076 incidents
- 2024: 2,102 incidents[4]

This data reveals a significant spike in 2021 followed by a substantial decrease in subsequent years, though the numbers remained higher than pre-pandemic levels. The year 2024 showed a slight increase from 2023, with 2,102 reported incidents[4].

For 2024, more granular data shows:
- 915 cases from January 1 to June 9, 2024 (including 106 cases due to intoxication)[1]
- More than 1,240 cases reported by August 21, 2024[2]

While these figures provide absolute numbers, the search results don't specify the rate per 10,000 flights, which is the metric requested for forecasting.

## Recent Policies and Enforcement Actions

Several policy measures have been implemented that may affect future incident rates:

1. **Zero-Tolerance Policy**: Implemented on January 13, 2021, this policy issues fines instead of warning letters or counseling for unruly behavior[1].

2. **Increased Penalties**: The FAA can propose civil penalties up to $37,000 per violation for passengers who assault, threaten, intimidate, or interfere with airline crew members[1][2].

3. **FBI Referrals**: The FAA has referred over 310 of the most serious cases to the FBI since late 2021, with 43 more cases referred during 2023-2024[2]. This partnership aims to ensure criminal prosecution when warranted.

4. **TSA Collaboration**: The Transportation Security Administration is working alongside the FAA with zero tolerance measures and can revoke a passenger's PreCheck privileges or place them on a no-fly list[5].

These enforcement actions have contributed to an 80% reduction in the rate of unruly passenger incidents since the peak in early 2021[2]. However, reports indicate that unacceptable behavior continues and is "increasingly aggressive and of a physical nature"[5].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors limit the precision of any forecast:

1. The available data doesn't provide the specific metric of incidents per 10,000 flights, only absolute numbers.

2. There's no clear information on seasonal variations, though summer travel is mentioned as a period when incidents may increase[1].

3. The search results don't provide data on total flight numbers, making it impossible to calculate historical rates per 10,000 flights.

4. While we know that 512 investigations were initiated in 2024 (about 24% of total incidents)[4], this doesn't directly translate to the rate per 10,000 flights.

## Conclusion

Based on the available data, we can observe that unruly passenger incidents have stabilized at around 2,000-2,100 per year since 2023, which is significantly lower than the 2021 peak but still higher than pre-pandemic levels. The effectiveness of the zero-tolerance policy and increased enforcement actions suggests a continued downward pressure on incident rates, but the slight increase from 2023 to 2024 indicates this trend may have plateaued.

Without specific data on the rate per 10,000 flights or seasonal patterns, it's difficult to make a precise forecast for the week of March 23, 2025. The FAA's unruly passenger website would be the authoritative source for this specific metric when it becomes available.
