# Will SpaceX Attempt to Catch a Starship Booster with the Tower Before September 30, 2024?

Based on available information as of July 15, 2024, there are strong indications that SpaceX will attempt to catch a Starship Super Heavy booster with the tower (nicknamed "Mechazilla") before September 30, 2024. Here's a comprehensive analysis of the relevant factors:

## Current Status and Timeline

SpaceX has been making significant progress toward attempting a booster catch with the tower arms (nicknamed "chopsticks"). Following the successful Flight 4 mission where both the Starship and Super Heavy booster achieved controlled ocean landings, Elon Musk explicitly stated his intention to attempt a booster catch on the next flight: "I think we should try to catch the booster with the mechazilla arms next flight!"[4]

As of June 18, 2024, Musk indicated that SpaceX is targeting a Starship launch with a tower booster catch in approximately 4-6 weeks[3]. This timeline would place the potential catch attempt in late July or early August 2024, well before the September 30 deadline.

Supporting this timeline, SpaceX has a reservation for its WB-57 aircraft (used to monitor and capture imagery of Starship launches) from July 21st to 28th, 2024, suggesting a late July launch window unless there are unforeseen delays[1].

## Technical Preparations and Testing

SpaceX has been actively conducting tests specifically designed to prepare for a booster catch:

1. **Catch Practice Tests**: On June 26, 2024, SpaceX conducted a booster catch practice test to ensure the success and reliability of recovering the Flight 5 booster[1].

2. **Controlled Impact Testing**: Engineers have performed multiple controlled impact tests with the tower arms and a test tank, with each cycle lasting about 3-5 seconds. These tests help fine-tune the arms' movements and enhance the precision of the catch mechanism[1].

3. **Booster Test Section**: A Super Heavy booster test section (designated Booster 14.1) has been moved to the orbital launch pad, likely for testing with the "chopstick" arms before any actual catch attempt[2].

4. **Infrastructure Upgrades**: Teams have been repairing, fixing, and upgrading the launch mount and other launchpad infrastructure to prepare for Flight 5. The launch tower arms have undergone minor repairs and fixes to ensure they remain in optimal condition for both stacking the launch vehicles and for the booster catch operation[1].

## Official Documentation and Statements

An FCC filing provides further evidence of catch attempt plans, indicating that "the first stage booster will either return to the launch site or perform a controlled water landing during Flight 5"[1][2]. This dual-option approach suggests SpaceX is preparing for a tower catch while maintaining a backup plan for ocean landing if needed.

Musk has previously estimated a 50% chance of successfully catching the booster during Flight 5[1], acknowledging the technical challenges while demonstrating confidence in attempting the maneuver.

## Technical Improvements

SpaceX has implemented several technical improvements to increase the likelihood of a successful catch:

1. **Enhanced Roll Control**: Additional roll control thrusters have been added to upcoming Starships to improve attitude control redundancy[4].

2. **Upgraded Filtration**: Super Heavy boosters for Flight 5 and beyond have received additional hardware inside oxygen tanks to improve propellant filtration capabilities, addressing issues that caused engine shutdowns during previous flights[4].

3. **Arm Movement Refinement**: Previous trials revealed that the tower arms struggled to halt without excessive swinging due to their significant inertia, especially when moving at high speeds. The recent impact tests are helping engineers fine-tune the arms' movements for a more precise catch[1].

## Uncertainties and Limitations

Despite the positive indicators, several factors could affect the timeline or decision to attempt a catch:

1. **Technical Challenges**: The complexity of precisely catching a massive booster returning from space presents unprecedented engineering challenges.

2. **Weather Conditions**: Launch and landing operations are dependent on favorable weather conditions, which could cause delays.

3. **Regulatory Approvals**: Any changes to flight plans would require updated regulatory approvals.

4. **Contingency Planning**: The FCC filing indicates SpaceX is maintaining the option for a controlled water landing as an alternative to the tower catch[1][2], suggesting they may redirect the booster for an ocean landing if issues arise during flight.

## Conclusion

Based on the available evidence, SpaceX appears to be on track to attempt catching a Starship Super Heavy booster with the tower before September 30, 2024. The company has conducted specific tests for this purpose, made necessary technical improvements, and publicly stated intentions to attempt the catch on Flight 5, which is scheduled for late July or early August 2024. While success is not guaranteed (Musk himself estimated a 50% chance), the attempt itself seems highly likely to occur before the specified deadline.
