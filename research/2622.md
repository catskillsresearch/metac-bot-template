### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- From 1948 to 2018, US annual GDP growth averaged about 3.2%, with an all-time high of 7.3% in 1984.
- In the late 2010s, growth rates were moderate, e.g., 3% in Q3 2018.
- The COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 triggered a severe recession, resulting in a sharp contraction in GDP.

### Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Metric

- In response to the pandemic, the US government passed large fiscal stimulus packages, such as the CARES Act, aimed at supporting households and businesses.
- The Federal Reserve adopted highly accommodative monetary policy, cutting interest rates and launching asset purchase programs.
- These measures set the stage for a strong rebound once pandemic restrictions eased, with many forecasters in mid-2020 predicting a sharp GDP recovery in 2021 due to the "low base effect" from the 2020 downturn[3].

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS): Projected an average annual GDP growth rate of 2.3% from 2020–2030, noting potential for a higher-than-average rebound year following the pandemic[3].
- Statista: Provides annual projections through 2030, generally showing moderate annual growth after the post-pandemic recovery, with no year expected to match or exceed the 1984 record[2].
- Trading Economics: Expected growth to return to around 2% in the mid-2020s, emphasizing a strong but temporary post-pandemic rebound[5].

### Key Differences Affecting the Forecast

- The pandemic-induced recession created an unprecedentedly low starting point for 2021, increasing the likelihood of an unusually high growth rate that year compared to normal business cycles.
- Unlike previous recoveries, the scale of fiscal and monetary intervention in 2020 was historically large.
- However, structural factors—such as slower labor force growth and productivity—were expected to limit sustained high growth in subsequent years.

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- Mid-2020 forecasts were marked by high uncertainty due to the unpredictable duration of the pandemic, pace of reopening, and risk of subsequent infection waves.
- Measurement of GDP growth, particularly in extreme economic conditions, can be subject to substantial revisions.
- The final annual growth figure for 2021 (or any year) would depend on the precise timing of economic recovery and policy responses.

### Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

- The most likely outcome, as assessed in July 2020, was that the highest annual US GDP growth rate before 2030 would occur in 2021, driven by the recovery from the pandemic recession.
- Probabilistically, a single-year real GDP growth rate in the range of 5% to 7% was plausible for 2021, though exceeding the 1984 record of 7.3% was considered unlikely.
- For the remainder of the decade after the rebound, annual growth rates were expected to normalize to the 2%–3% range[3][2][5].
