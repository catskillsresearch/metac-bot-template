### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Keir Starmer's approval and favourability ratings rose immediately after Labour's July 2024 landslide, with YouGov recording an eight-point jump to 44% favourability in early July[2].
- By early August 2024, Starmer's favourability had dropped to 40%, with net favourability falling from ±0 to -9, indicating the post-election "honeymoon" was short-lived and his ratings had returned to pre-election levels[1][2].
- Ipsos polling from mid-July 2024 found 36% of Britons thought Starmer was doing a good job as Prime Minister, the highest such figure since early 2021, but still below 40%[5].

### Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- No major new policies or announcements are cited in the available sources that would be expected to significantly boost Starmer's approval in the short term.
- The political context includes Labour's robust parliamentary majority, but also historically low turnout and a fragmented vote, with the emergence of Reform UK as a significant force, potentially limiting Starmer's public mandate and approval ceiling[2].

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The Politico Poll of Polls aggregates data from major UK pollsters and is the specified source for the resolution of this question.
- YouGov and Ipsos are leading polling organizations whose recent data show Starmer's approval/favourability at or below 40% as of early August 2024[1][2][5].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- Polling data can fluctuate due to unforeseen events, policy announcements, or external shocks.
- The "Smooth" version of the Politico Poll of Polls is required for resolution; if this is unavailable, the question is annulled.
- Approval and favourability are not always measured identically; however, both YouGov and Ipsos data suggest Starmer's approval is at or below 40% as of early August 2024[1][2][5].
- The trend as of August 2024 is downward, but a reversal is possible if significant positive developments occur.

### Conclusion

Based on available data as of August 16, 2024, Keir Starmer's approval rating is at or just below 40% and trending downward. Unless there is a notable positive shift, it is likely—but not certain—that his approval rating will be less than 40 on September 18, 2024, as measured by the Politico Poll of Polls.
