## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- In 2020, the Abraham Accords saw the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Morocco normalize relations with Israel, driven by shared concerns over Iran, economic interests, and U.S. mediation[4].
- Saudi Arabia has participated in discreet cooperation with Israel, especially on intelligence and security, but has not extended formal recognition.
- As of 2025, normalization negotiations have advanced but remain stalled; Saudi leaders have set a high bar, insisting on significant progress toward Palestinian statehood as a precondition for recognition[1][3].
- The October 2023 Hamas-Israel conflict has increased regional volatility, raising the political cost for Saudi Arabia to normalize without meaningful concessions for Palestinians[5].

## 2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has reiterated that normalization with Israel requires movement toward a Palestinian state[3].
- Negotiations reportedly centered on a “mega-deal” involving U.S. defense guarantees, civil nuclear cooperation, technology access, and a “credible pathway” to Palestinian statehood[2][3].
- The U.S. remains keen on brokering normalization, but the required domestic reforms in Israel and consensus within Saudi Arabia present significant obstacles[1][2].
- Both Saudi and Israeli governments see strategic and economic gains from normalization, but domestic legitimacy and regional leadership concerns weigh heavily for the Saudis[3][5].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The Atlantic Council and the Cairo Review provide recent, in-depth analysis of Saudi-Israeli normalization prospects[1][5].
- War on the Rocks and other policy think tanks discuss the evolving Saudi calculus and demands[2][3].
- Wikipedia and major newswire services (Reuters, France24) document milestones in regional normalization and the Abraham Accords[4].

## 4. Limitations or Uncertainties in Measurement

- The probability of normalization is highly sensitive to unpredictable regional developments, such as renewed Israeli-Palestinian violence or shifts in U.S. foreign policy[5].
- Saudi domestic politics, including the succession and internal opposition, could delay or accelerate normalization[3].
- The definition of “credible progress” toward Palestinian statehood is ambiguous and open to interpretation by the parties and international community[3].
- Shifts in Israeli politics, especially regarding willingness to compromise on the Palestinian issue, remain uncertain.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given these factors, the probability that Saudi Arabia will normalize relations with Israel by 2031—assuming Iran does not obtain a nuclear weapon—remains plausible but below 50%. The most likely scenario is conditional progress: if a new U.S.-brokered deal can satisfy Saudi demands on security and Palestinian statehood, normalization could occur. However, absent clear movement on these fronts, delays are likely. An estimated probability in the range of 30–45% reflects these mixed incentives and significant hurdles.
