# SpinLaunch Orbital Launch Capability by 2032: A Probabilistic Assessment

As of August 17, 2022, SpinLaunch represents one of the most ambitious and unconventional approaches to reducing the cost of access to space. Their kinetic launch system aims to dramatically reduce the reliance on rocket propellants by using a ground-based electric accelerator to achieve most of the velocity needed to reach orbit.

## Current Status and Progress

SpinLaunch has developed a Suborbital Accelerator as a technology demonstrator and test platform. This system consists of a vacuum chamber approximately 108 feet (33 meters) in diameter capable of spinning payloads to speeds up to 8,000 km/h (5,000 mph)[3]. The company has conducted multiple test flights with this system, subjecting test vehicles to forces up to 10,000 Gs during acceleration phases lasting up to 30 minutes[3].

On October 22, 2021, SpinLaunch reported its first successful launch, which propelled a test vehicle at supersonic speeds and included recovery of the reusable flight vehicle[5]. This marked a significant milestone in demonstrating the basic feasibility of the kinetic launch approach.

It's important to note that the current Suborbital Accelerator is designed primarily as a test platform and cannot actually place payloads into orbit[5]. The company's roadmap includes developing a much larger Orbital Accelerator that would be capable of accelerating a 200 kg class satellite to the velocities required for orbital insertion with minimal use of rocket propellants.

## Technical Challenges

The engineering challenges facing SpinLaunch are unprecedented and formidable:

1. **Materials science limitations**: The rotating arm must withstand 10,000 Gs of force across a 45-foot span, pushing the boundaries of current composite materials technology.

2. **Vacuum maintenance**: The system requires operating in a vacuum to prevent catastrophic damage from air friction, with a launch tube that must seal nearly instantaneously upon payload release.

3. **Atmospheric transition**: Once released at hypersonic speeds, the payload must survive the extreme thermal and aerodynamic stresses of atmospheric transition.

4. **Precision release mechanics**: The timing and angle of payload release must be extraordinarily precise to achieve the intended trajectory.

5. **Orbital insertion**: Even after the kinetic launch, a rocket stage is still required to perform final orbital insertion, which introduces additional complexity.

## Expert Assessments

Technical experts have expressed varying degrees of skepticism about SpinLaunch's approach:

- Critics like Scott Manley and Thunderf00t have raised fundamental concerns about the physical and material science limitations of the system, questioning whether the approach is viable at all given current technology.

- Real Engineering has offered a more optimistic assessment, acknowledging the challenges but suggesting they might be surmountable.

The lack of peer-reviewed technical publications from SpinLaunch makes independent assessment difficult, but the successful demonstration flights suggest at least partial validation of their core concepts.

## Comparison to Reference Cases

Novel space launch technologies typically face extended development timelines:

- **SpaceX's Falcon 1**: From founding to first successful orbital launch took approximately 6 years (2002-2008).
- **Rocket Lab's Electron**: Development to first successful orbital launch took about 7 years (2010-2017).
- **Virgin Orbit's LauncherOne**: Development to successful orbital deployment took approximately 8 years (2012-2020).

These comparisons involve more conventional rocket technologies. More experimental approaches like space elevators, electromagnetic railguns, and nuclear thermal propulsion have seen decades of research without achieving operational status.

SpinLaunch's approach is arguably more technically ambitious than conventional rockets, suggesting a longer development timeline might be expected. However, the company has demonstrated faster-than-average progress with its Suborbital Accelerator.

## Funding and Commercial Viability

SpinLaunch has secured significant investment (approximately $80 million) from prominent venture capital firms including GV and Kleiner Perkins. This level of funding provides resources for continued development but may not be sufficient for completing the full-scale Orbital Accelerator without additional investment rounds.

The company's target of under $2,500 per kilogram to orbit would be competitive in the launch market if achieved, potentially creating strong commercial demand if technical challenges are overcome.

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on the information available as of August 2022, I assess the probability of SpinLaunch or a successor company successfully lifting a satellite to low Earth orbit using mass accelerator technology by 2032 at approximately **35-45%**.

Key factors supporting this assessment:

- Successful suborbital test flights demonstrate basic feasibility of the kinetic launch concept
- Strong financial backing from sophisticated investors
- 10-year timeframe allows for multiple development iterations
- Commercial incentives for low-cost launch solutions remain strong

Key factors reducing probability:

- Unprecedented engineering challenges at the limits of material science
- Requirement for several orders of magnitude scaling from test system to operational system
- Historical precedent of novel launch technologies facing significant delays or failure
- Need for additional substantial funding rounds to complete development

The probability assessment reflects substantial uncertainty given the limited public technical information available about SpinLaunch's system design, material choices, and engineering solutions to the key challenges identified.
