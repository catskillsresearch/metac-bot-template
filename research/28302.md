### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of September 12, 2024, the US national average retail price for regular gasoline was $3.24 per gallon, according to AAA, reflecting a steady decline in prices through early September[1].
- Earlier in 2024, prices were higher, with an average of $3.62 in April, but have since fallen due to seasonal demand decreases and market stabilization[5].
- The $3.205 threshold is only marginally below the most recent reported average, and the trend as of mid-September is downward[1].

### Recent Announcements and Policies

- There have been no significant new policy interventions or supply disruptions reported as of mid-September 2024 that would likely reverse the current downward price trend[1][5].
- Analysts attribute the decline to market factors such as lower post-summer demand and improved supply balance, rather than direct government action[1].

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The AAA Daily Fuel Gauge Report is the definitive source for the national average retail price of regular gasoline and will be used for resolution[1][4].
- Historical and current price data can also be cross-verified with the US Energy Information Administration (EIA)[3].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- Gasoline prices are inherently volatile and subject to rapid changes due to international events, refinery issues, or unexpected demand shifts[5].
- While the trend is downward, the difference between the current average ($3.24) and the threshold ($3.205) is small, so even a modest price movement could affect the outcome.
- The AAA methodology is consistent, but if the resolution source is inaccessible on the resolution date, the question will be annulled per the specified criteria.

### Summary

As of September 12, 2024, the US national average retail price of regular gasoline is $3.24, trending downward. If this pace continues, it is plausible that the price could fall below $3.205 by September 30, 2024. However, the margin is narrow, and short-term volatility could result in the price remaining just above or dipping below the threshold. The most recent data and trend suggest the price is likely to be near, but possibly just above, $3.205 on the target date[1][5].
