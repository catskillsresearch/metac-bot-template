# Forecasting the #2 Position on Forbes Real-Time Billionaires List for June 28, 2025

As of May 13, 2025, I've analyzed the available information to forecast who is likely to occupy the second position on the Forbes Real-Time Billionaires List by June 28, 2025.

## Current Status (May 2025)

According to the most recent Forbes data from early May 2025, the current top billionaire rankings are:

1. Elon Musk - $386.5 billion (increased by $46 billion in the last month)[1]
2. Jeff Bezos (holding second place for the second consecutive month)[1]
3. Mark Zuckerberg[1]
4. Larry Ellison[1]
5. Warren Buffett[1]

Jeff Bezos currently occupies the second position, with his wealth primarily tied to Amazon's stock performance. Earlier data from April 2025 showed Bezos and Zuckerberg with very similar net worths of approximately $215-216 billion each[4], indicating a close race for the second position.

## Key Trends and Market Factors

Several important trends could influence the rankings by late June:

**Stock Market Volatility:** The market has been experiencing volatility in response to President Trump's tariff plans and recession concerns[1]. This uncertainty is causing business leaders to pause new ventures and investments, which could disproportionately affect different billionaires depending on their portfolio composition.

**Tech Stock Performance:** The wealth of top billionaires like Musk, Bezos, and Zuckerberg is heavily influenced by technology stock performance. Recent months have shown significant growth in tech valuations, with tech leaders collectively accounting for over $600 billion of the $1.5 trillion increase among the world's wealthiest individuals[3].

**Tesla's Recent Recovery:** Tesla stock recovered from an early April plunge to end the month up about 7%, significantly boosting Musk's fortune[1]. This demonstrates how quickly these rankings can change based on individual company performance.

## Forecast Analysis for June 28, 2025

Based on the available information, I assess the following probabilities for the second position on June 28:

1. **Jeff Bezos (50%)** - Currently holds the position and has maintained it for two consecutive months[1]. Amazon's diverse business model provides some insulation against market volatility.

2. **Mark Zuckerberg (30%)** - Was very close to Bezos in wealth as of early April[4]. Meta's continued investments in AI and virtual reality could drive stock growth if these sectors gain momentum.

3. **Larry Ellison (10%)** - Currently in fourth place[1]. Oracle's enterprise focus might provide stability during economic uncertainty.

4. **Elon Musk (5%)** - While currently in first place, significant Tesla volatility could potentially drop him to second if the company faces setbacks.

5. **Warren Buffett (3%)** - His more diversified portfolio through Berkshire Hathaway offers stability, but growth is typically slower than tech-focused billionaires.

6. **Someone else (2%)** - Including potential rapid wealth increases from other billionaires just outside the top 5.

## Uncertainties and Limitations

Several factors create uncertainty in this forecast:

- The Forbes Real-Time Billionaires List is updated daily based on stock price changes, making it inherently volatile
- Potential major business announcements, acquisitions, or stock sales could significantly alter wealth positions
- Geopolitical events or policy changes affecting specific industries could impact billionaire wealth disproportionately
- The ongoing market reaction to President Trump's economic policies creates additional uncertainty

This forecast assumes no major regulatory actions targeting specific companies and no significant personal wealth transfers (such as major charitable donations) from any of the top billionaires.
