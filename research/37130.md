## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The US State Department's Diversity Visa (DV) program operates on a well-established annual cycle, with participants registering in the preceding year and results for DV-2025 available from May 4, 2024, through September 30, 2025[2][3].
- The official Entrant Status Check (ESC) webpage is the primary source for checking DV lottery results and remains accessible for the duration of each program year[1][2][5].
- As of May 2025, both the DV-2024 and DV-2025 status check portals are online, with clear instructions for use[1][3][5].

## Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- No recent announcements from the US State Department or other government agencies indicate plans to terminate, suspend, or materially alter the Diversity Visa program or its online presence for the 2025 cycle[1][2][5].
- The DV-2025 program is currently active, and the State Department continues to direct applicants to the official online portal for results and instructions[1][5].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The authoritative page for the Diversity Visa program is the US State Department's official site at travel.state.gov and the Entrant Status Check at dvprogram.state.gov[1][2][3][5].
- The Step 1 "Submit an Entry" instructions and portal are located at the URL specified in the resolution criteria.

## Limitations or Uncertainties in Measurement

- The main risks to the page being online are unforeseen legislative changes, executive orders, judicial actions, or major technical outages.
- Historically, no such disruptions have occurred during an active DV cycle, and the program has continued despite political debate.
- Measurement is straightforward: if the specified URL resolves to the official Step 1 instructions and entry portal on or after July 1, 2025, the criterion is met.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the program's continued operation, the established timeline through September 2025, and the absence of any announced policy changes, the likelihood that the Diversity Visa "Submit an Entry" page will be online on July 1, 2025, is very high.
