## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The FBI’s National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) has processed an average of approximately 2.6 million checks per month in 2022, with 2023 being the fourth-highest year on record for background checks[1][4].
- November is historically a high-volume month for NICS checks, often exceeding 3 million, especially during election years or periods of heightened political uncertainty. For example, November 2020 saw over 3.4 million checks[5].
- After a decline from the 2020–2021 peak, the last three months of 2023 saw a reversal, with Q4 2023 (October–December) up 4.6% over Q4 2022, totaling over 4.7 million NSSF-adjusted checks (which is lower than raw NICS numbers)[4].
- As of 2024, Americans were purchasing nearly 1.4 million firearms per month, but raw NICS checks are higher due to permit and other non-sale checks[3].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- There have been no major federal policy changes directly affecting NICS check volume in 2024, but the presidential election is expected to drive increased activity, as political uncertainty historically correlates with spikes in firearm purchases and background checks[3].
- The FBI’s FY 2024 budget request included additional resources for NICS, but this is aimed at processing efficiency, not at changing the volume of checks[1].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The FBI publishes monthly NICS data, which is the authoritative source for resolving this question. The data can be accessed directly from the FBI’s official website[1].
- Industry groups like the National Shooting Sports Foundation (NSSF) provide adjusted NICS data focused on gun sales, but the raw NICS number is the metric for this question[4].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- NICS checks do not equate exactly to gun sales: some checks are for permits or multiple firearms, and some private sales in certain states do not require NICS checks[2][3].
- The raw NICS number includes permit checks and other non-sale-related checks, which can inflate the monthly total.
- Data reporting can be delayed, but the FBI typically publishes monthly numbers in the following month.

## Forecast

Given:
- The historical pattern of November being a high-volume month,
- The recent upward trend in monthly NICS checks since July 2024,
- The expected surge due to the 2024 presidential election,

It is likely that the number of FBI NICS background checks initiated in November 2024 will exceed 3.0 million, barring an unexpected reversal in trend or reporting anomaly.
