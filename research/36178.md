### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- In early 2025, WTI crude oil prices have largely stayed below $75 per barrel, with the annual average for 2025 forecasted at $70.62[1].
- Technical analysis for March 2025 projects WTI to trade in a range between $67 and $70.50, suggesting continued range-bound movement near the upper end of the specified band[4].
- The EIA forecasts Brent crude to average $74 in 2025, with WTI typically trading slightly lower, supporting the expectation that WTI will remain within the $60-$70 range[3].

### Recent Announcements and Policies

- The IEA's March 2025 Oil Market Report notes that benchmark crude prices fell in February and early March due to concerns about the global economic outlook and oil demand growth[2].
- OPEC+ production restraint is expected to continue, but growing non-OPEC+ production and slower demand growth are putting downward pressure on prices[3].

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Yahoo Finance provides daily closing prices for WTI crude oil futures.
- The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) and International Energy Agency (IEA) offer regular market reports and forecasts[3][2].
- Statista and technical analysis platforms (e.g., DailyForex) provide historical and forecasted price ranges[1][4].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- Oil prices are highly volatile and sensitive to geopolitical events, OPEC+ policy changes, and unexpected shifts in supply or demand[1][3].
- While forecasts and technical analysis suggest prices will likely remain within the $60-$70 range through March 2025, short-term breaches are possible due to market shocks or speculative trading.
- The question resolves based on daily closing prices, so even a single close outside the range would affect the outcome.

> In summary, as of March 20, 2025, authoritative forecasts and recent trends suggest WTI crude oil is likely to remain above $60 and below $70 through the end of March 2025, but significant uncertainty remains due to the inherent volatility of oil markets[1][3][4].
