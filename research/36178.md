## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The average annual WTI crude oil price for 2025 is forecasted at $70.62 per barrel, a decrease of about $6 from the previous year. In the first weeks of 2025, weekly WTI prices largely stayed below $75 per barrel[1].
- Technical analysis for March 2025 projects WTI crude oil to trade in a range between $67 and $70.50, indicating a relatively stable, range-bound market for the month[4].
- The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) forecasts Brent crude oil prices to average $74 per barrel in 2025, with WTI typically trading at a slight discount to Brent[3].

## Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Metric

- OPEC+ has maintained voluntary production cuts, which have supported prices but are offset by increasing production from non-OPEC+ countries[3].
- The EIA and IEA both highlight that global oil supply is expected to outpace demand growth in 2025, putting downward pressure on prices[2][3].
- Additional U.S. sanctions on Russia’s oil sector could reduce Russian exports, but the overall impact is uncertain and not fully factored into forecasts[3].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Historical and current WTI crude oil closing prices can be verified on Yahoo Finance[4].
- Forecasts and analysis are available from Statista, the EIA, and the IEA[1][2][3].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- Oil prices are historically volatile and subject to rapid changes due to geopolitical events, supply disruptions, or unexpected shifts in demand[1][3].
- Forecasts are based on current trends and assumptions; actual prices may deviate due to unforeseen factors such as economic shocks or policy changes[2][3].
- The technical forecast for March 2025 suggests prices will remain within the $67–$70.50 range, but brief excursions outside this range cannot be ruled out[4].

## Summary

Based on available forecasts and recent price trends, it is likely—but not guaranteed—that the closing price of WTI crude oil will remain above $60 and below $70 for each trading day through the end of March 2025. However, due to the inherent volatility of oil markets, there remains some risk of prices moving outside this range, especially in response to unexpected geopolitical or economic developments.
