## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- From 2014 to 2019, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) dominated Indian national politics, winning a parliamentary majority on its own in both elections—282 seats in 2014 and 303 in 2019[2][1].
- Narendra Modi, a BJP member, has served as Prime Minister since 2014, marking a shift away from coalition governments that dominated Indian politics from 1989 to 2014[2][5].
- In 2024, the BJP's dominance diminished: it won 240 seats, falling short of the 272 needed for a majority. The party now relies on its National Democratic Alliance (NDA) partners, with the coalition securing a total of 293 seats[5].
- The opposition Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA), comprising about three dozen parties, won 234 seats, boosted significantly by a resurgence in the Congress Party (99 seats, nearly double its 2019 tally)[5].
- The return to coalition politics resembles the pre-2014 era, where Prime Ministers from coalition governments were sometimes replaced mid-term due to shifting alliances[5].

## 2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- The 2024 general election marked a significant shift, with the BJP losing its single-party majority for the first time since 2014[5].
- The NDA coalition's majority is comfortable for now, but reliance on partners introduces new uncertainty into government stability[5].
- Opposition unity has improved, but whether this leads to a change in government depends on future elections, coalition stability, and potential defections.

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Parliamentary seat tallies and coalition compositions are documented in official election reports and major news sources[1][2][5].
- The evolving status of the NDA and opposition alliances can be tracked via major political analysis outlets and government releases.

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- Coalition governments in India have historically been less stable than single-party governments, increasing the probability of mid-term leadership changes or realignments.
- However, as of mid-2024, the NDA's majority remains solid, and there is no immediate indication of an imminent split[5].
- The opposition's ability to form a stable alternative government is unproven at the national level in recent years.
- Unexpected events—such as by-elections, scandals, or major policy disputes—could rapidly alter coalition dynamics.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the shift from single-party rule to coalition government, the probability of a non-BJP Prime Minister before 2030 has increased compared to the 2014–2024 period. Still, as of 2024, the NDA remains cohesive and in control. Historically, coalition era governments did experience Prime Minister changes due to alliance shifts, but these were not annual occurrences. With roughly five years to the next scheduled general election (2029), and barring major coalition defections, the likelihood of a non-BJP Prime Minister before 2030 appears moderate—higher than in previous years, but still less than 50%, unless there is a major realignment or a successful no-confidence motion.
