# Forecasting Arkansas Drought Conditions for December 31, 2024

Based on information available as of early November 2024, here's an analysis to help forecast whether Arkansas will have 1 million or more residents living in drought conditions by the end of December 2024.

## Current Drought Status in Arkansas

As of late October 2024, Arkansas was experiencing significant drought conditions. Moderate to extreme drought (D1 to D3) conditions were present in southern, central, and western sections of the state[4]. This drought developed due to a very dry period from early August through late October, with rainfall deficits of six to eight inches being common across affected areas[4].

The severity of the drought led to:
- Burn bans in 66 of Arkansas's 75 counties
- High to extreme wildfire danger designations by the Arkansas Forestry Division
- Agricultural disaster declarations in multiple counties[4]

## Recent Precipitation Patterns

In early November 2024 (specifically November 3-5), significant rainfall occurred across northern and western Arkansas:

- Ten to fifteen inches of rain fell across the north/west regions, including portions of the Ozark and Ouachita Mountains and the Arkansas River Valley west of Russellville[4]
- At Harrison (Boone County), 12.37 inches of precipitation was recorded from November 3-5, making it the wettest three-day period on record locally[4]
- Through mid-November, Harrison had accumulated 14.37 inches of rain for the month, making November 2024 the 5th wettest month of all time at that location[2]

This substantial rainfall helped alleviate drought conditions in the northern and western portions of the state, particularly notable since Harrison had just experienced a record dry 91-day stretch from August 1 through October 30 (with only 2.55 inches of precipitation)[4].

## Climate Outlook for November-December 2024

The U.S. Climate Prediction Center's outlook for November 2024 (released October 31) provided some relevant forecasting information:

- The precipitation outlook favored well above average precipitation across parts of the central U.S., which would include Arkansas[5]
- For the Southeast region (which borders Arkansas), the week of November 7 was expected to see a return to near-normal rainfall after limited precipitation in the first week of November[3]

Looking further ahead toward December:
- A weak La Ni単a pattern was expected to develop, which typically increases the odds of below-normal precipitation for December through February across southeastern states including Florida, Georgia, Alabama, and South Carolina[3]
- While Arkansas isn't specifically mentioned in this La Ni単a impact assessment, its proximity to these states suggests potential influence on its precipitation patterns

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors limit the precision of forecasting whether 1 million Arkansas residents will be in drought areas by December 31:

1. The search results don't provide specific data on how many Arkansas residents were living in drought-affected areas as of early November 2024.

2. While significant rainfall occurred in early November in northern and western Arkansas, the search results don't specify whether this was sufficient to completely eliminate drought conditions in those regions.

3. The climate outlooks available extend only through November, with limited information about December precipitation patterns specifically for Arkansas.

4. The population distribution across Arkansas in relation to drought-affected areas is not detailed in the available information.

5. The La Ni単a pattern's influence on Arkansas specifically (as opposed to neighboring southeastern states) is not clearly established in the search results.

## Conclusion

Based on the available information, Arkansas was experiencing significant drought conditions in southern, central, and western regions as of late October 2024, with substantial rainfall in early November helping to alleviate conditions in northern and western areas. While climate outlooks suggested above-average precipitation for November, the December outlook remained less certain, with potential influence from a weak La Ni単a pattern.

Without specific data on population distribution in drought-affected areas or more detailed forecasts for December, it's difficult to make a precise prediction about whether 1 million Arkansas residents will be living in drought conditions by December 31, 2024.
