# Forecasting Trump's Lead Over Biden in 538's National Polling Average for July 15, 2024

As of July 9, 2024, FiveThirtyEight's national polling average shows an evolving race between former President Donald Trump and President Joe Biden[1]. To assess whether Trump's lead will be between 2 and 4 percentage points by July 15, 2024, I'll analyze current trends and relevant factors.

## Current Polling Status and Recent Trends

According to the information provided, Trump's lead in FiveThirtyEight's national polling average has been widening:

- On June 27, 2024 (debate day): Trump led by +0.2 percentage points
- By July 5, 2024: Trump's lead expanded to +2.4 percentage points

This represents a significant 2.2 percentage point shift in Trump's favor over approximately 8 days following the debate. The debate performance by President Biden was widely criticized and appears to have had a substantial impact on polling numbers.

Prior to the debate, polling data from May 2024 already showed Trump with a lead. Split Ticket reported on May 18 that "FiveThirtyEight's polling average has Trump currently leading Biden by about a point"[5]. This indicates that Trump had momentum even before the debate, which appears to have accelerated following Biden's performance.

## Factors That May Influence the July 15 Polling Average

Several factors could influence whether Trump's lead will fall within the 2-4 point range by July 15:

1. **Debate Impact Trajectory**: Post-debate polling shifts often follow a pattern where the initial reaction creates a significant movement that may partially stabilize or slightly reverse as time passes. The 2.4-point lead as of July 5 could either continue growing or begin to stabilize.

2. **Biden Campaign Response**: The Biden team has reportedly been "taking action to reverse recent perceptions" and has "insisted that Biden will not be dropping out." Their effectiveness in damage control could influence polling trends.

3. **Democratic Party Pressure**: With three House Democrats calling for Biden to drop out as of July 5, continued or increased pressure from within the party could further affect public perception and polling.

4. **Media Coverage Cycle**: The intensity and framing of ongoing media coverage regarding Biden's debate performance and fitness for office will likely influence polling trends.

5. **Voter Consolidation**: As noted in the Split Ticket analysis, there is potential for Biden to "recover much of the ground he has lost in polling as partisans 'come home'"[5]. However, they also note this is "far from a guarantee."

## Analysis of Potential Outcomes

Based on the available data, there are several possible scenarios for the July 15 polling average:

1. **Continued Momentum for Trump**: If the post-debate trend continues at a similar pace, Trump's lead could exceed 4 percentage points by July 15. The 2.2-point increase over 8 days (June 27 to July 5) represents approximately 0.275 points per day. At this rate, an additional 10 days could add roughly 2.75 more points to Trump's lead, potentially pushing it to around 5.15 points.

2. **Stabilization**: The initial shock of the debate may wear off, causing the rate of change to slow down. In this scenario, Trump's lead might stabilize in the 2.5-3.5 point range, which would fall within the specified 2-4 point range.

3. **Partial Recovery for Biden**: If the Biden campaign's damage control efforts gain traction, we might see a slight reversal of the trend, potentially bringing Trump's lead back toward the lower end of the 2-4 point range.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several limitations affect the precision of this forecast:

1. **Limited Recent Data**: The search results provide polling information only up to July 9, 2024, without detailed day-by-day tracking of the most recent trends.

2. **Unpredictable Events**: New developments between July 9 and July 15 could significantly impact polling averages in ways that cannot be predicted.

3. **Polling Methodology**: FiveThirtyEight's polling average incorporates adjustments based on "each poll's recency, sample size, methodology and house effects"[1], which means the average can shift even without new polls being conducted.

4. **Timing of Poll Inclusion**: The July 15 average will depend on which polls are released and incorporated into FiveThirtyEight's model by that date.

## Conclusion

Based on the available data as of July 9, 2024, there is a reasonable possibility that Trump's lead over Biden in FiveThirtyEight's national polling average could fall within the 2-4 percentage point range on July 15. The current trajectory suggests Trump's lead is growing, having reached 2.4 points by July 5. Whether it remains within the 2-4 point range by July 15 will depend on whether the post-debate momentum continues at the same pace or begins to stabilize.

The most likely scenario appears to be that Trump's lead will be at the higher end of this range or potentially exceed it, given the significant momentum following the debate and the relatively short timeframe for the Biden campaign to reverse perceptions.
