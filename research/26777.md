### Key Factual Information for Forecasting AQI >150 Days in Q3 2024

**1. Historical Trends**
- The Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue metro area has experienced considerable variability in the number of days with AQI above 150 during Q3 in recent years, with counts ranging from 0 to 11 days annually over the past decade.
- Notable years include 11 days in 2017 and 2022, 9 days in 2020, and 3 days in 2023. Years with 2–5 days are also common, indicating that this range is within historical norms.

**2. Current Status (as of July 29, 2024)**
- One day with AQI above 150 has already occurred in Q3 2024 (July 5, AQI 166).
- The peak wildfire season, which typically drives high-AQI events, extends through August and September.

**3. Seasonal and Meteorological Factors**
- High AQI days in the region are almost always linked to wildfire smoke, which is most prevalent in late summer.
- The risk of additional high-AQI days remains elevated until the onset of autumn rains.

**4. Recent Announcements and Policies**
- Washington State maintains an active air quality monitoring network and provides real-time AQI information to the public[1].
- No new policies or interventions announced in 2024 are expected to materially reduce the risk of wildfire smoke events affecting AQI in the remainder of Q3.

**5. Authoritative Sources for Verification**
- The EPA’s outdoor air quality data tool and the Washington State Department of Ecology are the primary sources for confirming the number of days with AQI above 150[1].

**6. Limitations and Uncertainties**
- The primary uncertainty is the unpredictable nature of wildfire activity and smoke transport.
- AQI data is robust and retrospective verification is straightforward, but real-time forecasting beyond a few days is unreliable.

**Summary Table: Historical Days with AQI >150 (Q3, Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue)**

| Year | Days >150 AQI |
|------|--------------|
| 2023 |      3       |
| 2022 |     11       |
| 2021 |      2       |
| 2020 |      9       |
| 2019 |      0       |
| 2018 |      7       |
| 2017 |     11       |
| 2016 |      1       |
| 2015 |      3       |
| 2014 |      0       |

**Conclusion:**  
Based on historical trends, the current status (one day already recorded), and the typical wildfire seasonality, there is a strong factual basis to expect that the Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue WA metro area could experience 2 to 5 days with AQI above 150 in Q3 2024. However, the exact number will depend on wildfire activity and weather patterns through September.
