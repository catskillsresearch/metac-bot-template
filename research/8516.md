## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- In 2021, 85% of US adults owned a smartphone, showing that rapid, near-universal adoption of a new personal technology is possible within a few decades.
- As of 2023, about 30% of Americans use AR in any form, with most usage occurring via smartphones, not dedicated AR devices[2].
- AR glasses revenue is growing rapidly: from $1.85 billion in 2021 to projections of over $35 billion by 2026, indicating rising investment and market interest, but not direct evidence of mass consumer adoption[3].
- In 2020, only 15% of the US population used AR monthly, again mostly via non-dedicated devices[4].
- By 2025, 14 million US workers (a small fraction of the adult population) are projected to use smart glasses daily, primarily in workplace settings, not personal life[5].

## 2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- Major tech companies have signaled strong interest in AR hardware, with ongoing investments and product announcements, but no single device has yet captured the mass market.
- The rise of the metaverse, Industry 4.0, and IoT trends are expected to boost AR adoption, particularly in business and industry[5].
- There is currently no evidence of US policy mandating or subsidizing personal AR device adoption.

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Surveys by Pew Research Center for technology adoption baselines.
- Market forecasts from Statista, ARtillery Intelligence, and others for AR device penetration and revenue[1][2][3].
- Industry analyses and usage statistics from XR Today, Exploding Topics, and Threekit[2][4][5].

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- Most usage statistics for AR refer to software use (often on smartphones), not ownership of dedicated AR devices as defined for this question.
- Surveys may overcount by including devices not qualifying under the question's strict definition.
- Social, economic, and technical factors (privacy, cost, utility, acceptance) could accelerate or impede adoption.
- Long-term forecasts (to 2050) are inherently uncertain due to potential for unforeseen technological breakthroughs or societal shifts.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

- Reference cases (e.g., smartphones) show that >80% adoption is possible for transformative personal technology within 30–40 years.
- However, as of early 2022, dedicated personal AR device adoption is likely well below 10% of US adults, and most usage remains through smartphones or workplace devices[2][5].
- The current growth rate is strong but from a small base, and significant barriers (cost, design, privacy, utility) remain for truly mass-market AR glasses.
- If AR hardware can overcome these barriers and deliver must-have consumer utility, a trajectory similar to smartphones is possible—but the "hockey-stick" moment has not yet occurred.
- Given these factors, as of January 2022, the probability that more than 50% of US adults will own a personal AR device by 2050 should be considered **plausible but not yet likely or assured**. A reasonable forecast might place the probability in the 40–60% range, with significant uncertainty due to the early stage of adoption and many unknowns.
