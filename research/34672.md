# Will OpenAI, Anthropic, or Perplexity Run an Ad at the 2025 Super Bowl?

Based on information available prior to February 3, 2025, here's an analysis of whether OpenAI, Anthropic, or Perplexity will run an ad during Super Bowl LIX scheduled for February 9, 2025.

## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

The Super Bowl has historically been a platform where companies showcase their innovations and establish their presence in emerging markets. In recent years, Super Bowl advertising has reflected dominant technological and cultural trends, from cryptocurrency and sports betting apps in previous years to travel and hospitality after COVID restrictions lifted[5].

For Super Bowl LIX in 2025, artificial intelligence appears to be emerging as a dominant advertising theme. Mark Evans, executive VP of ad sales for Fox Sports, has stated: "AI is coming. If it's not already here in almost every business, it will be coming like a freight train... So you will see some more AI focused creative, which I think intuitively would be expected."[5]

## Recent Announcements Affecting AI Companies' Super Bowl Presence

### OpenAI

According to Adweek reporting from November 4, 2024, "OpenAI, the artificial intelligence (AI) company behind ChatGPT, is set to make its Super Bowl ad debut this year."[2] This represents the most concrete evidence that one of the specified companies plans to advertise during the 2025 Super Bowl.

Industry speculation further supports this, with RetailWire reporting in late January 2025 that "AI-focused firms like OpenAI" are among those expected to be "spending big money to get in front of viewers."[5]

### Anthropic and Perplexity

As of February 3, 2025, there are no specific announcements or credible reports indicating that either Anthropic or Perplexity has purchased advertising slots for Super Bowl LIX. While AI companies in general are expected to have a strong presence, these two companies are not specifically mentioned in any of the available pre-game advertising reports.

## Context: Other Confirmed Super Bowl LIX Advertisers

Several major companies have already confirmed their Super Bowl LIX advertising plans:

- **Google** is making a significant investment with 51 different commercialsâ€”50 regional spots highlighting small businesses across the U.S. and one national 60-second ad titled "Dream Job" showcasing their AI capabilities[4]
- **Salesforce** is returning with a 30-second ad starring Matthew McConaughey as part of their "Ask More of AI" campaign[4]
- **HexClad** is making its Super Bowl debut with a 30-second spot featuring Gordon Ramsay and Pete Davidson[4]

## Limitations and Uncertainties

While there is reporting indicating OpenAI's planned participation, Super Bowl advertising plans can change up until the broadcast date. Companies sometimes make last-minute decisions to purchase remaining ad inventory, or may withdraw previously planned advertisements.

The information available about OpenAI's plans comes from industry reporting rather than direct announcements from the company itself, which introduces some uncertainty. Additionally, the complete roster of Super Bowl advertisers is typically not finalized or fully public until closer to the event date.

## Conclusion

Based on information available before February 3, 2025:
- OpenAI appears likely to run its first-ever Super Bowl ad during Super Bowl LIX[2][5]
- There is no evidence that either Anthropic or Perplexity has purchased Super Bowl advertising slots
- AI-themed advertising is expected to be prominent during the 2025 Super Bowl broadcast[5]
