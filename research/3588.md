## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status (as of 2020-02-09)

- Stacey Abrams served in the Georgia House of Representatives from 2007 to 2017, including as minority leader from 2011 to 2017[1][5].
- She was the Democratic nominee for governor of Georgia in 2018, becoming the first Black woman to be a major party’s gubernatorial nominee in U.S. history, but lost a close race and did not concede[4][5].
- Afterward, she founded Fair Fight Action, a prominent voting rights group credited with boosting Democratic turnout in Georgia, particularly in the 2020 presidential and Senate elections[1][5].
- As of early 2020, Abrams had not held statewide or federal elected office and had not formally announced a presidential campaign.
- U.S. presidents are typically former governors, senators, or vice presidents. Only rarely do candidates win the presidency without such prior experience.
- No Black woman had ever been a major-party nominee for president as of 2020.

## 2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- Abrams publicly expressed interest in running for higher office, including the presidency, stating she could be president by 2040[5].
- Her ongoing national profile, advocacy for voting rights, and impact on Democratic politics kept her in consideration for future high office.
- The 2020 Democratic Party was increasingly promoting diverse candidates and emphasizing voting rights, aligning with Abrams’ platform.

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Wikipedia provides a comprehensive career overview[1].
- The National Women's History Museum highlights her historical significance[2].
- Official campaign and organizational sites and national news outlets (e.g., FiveThirtyEight, not directly cited but referenced in the query) provide context for her ambitions and national influence.

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- The 20-year time horizon (2020–2040) introduces significant uncertainty, as political fortunes can shift rapidly.
- Historically, most presidents have prior statewide or federal executive experience, which Abrams lacked as of 2020.
- Factors such as changes in public attitudes, party dynamics, and unforeseen events could substantially alter her prospects.
- The reference case for a Black woman with Abrams’ profile reaching the presidency did not exist as of 2020; her candidacy would break new ground.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given her achievements and national profile as of February 2020, Stacey Abrams was a plausible but long-shot candidate for the presidency by 2040. While her influence and visibility were growing, her lack of statewide or federal elected executive experience and the historic barriers faced by Black women in presidential politics suggested a probability below that of more conventional candidates. However, her organizational impact and the Democratic Party’s increasing diversity slightly increased her chances above most state-level politicians lacking national office.

Overall, as of 2020-02-09, the probability that Stacey Abrams would be elected president in or before 2040 was low but nonzero—plausible if she secured higher office or was selected as a vice presidential candidate and ascended, but still an uphill path given historical precedents.
