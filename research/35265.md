# Analysis of Atlético de Madrid's LaLiga 2024/25 Title Chances

As of May 12, 2025, a comprehensive analysis of Atlético de Madrid's chances of winning LaLiga 2024/25 reveals that it is now mathematically impossible for them to claim the title.

## Current Standings

The current LaLiga standings show:

1. Barcelona: 82 points (+59 GD)[4]
2. Real Madrid: 75 points (+35 GD)[4]
3. Atlético Madrid: 70 points (+33 GD)[3][4]

Atlético Madrid has played 35 matches with a record of 20 wins, 10 draws, and 5 losses[3]. With only 3 matches remaining in their schedule, the maximum points they could achieve would be 79 (assuming they win all remaining matches), which would still leave them short of Barcelona's current 82 points.

## Season Performance Analysis

Atlético Madrid has shown strong form throughout the season under Diego Simeone's management. Their defensive record has been particularly impressive, conceding only 27 goals in 35 matches[3]. This defensive solidity has been a hallmark of Simeone's teams and has contributed significantly to their position in the top three.

Their recent form (W, D, W, L, W)[4] demonstrates their continued competitiveness, but inconsistency in results has ultimately cost them in the title race.

## Comparative Analysis with Competitors

**Barcelona** has been the standout team this season with an impressive goal difference of +59[4]. Their attacking prowess (89 goals scored in 33 matches according to earlier data)[5] has given them a significant advantage.

**Real Madrid**, the defending champions, have maintained a strong position but fallen behind Barcelona in the title race with 75 points[4].

## Conclusion

Based on the current standings and remaining matches, Atlético Madrid cannot win LaLiga 2024/25. Barcelona has already secured an insurmountable lead in points. While Atlético's season can still be considered successful with their qualification for next season's Champions League already assured[5], they will need to wait at least another year for their first domestic title since 2020/21.

The question "Will Atlético de Madrid win the EA Sports LaLiga 2024/25?" must be resolved as **No**.
