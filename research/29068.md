## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- In 2016, the RCP national polling average underestimated Trump's performance by 1.8 percentage points compared to the final result. In 2020, the underestimation was even larger, at 2.7 points[1].
- The "shy Trump voter" hypothesis has been proposed to explain this bias, but its validity is debated and not universally accepted.
- In the 2022 midterms, the polling bias shifted: polls slightly overestimated Republican performance in Senate races (by 3.7 points), but the national generic ballot was very accurate, with the RCP average only 0.3 points off the final result[1].
- The October 17, 2024, RCP national polling average for Trump vs. Harris is a -1.583 percentage point spread for Trump[4].

## Recent Announcements or Policies Affecting the Metric

- There have been no major changes in polling methodology or significant announcements that would systematically affect polling bias for 2024 as of October 22, 2024.

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- RealClearPolitics and RealClear Polling provide historical and current polling averages and analyses[1][4].
- Independent analysts and polling aggregators have documented the variability and unpredictability of polling bias from cycle to cycle[5].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- Historical polling bias does not reliably predict future bias. The direction and magnitude of polling error have shifted between cycles, sometimes favoring Democrats, sometimes Republicans, and sometimes showing little bias at all[5].
- The 2022 midterms demonstrated that polling bias can reverse or disappear, making it risky to assume a repeat of 2016 or 2020 patterns[1][5].
- The final polling bias for Trump in 2024 cannot be determined until after the election results are known.

## Conclusion

Based on available data as of October 22, 2024:
- The RCP national polling average as of October 17, 2024, shows Trump trailing Harris by 1.583 percentage points[4].
- In 2016 and 2020, RCP underestimated Trump by 1.8 and 2.7 points, respectively, but in 2022, the bias was minimal or even favored Republicans[1].
- There is no clear evidence that the polling bias for Trump in 2024 will be strictly greater than 1.0 percentage points; historical trends are inconsistent, and recent cycles show reduced or reversed bias[1][5].
- Therefore, while a bias greater than 1.0 pp is possible, it is not strongly supported by the most recent evidence, and the outcome remains uncertain.
