Based on the available information as of May 25, 2025, I'll assess the likelihood of an attempt to fire Jerome Powell before the end of his term on May 15, 2026.

## Current Status and Recent Developments

Jerome Powell is currently serving his second four-year term as Chair of the Federal Reserve, having been confirmed on May 12, 2022[2][4]. As of late May 2025, Powell remains active in his role, as evidenced by his recent baccalaureate remarks at Princeton University on May 25, 2025[1] and his press conference following the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on May 7, 2025[3].

During his May 7 press conference, Powell noted that "the risks of higher unemployment and higher inflation appear to have risen" and mentioned "elevated uncertainty about the economic outlook, largely reflecting trade policy concerns"[3]. On May 15, 2025, Powell warned that the U.S. could face "supply shocks," coming just one week after discussing concerns about tariffs[5].

## Key Factors Affecting the Forecast

### Political Dynamics and Tensions

President Trump, who began his second term in January 2025, has demonstrated increasing dissatisfaction with Powell's leadership at the Federal Reserve. The tension appears to stem primarily from disagreements over monetary policy, particularly regarding interest rates, and Powell's assessment of the economic impact of Trump's expanded tariff policies.

The administration has shown willingness to test the boundaries of executive authority in other independent agencies. Trump has already made personnel changes within the Federal Reserve system, nominating Michelle Bowman for the vice chair position on March 17, 2025, following Michael Barr's resignation from that role (though Barr remains a Fed governor)[2].

### Legal and Institutional Constraints

The Federal Reserve was designed to operate independently from direct political control. Board members, including the Chair, are legally protected from removal except "for cause," which has historically been interpreted as requiring evidence of misconduct rather than policy disagreements. This legal protection creates a significant barrier to any attempt to fire Powell.

### Recent Economic Context

Powell's recent public statements have acknowledged economic uncertainty related to trade policy while maintaining the Fed's focus on its dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability. During his May 7 press conference, Powell noted that the economy was "still in a solid position" despite "heightened uncertainty"[3]. He specifically mentioned that surveys of households and businesses "report a sharp decline in sentiment and elevated uncertainty about the economic outlook, largely reflecting trade policy concerns"[3].

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on the available information, I assess the likelihood of an attempt to fire Jerome Powell before the end of his term as follows:

**Factors increasing probability:**
- President Trump's demonstrated willingness to challenge norms regarding independent agencies
- Ongoing policy disagreements regarding interest rates and tariff impacts
- Trump's nomination of Bowman for vice chair position, suggesting desire to reshape Fed leadership

**Factors decreasing probability:**
- Legal barriers to removing a Fed Chair except "for cause"
- No historical precedent for firing a Fed Chair
- Potential political and market backlash from threatening Fed independence
- Powell's continued performance of duties as evidenced by recent public appearances

Given these considerations, there remains a significant possibility that President Trump may attempt to fire Powell before his term ends, particularly if economic conditions worsen or if Powell continues to signal that tariff policies are creating economic headwinds. However, such an attempt would face substantial legal challenges and could create significant market instability.

The most likely scenarios include continued public criticism of Powell while exploring legal avenues for removal, pressure for voluntary resignation, or attempts to limit Powell's influence through other Fed appointments while allowing him to complete his term.
