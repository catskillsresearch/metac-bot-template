# Forecasting Analysis: Potential Attempt to Fire Jerome Powell

As of May 13, 2025, I'll analyze the available factual information to assess the likelihood of an attempt to remove Jerome Powell from his position as Federal Reserve Chair before the end of his term on May 15, 2026.

## Current Status and Legal Framework

Jerome Powell is currently serving his second four-year term as Chair of the Federal Reserve, having been confirmed on May 12, 2022[1]. His current term is set to expire on May 15, 2026. An important legal constraint exists: as of April 2025, neither the president nor Congress has the authority to dismiss a Federal Reserve chairman before the end of their term[2].

The Federal Reserve's independence is structurally protected - Board members can only be removed for "cause," which has historically been interpreted as misconduct rather than policy disagreements. No U.S. president has ever attempted to fire a Fed chair.

## Recent Developments

### Political Tensions

President Trump has recently expressed significant dissatisfaction with Powell's leadership:

- On April 17, 2025, Trump posted that "Powell's termination cannot come fast enough!" while criticizing Powell as "TOO LATE AND WRONG"
- Trump called Powell a "major loser" and demanded interest rates be lowered
- National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett indicated the administration was studying whether Powell could be fired
- Trump stated, "If I want him out, he'll be out of there real fast"

However, on April 22, 2025, Trump denied having plans to fire Powell, suggesting a temporary de-escalation.

### Powell's Recent Actions and Statements

Powell has maintained a consistent policy stance despite political pressure:

- On May 7, 2025, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) decided to leave policy interest rates unchanged[5]
- Powell cited "heightened uncertainty" and noted that "the risks of higher unemployment and higher inflation appear to have risen"[5]
- In his press conference, Powell acknowledged that surveys show "a sharp decline in sentiment and elevated uncertainty about the economic outlook, largely reflecting trade policy concerns"[5]
- On May 12, 2025, Powell announced that interest rates would not increase[4]

Powell has also directly addressed the question of his removal, stating that removing a Fed chair is "not permitted under the law" and expressing his intention to serve his full term.

## Precedent-Setting Actions

While no Fed chair has ever been fired, Trump has recently taken unprecedented actions against other independent agencies:

- Fired two Democratic members of the Federal Trade Commission
- Dismissed two Democrats on the three-member board of the National Credit Union Administration
- Justified these removals by claiming their continued service was "inconsistent with my administration's priorities"

These actions suggest a willingness to test the boundaries of presidential authority over independent agencies.

## Factors Affecting Probability Assessment

### Factors Increasing Probability of Removal Attempt

1. Trump's explicit statements about wanting Powell removed
2. Recent precedent of removing officials from other independent agencies
3. Ongoing policy disagreements, particularly regarding interest rates and tariffs
4. Powell's May 7th comments implying that Trump's tariff policies could lead to "higher inflation and slower growth"

### Factors Decreasing Probability of Removal Attempt

1. Legal constraints on removing a Fed chair before term expiration
2. Trump's April 22nd denial of plans to fire Powell
3. Political and market costs of undermining Fed independence
4. The relatively short remaining time in Powell's term (approximately 1 year)
5. Powell's recent decision not to raise interest rates on May 12, 2025[4]

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on the available information as of May 13, 2025, I assess that:

- There is a moderate probability (30-45%) that President Trump will attempt to fire Jerome Powell before the end of his term
- The probability is higher for indirect pressure tactics (demanding resignation, public criticism) than for a direct formal termination
- Any attempt would likely face immediate legal challenges based on the Fed's statutory independence
- The probability increases if economic conditions deteriorate or if Powell makes policy decisions that directly counter the administration's economic agenda

## Key Uncertainties

1. Legal interpretation of "cause" for removal of Fed officials
2. Federal courts' willingness to intervene in a dispute between the executive branch and the Fed
3. Powell's response to escalating pressure
4. Economic and market developments over the next year that could affect monetary policy decisions
5. Potential congressional reaction to any attempt to remove Powell
