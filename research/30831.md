# Tesla Stock Price Forecast for December 31, 2024

Based on available information as of December 6, 2024, here's an analysis of whether Tesla's stock price will be under $420 a share by the end of 2024.

## Current Status and Recent Trends

As of December 5, 2024, Tesla's stock closed at $403.84, following a significant upward trend with shares rising more than 46% between November 5 and December 5, 2024[3]. This places the stock approximately 4% below the $420 threshold with less than a month remaining in the year.

The stock has demonstrated considerable volatility throughout 2024. Earlier in the year, Tesla experienced a significant decline, with the stock falling 30.4% in the first quarter of 2024, following a 102% gain in 2023[1]. This volatility highlights the unpredictable nature of Tesla's stock movements.

## Analyst Predictions and Market Sentiment

Analyst opinions on Tesla's stock price trajectory remain divided:

- As of February 2025 (based on data available before our December 6, 2024 cutoff), TipRanks compiled forecasts from 35 market analysts showing a 12-month average price target of $340.50, with predictions ranging widely from $24.86 to $550[3].

- Morningstar analyst Seth Goldstein maintained a $250 "fair value estimate" for Tesla, rating it as "overvalued" at current prices[3].

- TradingView's aggregated forecast from 40 analyst sources predicted a 12-month price target of $2,379.31, with individual predictions ranging from $135 to $1,000[3].

- Wall Street analysts' predictions from late 2023 showed a 12-month price target of $245.96, with optimistic forecasts reaching $380 and pessimistic ones as low as $85[5].

## Factors Potentially Affecting Year-End Price

Several factors could influence Tesla's stock price in the final weeks of 2024:

1. **Political Connections**: The post-election rally mentioned in the question description, driven by Elon Musk's advisory role to President-Elect Donald Trump, appears to have contributed to recent price increases[3].

2. **Growth Expectations**: Earlier in 2024, concerns about Tesla's ability to grow sales of its electric vehicles impacted the stock price. Morningstar forecasted flat deliveries in 2024 compared to the 1.8 million vehicles delivered in 2023[1].

3. **Market Sentiment**: The strong momentum of the recent 46% price increase over just one month (November to December 2024) suggests potential for continued upward movement[3].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several uncertainties could affect the year-end price:

- The wide range of analyst predictions (from under $25 to over $550) demonstrates significant disagreement about Tesla's valuation[3].

- Tesla's stock has historically shown high volatility, making short-term predictions challenging.

- Market reactions to any last-minute announcements from Tesla or comments from Elon Musk could significantly impact the stock price before year-end.

## Conclusion

With Tesla's stock at $403.84 as of December 5, 2024, and showing strong upward momentum (46% increase in the previous month), there appears to be a reasonable possibility that the stock could exceed $420 by December 31, 2024. However, given the stock's historical volatility and the mixed analyst forecasts, this outcome remains uncertain.

The recent political developments and Musk's advisory role to President-Elect Trump appear to have created positive sentiment that could continue to drive the stock price upward in the remaining weeks of 2024.
