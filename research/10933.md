## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status (as of 2022-05-18)

- Sam Bankman-Fried was one of the fastest-rising billionaires, with his net worth peaking at approximately $26.5 billion in early 2022, making him the 41st-richest American at the time[1][3][4][5].
- His wealth was mostly illiquid, concentrated in FTX equity and FTT tokens, with significant exposure to cryptocurrency market volatility[3][4][5].
- SBF was the founder and CEO of FTX, a leading global crypto exchange, and controlled Alameda Research, a quantitative trading firm[1][4].
- His public profile included effective altruism, large philanthropic pledges, and significant investments, such as acquiring a 7.6% stake in Robinhood in May 2022[4].

## 2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- As of May 18, 2022, there were no public indications of impending financial trouble for FTX or SBF.
- Within months after this date, revelations emerged regarding mismanagement and insolvency at FTX, leading to its collapse, SBF's arrest, and a subsequent criminal conviction with a 25-year prison sentence and forfeiture of $11 billion[2][4][5].
- The collapse resulted in complete loss of SBF’s net worth, with authorities seizing major assets, including his Robinhood stake[4][5].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Forbes Real-Time Billionaires List and Bloomberg Billionaires Index are the resolution sources for SBF’s wealth ranking in 2030.
- Major financial news outlets, regulatory filings, and court documents provide further verification for SBF’s financial status and legal outcomes[1][3][4][5].

## 4. Limitations or Uncertainties in Measurement

- As of May 18, 2022, forecasting models using only available data would have assumed continued rapid growth, but with risk due to high concentration in cryptocurrency assets.
- The events leading to SBF’s collapse were not publicly known as of that date, so forecasts based on later knowledge would introduce hindsight bias.
- The current (2025) situation shows that SBF’s legal and financial circumstances are unprecedented among top billionaires, making a return to the top 100 wealthiest by 2030 virtually impossible, barring extraordinary developments[2][4][5].

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the facts available as of 2022-05-18:
- Probabilistically, SBF would have been considered a strong candidate to remain in the top 100 wealthiest people if FTX’s growth had continued and no major adverse events occurred.
- However, incorporating subsequent events (collapse, criminal conviction, asset forfeiture), the probability of SBF being among the 100 wealthiest in 2030 is near zero, as recovery from such a collapse is unprecedented and legal restrictions prevent asset accumulation[2][4][5].
