### Key Factual Information for Forecasting Trump's Net Favorability

**Current Status and Historical Trends**
- As of July 30, 2024, Donald Trump's net favorability rating on 538 is -8.7, narrowly below the -8 threshold in question.
- Trump's favorability has been consistently negative since leaving office, with 41.4% favorable and 53% unfavorable in recent averages[1].
- He remains highly popular among Republican voters, but his national numbers have not shown significant improvement, even during major political shifts[1][4].

**Recent Political Developments**
- The 2024 election is now a contest between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, following Joe Biden's withdrawal due to concerns about his cognitive fitness.
- Harris's net favorability is also negative and very close to Trump's, at -8.5 as of July 30, 2024, while Biden's was much lower at -17.6[2].
- No major positive or negative events for Trump have been reported in the immediate lead-up to September 1, 2024, that would likely cause a dramatic shift in his favorability.

**Authoritative Sources**
- 538 is the definitive source for tracking net favorability ratings, using a weighted average of national polls[2].
- Historical polling data from 538 and other reputable pollsters show that Trump's favorability is relatively stable, with only modest fluctuations in response to news events[1][5].

**Limitations and Uncertainties**
- The difference between -8.7 and -8 is small, so even minor polling shifts could result in Trump's net favorability crossing the threshold.
- 538's methodology blends multiple polls, which can smooth out short-term volatility but may not capture rapid changes if a major event occurs.
- Polling error and late-breaking news could affect the final number, but large, sustained moves in Trump's favorability have been rare in recent years[1][5].

### Summary Table: Key Metrics as of July 30, 2024

| Candidate      | Net Favorability (538) |
|----------------|-----------------------|
| Donald Trump   | -8.7                  |
| Kamala Harris  | -8.5                  |
| Joe Biden      | -17.6                 |

### Conclusion
As of the latest available data before August 5, 2024, Trump's net favorability is just below the -8 threshold, and historical trends suggest limited volatility. While a small improvement could push his rating above -8, there is no clear evidence of an imminent shift, and the outcome will likely depend on minor polling changes in the weeks leading up to September 1, 2024.
