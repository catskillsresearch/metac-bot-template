## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- In 2010, there were 53,364 centenarians in the US (0.0173% of the population), far fewer than the 114,000 previously projected for that year[1].
- By 2014, the number had risen to approximately 72,000, or about 0.022% of the US population at that time[1].
- As of 2024, there are an estimated 101,000 centenarians in the US, making up roughly 0.03% of the population[1].

## Recent Announcements and Projections

- The US Census Bureau projects the number of centenarians to increase more than fourfold from 101,000 in 2024 to about 422,000 by 2054[1][4].
- According to Pew Research’s analysis of Census Bureau projections, centenarians are expected to comprise about 0.1% of the US population by 2054[1].
- The US population is projected to reach approximately 404 million by 2060, suggesting it will be slightly lower, but close to 400 million by 2050[2].
- Other sources estimate that the US will have 9.7 centenarians per 10,000 people in 2050, which translates to 0.097%[3].

## Key Differences Affecting the Forecast

- Past forecasts significantly overestimated the centenarian population (e.g., 2010 projection was double the actual count), but methodologies have been refined to address previous census errors[1].
- The rise in centenarians is driven by the aging of the baby boomer generation and gradual gains in life expectancy, not sudden breakthroughs in anti-aging technology[1][4].
- There is no evidence as of 2018 of any major medical or policy breakthrough that would dramatically accelerate centenarian growth beyond these trends.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

- Using the projected 422,000 centenarians and an estimated 400 million total US population in 2050, the percentage would be:

\[
\text{Centenarians as \% of population} = \frac{422,000}{400,000,000} \times 100 \approx 0.105\%
\]

- This aligns closely with the Census Bureau’s projection of centenarians comprising 0.1% of the US population by 2054[1].
- Given historical overestimation and the lack of disruptive life extension developments, the probability of the percentage exceeding 0.1% is low. The most likely range is between 0.09% and 0.11% for January 1, 2050.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- All long-term demographic forecasts are subject to uncertainties, including unforeseen changes in medical technology, public health, or catastrophic events.
- Past census errors in centenarian counts have led to overestimates, though methodologies have improved.
- Projections may change as new data becomes available or as trends in mortality and aging evolve.
