# US Troop Withdrawal from Syria: Forecast Analysis

In early February 2025, multiple reports emerged indicating that the Pentagon is actively developing plans for a potential full withdrawal of US troops from Syria. This analysis examines the available information to help forecast whether the US will officially announce the withdrawal of at least half of its troops from Syria before April 2025.

## Current Status and Recent Developments

As of early February 2025, approximately 2,000 US troops remain stationed in Syria, with 1,100 classified as "temporary rotational forces" and 900 as "core troops." The Pentagon is currently drafting plans for a complete withdrawal of these forces, with potential timelines of 30, 60, or 90 days[1][2]. This planning follows recent expressions of interest in withdrawal by President Donald Trump and officials close to him[3].

On January 30, 2025, President Trump made a statement indicating potential disengagement: "We're not involved in Syria. Syria's its own mess. They've got enough messes over there. They don't need us involved."[2] This statement came shortly before a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House[3].

## Key Contextual Factors

### Historical Precedent
This is not the first attempt by the Trump administration to withdraw troops from Syria. In 2019, President Trump ordered then-Defense Secretary James Mattis to pull troops from the country, which led to Mattis's resignation in protest[2]. This historical precedent suggests that while the president has shown consistent interest in withdrawal, implementation has faced institutional resistance.

### Recent Administrative Actions
National Security Advisor Mike Waltz visited US CENTCOM headquarters in Florida in early February 2025, where he received briefings from senior military officials on the Middle East[4]. While a senior White House official stated that troop reduction in Syria was not the purpose of Waltz's visit, the timing coincides with the reported withdrawal planning[4].

### Security Concerns
US intelligence recently helped prevent an ISIS attack on a Shiite shrine near Damascus, highlighting ongoing security concerns in the region[4]. American officials have expressed concerns about a possible resurgence of ISIS in Syria if US forces withdraw[4]. The current US military mission in Syria focuses on countering ISIS and supporting local military groups, particularly the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF).

## Timeline Analysis

If the Pentagon's plans follow the reported timelines (30, 60, or 90 days), and if a decision to implement is made promptly, even the longest timeline (90 days) would potentially see withdrawal beginning or completed before April 1, 2025. The NBC News report from February 5, 2025, indicated that planning was already underway[1], suggesting that an announcement could come relatively soon after the completion of these plans.

## Uncertainties and Limitations

Several factors could affect the likelihood and timing of an official withdrawal announcement:

1. **Decision-making process**: While plans are being developed, the reports indicate that no final decision has been made yet.

2. **Institutional resistance**: Given the previous experience in 2019, there may be resistance from within the Department of Defense or other national security institutions.

3. **Regional developments**: Changes in the security situation in Syria, particularly regarding ISIS activity, could influence the decision timeline.

4. **Diplomatic considerations**: Reactions from allies, particularly those involved in counter-ISIS operations, might affect the implementation timeline.

## Conclusion

Based on the available information as of early February 2025, there are strong indications that the Pentagon is actively preparing for a potential full withdrawal of US troops from Syria. The reported timelines (30-90 days) suggest that if approved, such a withdrawal could be announced and potentially even implemented before April 2025. However, historical precedent indicates that there may be institutional resistance to such plans, and no final decision has been reported as of February 13, 2025.

The most significant indicators to monitor would be official statements from the Department of Defense or White House regarding Syria policy, any public announcements following National Security Council meetings on the topic, or changes in operational patterns of US forces in Syria.
