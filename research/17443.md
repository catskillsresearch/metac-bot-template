**1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status**

- In June 2023, GPT-4 scored approximately 75% on OpenAI’s internal adversarial factuality eval and 59% on the TruthfulQA benchmark at release[2][5].
- Incremental improvements in hallucination mitigation have been achieved via various strategies: chain-of-thought prompting (yielding up to 35% improved accuracy in reasoning tasks), chain-of-verification (cutting hallucinations by 15–20 percentage points), and advanced reinforcement learning (up to 40% reduction in some QA tasks)[2][5].
- Despite these advances, no evidence indicates that any released LLM, OpenAI or otherwise, has neared the ≥95% (internal) or ≥92% (TruthfulQA) thresholds required for this forecast[2][5].

**2. Recent Announcements and Policies**

- As of May 2025, industry best practices focus on incremental mitigation: prompt engineering, self-checking, refusal triggers, and segment-level corrective fine-tuning[2][3][5].
- There have been no public claims or pre-release announcements from OpenAI or third-party verifications that any product/API achieves the required factuality levels[3][5].

**3. Authoritative Sources for Verification**

- OpenAI’s official evals, peer-reviewed publications on factuality benchmarks (e.g., TruthfulQA), and third-party benchmarks remain the gold standard for verification.
- Public product/API documentation and third-party user access are required for this forecast to resolve as YES.

**4. Limitations and Uncertainties**

- Measuring “hallucination” is inherently difficult, especially in open-ended domains, and may vary with evaluation protocols[3][5].
- Some mitigation techniques improve accuracy on specific tasks but do not generalize to all domains[2][5].
- The last step—raising accuracy from ~75% to ≥95%—is far harder than earlier gains, due to diminishing returns and the complexity of grounding language models in external reality.

**Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment**

Given the state of the art as of May 2025, recent research progress, and the absence of any announcements or verifiable claims approaching the required thresholds, the probability that OpenAI will release a product/API that hallucinates 5× less than GPT-4 by June 30, 2025, is **low (<10%)**.
