### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- **GPT-4 Baseline (2023):** At release, GPT-4 achieved approximately 75% on OpenAI’s internal adversarial factuality evaluations and 59% on the public TruthfulQA benchmark, with hallucination rates significantly improved over GPT-3.5 but still leaving substantial room for error[1][3].
- **Recent Progress (2024–2025):** Industry efforts have focused on techniques like retrieval-augmented generation, chain-of-thought prompting, and systematic knowledge verification, all shown to reduce hallucinations but with diminishing returns as accuracy increases[1][5].
- **State of the Art (May 2025):** The best-known LLM, Google’s Gemini-2.0-Flash-001, reportedly achieves a 0.7% hallucination rate (i.e., 99.3% accuracy) in certain settings, setting a new industry standard. However, this is not an OpenAI product[3].

### Key Differences Affecting the Forecast

- **Current OpenAI LLMs:** As of May 2025, there is no public evidence or announcement of an OpenAI LLM (product or API) claiming to score ≥95% on internal factuality evaluations or ≥92% on TruthfulQA. OpenAI’s recent releases have not been cited as matching or exceeding Google’s top performance[3].
- **General-purpose vs. Specialized Models:** Industry analysis suggests that specialized LLMs (e.g., for medicine or law) may reach higher factual accuracy before general-purpose chatbots do. The resolution criteria require a general-purpose OpenAI LLM product/API publicly available or in beta[3].
- **Slowdown in Progress:** Expert forecasts note that as LLMs approach very high factual accuracy, further improvements become exponentially harder, requiring significant research investment and possibly new architectures[3].

### Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

- **Probability (as of May 25, 2025):** Given no public claims or releases from OpenAI matching the specified thresholds, and the current industry leadership held by Google, the probability that OpenAI will release such a product/API by the June 30, 2025 deadline is **very low**—likely less than 10%.
- **Uncertainties:** It remains possible (but not evidenced) that a last-minute release or beta could occur, or that OpenAI could introduce a highly specialized factuality-optimized product. No such announcements have been observed as of late May 2025.

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- OpenAI’s official blog, release notes, or API documentation (for claims of factuality scores).
- Independent benchmarks and third-party evaluations on TruthfulQA and OpenAI’s internal evals.
- Industry news and major AI research reporting on LLM accuracy milestones.

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- **Measurement Consistency:** Internal evals are not always public, and TruthfulQA scores can vary with prompt engineering and model configuration.
- **Disclosure:** OpenAI may choose not to publicly disclose eval results even if achieved.
- **Specialized Products:** A highly factual, domain-limited LLM could meet the threshold, but would need to be released as a public product/API.
