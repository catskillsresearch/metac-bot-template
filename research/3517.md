# Forecasting Global Thermonuclear War by 2070

As of January 23, 2020, the question of whether there will be a global thermonuclear war by 2070 requires careful analysis of historical patterns, current geopolitical tensions, and probabilistic reasoning. This assessment examines the available evidence and provides a forecast based on information available at this time.

## Historical Context

Since the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945, nuclear weapons have not been used in warfare, creating what some experts refer to as "nuclear peace." This 75-year period without nuclear warfare represents an important baseline for our analysis. During this time, however, there have been several close calls:

- The Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962 brought the world to the brink of nuclear war
- Multiple incidents of false alarms in early warning systems
- Accidents involving nuclear weapons that could have resulted in detonation
- Periods of heightened tensions during the Cold War

The resolution criteria for this question set a high threshold: either three countries each detonating at least 10 nuclear devices or two countries each detonating at least 50 nuclear devices outside their territories. This definition specifically excludes limited regional nuclear conflicts.

## Current Status and Risk Factors (as of 2020)

### Nuclear Arsenal Status

As of early 2020, nine countries possess nuclear weapons:
- United States
- Russia
- China
- United Kingdom
- France
- India
- Pakistan
- Israel (suspected)
- North Korea

These arsenals vary significantly in size, with the US and Russia maintaining the largest stockpiles by far.

### Key Risk Factors

Several factors contribute to the risk assessment:

**Escalation Pathways**: Historical analysis suggests that conventional conflicts between nuclear powers can potentially escalate to nuclear use, particularly if one side faces existential threats or significant military defeats.

**Annual Probability**: Based on available analyses, experts estimate approximately a 1.1% chance of nuclear war per year, with an 85% chance that such a war would escalate to meet the criteria specified in this question[1].

**Cumulative Risk**: Mathematical modeling suggests there is a 50% chance that nuclear peace will last at least 25 years, but no more than 225 years from the present[2]. This places the median timeframe for potential nuclear conflict within the period covered by this question (2020-2070).

## Probabilistic Assessment

Using the available data points, we can generate a probabilistic forecast:

1. If we apply the 1.1% annual probability estimate[1], the cumulative probability of nuclear war by 2070 (50 years from 2020) can be calculated as:
   
   P(war by 2070) = 1 - (1 - 0.011)^50 ≈ 0.42 or 42%

2. Given the resolution criteria's high threshold and the estimate that 85% of nuclear conflicts would escalate to meet these criteria[1], the adjusted probability becomes:
   
   P(global thermonuclear war by 2070) = 0.42 × 0.85 ≈ 0.36 or 36%

3. However, this simple calculation assumes a constant annual risk, which may not accurately reflect changing geopolitical dynamics, technological developments, or evolving nuclear doctrines.

## Key Uncertainties and Limitations

Several factors create significant uncertainty in this forecast:

1. **Deterrence Stability**: The effectiveness of nuclear deterrence could either strengthen or weaken over the coming decades.

2. **Proliferation Trends**: Additional countries acquiring nuclear weapons could increase complexity and risk.

3. **Technological Developments**: Advances in missile defense, cyber capabilities, and conventional precision weapons could affect nuclear stability.

4. **Black Swan Events**: Low-probability, high-impact events such as accidental launches or non-state actor acquisition of nuclear weapons are inherently difficult to forecast.

5. **Data Limitations**: Expert estimates vary widely on nuclear risk probabilities, indicating significant epistemic uncertainty.

## Conclusion

Based on the information available as of January 23, 2020, the probability of a global thermonuclear war occurring by 2070 appears to be in the range of 30-40%. This estimate carries substantial uncertainty and should be interpreted as a rough assessment rather than a precise prediction.

The historical record of 75 years without nuclear warfare provides some evidence for the stability of nuclear deterrence, but the cumulative probability over a 50-year forecast horizon remains concerning. The persistence of nuclear arsenals, ongoing geopolitical tensions, and the potential for technological disruption all contribute to this risk assessment.
