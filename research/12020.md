**Key Historical Trends and Current Status**

- The United Kingdom was a member of the European Economic Area (EEA) from January 1994 until December 2020, by virtue of its EU membership. The UK ceased to be a party to the EEA Agreement after leaving the EU on January 31, 2020, and fully exited the single market at the end of the Brexit transition period on December 31, 2020[4][5].
- The EEA comprises all EU countries plus Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway (EFTA members). Switzerland, while an EFTA member, is not in the EEA, but accesses the single market through separate bilateral agreements[1][3][5].
- The UK is the only country to have left the EEA to date[5].

**Reference Cases and Comparisons**

| Country         | EEA Membership | EFTA Membership | Single Market Access |
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Iceland         | Yes           | Yes             | Yes                 |
| Norway          | Yes           | Yes             | Yes                 |
| Liechtenstein   | Yes           | Yes             | Yes                 |
| Switzerland     | No            | Yes             | Partial (bilateral) |
| United Kingdom  | No            | No              | No                  |

- New EEA/EFTA membership has only occurred among smaller European states, and accession (e.g., Croatia) can be slow, requiring the agreement of all EEA/EFTA members[5].
- Switzerland’s arrangement demonstrates that access to the single market without EEA membership is possible, but only through a complex, bespoke set of treaties[1][5].

**Key Differences Affecting the Forecast**

- UK government policy since 2017 has explicitly rejected permanent single market or EEA membership as incompatible with Brexit’s goals, particularly around sovereignty and freedom of movement[4].
- Public and political discourse continues regarding rejoining the single market or EEA. Opinion polling since 2020 has shown narrow or increasing support for closer ties with the EU, especially among younger age cohorts[Description].
- To rejoin the EEA as a non-EU member, the UK would need to join EFTA, which requires approval from current EFTA states, and then all EEA parties must ratify UK accession[5].
- EFTA states might be cautious about UK accession, given its size and complex relationship with the EU[4].
- Changes in UK domestic politics, such as a government or public majority in favor of closer economic integration with Europe, could shift the policy stance.

**Recent Announcements/Policies**

- No major UK government moves toward EEA or EFTA membership have been announced as of August 2022. The official position remains outside the single market[4].
- The completion of the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement in December 2020 formalized the UK’s position outside both the EU and EEA[2][4].

**Limitations and Uncertainties**

- Polling suggests generational divides may affect future political will, but public opinion is not currently overwhelmingly in favor of EEA membership[Description].
- EEA accession is a multistep, multilateral process, with potential legal, political, and diplomatic hurdles.
- The EFTA states and EU hold veto power over new EEA accessions, adding uncertainty.
- Potential UK return to EEA would likely require significant changes in domestic political priorities or external economic pressures.

**Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment**

- Given the UK’s clear policy stance as of 2022, the complexity of rejoining the EEA as a non-EU member, and the lack of precedent for a country of the UK’s size and influence joining EFTA/EEA after having left, the probability of the UK joining the EEA before 2040 appears **low** as of August 2022.
- However, a non-negligible probability remains, primarily due to:
  - Demographic trends in public opinion,
  - The possibility of future political realignment,
  - The precedent of slow but eventual EEA expansion (e.g., Croatia’s protracted process).

A rough probabilistic estimate, based on available facts as of August 2022, would place the likelihood of the UK joining the EEA before 2040 at **below 20%**.
