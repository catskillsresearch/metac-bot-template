# Forecasting Influenza A Prevalence for the 2024-25 Season Through December 21, 2024

The question asks whether the CDC will report more than 80% of tested influenza sequences as influenza A during the 2024-25 season through the week ending December 21, 2024. To address this question, I'll analyze historical trends, current projections, and relevant factors that may influence influenza type distribution.

## Historical Trends and Current Status

### Recent Seasonal Patterns

During the 2023-2024 influenza season, 69.2% of specimens tested positive for influenza A and 30.8% for influenza B viruses[3]. This represents a significantly lower proportion of influenza A compared to the previous two seasons, where influenza A comprised 98.2% (2022-23) and 98.4% (2021-22) of positive specimens.

The timing of peak activity for influenza types in the 2023-2024 season is particularly relevant:
- Influenza A peaked in late December 2023
- Influenza B peaked in late February 2024[3]

This timing pattern contributed to a sustained period of elevated influenza activity overall, with the percentage of specimens testing positive ranging from 0.4% to 18.3%, peaking during the week ending December 30, 2023[3].

### Influenza A Subtypes

In the 2023-2024 season, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 was the predominant virus circulating[3]. This is significant because different influenza A subtypes can affect transmission patterns and population immunity.

## Projections for the 2024-2025 Season

The CDC has released several projections for the 2024-2025 respiratory disease season:

1. The CDC projects that the peak hospitalization rate due to influenza will be similar to or lower than that of the 2023-2024 season rate of 8.9 weekly laboratory-confirmed hospitalizations per 100,000, with moderate confidence[2].

2. Overall, the CDC expects that the 2024-2025 fall and winter virus season will likely have a similar or lower number of combined peak hospitalizations from flu, COVID-19, and RSV compared to the previous season[4].

3. As of October 2024, overall respiratory virus activity remained low nationwide, with COVID-19 cases declining and low flu and RSV activity[4].

## Factors Affecting Influenza Type Distribution

Several factors may influence whether influenza A exceeds 80% of positive specimens through December 21, 2024:

### Historical Wave Patterns

Looking at a 25-year historical perspective, 11 seasons had two waves of influenza activity, and 8 of those seasons had their second wave come from influenza B. This suggests that when a second wave occurs, it is more likely to be influenza B than influenza A.

### Vaccination Coverage

Vaccination coverage may influence the distribution of influenza types. As of mid-October 2024, 19.6% of adults 18 years or older had received the 2024-25 seasonal influenza vaccine[5]. The CDC noted that vaccination rates were expected to increase as the season progressed.

For the 2024-2025 season, manufacturers projected they would supply the United States with as many as 148 million doses of flu vaccine[1]. The trivalent (three-component) vaccine for the 2024-25 flu season targets two influenza A strains and one influenza B strain, which may affect the relative prevalence of these types.

### Timing Considerations

The question specifically asks about the period through December 21, 2024. Based on the 2023-2024 season, influenza A peaked in late December while influenza B peaked later in February[3]. If this pattern repeats, the period through December 21 would likely capture primarily the influenza A wave and might miss much of the influenza B activity.

## Analysis and Forecast

Based on the available data, several factors suggest that influenza A might not exceed 80% of positive specimens through December 21, 2024:

1. The most recent complete season (2023-2024) had only 69.2% influenza A, well below the 80% threshold.

2. While the two seasons before that (2021-22 and 2022-23) had very high influenza A percentages (over 98%), the most recent season may be more predictive of the current pattern.

3. The CDC projections suggest similar patterns to the 2023-2024 season for the 2024-2025 season.

However, factors that might support influenza A exceeding 80% include:

1. The timing window (through December 21) may capture primarily the influenza A wave, as influenza B typically peaks later in the season.

2. Historical variability in influenza seasons means that the type distribution can change significantly from year to year.

3. The CDC notes that "past seasons have varied widely in the number of illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths, depending on the subtypes circulating, population immunity to different subtypes, and vaccine effectiveness against circulating subtypes"[2].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several uncertainties could affect this forecast:

1. Influenza seasons are inherently variable and difficult to predict with precision.

2. The emergence of new variants or shifts in circulating subtypes could dramatically alter the distribution of influenza types.

3. Vaccination rates and effectiveness against specific strains will influence outcomes but are not fully known in advance.

4. The CDC notes that population immunity patterns and vaccine effectiveness against circulating subtypes can significantly impact seasonal patterns[2].
