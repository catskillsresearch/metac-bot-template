# Historical Temperature Patterns in San Francisco for December

Based on historical data and recent trends, I'll analyze the likelihood of San Francisco experiencing temperatures below 40°F in December 2024.

## Historical Temperature Records

San Francisco has historically experienced temperatures below 40°F during December, though such occurrences are relatively uncommon. The all-time record low temperature for San Francisco was 27°F (-3°C), recorded on December 11, 1932, which coincided with a rare snowfall that actually accumulated on the ground[1][2]. This remains one of the coldest days in the city's recorded history.

More recently, on December 5, 2013, San Francisco tied a record low of 40°F for that specific date[3]. This record was originally set in 1972, indicating that temperatures at or below 40°F do occur periodically in December. During this same cold snap, surrounding Bay Area locations experienced even colder temperatures:

- Oakland: 33°F (record low for the date)
- San Rafael: 30°F (record low for the date)
- San Jose: 29°F (tied record low)
- Morgan Hill: 16°F
- Graton (Sonoma County): 16°F
- Napa: 19°F[3]

## Recent December Temperature Trends

According to the question details, December temperatures in recent years show:

- December 2022: Lowest recorded temperature was 40°F
- December 2023: Lowest recorded temperature was 46.13°F

This indicates significant year-to-year variability in December minimum temperatures. The 6°F difference between these consecutive years demonstrates that San Francisco's winter temperatures can fluctuate substantially.

## Microclimates and Geographic Considerations

San Francisco's unique geography creates microclimates that often keep the city proper warmer than surrounding areas. During the 2013 cold snap, a freeze warning was issued for the entire Bay Area except San Francisco[3]. This suggests that while surrounding areas may experience sub-freezing temperatures, San Francisco itself often remains slightly warmer due to its proximity to the ocean and the heat-retaining properties of its urban environment.

## Likelihood Assessment for December 2024

Based on historical data, temperatures below 40°F in San Francisco during December are possible but not guaranteed every year. The fact that December 2022 reached exactly 40°F while December 2023 stayed above 46°F shows recent variability.

Several factors support the possibility of sub-40°F temperatures in December 2024:

1. Historical precedent exists for December temperatures well below 40°F
2. The recent occurrence of 40°F in December 2022 shows such temperatures remain possible in the modern climate
3. December is typically one of the coldest months in San Francisco

However, factors suggesting temperatures might stay above 40°F include:

1. The warming trend seen in December 2023 (minimum of 46.13°F)
2. San Francisco's microclimate often keeps it warmer than surrounding areas
3. General climate warming trends may reduce the frequency of very cold days

## Conclusion

Historical records clearly show that San Francisco can experience temperatures at or below 40°F in December, with the record low being 27°F in 1932. More recently, December 2022 reached 40°F exactly. Given this historical context and the significant year-to-year variability observed between 2022 and 2023, it is certainly possible but not guaranteed that San Francisco will experience temperatures below 40°F in December 2024.

For definitive resolution, temperature data from the downtown San Francisco weather station (SFOC1) as reported by Iowa State University's Environmental Mesonet will need to be monitored throughout December 2024.
