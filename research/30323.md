### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Google/Alphabet has experienced several rounds of layoffs in 2024, with Tech Crunch reporting significant cuts in January (over 1,000 jobs), May (staff from Flutter, Dart, and Python teams), and July (large global cuts in Cloud teams)[1][4][5].
- The most recent confirmed layoff event for Google/Alphabet on the Tech Crunch tracker is in July 2024, specifically mentioning global cuts across Cloud teams[1].
- As of the knowledge cutoff (November 20, 2024), there are no Tech Crunch tracker entries for Google or Alphabet layoffs in October, November, or December 2024.

### Recent Announcements and Policies

- In January 2024, Google CEO Sundar Pichai warned staff that more layoffs were expected throughout the year, but emphasized these would not be as large as the 2023 cuts and would be more targeted[3].
- Google has cited ongoing organizational changes and resource allocation as reasons for continued, but smaller-scale, layoffs in 2024[3].
- No public announcements or credible reports indicate that further layoffs at Google/Alphabet have occurred or are planned for the final quarter of 2024, as per Tech Crunch’s reporting up to the knowledge cutoff.

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Tech Crunch’s “A comprehensive list of 2024 tech layoffs” is the sole source for resolution, and it is regularly updated to reflect new layoff events[1].
- The tracker explicitly lists Google/Alphabet for layoffs in January, May, and July 2024, but not for October, November, or December 2024 as of the knowledge cutoff[1].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- The question’s resolution depends entirely on the Tech Crunch tracker’s updates. If the tracker ceases to update after the question launch, the answer defaults to "No" regardless of other evidence.
- Layoffs at subsidiaries or teams not explicitly labeled as “Google” or “Alphabet” on the tracker will not count for resolution.
- There is always a possibility of new layoffs being announced and reported after the knowledge cutoff, but no such events are documented as of November 20, 2024.

**Summary:**  
As of November 20, 2024, Tech Crunch’s tracker does not list any new layoffs at Google or Alphabet for October, November, or December 2024. While there have been multiple rounds of layoffs earlier in the year and leadership has warned of ongoing restructuring, no evidence exists of further layoffs being reported by Tech Crunch in the relevant period. The answer will ultimately depend on whether the tracker is updated with new Google/Alphabet layoffs before December 31, 2024.
