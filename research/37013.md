## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- In August 2024, Sri Lanka’s Telecommunications Regulatory Commission granted Starlink a license to operate, signaling an initial regulatory green light for satellite broadband services in the country[4].
- Starlink service was officially announced to launch in Sri Lanka in April 2025, with government officials and the Director General of the regulator confirming these plans[5].
- Starlink’s Sri Lanka residential service page is live, listing service and hardware pricing in Sri Lankan rupees, indicating technical and commercial readiness[3].

## Recent Announcements and Policy Changes

- As of May 2025, reports indicate the Sri Lankan government is stalling Starlink’s rollout due to unresolved security and sovereignty concerns, despite earlier regulatory approval and public launch plans[2].
- There is no public indication that these concerns have been resolved as of May 16, 2025.

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The [Starlink Availability Map][1] is the definitive source for determining if Sri Lanka is listed as "Available" before July 1, 2025.
- Local and international news sources tracking regulatory decisions and Starlink’s rollout provide context on political developments[2][4][5].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- The regulatory stall introduces significant uncertainty. While technical and initial regulatory milestones have been met, political factors could prevent Starlink’s map from showing Sri Lanka as "Available" in time.
- In other countries, similar stalls have been resolved within weeks or months, but some remain unresolved for longer periods.
- The Starlink map’s update timing may lag behind actual service commencement or regulatory resolution.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

- Given the initial regulatory approval, technical readiness, and planned April 2025 launch, the probability of Starlink listing Sri Lanka as "Available" before July 1, 2025, would have been high.
- The recent regulatory stall as of mid-May 2025, with no sign of imminent resolution, significantly reduces the probability.
- Barring rapid negotiations, the probability is now best assessed as **moderate but uncertain**—roughly a 40–55% chance that Sri Lanka will appear as "Available" on the Starlink map before July 1, 2025, depending on how quickly the government’s concerns are addressed.
