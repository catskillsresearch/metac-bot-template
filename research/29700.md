# Forecasting John Thune's Succession as Republican Senate Leader

As of November 2024, the race to succeed Mitch McConnell as the Republican leader in the Senate is approaching its conclusion. After nearly 20 years of McConnell's leadership, Senate Republicans are preparing to select a new leader through a secret ballot election scheduled for mid-November 2024[5]. This analysis examines the key factors that may influence whether John Thune will emerge victorious.

## Current Candidates and Standing

Three senators are officially vying to succeed McConnell:

- **John Thune** (South Dakota), current Senate Minority Whip
- **John Cornyn** (Texas), former whip and noted fundraiser
- **Rick Scott** (Florida), Trump ally[1][2]

Among these candidates, Thune and Cornyn are widely considered the frontrunners, with Scott generally viewed as a "spoiler candidate" who could potentially influence the final outcome rather than win outright[5].

## Thune's Advantages

Several factors position Thune favorably in this leadership contest:

1. **Current Leadership Position**: As the Senate Minority Whip, Thune currently holds the second-highest Republican leadership position, giving him a perceived edge in the race[5].

2. **Strategic Campaign**: Thune has been methodically building support, having "jumped out to a pace meant to exhaust his rivals." His campaign strategy has included:
   - Pledging a record-setting $4 million to the Senate GOP's campaign arm
   - Holding individual meetings with every Republican colleague to secure support
   - Traveling extensively across the country to support Republican Senate candidates[1]

3. **Experience**: Thune has served in the Senate for over 20 years, having first won his seat in 2004 when he defeated then-Democratic leader Tom Daschle[3].

## Competitive Dynamics

Despite Thune's advantages, the leadership race remains highly competitive:

1. **Close Contest**: The race between Thune and Cornyn is described as fairly close, with Thune having only a "narrow edge"[5].

2. **Similar Candidates**: Little differentiates the two leading candidates in substance or style. Both Thune and Cornyn are described as "genteel and well-liked" and are "seen as substantive policy players and savvy political operators"[5].

3. **Secret Ballot**: The leadership election will be conducted by secret ballot, making the outcome "deeply uncertain"[1]. This format allows senators to vote their conscience without public scrutiny.

## Potential Challenges for Thune

Several factors could complicate Thune's path to leadership:

1. **Trump Factor**: Thune has had a complex relationship with former President Trump, having "at times defied Trump's wishes." This positioning creates a "delicate pose" for Thune as he must balance traditional Republican values with the current direction of the party under Trump's influence[1].

2. **Party Evolution**: Thune's candidacy represents a test of "whether someone like Thune, who defines himself by the party's traditional values and has at times defied Trump's wishes, can still rise to power" in the current Republican Party[1].

3. **Competitive Rivals**: Both Cornyn and Scott bring significant strengths to the race. Cornyn is described as a "strong fundraiser" with previous leadership experience as whip, while Scott is positioned as a Trump ally[1].

## Timeline and Process

The leadership election is expected to take place after the November 2024 general election, with senators returning to Washington in mid-November to cast their votes[5]. This timing means the outcome will be influenced by the results of the general election, including which party controls the Senate and which Republican senators are returned to office.

## Conclusion

While John Thune appears to have a slight advantage in the race to succeed Mitch McConnell as Senate Republican leader, the outcome remains uncertain. His current leadership position, strategic campaign efforts, and extensive experience provide him with significant advantages. However, the competitive nature of the race, the secret ballot format, and the evolving dynamics of the Republican Party under Trump's influence all introduce elements of unpredictability. The mid-November leadership vote will ultimately determine whether Thune can secure enough support from his colleagues to become the next Republican Senate leader.
