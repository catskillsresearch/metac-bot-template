## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of April 12, 2020, states totaling 196 electoral votes had enacted the NPVIC, about 73% of the 270 required for the compact to take effect[2][5].
- The compact was first adopted in 2007. Progress accelerated in the late 2010s, with a record four states joining in 2019[5].
- By early 2025, the compact had reached 209 electoral votes (including 18 jurisdictions: 17 states and D.C.), or 77% of the threshold[1][2][5]. This means only 61 more electoral votes are needed for activation[1][5].

## Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Metric

- As of February 2025, NPVIC bills had passed at least one chamber in seven additional states (representing 74 electoral votes), but not yet fully enacted in those states[5].
- Despite growing public support (58% nationally in a 2020 Pew poll), legislative action has largely stalled in Republican or swing states, which are less likely to join in the near term[5].
- No major Republican-led state had joined the compact by 2025, and the remaining available electoral votes are disproportionately in states where passage is politically unlikely[1][2].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- **Legal Challenges:** There is legal debate over whether the compact requires congressional approval under the U.S. Constitutionâ€™s Compact Clause, or whether it would face court challenges if enacted[2].
- **Political Headwinds:** Most of the remaining electoral votes are in Republican-leaning states, where legislative approval is unlikely given current partisan divides on the issue[2][5].
- **Public Support vs. Legislative Action:** While national polling shows majority support, state-level legislative action depends on local politics, making further progress incremental and uncertain[5].
- **Measurement:** The metric depends on the number of electoral votes in states that have fully enacted the compact, not just introduced or partially passed legislation.

## Probabilistic Assessment

Given the rate of progress (13 electoral votes gained from 2020 to 2025), with most remaining large states showing little movement and persistent legal/political barriers, the probability that the NPVIC will reach 270 electoral votes before 2030 is moderate but declining. Progress has slowed as the compact approaches its goal, and the remaining states required are among the least likely to join. 

**Adjusted forecast:** There is a less than 50% chance that the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact will reach a majority in the Electoral College before 2030, unless there are significant shifts in state-level politics or national party strategies in the coming years.
