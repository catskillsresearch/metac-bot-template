## 1. Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of July 2024, the largest company (Apple) holds about 3.1% of the world’s total market capitalization, with no historical precedent for any single company—AI or otherwise—dominating even a tenth of global GDP or market cap[1].
- The generative AI market reached $25.6 billion in 2024, with rapid adoption but still a small fraction of the global economy[2].
- Five major tech companies (Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta, Amazon, Oracle) have invested nearly $200 billion in AI infrastructure, leading the global race for AI and AGI capabilities[1][5].

## 2. Recent Announcements and Policies

- Big Tech’s AI strategies involve massive infrastructure build-outs, open-source contributions (e.g., Meta’s PyTorch, LLaMA models), and integration of AI across diverse platforms and services[5].
- Regulatory and public scrutiny of AI has increased, with governments signaling intent to monitor, regulate, or intervene in cases of excessive market power or risks to public welfare.
- No single company has yet demonstrated the capacity to consolidate enough economic output to approach the 50% value-added threshold required for dominance as defined in the resolution criteria[1][2][5].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- CompaniesMarketCap.com provides real-time data on the world’s largest companies (market cap).
- IoT Analytics, TechPolicy Press, and Unite.AI track AI investment, market size, and company ambitions[1][2][5].
- SCSP.ai and other think tanks analyze AGI trends and national/international policy response[4].

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- Measuring “value-added” by a single AI company is challenging, especially when AI systems are widely licensed, integrated, or open-sourced.
- Attribution of economic output in complex global supply chains complicates assessment of true company influence.
- Government intervention, antitrust enforcement, and open-source diffusion are likely to hinder any single company’s path to majority global economic output.
- The scenario where an AI system is spread across companies but centrally coordinated introduces further ambiguity, likely requiring resolution by expert committee per Metaculus protocol.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

While AGI could, in theory, enable unprecedented economic concentration, all available evidence as of mid-2025 points to a highly competitive, multi-player environment among a small number of “hyperscaler” firms rather than single-company dominance. Regulatory, political, and practical barriers remain formidable. The probability that a single AI company will account for over 50% of world economic value-added within five years after AGI is therefore **very low—well under 5%** under current trajectories. The most likely outcome is continued oligopolistic competition, with government action to prevent extreme concentration.
