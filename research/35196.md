# Forecast Analysis: Nitroglycerin Injection Shortage Status for April 1, 2025

Based on the available information prior to February 20, 2025, I'll analyze the likelihood of nitroglycerin injections being in shortage according to the FDA on April 1, 2025.

## Historical Context and Current Status

Nitroglycerin injection has experienced shortages in the past. Historical data indicates that Hospira discontinued nitroglycerin injection, and Baxter had nitroglycerin premixes on shortage due to raw material supply issues[4]. Nitroglycerin is a critical vasodilating agent used in conditions such as cardiac arrest to increase the flow of oxygenated blood through blood vessels[4].

The American Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP) maintains a comprehensive drug shortages list that includes current shortages with estimated resupply dates[2]. However, the available data does not specifically indicate whether nitroglycerin injections will be in shortage on April 1, 2025.

## Recent Developments

As of the information available before February 20, 2025, there is no specific mention of nitroglycerin injections in the most recent drug shortage lists that extend to future dates. The Drug Shortage PIN List that extends to May 1, 2025, does not explicitly mention nitroglycerin injections[3].

The pharmaceutical industry has been experiencing what some professionals describe as "the worst drug shortage crisis" they've seen, with multiple products affected[5]. This broader context suggests an environment where drug shortages remain a significant concern.

## Forecast Limitations

Several limitations affect the ability to make a definitive forecast:

1. The available information does not provide specific FDA status updates for nitroglycerin injections with projected dates extending to April 1, 2025.

2. Historical shortage information for nitroglycerin injections is available, but more recent status updates specific to this medication are not present in the provided data.

3. Drug shortage situations can change rapidly based on manufacturing issues, raw material availability, and regulatory decisions.

## Conclusion

Based solely on the information available before February 20, 2025, there is insufficient data to make a definitive forecast about whether nitroglycerin injections will be in shortage according to the FDA on April 1, 2025. The historical context suggests that nitroglycerin injections have been prone to shortages in the past, and the broader pharmaceutical supply chain has been experiencing significant challenges, but specific forward-looking information about this particular medication's status for April 2025 is not available in the provided sources.

For the most accurate and up-to-date information, healthcare professionals should consult the FDA's drug shortage database and the ASHP's current shortages list closer to the date in question[5].
