### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of October 21, 2024, there is no verified public record or authoritative report confirming that a book written by a language model (meeting the specified criteria: 99% AI-generated main text, at least 20,000 words) has appeared on the New York Times Best Seller list[1][2].
- AI-generated books have become increasingly common, and there is growing discussion about their impact on the publishing industry and bestseller lists. However, most coverage focuses on the potential for disruption rather than confirmed cases of AI-authored books achieving bestseller status[1].
- The New York Times Best Seller list remains highly influential in the U.S. book market, but its methodology is not fully transparent. The list is curated and subject to editorial discretion, and there is no public evidence that the NYT tracks or discloses the authorship method (human vs. AI) for listed books[3].

### Recent Announcements and Policies

- There have been no public announcements or policy changes from the New York Times regarding the eligibility or treatment of AI-generated books for the Best Seller list as of the cutoff date.
- Industry discussions and online forums have speculated about the possibility of AI-written books making the list, but these are not substantiated by official sources or sales data[1].

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The New York Times Best Seller list itself, as published weekly, is the primary authoritative source for verification[2].
- Book industry sales tracking services such as BookScan provide data on book sales but do not specify authorship method (human or AI)[3].
- No official registry or public database exists that identifies books on the NYT list as AI-authored according to the strict criteria outlined in the question.

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- The NYT Best Seller list's selection process is partly opaque and subject to editorial judgment, which may affect the inclusion or recognition of AI-authored works[3].
- There is no standardized reporting or disclosure requirement for AI authorship in mainstream publishing, making it difficult to verify the authorship method for books on the list.
- Some books may be marketed as "AI-assisted" or "AI-generated," but unless the publisher or author explicitly states that the book meets the 99% AI-generated threshold, it is challenging to confirm compliance with the resolution criteria.

### Conclusion

Based on all available factual information as of October 21, 2024, there is no evidence that a book written by a language model (as defined in the question) has made the New York Times Best Seller list. While the possibility is widely discussed and AI-generated books are increasingly prevalent, no such event has been documented or verified by authoritative sources before 2025.
