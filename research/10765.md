## Factual Situation as of April 26, 2022

**Historical Trends and Current Status**
- As of April 2022, no Eurozone member state has ever exited the currency union. During the Eurozone debt crisis (2010–2015), Greece ("Grexit") was considered a candidate for exit, but ultimately remained.
- Despite Brexit (the UK's EU exit in 2020), no significant movement or legal framework for Eurozone exit has materialized among the 19 covered member states. Brexit’s negative economic impact was more pronounced on the UK than on the EU as a whole, and no Eurozone state has attempted to replicate this path[5].
- The Eurozone had been expanding, with Croatia on track to join in 2023, rather than contracting[4].

**Recent Announcements and Policies**
- The EU and Eurozone were recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2022, with moderate fiscal tightening but continued policy support to sustain growth[3].
- The Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 introduced economic shocks, especially via higher energy prices and inflation. However, forecasts projected only moderate output loss and a slowdown, not a systemic collapse[3].
- The ECB projected inflation to moderate towards its 2% target by 2026–2027, with economic pressures easing over time, suggesting stabilization rather than crisis[1].
- The EU’s GDP growth outlook was negative for 2030 (-0.36%), but not sharply so, and nowhere near the levels threatening the Eurozone’s existence[5].

**Key Differences Affecting the Forecast**
- Unlike during the Eurocrisis, as of 2022, no member state was under acute fiscal stress or had a government actively campaigning for Euro exit.
- The legal and political barriers to exiting the Eurozone remain extremely high, with no streamlined process for withdrawal.
- EU institutions have shown willingness to intervene and support member economies in periods of stress (e.g., via the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme and recovery funds).

**Limitations and Uncertainties**
- Forecasts depend on the absence of major unforeseen crises (e.g., severe financial, political, or social upheavals) that could spark anti-Euro sentiment or trigger an exit.
- Measurement is based on official announcements or credible media reports; informal or temporary arrangements could make resolution ambiguous.

## Probabilistic Assessment

Given the lack of precedent, continued expansion, and economic/political incentives to remain, the probability that any covered Eurozone member state leaves before 2030 is **very low** as of April 2022. While long-term stagnation or new crises could increase risk, no credible pathways or movements to exit existed at the time. An estimated probability for exit before 2030 would likely be **below 10%** based on available data.
