## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- In the 2019 Brandenburg state election, AfD secured 23.5% of the vote, establishing itself as a major political force in the state.
- In 2024, AfD has demonstrated significant growth in eastern Germany. In the September 2024 state elections, AfD won 32.8% in Thuringia (first place) and 30.6% in Saxony (second place), both neighboring states with similar political dynamics[2][3].
- Leading up to these elections, AfD was polling at around 30% in both Saxony and Thuringia, and their final results closely matched these figures, suggesting that polling has been a relatively accurate predictor of their performance in eastern states[2].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- No major new policies or announcements specific to Brandenburg are noted in the available sources. The broader context is one of rising voter discontent with the national government, which has benefited AfD across eastern Germany[3].
- AfD continues to campaign on its established themes of Euroscepticism, opposition to immigration, and criticism of the federal government, which have resonated with many voters in the region[2][3].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Official election results will be published by the Bundeswahlleiterin (Federal Returning Officer) and reported by major news outlets such as Politico and the Atlantic Council[1][2][3].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- The most recent, state-specific polling data for Brandenburg is not provided in the available sources, so the forecast must rely on recent results and trends in comparable eastern states.
- Voter turnout, last-minute campaign developments, and the performance of other right-wing parties (such as BSW) could influence AfD's final vote share.
- Polling errors, tactical voting, and local issues unique to Brandenburg may also affect the outcome.

## Summary

Based on AfD's recent performance—achieving just above 32% in Thuringia and just below in Saxony—and the general trend of rising support in eastern Germany, it is plausible that AfD could approach or slightly exceed 32% in Brandenburg. However, without specific Brandenburg polling, there remains uncertainty, and the final result could fall just above or below this threshold[2][3].
