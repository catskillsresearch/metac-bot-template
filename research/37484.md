## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Since post-Watergate reforms, the DOJ has required U.S. attorneys to consult with the Public Integrity Section (PIN) before prosecuting lawmakers, to provide centralized, non-partisan oversight and prevent politically motivated prosecutions[1][3].
- This requirement is codified in the Justice Manual and has been consistently followed, as evidenced by recent cases as of June 2025 where PIN approval was still required and documented[2].

## 2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- As of June 2025, DOJ leadership is actively revising the relevant section of its policy. During this revision, **the consultation requirement is suspended**; U.S. attorneys are not currently required to consult with PIN before prosecuting lawmakers, but this suspension is not a permanent policy change[3].
- Media reports and congressional correspondence confirm that the Justice Department, under the Trump administration, is considering formally removing the requirement[4].
- The official Justice Manual explicitly notes: "The Consultation Requirement is suspended while revisions are ongoing. [June 2025]"[3].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- DOJ Justice Manual, section 9-85.000 and 9-85.210, as updated in June 2025[3].
- Official DOJ Public Integrity Section webpage[1].
- Congressional correspondence confirming PIN approval still required in recent practice[2].
- Lawfare and other legal news outlets reporting on the proposed changes[4].

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- The requirement is currently **suspended**, not rescinded. Suspension is temporary and reversible; only a formal announcement, DOJ memorandum, or Justice Manual update eliminating the requirement would resolve the question as "Yes".
- The ongoing review could result in reinstatement, modification, or formal removal of the requirement. Political and public scrutiny could influence the final outcome.
- There is uncertainty regarding the timeline—policy reviews can be protracted, and changes may be delayed or reversed by subsequent DOJ leadership.
- The forecast’s resolution requires a formal, nationwide policy removal, not just non-enforcement or partial/temporary suspension.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the current suspension of the PIN consultation requirement and the DOJ’s active reconsideration under a Trump administration reportedly motivated to increase prosecutorial discretion, the probability that the DOJ will **officially remove** the requirement before November 4, 2026, is **moderately elevated**. However, the lack of a formal rescission as of June 2025 and the potential for policy reversal due to political pressure or changes in leadership mean this is far from certain. 

**Estimated probability: 55–70%.**
