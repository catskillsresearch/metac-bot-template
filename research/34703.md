### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Starbucks has invested heavily in AI-driven personalization and operational efficiency, notably through its Deep Brew initiative and the My Starbucks Barista feature, which allows users to order via messaging or voice within the Starbucks app itself[2][3][4].
- Starbucks continues to improve its mobile ordering experience, including scheduled orders and real-time customization, but these features are accessed through the Starbucks app or website, not via third-party AI agents[1][5].
- Starbucks' AI features are designed to streamline internal operations and enhance customer experience within its own digital ecosystem, not to enable external AI agents to place orders on behalf of users[3][4].

### Recent Announcements/Policies

- As of January 2025, Starbucks is focused on optimizing mobile ordering and in-store fulfillment, with no public announcements about opening its ordering APIs to external AI agents or chatbots like Claude[1][5].
- There is no evidence that Anthropic's Claude has been integrated with Starbucks or delivery services such as DoorDash to autonomously place orders for users via the main chat interface.

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Starbucks' own digital ordering improvements and AI initiatives are well-documented, but all are internal to Starbucks' platforms[1][2][3][4][5].
- No credible reports or press releases from Anthropic, Starbucks, or major tech news outlets indicate that Claude can place Starbucks delivery orders as described in the resolution criteria.

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- If Starbucks or Anthropic were to announce such a feature after February 8, 2025, it would not be covered by this assessment.
- The answer is based on public information; private pilots or unannounced features cannot be ruled out but are not verifiable.
- The requirement that the order be placed solely through the main chat interface, without plugins or additional user action, is a high technical and regulatory bar that has not been met as of early 2025.

### Conclusion

Based on all available factual information before February 8, 2025, there is no evidence that Claude can autonomously order a Starbucks delivery for a user in North America via the main chat interface, as described in the resolution criteria. Therefore, the answer is **No**.
