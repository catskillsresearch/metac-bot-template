## Key Factual Information as of August 23, 2024

- **Current CDC Assessment:** As of July 8, 2024, the CDC assesses the risk of mpox to the US general public as "Very Low." This is the most recent published qualitative assessment[1][2].
- **Recent Developments:** The World Health Organization (WHO) declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on August 14, 2024, due to an upsurge of clade I mpox cases in Central and Eastern Africa. However, there are no known clade I mpox cases in the United States as of August 23, 2024[1].
- **CDC Statements and Surveillance:** The CDC and the Biden-Harris Administration emphasize that the risk to most Americans remains very low. The US has expanded its surveillance, diagnostic testing, and vaccination capacity to detect and respond rapidly to any imported cases[1][2].
- **CDC Health Alert (August 7, 2024):** The CDC reiterates that the risk of clade I mpox spreading to the United States is "very low at this time." Recommendations are targeted at travelers to affected regions and high-risk groups, not the general public[2].
- **No Domestic Cases:** There are no reported clade I mpox cases in the US as of August 23, 2024. The CDC continues to monitor the situation and update guidance as needed[1][2][4].
- **International Comparison:** The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) assesses the risk to the general population in the EU/EEA as "low," with higher risk only for specific subgroups (e.g., close contacts, people with multiple sexual partners, immunocompromised individuals)[5].
- **CDC Risk Assessment Update:** The CDC is working to update its July 8, 2024, risk assessment in response to the international situation, but no new assessment has been published as of August 23, 2024[1].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- The CDC could revise its risk assessment if new cases are detected in the US or if the epidemiological situation changes rapidly.
- The current assessment is based on available data as of August 23, 2024. Unforeseen developments (e.g., importation of cases, local transmission) could prompt a reassessment.

## Authoritative Sources

- CDC official risk assessments and Health Alert Network updates[1][2].
- US government fact sheets and surveillance data[1][4].
- ECDC risk assessments for international context[5].

## Conclusion

As of August 23, 2024, all available evidence indicates that the CDC assesses the risk of mpox to the US general public as "Very Low," with no known domestic cases and robust surveillance in place. Unless there is a significant change in the epidemiological situation (such as importation or local transmission), it is unlikely that the CDC will raise the risk assessment above "Very Low" before October 1, 2024.
