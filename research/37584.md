# San Diego Rent Forecast Analysis: May 2025

Based on the available data as of June 3, 2025, I can provide a comprehensive analysis of the year-over-year rent change in San Diego for May 2025.

## Current Situation

According to Zillow's rental data, San Diego's rental market has experienced a **significant decrease** in May 2025 compared to the previous year. The average rent in San Diego for May 2025 is $2,795, down from $3,000 in May 2024[4]. This represents a **year-over-year decrease of approximately 6.8%**.

This local trend stands in stark contrast to the national rental market, where the U.S. typical rent (measured by Zillow Observed Rent Index) was $2,024 in April 2025, reflecting a 3.4% year-over-year increase[3][5].

## Historical Context and Trends

San Diego's rental market shows interesting patterns over the 2024-2025 period:

- Rent remained stable at approximately $3,000 from January through April 2025
- A significant drop occurred in May 2025 to $2,795
- Previous year (2024) showed increases during summer months, peaking at $3,150 in August and September[4]

Despite the recent decrease, San Diego's rental prices remain substantially higher than the national average, with rents 51% above the national level[4].

## Key Factors Affecting the Forecast

1. **Policy Changes**: The San Diego Council began rolling back ADU (Accessory Dwelling Unit) policies in March 2025 that previously allowed backyard apartment buildings. This regulatory change could potentially limit housing supply in the medium to long term.

2. **Market Temperature**: Despite the year-over-year decrease, Zillow classifies the San Diego rental market temperature as "WARM," indicating increasing demand relative to the national average[4].

3. **Rental Concessions**: Nationally, about 34.8% of rental listings on Zillow offered concessions (discounts for renters) in March 2025, with increases in many major metro areas[5]. This suggests landlords may be making adjustments to attract tenants in a changing market.

4. **Housing Value Trends**: The average San Diego home value is $1,033,526, up just 0.5% over the past year[2], indicating a cooling in the overall housing market that may be influencing rental rates.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- The data available represents asking rents rather than actual lease agreements
- There may be variations within different neighborhoods of San Diego not captured in the city-wide average
- The recent policy change regarding ADUs may have longer-term impacts not yet fully reflected in the May 2025 data
- Seasonal factors may influence month-to-month changes

## Conclusion

Based on the Zillow data available as of June 3, 2025, the year-over-year change in rent for San Diego, CA in May 2025 is a decrease of 6.8%. This represents a significant divergence from the national trend of increasing rents (3.4% nationally). The contrast suggests San Diego's rental market is experiencing unique local dynamics despite maintaining a "warm" market designation.
