### 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of June 5, 2025, Casey DeSantis has not announced her candidacy for governor of Florida.
- Recent precedent for high-profile, non-incumbent candidates (including spouses of sitting governors) suggests that formal announcements typically occur closer to the start of the primary campaign season, often in the fall preceding the election year.
- Byron Donalds, a prominent Republican with Donald Trump’s endorsement, has already declared his candidacy and is gaining in the polls, shifting the dynamic of the race[4].

### 2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- Casey DeSantis has repeatedly declined to confirm or deny her intent to run, instead offering ambiguous statements such as quoting, “When you come to a fork in the road, take it,” when pressed about her future political ambitions[4].
- Governor Ron DeSantis has publicly highlighted his wife’s conservative credentials but also maintains ambiguity, suggesting a deliberate strategy to keep options open[4].
- Internal Republican tensions have arisen regarding Casey DeSantis’ nonprofit, “Hope Florida,” including scrutiny over a $10 million donation, which may complicate the environment for an announcement[3].
- No press releases or official statements from the Governor’s office or Casey DeSantis’ team as of early June 2025 indicate an impending candidacy announcement[1][2].

### 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Official statements and press releases from the Florida Governor’s office[1][2]
- Recent news coverage from CBS12 and WFSU tracking speculation and political maneuvering[3][4]

### 4. Limitations or Uncertainties in Measurement

- The timing of political announcements is inherently uncertain and can shift in response to internal polling, party strategy, or unforeseen events.
- While current public behavior and political context suggest a low probability of announcement before July 1, 2025, last-minute decisions are always possible in politics.

### Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the lack of any concrete signals, ongoing ambiguity from Casey DeSantis herself, public GOP friction, and the fact that other candidates have already launched their campaigns, the probability that Casey DeSantis will announce her candidacy for Florida governor before July 1, 2025, is assessed as **low (estimated <10%)**.
