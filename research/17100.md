# Forecast: US Restrictions on Generative AI API Access Before 2026

Based on current information available as of May 26, 2025, I'll assess the likelihood of the US implementing restrictions on generative AI API access before 2026.

## Current Regulatory Landscape

The US has recently taken significant steps toward controlling advanced AI technologies through export regulations, though with some policy reversals. In January 2025, the US Department of Commerce introduced the "Framework for Artificial Intelligence Diffusion," establishing new export control regulations for advanced computing chips and closed AI models[5]. These regulations created a new Export Control Classification Number (4E091) specifically for "frontier" AI model weights, requiring licenses for exporting closed-source AI models trained with high computing power (more than 10^26 operations)[1].

Notably, these regulations established a tiered approach to international access:

- **Tier 1 (Unrestricted Access)**: 18 major US allies including Five Eyes nations, South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, and several European countries[5]
- **Tier 2 & 3**: Other countries with varying levels of restrictions, with license applications for "frontier" AI model weights to countries outside close US allies being "presumptively denied"[1][5]

However, on May 15, 2025, the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) announced they would rescind the "AI Diffusion Rule" just days before it was set to take effect, indicating policy uncertainty in this area[2].

## Comparative Analysis with Question Criteria

The question asks specifically about API access restrictions to generative AI before 2026. While current regulations focus on model weights and computing hardware rather than API access explicitly, they demonstrate a clear regulatory trajectory toward controlling international access to advanced AI capabilities.

Key considerations:

1. **Current vs. Required Restrictions**: The January 2025 regulations restricted exports of AI model weights but did not explicitly restrict API access to generative AI models[1]. The question requires restrictions specifically on API access.

2. **Scope of Models**: The current regulations focus on "frontier" AI models (those trained with extremely high computing power), which would likely include the "powerful generative AI systems" specified in the question[1].

3. **Geographic Restrictions**: The current regulatory framework does establish geographic tiers of access, which aligns with the question's focus on restricting access to "only people in the US"[5].

## Forecast Assessment

Given the current trajectory and available information, I assess:

**Probability: 70% that the US will restrict access outside the US to some APIs to generative AI before 2026**

Factors supporting this assessment:

- The US has already demonstrated willingness to regulate international access to advanced AI technologies, as evidenced by the January 2025 export controls[1][5].
- The framework for differentiated access by country is already established[5].
- The technical infrastructure for implementing such restrictions (IP checks, identity verification) is mature and already used in other contexts.

Factors decreasing this probability:

- The recent rescission of the AI Diffusion Rule suggests potential policy uncertainty or reconsideration[2].
- Current regulations focus on model weights rather than API access specifically[1].
- Implementing and enforcing API access restrictions presents technical challenges.

## Uncertainties and Limitations

Several uncertainties affect this forecast:

1. **Policy Continuity**: The rescission of the AI Diffusion Rule in May 2025 creates uncertainty about the stability of US AI export policy[2].

2. **Technological Evolution**: The rapid advancement of AI capabilities may outpace regulatory frameworks.

3. **Implementation Mechanisms**: The question specifies that various forms of restrictions would qualify, but it remains unclear which specific mechanisms the US government might employ.

4. **International Coordination**: The effectiveness of restrictions may depend on coordination with allies, which could influence policy decisions.

Given these factors and the current regulatory trajectory, I assess a 70% probability that the US will implement some form of API access restrictions on powerful generative AI systems before the end of 2025.
