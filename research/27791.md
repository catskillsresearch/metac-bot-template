# Will Cannabis Be Removed from Schedule I Before September 30, 2024?

As of August 29, 2024, the process to reschedule marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) is underway, but not yet complete. This analysis examines the current status, process timeline, and factors that may influence whether rescheduling will occur before September 30, 2024.

## Current Status of Marijuana Rescheduling

Since the CSA was enacted in 1970, marijuana has been classified as a Schedule I drug, placing it in the most restrictive category alongside substances like heroin and LSD[5]. However, significant developments have occurred in the rescheduling process:

- In October 2022, President Biden instructed the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Attorney General to review how marijuana is scheduled under federal law[2].
- HHS completed its scientific and medical evaluation and recommended rescheduling marijuana to Schedule III in August 2023[4][5].
- On May 16, 2024, the Department of Justice (DOJ) announced its plan to reschedule marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III[5].
- The DOJ published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) in May 2024, initiating the formal rulemaking process[3].
- As of August 29, 2024, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has published a Proposed Rule regarding the rescheduling of marijuana[1].

## Rescheduling Process and Timeline

The rescheduling process involves several steps with varying timeframes:

1. **HHS Recommendation**: Completed in August 2023 when HHS recommended rescheduling to Schedule III[4].
2. **DEA Determination**: The DEA must determine whether to proceed with rescheduling based on HHS's recommendation[4].
3. **Rulemaking Process**: The DOJ/DEA initiated this process with the publication of the NPRM in May 2024[3].
4. **Public Comment Period**: Following the NPRM publication, there is a comment period during which stakeholders can provide feedback[3].
5. **Final Rule**: After reviewing comments, the DEA must issue a final rule to officially reschedule marijuana.

While the exact timeline remains uncertain, some experts anticipated that "a final rescheduling rule could appear as soon as September or October 2024"[2]. This suggests that rescheduling before September 30, 2024, is possible but not guaranteed.

## Factors Affecting the Timeline

Several factors may influence whether rescheduling occurs before September 30, 2024:

- **Political Considerations**: The Biden administration has campaigned on marijuana reform, which may create pressure to complete the process before the 2024 election[4].
- **Administrative Procedures**: The rulemaking process includes mandatory steps that can extend the timeline, including review of public comments.
- **Legal Challenges**: Potential legal challenges to the rescheduling decision could delay implementation.

## Implications of Rescheduling

If marijuana is rescheduled to Schedule III, it would:

- Ease some restrictions on cannabis-related research[3].
- Potentially promote cannabinoid drug development[3].
- Adjust the legal framework for cannabis manufacturers and distributors[3].

However, it's important to note that rescheduling would not:

- Fully legalize cannabis-related activities permitted under state law[3].
- Impact the legal status of recreational marijuana used for non-medical purposes[3].
- Eliminate all federal regulations, as marijuana would still be subject to DEA and FDA oversight[3].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

The primary limitation in forecasting whether rescheduling will occur before September 30, 2024, is the inherent unpredictability of the administrative process. As noted in the search results, "There is no way to know exactly how long the process will take for the DEA to determine if it will initiate rulemaking. It could happen in days, weeks, months, or even years"[4].

While the process has advanced significantly with the publication of the NPRM and the August 29, 2024 proposed rule, the final decision and implementation timeline remain uncertain.
