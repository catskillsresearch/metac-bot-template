# Forecasting Lawsuits Against the Trump Administration by March 31, 2025

Based on information available as of February 18, 2025, here's an analysis to help forecast the number of lawsuits against the Trump Administration by March 31, 2025, according to the JustSecurity tracker.

## Current Status and Tracking Methodology

Just Security launched a public resource tracker for legal challenges to Trump administration actions on January 29, 2025[1]. This tracker is part of Just Security's broader coverage of the Trump Administration's Executive Actions and is being continually updated[1].

The tracker employs specific methodological guidelines that affect how cases are counted:

1. Multiple related lawsuits may be counted as a single case (e.g., all lawsuits involving F-1 foreign student visa registration are treated as one case despite involving "more than 100 lawsuits and 50 restraining orders from dozens of federal judges")[1]

2. Appeals are not counted as separate cases (appeals to Circuit Courts or the Supreme Court are considered part of the original case)[1]

3. Cases where the Trump administration is the plaintiff (rather than defendant) are not included in the tracker[1]

## Limitations in Forecasting

Several factors create uncertainty in forecasting the exact number of lawsuits by March 31, 2025:

1. The rate at which new legal challenges are being filed against the administration may vary based on the pace and nature of executive actions

2. The tracker's methodology of consolidating related cases means that even a large number of similar lawsuits might only increase the count by one

3. The resolution of existing cases could affect the total count, though the tracker appears to include closed cases in its total (noting 7 closed cases in its methodology)[1]

## Available Data Points

As of the publication of the tracker on January 29, 2025, Just Security had begun monitoring legal challenges to the Trump administration[1][3][4]. The tracker is being maintained by Just Security Student Staff Editors and other contributors, with weekly newsletter updates available from co-editor-in-chief Ryan Goodman[1].

Just Security also maintains other related resources that may provide context, including:
- A litigation tracker for pending criminal and civil cases against Donald Trump personally (though this is separate from the administration actions tracker)[2]
- A Trump Trials Clearinghouse containing court documents and materials related to Trump's legal cases[5]
