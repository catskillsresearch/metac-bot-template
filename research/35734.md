# Forecast Analysis: US Effective Tariff Rate by End of 2026

As a forecasting analyst examining the projected US effective tariff rate by the end of 2026, I've analyzed the current tariff landscape, recent policy changes, and expert projections to provide an informed assessment.

## Historical Context and Current Status

The effective US tariff rate has historically remained low since the 1960s, typically below 3%. According to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis data referenced in the query description, tariff rates have been relatively stable at these low levels for decades. However, since President Trump resumed office in January 2025, there has been a significant shift in trade policy with multiple tariff increases implemented and announced.

As of March 2025, the following key tariff policies have been implemented or announced:
- 25% tariffs on auto and auto parts entering the US (effective April 2, 2025)[2]
- Universal tariffs on all imports ranging from 10-20%[5]
- 60% tariffs on all imports from China[5]
- 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico

## Recent Policy Developments and Economic Impact

The tariffs implemented in early 2025 are projected to have substantial economic effects:

- **Fiscal Impact**: All tariffs enacted through April 2025 are estimated to raise $2.4 trillion over the 2026-35 period, with $631 billion in negative dynamic revenue effects[4]
- **Consumer Cost**: These tariffs represent a significant tax increase for US households, estimated at $1,155 in 2025 and $1,397 in 2026[5]
- **Economic Growth**: J.P. Morgan Research revised its growth forecast downward by 0.2 percentage points to 1.3% for 2025 due to auto tariffs alone[2]
- **Inflation Effects**: Core PCE inflation is forecast to increase by 0.3 percentage points to 3.1% for 2025[2]

## Forecast for End-2026 Effective Tariff Rate

Based on current policy trajectories and expert forecasts, I project the following for the end-2026 effective tariff rate:

Morningstar's May 29, 2025 analysis indicates an expected average tariff rate of 15% by year-end 2026, down from 18% at the end of 2025[3]. This projected decline suggests potential policy adjustments or the phasing out of certain tariffs over time.

The Yale Budget Lab's analysis of tariffs implemented through April 15, 2025 shows substantial revenue generation, indicating that significant tariffs will likely remain in place through 2026[4].

### Key Factors That Could Affect This Forecast:

1. **Negotiation Outcomes**: There are indications that some tariff threats may be negotiating tactics rather than final policy positions. Successful trade negotiations could result in lower-than-announced tariff rates.

2. **Economic Feedback**: The negative economic impacts of high tariffs (reduced GDP growth, increased inflation) may create pressure to moderate tariff policies by 2026.

3. **Targeted vs. Universal Approach**: The administration may shift from broad tariffs to more targeted approaches focused on specific sectors or countries, potentially reducing the overall effective rate.

4. **Retaliatory Measures**: The Tax Foundation estimates that retaliatory tariffs could further impact economic output, potentially influencing policy decisions by 2026[5].

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on available data as of March 28, 2025, I assess the following probability distribution for the effective US tariff rate at the end of 2026:

- 70% probability: 13-17% range, centered around Morningstar's 15% forecast
- 20% probability: 17-20% range, if tariffs remain at higher levels than expected
- 10% probability: 8-13% range, if significant trade deals are reached or tariff policies are moderated

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors create uncertainty in this forecast:
- The dynamic nature of trade negotiations
- Potential economic pressures that may influence policy decisions
- Limited data on implementation details for announced tariffs
- Uncertainty about retaliatory measures from trading partners
- Possible legislative or legal challenges to tariff policies

The effective tariff rate measurement itself depends on customs duties collected relative to total imports, which can be affected by changes in import composition as well as tariff rates.
