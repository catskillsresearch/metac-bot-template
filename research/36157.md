## Ivy League Teams' 2025 March Madness Sweet Sixteen Prospects

**Key Historical Trends and Current Status**

- Ivy League teams have rarely advanced to the Sweet Sixteen in the NCAA men's tournament. The most recent example is Princeton's 2023 run, which was an outlier compared to the league's usual performance.
- For the 2024-25 season, Princeton was picked as the preseason favorite in the Ivy League, receiving 15 first-place votes in the official poll. Yale and Cornell were next in line, with Dartmouth ranked much lower[2][5].
- As of the latest NET rankings and quad win data, Yale is the top Ivy League team (NET rank 72, 22-8 overall, 13-1 conference), followed by Cornell (NET 120, 18-11), Princeton (NET 166, 19-11), and Dartmouth (NET 209, 14-14)[4].
- Yale has the strongest resume with two Quad 2 wins and a solid conference record, while Princeton and Cornell have less impressive national profiles and fewer quality wins[4].

**Recent Announcements or Policies**

- There have been no significant changes in NCAA tournament selection or seeding policies that would directly affect Ivy League teams' chances of advancing.
- The Ivy League's automatic bid will go to the winner of the conference tournament, as usual[2][5].

**Authoritative Sources for Verification**

- Official Ivy League and NCAA standings, NET rankings, and quad win data provide the most reliable metrics for team strength and tournament prospects[1][3][4].
- Preseason polls and conference records offer insight into team expectations and performance[2][5].

**Limitations and Uncertainties**

- NCAA tournament outcomes are highly variable due to the single-elimination format. Lower-seeded teams like those from the Ivy League often face higher-ranked opponents in early rounds, making deep runs statistically unlikely.
- The actual Ivy League tournament winner and NCAA tournament matchups are not determined as of March 18, 2025, so projections rely on current team strength and historical precedent.

**Summary Table: Ivy League 2024-25 Key Metrics**

| Team      | NET Rank | Record  | Quad 1 Wins | Preseason Poll Rank |
|-----------|----------|---------|-------------|---------------------|
| Yale      | 72       | 22-8    | 0           | 2                   |
| Cornell   | 120      | 18-11   | 0           | 4                   |
| Princeton | 166      | 19-11   | 0           | 1                   |
| Dartmouth | 209      | 14-14   | 0           | 8                   |

**Conclusion**

Based on current team strength, historical trends, and the competitive landscape, the probability of an Ivy League team (Yale, Cornell, Princeton, or Dartmouth) reaching the Sweet Sixteen in the 2025 NCAA men's tournament is low. Yale is the strongest contender, but their national profile and lack of Quad 1 wins suggest they are unlikely to be seeded favorably enough to make a deep run. While upsets are possible, recent data and history do not support a strong forecast for an Ivy League Sweet Sixteen appearance in 2025.
