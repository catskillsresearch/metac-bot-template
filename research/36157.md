# Forecasting Ivy League Teams in the 2025 NCAA Tournament Sweet Sixteen

As of March 18, 2025, the Ivy League has determined its representative for the 2025 NCAA men's basketball tournament through its conference tournament ("Ivy Madness"). Here's the relevant information to help forecast whether an Ivy League team could reach the Sweet Sixteen.

## Current Status of Ivy League Basketball

The 2024-25 Ivy League regular season concluded with Yale claiming the outright championship with an impressive 13-1 conference record (22-8 overall)[1]. Cornell finished second at 9-5 (18-11 overall), while Dartmouth and Princeton tied for third place at 8-6[1]. These four teams qualified for the Ivy League tournament, which determines the conference's automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament.

The Ivy League tournament semifinals featured:
- #1 Yale vs. #4 Princeton
- #2 Cornell vs. #3 Dartmouth

Cornell defeated Dartmouth 87-71 in their semifinal matchup on March 15, 2025, shooting 53% from the floor and making 10 three-pointers[5]. This victory advanced Cornell to the championship game against Yale on March 16, 2025, at Brown's Pizzitola Sports Center[5].

## Historical Context and Trends

Cornell has historical precedent for deep NCAA Tournament runs. The Big Red previously reached the Sweet Sixteen during a tournament run that featured the current Cornell head coach, Jon Jaques, as a starter and team captain[5]. Cornell has made NCAA Tournament appearances in 1954, 1988, 2008, 2009, and 2010[5].

Princeton was overwhelmingly voted as the preseason favorite to win the Ivy League in 2024-25, receiving 15 of 16 first-place votes in the preseason poll[4]. However, they ultimately finished tied for third place, falling short of expectations[1][3].

Yale entered the Ivy League tournament as the clear favorite with -160 odds to win the conference tournament, followed by Cornell (+300), Dartmouth (+600), and Princeton (+1200)[3].

## Team Strengths and Weaknesses

Cornell's offensive prowess is notable - they became the nation's top two-point shooting offense on the season (.608) after connecting on 22-of-31 shots from inside the arc (.710) against Dartmouth in the semifinal[5]. Junior AK Okereke demonstrated his all-around game with 25 points, nine rebounds, four assists, four steals, and four blocks in that semifinal victory[5].

Yale demonstrated dominance throughout the season, including a convincing 84-57 win over Princeton at home after a closer 77-70 victory at Princeton earlier in the season[3]. This shows Yale's ability to perform well against quality competition, particularly at home.

Dartmouth's defensive capabilities were highlighted as an advantage over Cornell despite both teams playing similar fast-paced styles with an emphasis on high shot volumes[3].

## Factors Affecting Sweet Sixteen Chances

Several factors will influence whether an Ivy League team can reach the Sweet Sixteen:

1. **NCAA Tournament Seeding**: The seeding assigned to the Ivy League champion will significantly impact their path to the Sweet Sixteen. Lower seeds face more difficult early-round matchups.

2. **Momentum**: Cornell entered the Ivy League championship game on a five-game winning streak[5], suggesting they were playing their best basketball at the right time.

3. **Experience**: Yale was the defending Ivy League Tournament champion[5], providing them valuable postseason experience.

4. **Style of Play**: Cornell's efficient offense (particularly their nation-leading two-point shooting percentage) could make them a difficult matchup for teams unfamiliar with their style.

5. **Historical Precedent**: Ivy League teams have occasionally made deep tournament runs, with Cornell's previous Sweet Sixteen appearance and Princeton's historical upsets demonstrating the conference's potential for tournament success.

The Ivy League representative will need to win two NCAA Tournament games to reach the Sweet Sixteen. While this is challenging for mid-major conferences, the combination of Yale's consistent excellence throughout the season and Cornell's offensive efficiency suggests the potential for competitive tournament performances.
