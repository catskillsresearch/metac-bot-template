# Will Williams and Wilmore Return to Earth by September 15, 2024?

Based on information available as of August 6, 2024, there is significant uncertainty regarding whether astronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore will be back on Earth by September 15, 2024. Below is an analysis of the available information to help forecast this outcome.

## Current Status and Mission Timeline

NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams launched to the International Space Station (ISS) aboard Boeing's Starliner spacecraft on June 5, 2024, as part of the Crew Flight Test (CFT) mission[1]. This marked the first crewed flight test of Boeing's Starliner under NASA's Commercial Crew Program.

The mission was originally planned to be brief, with Starliner expected to remain at the orbital laboratory for "about a week"[1]. However, technical issues with the spacecraft's propulsion system have significantly extended their stay on the ISS:

- As of late July 2024, NASA and Boeing were still assessing Starliner's propulsion system performance before scheduling its undocking from the ISS[4].
- Boeing and NASA teams have been conducting docked hot-fire testing and analyzing the spacecraft's integrated propulsion system to "confirm system reliability ahead of Starliner's return to Earth"[5].

## Recent Developments Affecting Return Timeline

Several key developments provide insight into the potential return timeline:

1. **Crew-9 Launch Delay**: As of August 6, 2024, NASA announced a delay in the SpaceX Crew-9 mission launch to no earlier than September 24, 2024. This adjustment was specifically made to allow "more time for mission managers to finalize return planning" for the Starliner crew[5].

2. **Ongoing Technical Evaluations**: NASA stated that "no decisions have been made regarding Starliner's return" as of August 6, 2024[5]. A flight readiness review that was supposed to determine Starliner's return date did not take place as scheduled[5].

3. **Previous Timeline Expectations**: In late July 2024, NASA had indicated that Starliner "should be home" before the Crew-9 mission, which was then scheduled for August 18[2]. The subsequent delay of Crew-9 to September 24 suggests a potential shift in the return timeline.

4. **Starliner-1 Mission Impact**: NASA announced on July 28, 2024, that the subsequent Starliner-1 mission (planned for a six-month ISS stay) would be delayed until August 2025, indicating the seriousness of the current technical issues[2].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

The most authoritative sources for tracking this situation include:

- **NASA's Commercial Crew Program Blog**: Provides official updates on mission status and return planning[4].
- **Boeing Space Communications**: Boeing has expressed confidence in Starliner's ability to return safely despite the issues[5].
- **NASA News Releases**: Official announcements regarding mission timelines and crew status[1].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors create uncertainty in forecasting the astronauts' return date:

1. **Ongoing Technical Analysis**: NASA and Boeing are still evaluating the spacecraft's readiness with no definitive timeline established[5].

2. **Prioritization of Safety**: Both NASA and Boeing have emphasized that safety takes precedence over schedule, meaning further delays are possible if technical concerns persist[5].

3. **Interdependence with Other Missions**: The scheduling of Starliner's return appears to be coordinated with other ISS missions, particularly the SpaceX Crew-9 launch[5].

4. **Lack of Definitive Return Date**: As of August 6, 2024, no official return date had been announced, with NASA explicitly stating that decisions about Starliner's return were still pending[5].

## Conclusion

Based on the information available as of August 6, 2024, it remains uncertain whether Williams and Wilmore will be back on Earth by September 15, 2024. While NASA's rescheduling of the Crew-9 mission to September 24 suggests they may be planning for Starliner's return before that date (which would put them on Earth by September 15), the ongoing technical evaluations and lack of a confirmed return date make this forecast highly uncertain. Boeing has expressed confidence in Starliner's ability to return safely, but the timeline remains undetermined as technical assessments continue.
