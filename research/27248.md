### Key Factual Information Relevant to Forecasting an HHS Mpox PHE Declaration Before October 1, 2024

**Historical Trends and Precedent**
- HHS declared a public health emergency for mpox on August 4, 2022, during the last major US outbreak, enabling rapid response measures and resource allocation[3][4].
- The 2022-2023 outbreak was driven by Clade II mpox, which is less severe than the Clade I strain now circulating in Africa.

**Current Status (as of August 15, 2024)**
- A significant outbreak of Clade I mpox is ongoing in the Democratic Republic of Congo, with cases and deaths surpassing those of the 2022-2023 outbreak.
- On August 14, 2024, the WHO declared the mpox outbreak in Africa a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), emphasizing the risk of international spread and the emergence of a new sexually transmissible strain[1][2].
- The Africa CDC is close to declaring a continent-wide public health emergency, reflecting the seriousness of the outbreak[2].

**Recent Announcements/Policies**
- As of August 15, 2024, there is no new or renewed HHS public health emergency declaration for mpox since the previous declaration expired in 2023[3][4].
- The HHS PHE Declarations page and CDC advisories do not list a current mpox PHE.

**Authoritative Sources for Verification**
- HHS PHE Declarations page
- CDC Laboratory Outreach Communication System (LOCS)
- WHO official statements

**Limitations and Uncertainties**
- The US response could change rapidly if domestic cases rise or if the international situation worsens.
- The WHO PHEIC declaration may increase pressure on HHS to act, but as of the cutoff date, there is no public indication of an imminent US PHE declaration for mpox.

|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Previous US mpox PHE                     | Declared Aug 4, 2022; ended in 2023    |

| WHO PHEIC for mpox                       | Declared Aug 14, 2024                  |
| Africa CDC emergency declaration         | Imminent, not yet declared             |
| US domestic mpox outbreak                | No major outbreak reported             |

### Conclusion
As of August 15, 2024, there is no HHS public health emergency declaration for mpox in effect, nor any public indication that such a declaration is imminent. The situation remains dynamic, especially given the recent WHO PHEIC declaration, but no US PHE for mpox has been declared since the previous one ended in 2023.
