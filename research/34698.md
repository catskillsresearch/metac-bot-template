## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of late 2024 and early 2025, the number of registered Syrian refugees in Lebanon reported by UNHCR is approximately 815,000[1][3][5].
- This figure has remained stable for several years, largely because Lebanon halted new UNHCR registrations for Syrian refugees in 2015[5].
- The Lebanese government estimates the total number of Syrians in the country at around 1.5 million, but only about 815,000 are officially registered with UNHCR[1][3][5].

## Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Metric

- Lebanon’s policy since 2015 has been to prohibit new registrations of Syrian refugees with UNHCR, which has effectively frozen the registered population, aside from reductions due to resettlement or voluntary returns[5].
- As of February 2025, UNHCR reported that 270,000 Syrians had returned to Syria since December 2024, but this figure is regional and not specific to Lebanon[4]. There is no evidence of a sudden, large-scale deregistration of Syrian refugees in Lebanon during this period.
- Socio-economic conditions remain dire, with most refugee households living in extreme poverty and facing increasing hardship[1][3][5].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The UNHCR Lebanon operational portal and the official UNHCR regional refugee response data page are the primary sources for up-to-date registration figures[1][2].
- UNHCR’s multi-year strategy documents and regular operational updates provide context and confirm the stability of the registered refugee count[3].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- The registered figure does not reflect the total number of Syrians in Lebanon, as many are unregistered due to the 2015 policy[5].
- The number of registered refugees may decrease slowly due to returns or resettlement, but no major policy change or mass deregistration has been reported as of early 2025.
- Data is subject to minor revisions, but the figure is unlikely to deviate significantly from 815,000 by April 1, 2025, unless a major event occurs.

## Forecast

**Based on all available information as of February 8, 2025, the most likely number of registered Syrian refugees in Lebanon reported by UNHCR on April 1, 2025, will be approximately 815,000.**
