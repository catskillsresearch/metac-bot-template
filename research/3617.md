## Historical Trends and Current Status

- The size of the US Supreme Court is not fixed by the Constitution but by Congressional statute. Since the Judiciary Act of 1869, the court has had nine members (one chief justice, eight associate justices)[2][3][4].
- Prior to 1869, the size fluctuated between five and ten justices, often in response to political and geographic changes. The last change was over 150 years ago[2][3][4].
- Historically, efforts to alter the court’s size have been rare and politically contentious. The most famous modern attempt was President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s 1937 “court-packing” plan, which failed despite a Democratic supermajority in Congress[4].

## Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- As of February 11, 2020, there were no significant legislative pushes or executive actions poised to change the size of the Supreme Court. The issue was discussed in political circles but had not advanced as formal policy.
- The status quo of nine justices remains deeply entrenched, with no active momentum for change at the federal legislative level[4].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Congress has the authority to change the court's size via legislation; no constitutional amendment is required[2][4].
- All changes to Supreme Court size since 1789 have been enacted by Congress, with the last occurring in 1869[3][4][5].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- While there is a strong historical precedent for stability, political conditions could shift dramatically before 2050, potentially increasing the likelihood of change.
- Forecasting decades into the future must account for major, unpredictable political realignments or crises.
- Public opinion and institutional norms have historically provided strong resistance to court size changes, but these factors are subject to change.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the:
- More than 150 years of stability at nine justices,
- Legal possibility but high political and institutional barriers to change,
- Lack of recent legislative or executive momentum as of early 2020,

The probability that the US Supreme Court’s membership size will change before January 1, 2050, appears low. A reasonable baseline forecast would place the chance below 20%, barring extraordinary political developments.
