# Guinea Worm Eradication Forecast: Will it be achieved by 2030?

As of November 20, 2019, the eradication of Guinea Worm disease (dracunculiasis) represents one of the most successful disease elimination campaigns in history, though significant challenges remain. This analysis examines the likelihood of achieving complete eradication by 2030 based on available data.

## Historical Trends and Current Status

The Guinea Worm eradication campaign has achieved remarkable progress since its inception:

- When The Carter Center began leading the program in 1986, approximately 3.5 million cases occurred annually across 21 countries in Africa and Asia.
- By 2019, the disease is endemic in only a handful of countries, with case numbers reduced by more than 99.99%.

While complete data for 2019 is not yet finalized as of November 20, 2019, the trajectory shows continued progress toward elimination, albeit with some complications.

## Key Challenges to Eradication

### Animal Reservoir

The most significant development complicating eradication efforts is the discovery of Guinea Worm infections in animals, primarily dogs in Chad. This represents a critical challenge as it establishes a non-human reservoir for the parasite, making complete elimination substantially more difficult.

The emergence of this animal reservoir has forced eradication programs to adapt their strategies. For example, in Chad, the national program has:
- Intensified surveillance
- Promoted cash incentives for reporting suspected infections
- Applied larvicide (Abate) to water sources in affected villages

### Geographic Challenges

As of 2019, remaining cases are concentrated in some of the most remote and conflict-affected regions, particularly in countries like South Sudan and Chad. These areas present significant operational challenges for surveillance and intervention programs.

## WHO Timeline and Goals

In recognition of these challenges, particularly the animal reservoir issue, the World Health Organization has revised its eradication timeline:
- The original goal was to achieve eradication by 2020
- The target has now been moved to 2030, providing an additional decade to address the complex challenges that have emerged

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on the available evidence as of November 2019, I assess the likelihood of Guinea Worm eradication by 2030 as follows:

**Factors supporting eradication by 2030:**
- The remarkable progress already achieved (>99.99% reduction in cases)
- Continued commitment from The Carter Center and endemic countries
- The extended timeline providing additional time to address challenges
- Proven effectiveness of community-based interventions

**Factors challenging eradication by 2030:**
- The animal reservoir significantly complicates the eradication equation
- Remaining cases in conflict-affected areas with limited access
- Historical precedent showing the "last mile" of eradication is often the most difficult
- Previous targets have already been missed (1991, 2009, 2015, 2020)

Given these factors, I assess there is approximately a 60-70% probability that Guinea Worm will be eradicated by the end of 2030. The animal reservoir issue presents the most significant uncertainty in this forecast, as it fundamentally changes the nature of the eradication challenge from what was originally envisioned.

## Verification and Measurement

The WHO is the international body that certifies whether a disease has been eliminated from a country or eradicated from the world. For Guinea Worm, the certification process requires three consecutive years free of any indigenous cases. Therefore, to meet the 2030 deadline, the last case would need to be identified before the beginning of 2028.

The Carter Center also reports the status of the Guinea Worm eradication program by country, providing regular updates on case numbers and program progress.

## Limitations

This forecast is based on information available as of November 2019 and does not account for potential future developments such as:
- New scientific breakthroughs in treatment or prevention
- Further adaptation of the parasite to other animal hosts
- Changes in funding or political commitment to eradication
- Major geopolitical events affecting access to endemic regions
