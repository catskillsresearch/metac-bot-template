# Forecasting US Airline Passenger Volume for Christmas Week 2024

Based on available data as of December 13, 2024, here is an analysis of factors that would help forecast whether TSA passenger screening volumes will be between 17-18 million for December 25-31, 2024.

## Historical Trends and Current Status

### Record-Breaking Year in 2024

2024 has been a year of unprecedented air travel volume in the United States:

- TSA has screened nearly 800 million people through November 2024, with passenger volumes reaching record highs[3]
- The top ten busiest travel days in TSA's history have all occurred in 2024[3]
- On July 7, 2024, TSA set a single-day record by screening over 3 million people[3][5]
- December 1, 2024 became the new busiest day on record with over 3.09 million passengers screened in a single day[5]

### Year-over-Year Growth

- Passenger volumes have increased by 17% over the past two years (2022-2024)[3][4]
- For Thanksgiving 2024, TSA projected a 6% increase compared to the same period in 2023[4]

### Historical Christmas Week Data

Looking at the historical data provided for December 25-31:

| Year | Total Passengers | Year-over-Year Change |
|------|------------------|------------------------|
| 2019 | ~17.1 million    | Baseline (pre-pandemic)|
| 2020 | ~7.6 million     | -55.6% (pandemic impact) |
| 2021 | ~13.5 million    | +77.6% |
| 2022 | ~14.8 million    | +9.6% |
| 2023 | ~17.3 million    | +16.9% |

The 2023 total of approximately 17.3 million passengers during December 25-31 represents a full recovery and slight increase over pre-pandemic (2019) levels.

## Recent Announcements and Projections

AAA has released its year-end travel forecast for the 2024 holiday season:

- AAA projects 119.3 million people will travel 50+ miles during the year-end holiday period (December 21, 2024 - January 1, 2025)[2]
- This projection narrowly surpasses the previous record set in 2019 by 64,000 travelers[2]
- AAA expects 7.85 million air passengers during this broader holiday period, which would set a new record[2]
- AAA anticipates an additional 3 million travelers overall compared to the 2023 holiday season[2]

The timing of Christmas in 2024 (falling on a Wednesday) is expected to create heavy travel volumes both the weekend before and after the holiday[2].

## Analysis for December 25-31, 2024 Forecast

Several factors suggest continued growth in air travel for the Christmas week of 2024:

1. The overall 2024 trend shows record-breaking passenger volumes
2. The Thanksgiving 2024 period saw a 6% year-over-year increase
3. AAA projects record air travel for the broader holiday period

If we apply the 6% year-over-year growth rate observed during Thanksgiving 2024 to the December 25-31, 2023 total of approximately 17.3 million passengers, we would expect around 18.3 million passengers for the same period in 2024.

However, there are some limitations to consider:

- The query mentioned that year-over-year growth had slowed by October 2024 compared to summer
- The 7-day period through October 14, 2024, was down 1.4% against the comparable period in 2023
- AAA notes that their forecasts focus on domestic leisure travel only, while TSA data includes all passengers on both domestic and international routes[2]

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- TSA passenger counts include both domestic and international travelers
- Each passenger is counted each time they enter a secured area, so connecting passengers may be counted multiple times
- Day-of-week variations can impact travel patterns, especially with Christmas falling on different days each year
- Weather events can significantly impact air travel during winter months
- Economic factors like airfare pricing and overall economic conditions influence travel decisions
