## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- **Tesla’s 2018 Vehicle Sales:** Tesla sold approximately 257,618 vehicles globally in 2018, representing a 146% increase from the previous year[4]. The Model 3 was the world’s best-selling electric car, with 145,846 units sold[1]. Tesla’s global sales in 2018 ranked it 54th among car brands[4].
- **Global Auto Market Context:** The global light vehicle market in 2018 was around 94.3 million units[4].
- **Leading Car Companies (2017/2018):** Industry giants like Toyota and Volkswagen each sold over 10 million vehicles per year—about 40 times Tesla’s 2018 output.
- **Growth Rate:** Tesla’s sales grew at a compound annual growth rate far outpacing the industry average (139,997% since 2010, though from a very low base)[4]. In 2018, Tesla’s annualized delivery run rate increased from 120,000 to over 350,000 vehicles[5].
- **Geographic Concentration:** Over 80% of Tesla’s sales were in the Americas, with limited penetration in Europe and Asia as of 2018[4].

## 2. Recent Announcements and Policies

- **Model 3 Ramp-Up:** Tesla launched the Model 3 as its first mass-market car, aiming to massively increase production volume. However, it faced significant production challenges in 2018, struggling to meet ambitious targets[5].
- **Projected Growth:** Independent analysts estimated Tesla could reach around 612,881 annual sales by 2025 if growth continued[4]. Achieving global leadership would likely require annual sales of at least 10 million vehicles.
- **Financial Risks:** Despite high market capitalization, Tesla was not profitable in 2018 and faced risks of bankruptcy if execution faltered or financing dried up.

## 3. Key Differences Affecting the Forecast

- **Scale Gap:** Tesla’s production was a fraction of the global leaders’. Bridging this gap would require sustained exponential growth for over a decade.
- **Profitability and Capital:** Traditional automakers have robust profits and cash reserves; Tesla had negative earnings and high capital needs.
- **Industry Response:** Incumbents were beginning to invest heavily in electric vehicles, increasing competition in Tesla’s core market.
- **Execution Risk:** Tesla’s rapid expansion relied on resolving production bottlenecks, scaling global manufacturing, and maintaining demand—all challenging under intense scrutiny.

## 4. Probabilistic Assessment

Given:

- Tesla’s impressive growth trajectory but small scale compared to global leaders in 2018.
- The massive gap in annual vehicle sales (Tesla: ~0.25 million vs. leaders: 10+ million).
- The need for sustained 40%+ annual growth for 15+ years, without major execution or financial setbacks.
- The likelihood that incumbents will accelerate electrification and defend market share.

**Probability (as of 2018-06-22):**
- The chance that Tesla becomes the world’s largest car company by sales before 2035 appears low—likely under 10%. This is due to the scale of transformation required, competitive responses, and Tesla’s financial and execution risks at the time.

## 5. Limitations and Uncertainties

- Industry dynamics may shift rapidly with technological advances, policy changes, or major disruptions.
- Data availability and accuracy (especially from OICA or other sources) may affect resolution.
- The forecast is sensitive to unforeseen innovations or crises.
