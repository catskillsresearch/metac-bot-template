### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of December 2024, the All-In podcast was ranked #55 on a cross-platform list that included Spotify, Apple, and YouTube charts[5]. This suggests a strong but not top-tier presence in the overall U.S. podcast landscape.
- The most recent available Spotify-specific top 10 lists for 2024 and early 2025 do not mention All-In among the leading shows, which are dominated by The Joe Rogan Experience, MeidasTouch Podcast, and other high-engagement series[4].
- The All-In podcast has consistently performed well in the business and technology category but has not been reported in the top 40 overall on Spotify in recent months[5].

### Recent Announcements or Policies Affecting the Metric

- There are no reported changes to Spotify's podcast ranking methodology as of early 2025. Spotify continues to rank podcasts based on unique listeners, follower counts, recent listener engagement, and user interaction metrics such as shares and saves[4].

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The official Spotify Podcast Charts for the United States, set to "Top Podcasts," will provide the definitive ranking on March 31, 2025[2].
- Third-party aggregators like Podchaser and Podscribe offer additional context but are not the resolution source for this forecast[1][3].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- Podcast rankings can fluctuate week-to-week, especially outside the top 20, due to viral episodes, media coverage, or shifts in listener engagement.
- The latest available data is from December 2024, and there is no direct evidence of a major surge or drop for All-In since then.
- Cross-platform rankings may not perfectly reflect Spotify-specific performance, but they are a useful proxy in the absence of direct chart data.

### Forecast

Based on the available evidence, the most likely ranking range for the All-In podcast on the Spotify Podcast Charts (U.S., Top Podcasts) on March 31, 2025, is:

**'41-50' or '≥51'**

Given its #55 cross-platform ranking in late 2024 and absence from recent Spotify top 40 lists, it is unlikely to be in the top 40 overall. The most probable outcome is that All-In will be ranked between 41 and 50, or possibly lower (≥51), unless there is an unreported surge in popularity.
