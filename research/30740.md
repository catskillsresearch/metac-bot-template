## Key Historical Trends and Current Status
- **Historical Trends**: Gasoline prices have been influenced by crude oil prices, refinery capacity, and seasonal demand. In recent years, prices have been volatile due to global events and supply chain issues.
- **Current Status**: As of late 2023 and early 2024, there were expectations of decreased gasoline prices due to increased refinery capacity and stable crude oil prices[1]. The national average price of regular gas was around $3.62 per gallon in April 2024[5].

## Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric
- **Price Forecasts**: GasBuddy expects the yearly national average to drop from $3.51 per gallon in 2023 to $3.38 in 2024, with potential fluctuations due to seasonal demand and disruptions[3][4].
- **Seasonal Variations**: Prices are expected to rise in late February and peak around Memorial Day before mildly declining into summer[4].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification
- The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) provides weekly data on retail gasoline prices, which can be used to verify if the price exceeds $3.080 for the specified week[1][2].

## Limitations or Uncertainties in Measurement
- **Sudden Changes**: Global events or supply chain disruptions can cause unexpected price fluctuations.
- **Seasonal Demand**: Prices typically rise during summer months due to increased travel and demand.
