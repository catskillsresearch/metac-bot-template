# Egypt's Inflation Rate Forecast for January 2025

Based on available data as of January 24, 2025, I'll analyze the potential inflation rate for Egypt in January 2025.

## Historical Trends and Current Status

Egypt has been experiencing a gradual decline in its inflation rate in recent months. In December, the consumer price inflation rate fell to 24.1%, reaching a two-year low[2]. This continues a downward trend that has been observed throughout the latter part of 2024.

The annual core inflation rate had previously dropped to 24.4% in July 2024, compared to 26.6% in June, marking the lowest level since December 2022[4]. Egypt's headline annual inflation rate had been on a downward path for four consecutive months as of June 2024, decelerating to 27.1% compared to 27.4% in May[4].

## Recent Policy Developments

The Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) has implemented significant monetary tightening to combat inflation:

- The CBE raised key interest rates by eight percent (800 basis points) since January 2024, bringing the total hikes since March 2022 to 19 percent (1900 basis points)[4]
- The bank has indicated it will not reduce interest rates before the second quarter of 2025[1]
- This tight monetary policy stance is expected to continue until inflation drops below 20%, according to Fitch[1]

## Expert Forecasts

Several financial institutions have provided forecasts for Egypt's inflation in early 2025:

- Morgan Stanley projects that Egypt's inflation would "drop to around 15% in early 2025 with month-on-month inflation returning to levels seen before 2022"[1]
- Statista's AI algorithm forecasts inflation rates falling from 33.3% in 2024 to 21.9% in 2025[1]
- BMI Research anticipates inflation to fall below 20% by February 2025, primarily due to a significant base effect[4]
- The IMF expects Egypt's inflation to average 21.2% in the current FY2024/2025[4]
- Trading Economics forecasts an inflation rate of 13.60% by March 2025[5]

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors create uncertainty in precisely forecasting January 2025's inflation rate:

- The CBE has been vague about 2025 inflation, only saying it will "ease appreciably" as the cumulative impact of monetary policy tightening materializes[1]
- Fitch has cited "prolonged geopolitical risks" as a factor that could affect the pace of inflation decline[1]
- Egypt's currency challenges remain significant, with the pound having lost over 200% of its value against the dollar since 2022, which has driven up costs for consumers, companies, and the government[1]

## Conclusion

Based on the downward trend observed in recent months and expert forecasts, Egypt's inflation rate for January 2025 is likely to fall below 25%. The December 2024 rate of 24.1% already indicates this trajectory, and multiple forecasts suggest continued decline into early 2025. The most likely outcome based on available data would be the "Less than 25%" option, though uncertainties remain due to geopolitical factors and currency challenges.
