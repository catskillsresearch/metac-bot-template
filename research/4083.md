# Forecasting Analysis: Potential US Depression (2022-2032)

Based on information available as of April 13, 2020, I'll analyze the potential for and severity of a US depression in the 2022-2032 timeframe compared to the Great Depression.

## Historical Context and Current Status

The Great Depression (1929-1933) remains the benchmark for economic catastrophes in the US, with:
- Duration: 43 months
- Real GDP decline: 26.3% (peak to trough)
- Severity score: 1131 (43 × 26.3)

Economic conditions as of early 2020 showed several concerning patterns that could potentially contribute to economic instability:

- Extended bull market and economic expansion following the 2008-2009 financial crisis
- High corporate debt levels and potential asset bubbles
- Growing federal budget deficits even during economic expansion
- Global trade tensions affecting supply chains

## Key Factors Affecting Depression Probability

### Economic Growth Projections

Economic forecasts available in early 2020 generally projected moderate but slowing growth for the coming decade. While some economists had raised concerns about a potential recession in the near term, few were projecting a depression-level event within the 2022-2032 timeframe.

Some economic research firms have been forecasting a potential "Great Depression" scenario for the 2030s, which falls partially within our resolution timeframe[2]. However, these forecasts typically point to the latter part of the 2030s, mostly outside our resolution window.

### Federal Fiscal Position

The US federal deficit and debt positions were already concerning before 2020:
- Growing deficits despite economic expansion
- Federal debt approaching 100% of GDP
- Increasing entitlement spending pressures

These factors reduce the government's fiscal flexibility to respond to severe economic downturns.

### Monetary Policy Environment

As of early 2020, key monetary policy considerations included:
- Interest rates already at historically low levels
- Federal Reserve balance sheet still expanded from previous interventions
- Limited room for conventional monetary policy responses to a severe downturn

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on pre-April 2020 information, I assess the following:

1. **Probability of a depression meeting the specified criteria (2022-2032)**: Approximately 15-20%
   - Most likely scenario remains continued economic cycles without depression-level severity
   - The probability is elevated compared to historical baselines due to systemic vulnerabilities

2. **Conditional severity assessment** (if a depression occurs):
   - Expected relative severity: 0.3-0.7 times the Great Depression
   - This translates to approximately 340-790 on the severity scale (where Great Depression = 1131)
   - Key factors: stronger institutional safeguards and policy tools compared to 1929, but potentially less fiscal/monetary flexibility

3. **Most likely scenario**:
   - If a depression occurs, it would likely feature:
   - Duration: 24-36 months (shorter than Great Depression)
   - GDP decline: 12-18% (less severe than Great Depression's 26.3%)
   - Resulting in a severity score of approximately 290-650 (0.25-0.58× Great Depression)

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several important limitations affect this forecast:

1. Economic forecasting becomes increasingly uncertain beyond 2-3 year horizons
2. The resolution criteria's specific thresholds (36+ months or -10% annual GDP) create discontinuities in assessment
3. Historical sample size of depression-level events is extremely small, limiting statistical inference
4. Structural changes in the economy make direct historical comparisons challenging
5. The definition of "depression" itself lacks universal consensus among economists
