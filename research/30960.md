# Forecasting H5 Avian Influenza Cases in the United States Before January 1, 2026

## Current Status and Trends

As of May 9, 2025, the CDC has reported 70 human cases of H5 bird flu in the United States with 1 death[1]. This represents a relatively slow progression of cases since the current outbreak began in late March 2024 with the detection of H5N1 in dairy cows[3]. The case count has increased by only 4 cases since January 6, 2025, when 66 confirmed cases had been reported[5].

The timeline of case reporting shows:
- As of January 6, 2025: 66 confirmed human cases since 2024 (67 since 2022)[5]
- As of March 19, 2025: 70 human cases, with 41 associated with specific exposures[2]
- As of May 9, 2025: Still at 70 total cases[1][4]

This indicates a significant slowing in the rate of new infections during the first half of 2025, with no new cases reported between March 19 and May 9, 2025.

## Transmission Patterns and Risk Factors

The CDC has consistently maintained that no person-to-person transmission has been identified[5]. Most infections have been linked to animal-to-human exposures, primarily from contact with infected dairy cows and poultry. Of the 70 reported cases, the exposure sources have been documented, though the exact breakdown in the most recent data is not fully detailed in the available search results.

The public health risk assessment from the CDC remains classified as "low"[4]. This assessment is significant as it suggests that despite the ongoing presence of the virus in animal populations, human cases remain relatively rare and contained.

## Mortality and Severity

The United States reported its first H5N1-related death on January 6, 2025, in Louisiana[5]. This represents a case fatality rate of approximately 1.4% (1 out of 70 cases), which is substantially lower than the global average for H5N1 infections. For comparison, outside the United States, more than 950 cases of H5N1 bird flu have been reported to the World Health Organization with approximately 50% resulting in death[5].

## Comparative Analysis and Forecast Implications

To reach 10,000 cases by January 1, 2026, the United States would need to experience approximately 9,930 new cases in the remaining 7.5 months of 2025. This would require a dramatic shift in the epidemiological pattern currently observed. Based on the current rate of transmission (4 new cases over approximately 4 months), the projected case count by January 1, 2026, would be far below the 10,000 threshold.

For the 10,000 case threshold to be reached, several significant changes would need to occur:

1. Development of efficient person-to-person transmission, which has not been observed to date
2. Substantial mutation of the virus increasing human susceptibility
3. Failure of current containment and surveillance measures
4. Exponential rather than linear growth in case numbers

## Uncertainties and Limitations

Several factors could potentially accelerate case numbers:

1. The CDC notes that the spectrum of illness caused by current H5N1 bird flu viruses is not fully understood, which could lead to underreporting of milder cases[4]
2. Seasonal variations might affect transmission patterns
3. Changes in testing capacity or case definition could alter reported numbers

## Conclusion

Based on the current trajectory and available data as of May 12, 2025, it appears highly unlikely that the CDC will report 10,000 or more H5 avian influenza cases in the United States before January 1, 2026. The current case count of 70, combined with the slow rate of increase and absence of person-to-person transmission, suggests that barring a significant mutation or change in viral behavior, case numbers will remain orders of magnitude below the 10,000 threshold.

The most significant indicator to monitor would be any evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission, which would dramatically alter the forecast. CDC's ongoing surveillance and reporting will provide the most reliable indicators of any potential shift in the epidemiological pattern.
