## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Kneecap, an Irish rap trio known for their politically charged lyrics, is officially listed as part of the Glastonbury 2025 lineup. Their name appears on the festival’s official news release, stage announcements (including Shangri-La and West Holts), and reputable festival tracking sites[1][2][3][4].
- The band has experienced a significant rise in popularity since 2017 but has faced controversy over their lyrics and public statements, particularly regarding recent comments on the Israel-Gaza conflict and UK politics.

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- As of May 26, 2025, Kneecap remains on the published Glastonbury lineup. There has been no public statement from Glastonbury Festival organizers about their removal, despite recent public and media calls for their exclusion[1][3].
- Recent reports confirm Kneecap has been removed from other European festival lineups, notably the Hurricane and Southside festivals in Germany, following similar controversies[5].
- UK police are reportedly investigating complaints about the band’s statements, but no ban or legal action has yet been announced that would prevent their appearance at Glastonbury.

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Official Glastonbury Festival News and Lineup pages[1][2]
- Major UK music news outlets tracking the festival lineup (Radio X, eFestivals)[3][4]
- Metaculus community forecast and news tracking removals from other festivals[5]

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- The ongoing controversy and active UK police investigations introduce real risk of last-minute removal, especially if public or political pressure intensifies.
- The situation is fluid, and official confirmation will only be possible once the band performs or if the organizers make a definitive announcement.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

- Given the current facts—Kneecap’s official listing, absence of removal as of late May, and the festival’s historical tolerance for controversial acts—the probability of Kneecap performing at Glastonbury 2025 is moderately high.
- However, the elevated risk of late-stage cancellation due to recent precedent (festival removals elsewhere) and political environment means this is not a certainty.

> As of May 26, 2025, the best-supported forecast is that Kneecap is more likely than not to perform at Glastonbury 2025, but with meaningful risk of removal if controversy escalates prior to the festival.
