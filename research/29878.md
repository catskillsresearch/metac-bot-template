### Key Factual Information Relevant to the Forecast

- **Polling and Party Support:** As of late October 2024, the Left-Green Movement (VG) is polling at just 2.4% support, placing it near the bottom among Icelandic political parties. This is far below the leading Social Democratic Alliance (over 24%) and other major parties, making it highly unlikely for VG to lead a government or secure the prime ministership[2].
- **Recent Leadership Change:** Svandís Svavarsdóttir was elected as the new chairperson of the Left-Green Movement in October 2024, but this leadership change has not improved the party’s polling numbers[1].
- **Coalition Dynamics and Caretaker Government:** After the collapse of the coalition government in October 2024, the Left-Green Movement chose not to participate in the caretaker government, further reducing its immediate influence in government formation[3].
- **Party Fragmentation:** A new green party, The Greens, was formed in October 2024 by a former Left-Green MP, but it has announced it will not participate in the 2024 parliamentary election, so it will not affect the outcome directly[5].
- **Historical Precedent:** In previous elections, the Left-Green Movement only secured the prime ministership through coalition arrangements despite not being the largest party. Current polling suggests it is not in a position to repeat this outcome[2].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- Polls can shift in the final weeks before an election, but there is no evidence of a surge in support for the Left-Green Movement as of early November 2024.
- Coalition negotiations in Iceland can be unpredictable, but with such low support, the Left-Green Movement is unlikely to be in a position to demand the prime ministership.

### Conclusion

Based on all available factual information as of November 11, 2024, it is highly unlikely that the new Prime Minister of Iceland after the 2024 parliamentary elections will belong to the Left-Green Movement.
