## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status (as of June 7, 2022)

- Ron DeSantis, Governor of Florida, was considered a leading figure in the Republican Party and a potential 2024 presidential candidate. He was running for re-election as governor in 2022.
- Polls from spring 2022 indicated DeSantis led the Republican field when Trump was excluded, but trailed Trump by a wide margin when Trump was included, usually running a distant second[1].
- A new political action committee, “Ready for Ron,” had formed to encourage DeSantis to run for president in 2024, with backing from veteran Republican consultants, reflecting significant establishment interest[1].
- DeSantis’s national profile had grown due to his policies in Florida on COVID-19, education, and other culture war issues, positioning him as a key Republican alternative to Trump.
- The Republican Party’s nomination process is winner-take-all in many states, favoring candidates with strong national followings.
- Historically, sitting or recent governors with strong state-level support have been competitive in presidential primaries, but face challenges if a former president is in the race (e.g., Jeb Bush and Scott Walker in 2016 vs. Trump).

## 2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- As of June 2022, DeSantis had not officially announced a presidential campaign, focusing on his gubernatorial re-election.
- The formation of a PAC (“Ready for Ron”) was a notable indicator of momentum and donor interest for a potential presidential bid[1].
- Donald Trump, former president, was signaling strong interest in running again, which dominated the Republican primary landscape and posed a major obstacle for any challenger, including DeSantis[1].
- DeSantis’s policy positions on COVID-19, education, and social issues were designed to appeal to both the Trump base and more traditional conservatives.

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Wikipedia overview of DeSantis’s political trajectory and 2024 speculation[1].
- Fox News reporting on the formation of a pro-DeSantis PAC and polling data[1].
- Contemporary polling from sources like FiveThirtyEight and RealClearPolitics (not directly cited here but referenced in the Wikipedia article).

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties in Measurement

- The key uncertainty as of June 2022 was whether Trump would run for president again in 2024. Trump’s participation would significantly reduce DeSantis’s chances due to Trump’s dominance in primary polling.
- Polls more than two years before the election can shift dramatically based on political developments, candidate announcements, and unforeseen events.
- DeSantis’s national appeal, fundraising capacity, and performance in a national primary campaign were untested as of June 2022.
- The general election outcome depends not just on winning the Republican nomination, but on the results of the 2024 general election and potential re-election in 2028.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment (as of June 2022)

- If Trump chose not to run, DeSantis would be a frontrunner for the Republican nomination, likely making him one of the top contenders to become president by 2029.
- If Trump ran, DeSantis’s path to the nomination would be much harder, making his chances of becoming president before 2029 considerably lower.
- Overall, as of June 2022, the probability of DeSantis becoming US president by January 20, 2029, would best be described as plausible but highly contingent on Trump’s political decisions and DeSantis’s ability to expand his support beyond Florida.
