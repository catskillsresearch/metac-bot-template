To forecast the number of active US drilling rigs on March 28, 2025, I'll analyze the most recent data and trends available as of March 10, 2025.

## Current Rig Count Status

As of March 7, 2025, the total US drilling rig count stands at 592 rigs, reflecting a decrease of 1 unit from the previous week[5]. This marks the first reduction after five consecutive weeks of additions, potentially signaling a stabilization in drilling activity[4]. The current count is 30 units lower than the 622 rigs that were operating at the same time in 2024[5].

The breakdown of the current rig count shows:
- Oil-directed rigs: 486 (unchanged from the previous week)[4][5]
- Gas-directed rigs: 101 (down 1 from the previous week)[4][5]
- Miscellaneous rigs: 5 (unchanged)[4]

## Regional Distribution and Recent Changes

The geographic distribution of active rigs as of March 7, 2025 shows:
- Texas: 281 rigs (down 1 from previous week)[4][5]
- New Mexico: 105 rigs (unchanged)[4]
- Oklahoma: 49 rigs (unchanged)[4]
- West Virginia: 11 rigs (unchanged from three weeks ago)[4]
- Wyoming: 21 rigs (up 1 from previous week)[5]
- Colorado: 8 rigs (down 1 from previous week)[4][5]
- Kansas: 16 rigs (up 1)[4]

By drilling environment:
- Land-based rigs: 576 (down 2 from previous week)[5]
- Inland waters: 2 (unchanged)[5]
- Offshore: 14 rigs (up 1)[4][5]

## Recent Trend Analysis

The most recent data indicates a slight cooling in drilling activity after a period of growth. The oil rig count has remained relatively stable at 486 since at least February 28, 2025[1], suggesting a period of consolidation in oil drilling operations.

The total rig count of 592 represents the first decline after five consecutive weeks of additions[4], which could indicate that operators are reassessing their drilling plans in response to market conditions. This single-rig decline might be interpreted as a stabilization rather than the beginning of a significant downward trend.

## Factors Affecting Future Rig Counts

Several factors could influence the rig count between now and March 28, 2025:

1. **Oil and Gas Prices**: Drilling activity is closely tied to commodity prices, with operators adjusting their plans based on price expectations.

2. **Seasonal Factors**: Seasonal patterns can affect drilling activity, though these effects are typically more pronounced in Canada than in the US.

3. **Production Strategies**: As noted in the March 10, 2025 report, broader industry trends influenced by production strategies and market conditions could impact drilling decisions[4].

4. **Regional Dynamics**: Different basins may experience varying levels of activity based on their economics and operational considerations.

## Forecast Considerations

Based on the data available as of March 10, 2025, the US rig count has shown relative stability in recent weeks, with only minor fluctuations. The oil rig component has been particularly stable, remaining at 486 for several weeks[1], while the gas rig count has seen a slight decline.

Given the recent trend of five weeks of additions followed by a minor one-rig decline, and considering the stability in the oil rig count, the data suggests that dramatic changes in either direction are unlikely in the short term.

The forecast for March 28, 2025 should consider both the recent stability and the slight cooling in activity, with the understanding that additional market factors could emerge in the intervening weeks.
