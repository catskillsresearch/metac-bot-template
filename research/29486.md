## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- December is historically the wettest month in Brasília, with long-term averages ranging from about 207mm to 396mm of rainfall, and typically 21–22 rainy days in the month[3][5].
- Specific sources report:
  - Weatherspark: ~215mm average December rainfall, with about 75% of days seeing at least 1mm of rain.
  - Whereandwhen.net: 396mm average rainfall in December, 21 days with rain[5].
  - Weather2Travel: 207mm average rainfall, 21 days with rain[3].
  - Avionero: 253mm average, 21 rainy days.
- The National Institute of Meteorology (INMET) is the authoritative source for official rainfall data, and the question will resolve based on the cumulative December 2024 total at station [83377] BRASILIA - DF.

## Recent Announcements and Climate Context

- Brasília experienced a record-breaking drought in 2024, with 167 consecutive days without rain, ending in October.
- September 2024 was the hottest on record for the region, and 2024 is expected to be among the top five hottest years, contributing to increased wildfire activity.
- While such anomalies can affect short-term weather patterns, there is no evidence or forecast suggesting December rainfall will be unusually low or below historical averages.

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The INMET weather station [83377] BRASILIA - DF will provide the definitive rainfall measurement for December 2024.
- Additional climatological data can be cross-checked with sources like Weatherspark, Weather2Travel, and Whereandwhen.net for historical context.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- While recent drought and heat anomalies could influence rainfall, December's climatology in Brasília is dominated by the onset of the wet season, making it highly likely that rainfall will exceed 100mm.
- Forecasts and historical averages are not guarantees; only the INMET station's final December 2024 data will resolve the question.
- If INMET data for December 2024 is unavailable by January 7, 2025, the question will be annulled per the resolution criteria.

## Conclusion

Based on all available historical data and the typical climatology of Brasília, it is extremely likely that rainfall in December 2024 will exceed 100mm, barring an unprecedented anomaly. The final resolution will depend on the INMET station's recorded total for the month.
