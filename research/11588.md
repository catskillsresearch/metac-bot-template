# Forecasting Analysis: National Abortion Ban by 2030

As of June 28, 2022, just four days after the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision overturned Roe v. Wade, I'll analyze the factors relevant to forecasting whether a national abortion ban could be implemented before 2030.

## Current Situation Analysis

The Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization ruling on June 24, 2022, has fundamentally altered the abortion landscape in the United States. The Supreme Court's 6-3 decision has eliminated the constitutional right to abortion that had been established by Roe v. Wade in 1973, returning the authority to regulate abortion to individual states.

In the immediate aftermath of this ruling, several states with "trigger laws" have already moved to ban or severely restrict abortion, while others have strengthened protections for abortion rights. This creates a patchwork of abortion access across the country, with significant regional disparities.

## Key Factors Affecting National Ban Probability

### Political Requirements

For a national abortion ban to be enacted before 2030, several political conditions would likely need to be met:

1. **Congressional Control**: Republicans would need to control both the House and Senate, with either enough votes to overcome a filibuster in the Senate (60 votes) or a willingness to eliminate the filibuster for this issue.

2. **Presidential Support**: A Republican president willing to sign such legislation would be required, or alternatively, a veto-proof majority in Congress.

3. **Supreme Court Approval**: Any national ban would likely face legal challenges, requiring Supreme Court approval. The current 6-3 conservative majority has demonstrated willingness to overturn abortion precedent.

### Constitutional Considerations

The legal basis for a national abortion ban presents complexities:

- **Commerce Clause**: Congress might attempt to use its Commerce Clause powers to regulate abortion nationally, though this approach would face legal challenges.

- **States' Rights Arguments**: Ironically, the same "states' rights" reasoning used in Dobbs could potentially be used to challenge a federal ban.

- **14th Amendment**: Some advocates argue that the 14th Amendment's equal protection or due process clauses could be used to protect fetal life nationally.

### Political Signals

Current political signals provide mixed indications:

- Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has suggested a national abortion ban is "possible," though he's noted the filibuster would remain an obstacle.

- Some Republican lawmakers have expressed interest in pursuing a nationwide 15-week abortion ban.

- Former President Trump has recently stated that abortion should be left to the states, suggesting potential resistance to federal action.

- Democratic Senator Chris Murphy has warned that Republicans would pass a national ban if they win control of government in 2024.

## Probability Assessment

Based on information available as of June 28, 2022, I estimate the following probabilities:

- **25-30% probability** of a national abortion ban before 2030

This assessment is based on several considerations:

1. **Political Hurdles**: Achieving the necessary political alignment (presidency, House, Senate with 60 votes or elimination of filibuster) presents significant challenges.

2. **Constitutional Questions**: Uncertainty exists about whether the courts would uphold a national ban given federalism concerns.

3. **Public Opinion**: National polling consistently shows majority support for legal abortion in at least some circumstances, creating political pressure against a complete ban.

4. **Electoral Cycles**: There will be two presidential elections (2024, 2028) and four congressional elections before 2030, providing multiple opportunities for political realignment.

5. **Republican Divisions**: Not all Republicans support federal intervention, with some preferring state-level decision-making on abortion.

## Key Uncertainties

Several uncertainties could significantly shift this probability:

- Future Supreme Court composition
- Changes in public opinion following state-level abortion bans
- Emergence of new abortion-related medical technologies
- Impact of abortion on upcoming electoral outcomes
- Republican Party internal dynamics on federal vs. state authority

## Conclusion

While a national abortion ban before 2030 is possible, it faces substantial political, legal, and practical hurdles. The most likely pathway would require Republicans to gain unified control of government, potentially modify Senate rules, and overcome likely legal challenges. The probability is significant but not the most likely outcome based on information available as of June 28, 2022.
