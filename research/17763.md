# Forecasting Analysis: Threads vs. Twitter Monthly Active Users by 2026

As of July 23, 2023, we have limited but significant data to help forecast whether Threads will surpass Twitter in monthly active users (MAUs) before the end of 2025. Let's analyze the available information.

## Current Status and Early Adoption Trends

Threads launched on July 6, 2023, and experienced explosive initial growth followed by a significant drop-off:

- The platform reported 41.79 million daily active users on launch day, climbing to 49.3 million the following day (July 7)[1]
- By July 14, 2023, daily active users had declined to 23.6 million, representing a 52% drop in just one week[1]
- Threads achieved over 100 million sign-ups in its first five days, making it the fastest app to reach this milestone, surpassing even ChatGPT[5]

Meanwhile, Twitter (now X) had approximately 368 million monthly active users as of December 2022, as mentioned in the question description.

## Key Factors That May Influence Growth

### Advantages for Threads

1. **Instagram Integration**: Threads benefits from seamless integration with Instagram, allowing users to sign up with just one or two clicks from their existing Instagram accounts. This significantly lowers the barrier to entry.

2. **Meta's Ecosystem**: As part of Meta's portfolio, Threads has access to massive cross-promotion opportunities. Meta's other platforms have demonstrated remarkable user growth:
   - Facebook: ~2.9 billion MAUs
   - Instagram: Well over 1 billion MAUs
   - WhatsApp: Well over 1 billion MAUs

3. **Twitter's Instability**: Under Elon Musk's leadership, Twitter has experienced controversial changes that have alienated some users and advertisers, potentially creating an opportunity for competitors.

### Challenges for Threads

1. **Retention Issues**: The 52% drop in daily active users within the first week suggests significant challenges in user retention[1]. Initial curiosity may have driven sign-ups, but keeping users engaged appears problematic.

2. **Feature Parity**: At launch, Threads lacked several key features available on Twitter, including a web interface, direct messaging, and robust search functionality.

3. **Network Effects**: Twitter's established user base and network effects represent a significant barrier for any challenger platform.

## Uncertainties and Limitations

Several important factors remain unclear as of July 23, 2023:

1. **Monthly Active Users vs. Sign-ups**: While Threads reported 100 million sign-ups, this doesn't translate directly to monthly active users. The rapid decline in daily active users suggests many sign-ups may not convert to regular users.

2. **Twitter's Trajectory**: Whether Twitter's user base will continue to decline under Musk's leadership remains uncertain.

3. **Feature Development**: Threads' ability to quickly develop and deploy features that retain users will be crucial for long-term growth.

4. **International Expansion**: Threads' initial launch excluded the European Union due to regulatory concerns, limiting its potential user base.

## Assessment

Based on the information available as of July 23, 2023, Threads faces significant challenges in overtaking Twitter's MAU count by the end of 2025. While its initial sign-up numbers were impressive, the rapid decline in daily active users suggests retention issues that must be addressed for sustained growth.

However, Meta's resources, cross-platform integration capabilities, and Twitter's ongoing challenges under Musk create a plausible pathway for Threads to close the gap. If Meta can address early retention issues and Twitter continues to lose users, Threads could potentially overtake Twitter within the specified timeframe.

The key metrics to monitor going forward will be:
- Threads' ability to convert initial sign-ups to regular monthly users
- The rate of Twitter's user decline or growth
- Feature development and international expansion of Threads
