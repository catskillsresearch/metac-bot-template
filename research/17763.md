## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- **Threads user growth:** Threads launched in July 2023 with over 100 million sign-ups in the first week, becoming the fastest app to hit 100 million users[3]. Its MAUs initially dropped after launch but rebounded, reaching 130 million in February 2024, 175 million in July 2024, and 275 million in November 2024[3]. By early 2025, sources report Threads with between 320 million[5] and 350 million MAUs[2].
- **X (Twitter) user trends:** As of December 2022, X reported 368 million MAUs. In 2024, estimates vary: company announcements cite 550 million MAUs, while analytics firms like Sensor Tower reported around 349 million MAUs in Q1 2024[1]. Daily active users for X have reportedly declined, with 259.4 million DAUs cited recently[5]. There is consensus that X's user growth has stagnated or declined, possibly due to platform changes and leadership under Elon Musk[1].

## 2. Recent Announcements and Policies

- **Threads** has benefited from tight integration with Instagram and the broader Meta ecosystem, facilitating easy sign-ups and cross-promotion. Meta continues to invest in features and international expansion, supporting sustained growth[3].
- **X (Twitter)** has seen significant changes under Elon Musk, including controversial policy shifts, paid verification, and content moderation changes, which have led to user dissatisfaction and advertiser pullback[1]. These factors likely dampen user growth or even contribute to attrition.

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Meta’s quarterly reports and public statements are the primary sources for Threads MAUs[3][2].
- X (Twitter) no longer publishes official user numbers regularly, but company announcements and third-party analytics (e.g., Sensor Tower, Statista) provide estimates[1][3].
- Social media analytics platforms (e.g., Sensor Tower, Statista) and reputable tech news outlets (e.g., TechCrunch, NBC News) corroborate these figures[1][3].

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- **Definition of MAU:** Both platforms may use different methods to calculate MAUs, complicating direct comparisons.
- **Data transparency:** Meta regularly reports user statistics; X (Twitter) is less transparent post-privatization, making third-party estimates more relevant but less precise.
- **Sustaining engagement:** Threads’ rapid user growth may not equate to sustained monthly activity unless Meta continues to innovate and retain users.
- **Market saturation:** Both platforms may face growth ceilings as they approach global social media saturation.

## Probabilistic Assessment

- As of April 2025, Threads has between 320–350 million MAUs, very close to (or potentially surpassing) the lower-bound estimates for X (Twitter), which are in the 349–550 million range depending on the source[2][3][5][1]. The trend for Threads is strongly upward, while X’s growth is stagnant or negative.
- If Threads maintains its current trajectory (adding ~75 million MAUs in four months between July and November 2024), it is highly probable that it will surpass X’s MAUs before the end of 2025, especially if X’s stagnation or decline continues.

**Adjusted Probabilistic Forecast:**  
There is a strong probability (>80%) that Threads will report more monthly active users than Twitter (X) before the end of 2025, barring unforeseen market shifts or reporting irregularities.
