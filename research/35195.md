## Forecast: Will Sterile Water Injections Be in Shortage According to the FDA on April 1, 2025?

### 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of February 5, 2025, sterile water for injection (large volume bags) is officially listed as in shortage by multiple authoritative sources, including Drugs.com and the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP)[1][2][4].
- The shortage is attributed to significant damage at Baxter’s North Cove manufacturing facility, a major supplier of IV fluids, following Hurricane Helene in late 2024. Only some production lines are operational, and all marketed presentations are on allocation, meaning supply is insufficient for normal ordering[1][5].
- ICU Medical and the FDA are coordinating to temporarily import sterile water products from Canada to help alleviate the shortage, but these are interim measures and do not fully resolve the underlying supply constraints[1][3].

### 2. Recent Announcements and Policies

- The FDA has been actively working with manufacturers to manage inventory, expedite reviews, and allow temporary imports to address the shortage[3].
- Despite these efforts, industry reports and surveys indicate that shortages of IV fluids, including sterile water, are projected to persist into 2025. Hospitals have reported significant reductions in available products, and elective procedures have been canceled to conserve supply[5].

### 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The FDA’s Drug Shortages Database and Drugs.com both list sterile water for injection as in shortage as of early February 2025[2][4].
- ASHP provides detailed shortage status and management recommendations, confirming ongoing allocation and insufficient supply[1].
- Pharmacy Times and other industry publications corroborate that the shortage is expected to continue into 2025 due to ongoing manufacturing disruptions[5].

### 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- The exact FDA status for April 1, 2025, cannot be confirmed as of February 20, 2025. However, all available evidence and expert projections indicate that the shortage is ongoing and unlikely to be fully resolved by that date.
- The situation remains dynamic, and while mitigation efforts are underway, no authoritative source has projected a full resolution before April 2025.

> Based on all available data as of February 20, 2025, it is highly likely that sterile water injections will be in shortage according to the FDA on April 1, 2025.
