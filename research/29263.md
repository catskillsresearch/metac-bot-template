### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of the week ending September 28, 2024, the U.S. COVID-19 hospitalization rate was 3.2 per 100,000—the lowest for that week since the pandemic began. Previous years’ rates for the same week were higher: 4.3 (2020), 9.9 (2021), 6.0 (2022), and 4.6 (2023)[4].
- Since mid-August 2024, national trends show a decline in COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths[4].
- Wastewater surveillance indicates low viral activity across most of the U.S., with exceptions in Montana, Oregon, and 14 other states[4].

### Variant Dynamics

- The dominant variant at the end of September 2024 was KP.3.1.1, with XEC rising rapidly to second place. However, there is no evidence that XEC is significantly more transmissible or severe than previous variants, according to expert commentary and CDC monitoring[4].
- CDC’s modeling for the 2024-2025 respiratory season assumes new variants will behave similarly to those of the prior winter, with comparable vaccine performance and uptake[4].

### CDC Projections and Announcements

- The CDC’s Center for Forecasting and Outbreak Analytics, in its August 29, 2024, outlook, projected that the peak COVID-19 hospitalization rate for the 2024-2025 season would be similar to or lower than last year’s peak, provided variant behavior and vaccination rates remain stable[4].
- The CDC’s projections are based on the assumption that the summer wave peaked before October, which would likely result in a smaller autumn/winter wave[4].

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The CDC’s RESP-NET and COVID-NET dashboards provide weekly hospitalization rates for COVID-19, with RESP-NET covering about 10% of the U.S. population and being generally representative[5].
- The CDC COVID Data Tracker also provides hospitalization trends and is updated regularly[1][2].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- RESP-NET and COVID-NET data are not fully national but have historically tracked national trends well[5].
- Unforeseen changes in variant behavior, vaccine uptake, or public health policy could alter the trajectory.
- Data reporting delays or revisions may affect the final rate used for resolution.

### Conclusion

Given the declining trend in hospitalizations, the current rate of 3.2 per 100,000, and CDC projections for a season similar to or milder than last year, there is substantial factual support for the possibility that the lowest weekly COVID-19 hospitalization rate between October 5, 2024, and January 4, 2025, could fall below 2.0 per 100,000. However, this outcome is contingent on the absence of a significant new variant or reversal in current trends.
