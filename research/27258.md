## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of July 16, 2024, Jeff Bezos was ranked second on the Forbes Real-Time Billionaires List, with a net worth of $209.7 billion, behind Elon Musk ($252.3B) and ahead of Bernard Arnault ($177.4B)[4].
- Bezos's net worth is highly sensitive to Amazon's stock price. In early August 2024, a 13% drop in Amazon shares led to a $21 billion decrease in his net worth, bringing it down to $185.3 billion according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index[1][3].
- Despite this drop, other sources still place his net worth around $210 billion, confirming his position as the second richest person as of July 2024[2][4].

## Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Metric

- No major announcements or policy changes have been reported that would significantly impact Bezos's net worth or his ranking before September 30, 2024.
- The recent sharp decline in Amazon stock is the most significant event, and further volatility in tech stocks could impact Bezos's ranking[1][3].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The Forbes Real-Time Billionaires List is the specified and authoritative source for resolving this question.
- Other trackers, such as the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, provide similar but not identical figures[1][4].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- Bezos's ranking is highly dependent on Amazon's stock performance, which can fluctuate rapidly.
- The possibility of a tie for second place (which would resolve as "No") or a sudden surge/drop in net worth for Bezos or his competitors introduces uncertainty.
- Forbes and Bloomberg may report slightly different net worths due to methodology, but Forbes is the resolution source.
- There is no evidence as of August 19, 2024, that Bernard Arnault or another billionaire is likely to overtake Bezos imminently, but continued poor performance of Amazon stock could put his second-place ranking at risk.

## Conclusion

Based on all available data as of August 19, 2024, Jeff Bezos is most likely to remain in either the 1st or 2nd position on the Forbes Real-Time Billionaires List on September 30, 2024, barring a continued or accelerated decline in Amazon stock or an extraordinary event affecting his competitors. However, the risk of falling to third place has increased due to recent volatility in Amazon's share price[1][3][4].
