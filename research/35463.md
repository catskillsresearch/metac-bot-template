### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- During his first term (2017–2021), Donald Trump granted executive clemency to 237 individuals, often issuing multiple pardons or commutations at once, including high-profile and politically motivated cases[2][5].
- In his second term, Trump has continued this pattern. On January 20, 2025, he issued a mass pardon for individuals convicted in connection with the January 6, 2021, Capitol events[1][4].
- On January 23, 2025, Trump pardoned nearly two dozen anti-abortion activists, again demonstrating a tendency to grant clemency to groups rather than individuals[3].

### Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- The January 2025 actions indicate Trump’s willingness to use executive clemency for political signaling and to address issues important to his base[1][3][4].
- There have been no public announcements or credible reports, as of February 27, 2025, of planned clemency actions specifically for March 2025.

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The official White House website and public proclamations are primary sources for executive clemency actions[1].
- Wikipedia maintains an up-to-date list of individuals granted executive clemency by Donald Trump, with references to official documents and news coverage[2].
- Major news outlets (e.g., Politico, LA Times) and legal analysis organizations (e.g., Brennan Center) provide timely reporting on high-profile clemency actions[3][4][5].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- Only clemencies that are publicly disclosed will count toward the resolution of this question.
- The president’s use of clemency is highly discretionary and can be unpredictable, especially in response to political events or lobbying.
- There is no public information as of February 27, 2025, indicating that Trump will or will not grant more than three clemencies in March 2025.

### Summary

As of February 27, 2025, Donald Trump has demonstrated a pattern of granting executive clemency to multiple individuals at once, including two large-scale actions in January 2025. However, there is no public information confirming whether he will grant executive clemency to more than three individuals in March 2025. The base rate and recent actions suggest it is plausible, but the outcome remains uncertain until official announcements are made and publicly disclosed.
