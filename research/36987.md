## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The Billboard Artist 100 top 10 is generally stable week-to-week, with most artists remaining in the top 10 for multiple consecutive weeks, driven by sustained streaming, sales, and airplay[1][3].
- The Hot 100 top 10 (a related but not identical metric) also shows that a handful of artists can dominate for weeks, as in 2025 where Kendrick Lamar and SZA have led the charts for extended periods[3].
- There is a correlation between album release cycles and the entrance of new artists into the top 10: major new albums or viral songs can propel previously unranked or lower-ranked artists rapidly into the top tier.

## Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- As of mid-May 2025, there are no announced changes to Billboard's chart methodology or data sources that would affect the composition of the Artist 100[1][3].
- No press releases or industry news suggest an imminent wave of debut albums or singles from completely new artists in late June 2025.

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Billboard's official Artist 100 chart page will publish the relevant data for the week of June 28, 2025.
- Social media accounts (e.g., Billboardâ€™s Instagram) and music news outlets regularly report the weekly top 10[1].
- Wikipedia pages tracking Hot 100 and Artist 100 number-one artists provide context and historical trends[3].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- The exact weekly turnover rate for the Artist 100 top 10 is not provided for recent months, limiting precise quantification.
- Surprise releases or viral media events could unexpectedly increase the number of new artists in the top 10 for the target week.
- The Hot 100 and Artist 100 are correlated but not identical; some discrepancies may exist in turnover rates.

## Probabilistic Assessment

Given the historical stability of the top 10 and the lack of announced disruptive events as of May 14, 2025, the most likely outcome is that **one or two artists** in the top 10 of the Billboard Artist 100 for the last week of June 2025 will be new to the top 10 that week. There is a moderate probability of zero or three, but "one or two" best matches both recent stability and plausible but unverified potential for turnover.

**Most probable answer:** One or Two
