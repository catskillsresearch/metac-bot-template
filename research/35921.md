# Forecasting Albanese vs. Trump Approval Ratings for April 1, 2025

To forecast whether Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese will have a higher approval rating than US President Donald Trump on April 1, 2025, I'll analyze the available polling data and trends as of March 13, 2025.

## Current Status of Anthony Albanese's Approval

Anthony Albanese's approval ratings have shown a notable trajectory over the first quarter of 2025:

- In January 2025, Albanese recorded his worst-ever approval ratings according to Newspoll, with a net personal approval of minus 20% (37% satisfied, 57% dissatisfied)[3]
- By February 2025, multiple polls showed varying results:
  - Newspoll (Feb 10-14): 37% approval with a net approval of -21%[1]
  - Essential (Feb 12-16): 42% approval with a net approval of -6%[1]
  - Resolve Strategic (Feb 18-23): 34% approval with a net approval of -22%[1]
  - Freshwater Strategy (Feb 21-23): 35% approval with a net approval of -11%[1]

- By March 2025, YouGov polling (March 7-13) indicated that Albanese's "personal satisfaction levels have notably improved," coinciding with Labor consolidating a 51% to 49% lead over the Coalition[2]

This suggests a potential upward trend in Albanese's approval ratings from January through March 2025, though the exact numerical improvement by March is not specified in the available data.

## Trump's Standing in Australia and Globally

The search results provide limited direct information about Trump's current global approval ratings, but offer some relevant insights:

- As of March 2025, only 31% of Australians support Trump in his disagreement with Ukrainian President Zelensky, while 69% support Zelensky[2]
- YouGov notes that "Overseas leaders who've opposed Trump's policies have seen improvements in their polling results"[2]
- Trump's "recent 25% tariff decision" is mentioned as presenting an opportunity for Albanese to further improve his leadership standing[2]

These points suggest that Trump may have relatively low approval in Australia, though this doesn't necessarily reflect his global or US approval ratings.

## Factors That May Influence April 2025 Ratings

Several factors could influence both leaders' approval ratings by April 1:

1. **Australian Election Context**: With a federal election approaching in 2025, Albanese's ratings may be particularly volatile as campaign dynamics unfold[1][3]

2. **International Relations**: The disagreement between Trump and Zelensky, along with Trump's tariff policies, appears to be creating opportunities for Albanese to position himself in contrast to Trump[2]

3. **Economic Factors**: The Australian budget was scheduled for March 25, 2025[3], which could impact Albanese's approval depending on its reception

4. **Trend Direction**: Albanese's approval appears to be recovering from January lows, while the limited information on Trump suggests potential challenges in international perception

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several important limitations affect this forecast:

1. **Measurement Differences**: The polling methodologies for Albanese in Australia versus Trump globally may differ significantly, making direct comparisons challenging

2. **Limited Trump Data**: The search results provide minimal direct information about Trump's current approval ratings

3. **Time Gap**: The most recent data is from March 13, leaving approximately two weeks during which significant events could occur before April 1

4. **Morning Consult Methodology**: While the resolution criteria specify Morning Consult as the data source, the search results don't include their current measurements for either leader

## Conclusion

Based on the available information as of March 13, 2025, Albanese appears to be experiencing an upward trend in approval ratings after hitting lows in January. Meanwhile, Trump faces some international challenges, particularly regarding his policies on Ukraine and tariffs. However, without direct comparative approval ratings from Morning Consult or equivalent sources, it's difficult to make a definitive forecast about their relative standings on April 1, 2025.

The improving trajectory for Albanese and the international reaction to some of Trump's policies suggest a potential scenario where Albanese could have higher approval ratings, but this conclusion comes with significant uncertainty given the limitations in the available data.
