## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) is a federally funded program established in 1981 to help low-income households pay their energy bills. It provides direct financial assistance to eligible households, with eligibility based on income and other factors[5].
- As of March 2025, LIHEAP is still active. The California 2025 LIHEAP State Plan, for example, confirms the program’s operation from October 1, 2024, through at least September 30, 2025[3]. Federal and state agencies continue to accept applications and distribute funds[1][5].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- Congress passed a continuing resolution on March 14, 2025, funding the federal government, including LIHEAP, through September 2025[1].
- While there have been significant funding cuts and changes to eligibility targeting, these do not amount to program elimination. Instead, they focus on prioritizing the neediest households[5].
- The Heritage Foundation-led Project 2025 policy agenda proposes eliminating LIHEAP and other energy assistance programs, but as of March 2025, these proposals have not been enacted into law or policy[4].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The [Project 2025 Tracker spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QGG6wNHna-1tt91yXNkOauAJJ7snobFjfEnmxlmzhl4/edit?gid=0#gid=0) is the definitive source for the status of this objective.
- Official state and federal documents, such as the 2025 LIHEAP State Plan and agency websites, confirm the program’s ongoing status[1][3][5].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- The Tracker spreadsheet is maintained by the Keep_Track subreddit community. Its update frequency and methodology are not fully transparent, so there may be delays or subjective interpretations in marking objectives as "complete."
- Policy changes could theoretically occur between March 14 and April 1, 2025, but as of the cutoff, there is no evidence of imminent elimination.
- The resolution depends strictly on the status shown in the spreadsheet as accessed on or after April 1, 2025, regardless of any real-world developments.

## Conclusion

As of March 14, 2025, all available evidence indicates that LIHEAP continues to operate and is funded through at least September 2025. No legislative or executive action has eliminated the program, and the Project 2025 Tracker spreadsheet marks the objective as "in progress." Therefore, it is highly unlikely that the Tracker will mark the objective to eliminate LIHEAP as "complete" on April 1, 2025[1][3][5].
