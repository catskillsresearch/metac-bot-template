## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- SWAPO has governed Namibia since independence and has traditionally won presidential elections with large margins[5].
- In the 2019 presidential election, SWAPO's candidate won with a reduced majority, while opposition candidate Panduleni Itula received 30% of the vote, the highest for any opposition figure in Namibian history[4].
- Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah, SWAPO's vice president and deputy prime minister, is the party's sole candidate for the 2024 election and is widely regarded as the overwhelming favorite[2][5].
- The 2024 election is considered more competitive, with several prominent opposition candidates, including Panduleni Itula (Independent Patriots for Change), Job Amupanda (Affirmative Repositioning), and Ally Angula (independent, backed by smaller parties)[4].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- President Hage Geingob, who led SWAPO to victory in previous elections, named Nandi-Ndaitwah as the party's sole candidate and called for party unity to avoid internal divisions[5].
- SWAPO's leadership has publicly rallied behind Nandi-Ndaitwah, emphasizing her experience and the need for a united campaign[5].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Official election results will be published by Namibia's Electoral Commission and reported by major news outlets and international observers.
- The Africa Center for Strategic Studies and Africa Intelligence provide ongoing analysis of the Namibian political landscape[2][4].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- No public opinion polls or credible projections as of October 31, 2024, directly estimate Nandi-Ndaitwah's likely vote share.
- The 2019 election showed a significant increase in opposition support, suggesting SWAPO's dominance may be challenged further in 2024[4].
- The presence of multiple opposition candidates could split the anti-SWAPO vote, potentially benefiting Nandi-Ndaitwah, but the overall competitiveness of the race introduces uncertainty.
- The impact of President Geingob's death and the transition to new leadership may affect voter sentiment and turnout.

## Summary

As of October 31, 2024, Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah is the clear favorite to win the Namibian presidential election, backed by the historically dominant SWAPO party and party leadership unity. However, the rise of a competitive opposition and the lack of recent polling data introduce uncertainty about whether she will secure 55% or more of the vote in the first round. The most recent trend (2019) suggests SWAPO's vote share is declining, but the fragmented opposition may still allow for a first-round victory above the 55% threshold.
