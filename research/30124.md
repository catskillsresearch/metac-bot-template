## Cruise Rider-Only Ride-Hailing Service Status as of Late 2024

**Key Historical Trends and Current Status**
- Cruise, General Motors’ autonomous vehicle subsidiary, suspended all driverless operations nationwide in late 2023 following a series of safety incidents and regulatory actions, including the loss of its California permits[1][2][4].
- As of April 2024, Cruise had only resumed manual (human-driven) vehicle operations in select cities (e.g., Phoenix, Dallas, Houston) for mapping and data collection, not for autonomous, rider-only service[2][4].
- The official Cruise website, as of March 2024, states that ride-hail services are not available, with only a waitlist open for future service[1].

**Recent Announcements and Policies**
- In August 2024, Cruise and Uber announced a multi-year partnership to deploy Cruise autonomous vehicles on the Uber platform, but this launch is explicitly scheduled for 2025, not 2024[3][4].
- Cruise has been working to address regulatory and safety concerns, including recalling vehicles and settling with California regulators, but there is no public indication of a return to rider-only service before the end of 2024[4].

**Authoritative Sources for Verification**
- Cruise’s official website and blog[1][2]
- Press releases and news coverage from Uber, TechCrunch, and other industry outlets[3][4]
- Industry roundups confirming that Waymo, not Cruise, is the only company operating a fully autonomous ride-hailing service in 2024[5]

**Limitations and Uncertainties**
- There is always the possibility of rapid regulatory or operational changes, but as of November 15, 2024, there are no credible announcements or evidence that Cruise will resume rider-only, public ride-hailing service anywhere in the U.S. by December 31, 2024.
- All available information points to a planned relaunch in 2025, not 2024.

**Conclusion**
Based on all available factual information as of November 15, 2024, Cruise is not operating, nor is it scheduled to operate, a rider-only ride-hailing service available to the general public anywhere in the United States on December 31, 2024[1][2][3][4][5].
