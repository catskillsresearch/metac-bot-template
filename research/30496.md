### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The average high temperature in Jacksonville, FL during December typically ranges from 65°F to 70°F, with daily highs rarely exceeding 79°F[4].
- Historical weather records indicate that while it is uncommon, temperatures above 80°F have occurred in December, but these are rare events[3][4].
- For example, in December 2023, the record high for one day was 84°F, demonstrating that such temperatures are possible, though infrequent[2].
- Recent Decembers have included both unusually cold spells (such as December 2022, with lows in the 20s) and quick rebounds to the 70s, but not consistently above 80°F[5].

### Recent Announcements or Policies

- There have been no recent policy changes or climate announcements that would directly affect the likelihood of December temperatures exceeding 80°F in Jacksonville.

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The definitive source for this metric is the Iowa Environmental Mesonet (IEM) data calendar for the Jacksonville Naval Air Station, which will report the official daily high temperatures for December 2024 as required by the resolution criteria.

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- The main limitation is the inherent variability of weather; while historical data suggests exceeding 80°F in December is rare, it is not impossible.
- The resolution depends on the availability and completeness of the IEM data. Missing data ("MM") will not be considered, but this is not typically a significant issue for ASOS stations.
- Only the IEM data calendar will be used for resolution, regardless of other sources.
