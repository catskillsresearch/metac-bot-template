## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The Wolf Amendment, enacted in 2011, prohibits NASA from using federal funds for direct, bilateral cooperation with the Chinese government or Chinese-owned entities, unless Congress and the FBI certify such cooperation poses no technology transfer or human rights risks[1][2][5].
- The law has been renewed annually with little substantive debate, reflecting ongoing Congressional concerns over national security, technology theft, and human rights[3][5].
- Occasional exceptions (e.g., 2019 lunar data exchange, 2023 Chang’e-5 lunar sample transfer) have occurred, but only with explicit Congressional authorization, and have not altered or repealed the law[2][5].

## 2. Recent Announcements and Policies

- As of late 2023, a rare instance saw NASA obtain lunar samples from China’s Chang’e-5 mission, but this required a specific certification to Congress and did not signal a policy shift or amendment repeal[5].
- US–China relations in space remain competitive, with bipartisan political rhetoric frequently framing China as a strategic rival, further entrenching the Wolf Amendment’s status quo[4][5].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Official NASA policy FAQ[2]
- Congressional appropriations and legislative text[1]
- Recent analyses from science policy journals and reputable international think tanks[3][4][5]

## 4. Key Differences and Uncertainties

- While individual, one-off scientific collaborations can proceed with Congressional approval, these do not constitute a repeal of the Wolf Amendment and are insufficient to resolve this question as "No" under the specified criteria.
- There is no evidence of legislative movement to repeal the Wolf Amendment as of December 2022, nor is there a shift in US–China relations that would prompt such a change.
- The main source of uncertainty is the potential for an unforeseen geopolitical event or change in Congressional leadership that could alter current policy, but no such developments are evident within the available data.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the law’s consistent renewal, bipartisan support for restrictions on US–China space cooperation, and the lack of momentum for legislative repeal, the probability that the Wolf Amendment will remain in force until 2030 is high—likely exceeding 90% barring a major shift in US–China relations or Congressional priorities[1][2][5].
