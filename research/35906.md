# Rainfall Forecast for Brasília, Brazil in March 2025

Based on historical data and climate patterns available as of March 11, 2025, here is an analysis to help forecast rainfall in Brasília for March 2025.

## Historical Rainfall Patterns

Brasília experiences a tropical climate with distinct wet and dry seasons throughout the year[3]. Historical data indicates that March is firmly within Brasília's rainy season, as most of Brazil receives the majority of its annual rainfall between December and April[5].

Specifically for March, historical records show that Brasília typically receives approximately 132mm (5.2") of precipitation spread across 25 rainy days[2]. This makes March one of the wetter months in Brasília's annual cycle, though not as wet as December, which is historically the wettest month with around 245mm of rainfall across 26 rainy days[4].

## Annual Precipitation Context

To put March rainfall in context, Brasília receives substantial annual precipitation totaling approximately 1421-1443mm per year[1][4]. This places Brasília in the moderate rainfall category for Brazil, as most regions of the country receive between 1,000 and 1,500mm annually[5].

The city's location and tropical climate classification result in a clear distinction between wet and dry seasons, with summers (December-March in the Southern Hemisphere) being significantly rainier than winter months[3]. July stands in stark contrast as the driest month, receiving merely 0.8mm of precipitation over just 3 rainy days on average[4].

## Verification Sources

For verification of actual March 2025 rainfall data, the National Institute of Meteorology (INMET) weather station [83377] BRASILIA - DF will provide the official measurements. This data can be accessed through INMET's weather station map, where precipitation is recorded as "Chuva (mm)" in their data tables.

## Measurement Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors could affect the accuracy of rainfall forecasts for March 2025:

1. Climate variability: Year-to-year variations in rainfall patterns can be significant, especially in tropical regions.

2. Climate change impacts: Global warming is affecting precipitation patterns worldwide, including in Brasília, potentially causing changes in the frequency and intensity of rainfall events[4].

3. Seasonal shifts: The timing of seasonal transitions between wet and dry periods may vary from year to year.

4. Measurement methodology: The specific location of the INMET weather station may not represent rainfall across the entire city of Brasília, as precipitation can vary significantly even within short distances.

Given these considerations and historical data, March 2025 in Brasília is likely to experience rainfall in the range of 132mm distributed across approximately 25 rainy days, though actual measurements may vary based on current climate conditions.
