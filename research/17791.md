# Forecasting Analysis: Ukraine's Potential Nuclear Weapons Program

As of September 2, 2023, I'll analyze the likelihood of Ukraine launching a nuclear weapons program before 2026 based on historical context, current capabilities, and official statements.

## Historical Context and Current Status

Ukraine was once the third-largest nuclear power in the world, inheriting approximately 1,900 strategic nuclear warheads and 2,500 tactical nuclear weapons after the Soviet Union's collapse. Under the 1994 Budapest Memorandum, Ukraine relinquished this arsenal in exchange for security assurances from Russia, the United States, and the United Kingdom.

The Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the full-scale invasion beginning in February 2022 have fundamentally undermined these security guarantees, creating existential concerns for Ukraine's leadership. This security deficit has led to public statements by Ukrainian officials considering nuclear rearmament as an alternative to NATO membership.

## Nuclear Capabilities Assessment

Ukraine possesses significant technical prerequisites that could support a nuclear weapons program:

- **Nuclear Energy Infrastructure**: Ukraine ranks 7th globally in nuclear energy generation with 15 operational reactors across four power plants
- **Uranium Resources**: The country has domestic uranium deposits and processing facilities
- **Technical Expertise**: Ukraine maintains a substantial cadre of nuclear scientists and engineers
- **Delivery Systems**: Ukraine has historical experience with missile technology, including previous involvement in intercontinental ballistic missile production (Tsyklon)

## Official Statements and Policy Positions

Several high-ranking Ukrainian officials have publicly discussed nuclear weapons as a potential security option:

- In 2021, Ukrainian Ambassador to Germany Andrij Melnyk stated that Ukraine might reconsider its non-nuclear status if NATO membership remained unattainable
- In February 2022, President Volodymyr Zelensky suggested at the Munich Security Conference that Ukraine might revisit its nuclear status given the failure of Budapest Memorandum security guarantees

## Constraints and Obstacles

Despite these capabilities and statements, Ukraine faces significant barriers to developing nuclear weapons:

- **International Monitoring**: As a signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, Ukraine is subject to IAEA inspections
- **Resource Limitations**: The ongoing war has strained Ukraine's economic and industrial resources
- **Western Support Contingencies**: Military aid from Western allies would likely be jeopardized by a nuclear weapons program
- **Technical Challenges**: While Ukraine has nuclear expertise, weaponization presents additional technical hurdles

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on available information as of September 2023, I assess the likelihood of Ukraine launching a nuclear weapons program before 2026 as **low to moderate** (approximately 15-30%), with several key factors that could shift this probability:

### Factors that could increase probability:
- Further deterioration of Ukraine's conventional military position
- Explicit nuclear threats or nuclear use by Russia
- Withdrawal of Western security commitments
- Failure of peace negotiations

### Factors that could decrease probability:
- Concrete NATO membership pathway
- Strong alternative security guarantees from Western allies
- De-escalation of the conflict
- Increased costs of pursuing nuclear weapons (sanctions, loss of support)

## Conclusion

Ukraine has both the technical capacity and potential motivation to pursue nuclear weapons. However, the significant international consequences and current dependence on Western support create strong disincentives. The most likely path toward nuclear weapons would emerge if Ukraine perceives an existential threat without adequate security guarantees from allies.

The situation remains highly dynamic, with Ukrainian officials using nuclear ambiguity as a strategic tool to emphasize their security needs. Close monitoring of official statements, changes in nuclear infrastructure activities, and the trajectory of the conflict will be essential indicators for updating this assessment.
