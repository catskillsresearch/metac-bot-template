**Key historical trends and current status**

- Ukraine surrendered its inherited nuclear arsenal in 1994 in exchange for security guarantees under the Budapest Memorandum, which have since been violated by Russia[4].
- Since the Russian annexation of Crimea (2014) and the full-scale invasion (2022), Ukrainian officials have periodically raised the nuclear issue as leverage, particularly when Western security guarantees falter[1][2][5].
- As of early 2025, Ukraine possesses significant nuclear expertise, civilian nuclear infrastructure, uranium resources, and missile technology, theoretically enabling a rapid weapons program if so ordered[2].

**Recent announcements and policies**

- President Zelenskyy and other officials have stated that, given the failure of security guarantees, Ukraine faces a stark choice between NATO membership or “manufacturing nuclear weapons”[2][5].
- However, every such statement has been quickly clarified: both Zelenskyy and the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry have repeatedly and explicitly denied any current intention to develop nuclear weapons, affirming Ukraine’s commitment to the Non-Proliferation Treaty[2][5].
- No credible reports from major media, Ukrainian/allied officials, or international agencies have indicated the initiation of a weapons program as of May 2025[1][2][5].

**Authoritative sources for verification**

- Major international media, statements by Ukrainian ministers, allied government officials, and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) have all been monitoring the situation closely. The IAEA maintains a presence at all Ukrainian nuclear plants, making a covert program highly unlikely[3].

**Limitations or uncertainties**

- The situation is dynamic: if Western support were to evaporate and Russia’s aggression escalate further, Ukrainian incentives could theoretically shift.
- Public nuclear rhetoric, while increasing, has thus far served as a lever for diplomatic pressure rather than concrete policy.
- Any move towards weaponization would likely be detected rapidly by international agencies or media.

**Adjusted probabilistic assessment**

Given Ukraine’s technical capability, security pressures, and recurring nuclear rhetoric—but also the absolute absence of credible reports, the presence of IAEA inspectors, and the repeated official denials—the probability that Ukraine will launch a nuclear weapons program before 2026 is very low. Unless currently unforeseen geopolitical shocks occur, there is no evidence to suggest Ukraine will cross this threshold within the forecast window.
