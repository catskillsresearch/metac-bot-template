## 1. Historical Trends and Current Status

- The only commercial airliner to achieve sub-three-hour flights between New York and London was Concorde, which set a record of 2h 52m 59s in 1996. Concorde was retired in 2003, and since then, the fastest commercial subsonic flight took over five hours (5h 13m in 2018)[1].
- No commercial supersonic or hypersonic service existed as of December 2018; all regular services were subsonic and took over six hours for the journey.

## 2. Key Differences Affecting the Forecast

- **Technological readiness**: No operational or certified supersonic/hypersonic airliners as of late 2018. All efforts were in the research or prototype stage.
- **Regulatory environment**: Concorde’s retirement was driven by noise, emissions, and economics. New projects face even stricter environmental and noise regulations.
- **Economic factors**: High development and operational costs, with uncertain passenger demand and high ticket prices, make commercial viability challenging.
- **Infrastructure**: Lack of airport facilities and airspace procedures for routine hypersonic operations in both New York and London.
- **Timeline of new projects**: Hypersonic concepts (e.g., Venus Aerospace’s Stargazer) project initial test flights in the mid-2020s, with the earliest commercial operations anticipated in the 2030s[1][2][3].

## 3. Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

- Given the absence of operational supersonic/hypersonic commercial aircraft in 2018, the significant technological, regulatory, and economic hurdles, and the projected timelines for new technologies, it is highly unlikely that a commercial service capable of sub-three-hour transatlantic travel will be available before 2030.
- As of December 2018, a reasonable probabilistic forecast would be **less than 10%** for commercial sub-three-hour London–New York flights before 2030.

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- Aerospace project timelines are prone to delays due to technical, regulatory, and funding challenges.
- Certification for commercial service, especially at hypersonic speeds, requires extensive testing and regulatory approval, which can add years to planned schedules.
- Market demand for such rapid transatlantic travel is uncertain, impacting investment and prioritization.
