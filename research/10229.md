# Forecast Analysis: Russia's Fertility Rate in 2027

Russia's fertility rate has shown significant fluctuations over recent decades and appears to be on a downward trajectory as of 2025. This analysis examines current trends and provides a forecast for Russia's total fertility rate (TFR) in 2027.

## Current Status and Historical Trends

Russia's total fertility rate (TFR) decreased to 1.41 births per woman in 2023, with strong indicators that 2024 experienced an even further decline[1]. This continues a downward trend that began after 2015. After reaching its minimum of 1.16 in 1999, Russia's TFR showed steady growth until 2015, followed by a slight decrease in 2016 and more significant declines in 2017-2019[5].

As of April 2025, Russia's birth rate has plunged to a 200-year low, according to The Moscow Times[3]. The annual number of births is projected to drop to approximately 1.14 million by 2027[3]. This dramatic decline represents a significant demographic challenge for the Russian Federation.

## Forecast Models and Projections

Different forecasting models present varying projections for Russia's fertility rate:

1. **Medium-term projection**: According to Statista's medium scenario forecast from February 2024, Russia's TFR was expected to gradually increase between 2020 and 2035, eventually reaching 1.58 children per woman[2]. However, this projection may not have fully accounted for the accelerated decline observed in 2023-2025.

2. **Rosstat (Russian Federal State Statistics Service) forecast**: Longer-term projections from Rosstat indicate a mean fertility rate of 1.691 by 2034, increasing to 1.700 by 2035[4]. These figures appear increasingly optimistic given recent trends.

3. **Academic research**: Calculations by Arkhangelskiy, Sivoplyasova, and Moiseeva suggest continued decline through 2028, with the lowest point expected around 2030, followed by a slow recovery beginning in the early 2030s[5].

## Factors Affecting the Forecast

Several factors are likely to influence Russia's fertility rate through 2027:

- **Demographic momentum**: The continuing effects of Russia's post-Soviet demographic crisis mean there are fewer women of childbearing age in the population.

- **Economic conditions**: Economic uncertainty typically correlates with delayed family formation and lower fertility rates.

- **Policy interventions**: While the Russian government has implemented various pro-natalist policies, their effectiveness appears limited based on recent data.

- **Ongoing geopolitical tensions**: The continued impact of international sanctions and isolation may further depress economic conditions and fertility rates.

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on the available data and current trends, I forecast that Russia's total fertility rate in 2027 will most likely fall between 1.25 and 1.40 births per woman, with a central estimate of 1.32.

The probability distribution:
- 10% chance of TFR below 1.25
- 60% chance of TFR between 1.25 and 1.40
- 25% chance of TFR between 1.40 and 1.50
- 5% chance of TFR above 1.50

This assessment reflects the strong downward momentum observed through 2025, tempered by the possibility of policy interventions or economic improvements that could slow the decline. The recent data from 2023-2025 suggests that earlier, more optimistic forecasts from Russian government sources may not materialize.

The forecast indicates that Russia will likely continue to face significant demographic challenges, with fertility rates remaining well below the replacement level of approximately 2.1 births per woman needed for population stability.
