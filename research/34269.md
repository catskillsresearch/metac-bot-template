### Key Factual Information for Forecasting Trump's Net Worth (Forbes, March 31, 2025)

**1. Historical Trends and Current Status**
- As of January 21, 2025, Forbes estimated Donald Trump's net worth at $6.7 billion, ranking him 319th on the Forbes 400 list for 2024[2].
- The majority of his wealth is tied to his 57% stake in Trump Media & Technology Group, the parent company of Truth Social, which went public in March 2024[1][2].
- Trump's portfolio also includes significant real estate holdings, golf resorts, and commercial properties[1][2].
- The $TRUMP memecoin, associated with his brand, accounted for a large portion of his net worth, but its value had stabilized by late January 2025[2].

**2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric**
- Trump Media & Technology Group's public listing in March 2024 significantly increased his net worth, but there have been no major new developments or asset sales reported since January 2025[1][2][3].
- Legal issues and market volatility have caused some fluctuations, but no evidence suggests a drastic change in Forbes' valuation methodology or Trump's asset base between January and March 2025[3].

**3. Authoritative Sources for Verification**
- Forbes is the primary source for Trump's net worth estimates and is referenced in all major financial reporting on this topic[2].
- Bloomberg and The Street provide corroborating figures but are not the resolution source for this question[1][3].

**4. Limitations and Uncertainties**
- Forbes' net worth estimates are based on publicly available information, market valuations, and best estimates of private asset values, which can be imprecise.
- The value of Trump's holdings, especially in volatile assets like the $TRUMP memecoin and publicly traded shares, can fluctuate rapidly.
- Legal or regulatory actions, market crashes, or other unforeseen events could impact his net worth, but no such events are documented as of January 30, 2025.

### Most Likely Forecast (Forbes, March 31, 2025)
Given the above, the most probable range for Donald Trump's net worth according to Forbes on March 31, 2025, is:

**'0-$6 billion, inclusive'** — Unlikely, as Forbes already lists him at $6.7 billion as of January 21, 2025.
**'>$6 billion and <$8 billion'** — Most likely, as Forbes' latest estimate is $6.7 billion, and there is no evidence of a major increase or decrease in his asset values since then[2].
**'≥$8 billion and ≤$10 billion'** — Unlikely, as no recent estimates approach this level.
**'>$10 billion and <$20 billion'** — Highly unlikely, no credible source supports this range.
**'≥$20 billion'** — Not supported by any available data.

**Conclusion:**  
The best-supported forecast is that Forbes will report Donald Trump's net worth as being **greater than $6 billion and less than $8 billion** on March 31, 2025[2].
