## Factual Information Relevant to Forecasting ICC Charges Against Netanyahu Before 2025

**1. ICC Jurisdiction and Investigations**
- The ICC has asserted jurisdiction over alleged crimes committed in Gaza and the West Bank, including by Israeli officials, based on Palestineâ€™s accession to the Rome Statute[1][4].
- The ICC prosecutor, Karim Khan, confirmed ongoing investigations into events from October 7, 2023, onward, including actions by both Hamas and Israeli officials[1][4].

**2. Application for Arrest Warrants**
- On May 20, 2024, ICC Prosecutor Karim Khan announced he was filing applications for arrest warrants against several individuals, including Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity in Gaza[1][4].
- The charges against Netanyahu included persecution, other inhumane acts, starvation as a method of warfare, and intentionally directing attacks against civilians[1][2][4].

**3. Issuance of Arrest Warrant**
- On November 21, 2024, the ICC issued an arrest warrant for Benjamin Netanyahu. The warrant alleges responsibility for war crimes and crimes against humanity from at least October 8, 2023, through at least May 20, 2024[2][3].
- The issuance of an arrest warrant by the ICC is equivalent to bringing formal charges under the Rome Statute and meets the resolution criteria for this question[2][3].

**4. Authoritative Confirmation**
- Multiple sources, including the official ICC website and reputable international policy organizations, confirm the issuance of the arrest warrant and the nature of the charges[2][3].

**5. Limitations and Uncertainties**
- While the ICC has issued the warrant, actual prosecution depends on the apprehension of the accused, which is unlikely without cooperation from Israeli authorities, as Israel is not a party to the Rome Statute[3].
- The charges are subject to legal proceedings and potential challenges, but the formal act of issuing the warrant constitutes "bringing charges" for the purposes of this forecast.

## Conclusion

As of November 21, 2024, the International Criminal Court brought charges against Benjamin Netanyahu by issuing an arrest warrant for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in Gaza after October 7, 2023. This action fulfills the criteria for a "Yes" resolution to the question of whether the ICC would bring charges against Netanyahu before 2025.
