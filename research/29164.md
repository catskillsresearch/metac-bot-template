# Will the UK Abolish the Two-Child Benefit Cap before January 1, 2025?

The two-child benefit cap, introduced in 2017 through the Welfare Reform and Work Act 2016, restricts means-tested benefits to the first two children in a family for children born after April 6, 2017 (with some narrow exceptions)[4]. This analysis examines the current landscape and factors that may influence whether this policy will be abolished before January 1, 2025.

## Current Status and Impact

The two-child limit has significant financial implications for affected families, with the loss of income amounting to up to £3,235 per child in 2023/4[4]. Approximately 1.5 million UK children live in the 10% of families whose income is affected by this policy[4]. The policy has been criticized for its role in increasing child poverty, with advocates for abolition arguing it would lift 300,000 children out of poverty and reduce the depth of poverty for 700,000 more children[1].

## Political Landscape

### Labour Government Position

Despite Labour previously campaigning on abolishing the two-child limit in the 2017 and 2019 elections, the current Labour government under Prime Minister Keir Starmer has maintained support for the policy[4]. In a significant demonstration of this position, Starmer suspended seven MPs who defied the party line by voting for the limit to be abolished[2]. This suggests strong commitment to the current policy position despite internal party dissent.

The Labour leadership's stance appears to be primarily driven by fiscal considerations. The estimated cost of abolishing the two-child limit varies between sources, with figures of £1.7 billion[1] and £2.5 billion[3] cited for the 2024/25 fiscal year.

### Public Opinion

Public opinion appears to favor maintaining the policy. According to survey data, 60% of British adults believe the two-child limit should be kept, while only 28% think it should be abolished[2]. Support for keeping the policy is somewhat lower among specific demographics:
- 50% of Labour voters support maintaining it
- 43% of Londoners support maintaining it
- Only 32% of 18-24-year-olds support maintaining it[2]

This public sentiment likely reinforces the government's reluctance to abolish the policy, particularly given fiscal constraints.

## Expert and Advocacy Positions

Various organizations have called for the abolition of the two-child limit:

- The Child Poverty Action Group describes scrapping the two-child limit as "the most urgent action the new government must take to reduce child poverty" and "the most cost-effective" approach to addressing this issue[1].

- In 2019, the cross-party Works and Pensions Committee took the "highly unusual step" of recommending that the policy should be abandoned[4].

- The Resolution Foundation has projected that by the end of the decade, the benefit cap and two-child limit will drive the majority of large families into poverty[5].

## Forecast Considerations

Several factors suggest the two-child benefit cap is unlikely to be abolished before January 1, 2025:

1. **Political commitment**: The Labour government has clearly signaled its intention to maintain the policy, even taking disciplinary action against MPs who voted against it[2].

2. **Fiscal constraints**: The government has cited financial limitations as a key reason for not abolishing the policy[2][3].

3. **Public opinion**: Majority public support for maintaining the policy (60%) provides political cover for the government's position[2].

4. **Recent statements**: As of October 16, 2024, there were no indications of a policy reversal from the Labour government[2].

While advocacy groups continue to push for abolition, and some segments of the Labour Party support this position, the official government stance remains firmly in favor of maintaining the two-child limit. Without a significant shift in political priorities or fiscal circumstances, the policy appears likely to remain in place through the end of 2024.
