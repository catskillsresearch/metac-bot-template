### Key Factual Information for Forecasting

**1. Historical Trends and Current Status**
- As of late August and September 2024, West Virginia was experiencing its worst drought in at least two decades, with the entire state under some level of drought (moderate to extreme)[1][5].
- In November 2023, 78% of the state was in drought, and in February 2024, it was 69.1%. By September 2024, drought conditions had expanded again, affecting nearly the entire state[4].
- West Virginia's population is approximately 1.77 million, so if the entire state is in drought, over 1.4 million residents would be affected.

**2. Recent Announcements and Policies**
- No significant new policies or interventions have been announced that would rapidly mitigate drought conditions before December 31, 2024[5].
- Federal, state, and local agencies have provided resources and support to help communities cope, but these do not directly affect the meteorological drought status[5].

**3. Authoritative Sources for Verification**
- The U.S. Drought Monitor, specifically the Drought.gov West Virginia state page, is the official source for determining the number of residents in drought for this forecast[3].
- NOAA and the National Centers for Environmental Information provide monthly and seasonal drought reports[4].

**4. Limitations and Uncertainties**
- Drought Monitor data is updated weekly and reflects broad-scale conditions; local variations may not be captured[3].
- Weather patterns can shift rapidly, especially with winter approaching. While a weak La Niña is forecast, which increases the odds of continued dryness, there is always uncertainty in seasonal precipitation forecasts[2].
- The metric is population in drought-affected areas, not just land area, so changes in drought boundaries could affect the count even if conditions improve or worsen in less-populated regions.

### Summary Table

| Factor                         | Status as of Nov 2024           | Implication for Dec 31, 2024 Forecast |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Statewide drought coverage     | Nearly 100%                      | Likely ≥1.4 million in drought        |
| Population in drought (est.)   | Likely >1.4 million              | High probability                      |
| Seasonal outlook (La Niña)     | Below-normal precipitation likely| Supports continued drought            |
| Major interventions            | None announced                   | No rapid improvement expected         |
| Measurement uncertainty        | Moderate (broad-scale data)      | Some risk if conditions change        |

### Conclusion

As of early November 2024, nearly all of West Virginia is experiencing drought, and with a population of about 1.77 million, it is highly likely that 1.4 million or more residents will be living in drought-affected areas on December 31, 2024, unless there is an unexpected and significant improvement in precipitation.
