## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Lithium carbonate prices in China have experienced a significant decline throughout 2024, falling to below CNY 68,000 per tonne—marking their lowest point in over four years[2].
- The price drop is attributed to a persistent supply glut, with battery inventories remaining high and EV manufacturers showing little urgency to secure new lithium deals[2].
- Despite a 38% annual rise in new energy vehicle sales in China as of March 2024, these figures missed expectations, and the anticipated demand boost from government subsidies has not materialized as strongly as hoped[2].
- Historically, lithium carbonate prices were much higher, peaking at CNY 5,750,000 in December 2022, but have since declined sharply[2].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- The Chinese government has enacted subsidies to encourage trading older cars for EVs and has provided support for battery producers, aiming to stimulate demand for lithium inputs[2].
- Despite these measures, the market remains oversupplied, and battery manufacturers have not significantly increased purchasing activity[2].
- Some lithium mines in Australia and China have closed or reduced output due to low prices, but overall supply has not contracted enough to balance the market[2].

## Authoritative Forecasts

- Trading Economics' global macro models and analysts expect lithium carbonate prices to be around CNY 67,264 by the end of the current quarter, below the 70,000 threshold[2].
- S&P Global Commodity Insights forecasts lithium carbonate prices to stay between $9,924 and $11,627 per metric ton (approximately CNY 70,000–82,000 at current exchange rates) until 2026, but recent spot prices have already fallen below this range[1].
- Fastmarkets and other analysts expect only a mild recovery in Q4 2024, with no strong evidence that prices will consistently remain above 70,000 CNY/T[3].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- Market volatility: Lithium prices are subject to sudden changes due to shifts in policy, supply disruptions, or unexpected demand surges.
- Data granularity: Most forecasts and reported prices are based on spot or contract prices, which may not capture every day's closing price as required by the resolution criteria.
- Policy impact lag: Government interventions may take time to affect actual market prices, and their effectiveness remains uncertain given current oversupply conditions.

## Conclusion

Based on the latest available data and authoritative forecasts, lithium carbonate prices have already fallen below 70,000 CNY/T in late 2024 and are expected to remain at or below this level through December 20, 2024. Therefore, the likelihood that prices will continuously remain above 70,000 CNY/T during the specified period is low[2][1][3].
