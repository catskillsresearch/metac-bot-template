## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status (as of 2020-03-05)

- No oracle superintelligence or artificial general intelligence (AGI) currently exists. All widely deployed AI systems remain narrow in scope, with superhuman capability only in limited domains (e.g., Go, image classification).
- Oracle AI—defined as a system limited to answering questions with superhuman competence—has been discussed as a safer and potentially earlier milestone than full agentic AGI, especially in AI safety circles[4].
- The CAIS (Comprehensive AI Services) model, influential in 2019-2020, suggests that AI progress could manifest as an ecosystem of superintelligent services (including oracular systems) rather than a unified, agentic intelligence[4].
- Community forecasting, as captured on Metaculus, registers a majority belief (77% as of March 2020) that an oracle superintelligence would be developed before a general superintelligence[1].
- Expert commentary (e.g., Bostrom, FHI) recognizes the appeal of the oracle approach for AI safety but also notes potential practical ambiguities in distinguishing a powerful oracle from an agentic system[3][4].

## 2. Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Metric

- As of early 2020, there are no known announcements of substantial progress toward either a superintelligent oracle or a general superintelligence.
- AI safety research continues to emphasize the development of oracular and service-based approaches as potentially safer, but commercial and military incentives tend to favor agentic, general-purpose systems for broader utility[4].
- There is ongoing debate over the feasibility of keeping advanced AI strictly non-agentic, especially as capabilities grow.

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Metaculus provides a well-documented, community-based forecasting record on this question, with clear resolution criteria and historical predictions[1].
- The Future of Humanity Institute (FHI) and Nick Bostrom’s work remain leading technical and philosophical authorities on AI development trajectories and the distinction between oracle and agentic AI[3][4].
- No official governmental or academic body recognizes the existence of either technology as of March 2020.

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- The distinction between an oracle and a general superintelligence is partially theoretical: a sufficiently advanced oracle could, in principle, be repurposed as an agentic AI with modest modifications, potentially collapsing the timeline difference[1].
- Measurement is binary but subject to ambiguity if the first superintelligent system can be trivially converted between oracle and agentic modes.
- Commercial incentives may undermine safety-motivated efforts to build and deploy an oracle before a general agentic intelligence.
- All predictions are contingent on future technical, organizational, and geopolitical developments that are highly uncertain.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment (as of 2020-03-05)

- Based on expert and community consensus, the probability that an oracle superintelligence is developed before a general superintelligence is estimated at approximately 77% (60–89% credible interval), with significant residual uncertainty due to practical and definitional ambiguities[1].
