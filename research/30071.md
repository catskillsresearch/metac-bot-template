## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- In October 2024, Kalshi experienced explosive growth, becoming the top app in the Apple App Store's finance category and reaching seventh overall, largely due to a surge in election-related betting activity[1][4][5].
- Kalshi's trading volumes for election contracts neared $200 million, and the app saw approximately 865,000 downloads on the App Store in October alone, with a single-day peak of nearly 250,000 downloads around election day[1][5].
- Historically, Kalshi was not a major player in the app rankings, with only 195,000 downloads before this surge[5].
- The Wells Fargo Mobile App was ranked #13 in the finance category as of October 2024, serving as a benchmark for Kalshi's relative performance.

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- Kalshi enabled betting on the U.S. election, which was a major driver of its recent popularity spike[1][4].
- The company announced it would pay interest on user deposits, potentially increasing user retention and acquisition, though the direct impact on app ranking is not yet clear[1].
- Kalshi secured tens of millions in short-term loans from venture capitalists to ensure liquidity and is in talks for a $50 million equity round, signaling strong investor confidence and resources for further growth[4].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The Apple App Store Finance Apps chart is the definitive source for app rankings and will be used for resolution, as specified in the question.
- App analytics platforms such as Appfigures provide third-party estimates of downloads and ranking trends[5].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- Kalshi's surge in downloads and rankings was closely tied to the U.S. election. Experts note that such spikes are often temporary, and rankings may decline as the event passes[5].
- While Kalshi offers other betting markets, it is uncertain whether these will sustain the same level of user interest and downloads through December.
- App Store rankings are influenced by multiple factors, including marketing, news cycles, and user behavior, which can be volatile and difficult to predict.
- The Wells Fargo Mobile App has a stable, established user base, making it less susceptible to dramatic ranking swings compared to event-driven apps like Kalshi.

## Summary

As of November 2024, Kalshi has demonstrated the capacity to outrank major finance apps, including Wells Fargo, during periods of intense user interest (notably the U.S. election). However, the sustainability of this ranking through December 31, 2024, is uncertain due to the event-driven nature of its recent surge and the likelihood of a post-election decline in downloads and engagement. While recent product enhancements and strong investor backing could help maintain momentum, there is significant uncertainty about whether Kalshi will retain a higher ranking than Wells Fargo at year-end.
