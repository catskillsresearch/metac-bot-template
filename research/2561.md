## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of 2019, only about 560 people had traveled to space, almost all professional astronauts.
- The number of private citizens flying to space began to increase with the advent of commercial space tourism (notably from 2021 onward).
- The median cost for a private spaceflight was $24.2 million in 2025, projected to drop to $9.67 million by 2030 and $1.79 million by 2035[2].
- Orbital space tourism revenue increased from $385 million in 2021 to a projected $555 million in 2030, indicating more commercial flights and broader participation[5].

## 2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- Companies like SpaceX, Blue Origin, and Virgin Galactic started offering commercial spaceflights, with both suborbital and orbital missions available to private citizens.
- Costs are dropping, and the market is growing, but participation is still limited by financial and technical barriers[2][5].
- Metaculus itself is expanding its user base and community engagement, but remains a niche community[4].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Metaculus cost and participation forecasts[2]
- Space tourism market revenue statistics[5]
- Metaculus platform updates and user base information[4]

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- The intersection of Metaculus users and space travelers is likely very small.
- Not all space tourists will be Metaculus users or choose to post from space.
- Technical feasibility (internet access in space) is generally possible but not guaranteed for every tourist.
- Forecasts about space tourism are subject to market, regulatory, and technological changes.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given:
- The cost of space travel is declining and market participation is rising[2][5].
- The total number of private individuals visiting space is expected to increase, but remains low relative to global population.
- The Metaculus user base is growing but is a niche community[4].

An adjusted probabilistic estimate (as of 2019, using available trends) for at least one Metaculus user reporting from space before 2050 would likely be in the **10â€“25% range**. This reflects a meaningful but still low probability, given the rarity of both spaceflight and the specific requirement for a user to post a comment from space.
