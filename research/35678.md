## Key Historical Trends and Current Status
Historically, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) observes an increase in passenger volumes during weekends in March due to spring break and other travel events[Islands Magazine]. However, specific data for St. Patrick's Day Weekend in 2025 is not yet available.

## Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric
Recent discussions highlight concerns about air travel capacity due to shortages in pilots and air traffic control staff, which could impact passenger volumes[5]. However, these factors are more relevant to long-term growth rather than specific weekend forecasts.

## Authoritative Sources for Verification
The TSA provides daily passenger screening data, which will be the authoritative source for verifying the actual passenger volume for St. Patrick's Day Weekend once the data is released[Resolution Criteria].

## Limitations or Uncertainties in Measurement
A limitation in forecasting is the lack of specific data for 2025 as of the cutoff date. Additionally, factors like weather conditions, travel restrictions, or unexpected events could influence passenger volumes.

As of the cutoff date, there is no specific data available for the exact forecast of passenger volume for St. Patrick's Day Weekend in 2025. The TSA's daily passenger screening data will provide the definitive numbers once they are published.
