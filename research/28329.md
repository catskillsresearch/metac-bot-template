## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The Israel-Palestine conflict has seen repeated cycles of violence and failed peace processes. Previous pivotal attempts at a two-state solution (e.g., Oslo Accords, Camp David 2000, Annapolis 2007) ended without resolution, largely due to political fragmentation, mutual distrust, and external spoilers.
- As of late September 2024, the Gaza war remains active. Israeli military operations continue in Gaza, resulting in high civilian casualties, mass displacement, destruction of infrastructure, and a severe humanitarian crisis[1][3][5].
- Hostilities have also escalated regionally, particularly along the Lebanon border, with ongoing violence involving Hezbollah and Israeli forces[2].
- No substantive peace negotiations or international diplomatic breakthroughs have been reported since the October 2023 escalation.

## 2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- There have been no major diplomatic announcements or policy shifts indicating imminent progress toward a two-state solution or the specific criteria outlined (Israeli withdrawal, UN membership for Palestine, mutual recognition)[1][5].
- Humanitarian pauses have occurred, but only for aid delivery, not as steps toward a lasting ceasefire or political resolution[1][3].
- The Israeli government and main opposition parties continue to reject key elements of the two-state framework, and internal Palestinian divisions remain unresolved.

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) and UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) provide ongoing, detailed situation reports[1][5].
- The World Health Organization and international media track the humanitarian situation and casualties[2].
- Timelines and casualty figures are corroborated by reputable news agencies and the Gaza Health Ministry[3][4].

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- Measurement of progress is subject to the strict resolution criteria: the Gaza war must end (minimum 60 days cessation of hostilities), and at least one of four major diplomatic milestones must be met.
- Uncertainties include the potential for leadership changes, regional realignments, or international interventions that could alter incentives or trajectories.
- Reporting from the conflict is sometimes inconsistent due to access and verification challenges.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the current trajectory—ongoing hostilities, lack of diplomatic progress, deep political divisions, and no clear pathway to meeting any of the specified resolution criteria—the probability that the Gaza war will end and that significant progress will be made toward a two-state solution (as defined) before January 1, 2030, is **low**. Based on historical precedent and the present context, an estimated probabilistic range would be **10–20%**.
