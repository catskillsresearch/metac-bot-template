# Forecasting FBI Firearms Background Checks for November 2024

To assess whether FBI firearms background checks will exceed 2.6 million in November 2024, I'll analyze historical trends, recent developments, and factors that may influence firearm purchase patterns.

## Historical Trends and Current Status

The National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) has seen significant growth since its inception. When first launched in November 1998, NICS processed approximately 892,840 firearm background checks in its first complete month of operation[1]. By 2022, this volume had increased dramatically to approximately 2.6 million checks per month, totaling 31.6 million checks for the year[1].

Recent years have shown notable patterns:

- 2023 was recorded as the fourth highest year for firearm sales since the FBI's NICS implementation, behind only 2020, 2021, and 2022[4]
- Approximately 16.7 million firearms were sold in 2023[3]
- As of mid-2024, Americans have been purchasing nearly 1.4 million firearms per month[3]
- The firearms industry has maintained a streak of more than 1 million firearm sales per month for 53 consecutive months (as reported in early 2024)[4]

### Quarterly and Seasonal Patterns

Seasonal patterns indicate that the final months of the year typically see higher firearms sales:

- Q4 2023 (October, November, December) recorded more than 4.7 million firearm sales, representing a 4.6% increase over Q4 2022[4]
- December 2023 showed a 1.6% increase compared to December 2022[4]
- October, November, and December are historically the busiest months for gun sales[5]
- The last three months of 2023 reversed a years-long downward trend in gun-related background checks[4]

## Recent Developments Affecting Background Checks

Several factors may influence the volume of background checks in November 2024:

### System Capacity and Improvements

The FBI has recognized the need to enhance NICS capacity:

- The FY 2024 budget request included an additional 27 positions (including 1 Special Agent and 26 Professional Staff) and $8.4 million to support NICS operations[1]
- These resources aim to ensure timely processing of background check inquiries, particularly for cases requiring manual review[1]

### System Limitations

The NICS system faces ongoing challenges:

- The FBI's NICS database has well-known limitations and sometimes fails to correctly identify all people prohibited from owning firearms[2]
- Despite containing nearly 30 million active records on prohibited possessors as of 2023, states and court staff struggle to keep NICS records up to date[2]
- During high-volume periods, the FBI has struggled to complete all background checks, with over 316,000 unfinished checks in the first nine months of 2020 alone[5]

## Analysis for November 2024 Forecast

Based on the available data, several factors suggest November 2024 could exceed the 2.6 million threshold:

1. **Seasonal patterns**: November falls within the historically busiest quarter for firearm sales[5]
2. **Recent upward trend**: The last months of 2023 showed a reversal of the downward trend in background checks[4]
3. **Year-over-year growth**: If the pattern of year-over-year increases continues (as seen in Q4 2023 compared to Q4 2022), November 2024 could exceed previous November figures[4]

However, some factors create uncertainty:

1. **System capacity**: Despite budget increases, the NICS system has historically struggled with high volumes[5]
2. **Monthly fluctuations**: While the average in 2024 has been 1.4 million per month[3], this is significantly below the 2.6 million threshold, suggesting November would need to substantially exceed the yearly average

## Verification Sources and Limitations

The most authoritative source for verification will be the FBI's official NICS data, which is typically published in the month following the reporting period. The resolution criteria specifically mentions accessing this data through the FBI's repository.

Limitations in measurement include:

- The NSSF-adjusted NICS figures (which filter out checks processed for non-purchase purposes like permit renewals) provide a more accurate picture of actual firearm sales than raw NICS numbers[4]
- Delays in reporting could affect timely resolution, as noted in the fine print
- The NICS system itself has gaps in its underlying database that may affect the accuracy of background check processing[2]
