### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Since the US Supreme Court's 2018 decision to legalize sports betting, gambling-related suspensions have increased sharply across the NFL, NBA, MLB, and NHL[4].
- In the NFL, at least eleven players have been suspended for violating gambling policies since 2022, reflecting heightened enforcement[2].
- In MLB, gambling-related discipline has extended beyond players, with an umpire being fired for gambling violations in 2024[5].
- Despite these trends, as of December 2024, no player who has been selected as an All-Star in any of the four leagues has been banned or suspended specifically for sports betting[4].

### Recent Announcements and Policies

- All four leagues maintain strict anti-betting policies, and public statements by commissioners indicate an ongoing zero-tolerance approach, particularly for betting on one's own sport[5].
- The MLB re-affirmed its strict enforcement by firing umpire Pat Hoberg, even though there was no evidence he bet on baseball himself, showing the leagues' willingness to impose severe penalties for even indirect violations[5].
- No policy changes have been announced that would reduce the likelihood of suspensions for sports betting; if anything, public scrutiny and internal monitoring are increasing[3][4].

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Official league announcements, press releases, and credible sports journalism (e.g., ESPN, CNN, league websites) are used to verify suspensions and their reasons[2][4][5].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- The pool of All-Star players is relatively small compared to all professional athletes, making the event relatively rare by base rate.
- Increased surveillance, education, and internal monitoring may deter All-Stars from engaging in prohibited betting, but the rise in overall suspensions shows ongoing risk.
- Media coverage and public scrutiny may mean any such incident would be widely reported, reducing the chance of undercounting, but not eliminating the possibility that a minor, short-term suspension could be missed.
- The definition of "All-Star" includes any player ever selected for such a roster, even if a reserve or injury replacement, increasing the eligible pool but still limiting it to high-profile players.

### Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the continued increase in gambling suspensions, the aggressive enforcement policies, and the absence of All-Star suspensions as of December 2024, the likelihood of at least one All-Star from the NFL, NBA, MLB, or NHL being banned or suspended for sports betting before 2026 is above historical baselines but likely remains below even odds (i.e., less than 50%). A reasonable probabilistic estimate would be in the 20â€“35% range, accounting for both heightened risk and the rarity among high-profile players.
