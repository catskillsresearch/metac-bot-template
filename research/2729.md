## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status (as of April 2019)

- The SOO Green Renewable Rail project was formally announced in March 2019 as a 349-mile, 2,100 MW, 525 kV HVDC line, using a buried cable along existing railroad rights-of-way from Iowa to Illinois[2][5].
- The project was designed to address persistent transmission bottlenecks limiting renewable energy deployment by minimizing landowner and NIMBY resistance, a major source of delay for overhead lines[2].
- Its HVDC and underground construction approach was modeled on successful fiber optic network deployment, leveraging established technology and regulatory precedents[5].
- The project's business case was strengthened by significant cost declines in wind and solar generation and increasing demand for renewable energy transmission from the Midwest to the Northeast[2].

## 2. Recent Announcements and Policies (pre-2019)

- As of 2019, the project had not yet reached the permitting or construction phase. Its timeline targeted a construction financial close in late 2021 and commercial operation by Q1 2025[5].
- Broader policy context included ongoing reforms to regional market rules (e.g., MISO) to facilitate new transmission projects and recognition of the need for greater interregional grid capacity[2].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Project overview and statements from Clean Grid Alliance and project developers[2][5].
- Technical and commercial plan documents outlining timelines and strategy[5].
- Industry and policy commentary on transmission challenges and innovation (see references below).

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- U.S. transmission projects frequently encounter multi-year delays due to permitting, stakeholder engagement, and regulatory complexity, even for projects with innovative siting approaches.
- The use of existing rail corridors and underground cables reduces—but does not eliminate—risks of legal, environmental, or technical delays.
- Financing and market demand for renewable energy transmission are generally strong, but long-term changes in technology, regulatory environment, or energy markets could impact completion.
- The project's success definition for this forecast (at least 150 miles, 1,000 MW operational before 2035) increases its likelihood of success compared to its full 349-mile, 2,100 MW scope.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment (as of April 2019)

- Compared to reference cases (e.g., other U.S. long-distance transmission projects), SOO Green benefits from reduced siting risk and established technology, which are positive factors.
- However, the early project stage and typical delays for such infrastructure suggest high uncertainty.
- Given these factors, the probability of the SOO Green Renewable Rail project's first segment meeting the success criteria before 2035 is **moderately high** relative to typical transmission projects—estimated at **65-75%**.
- Key differentiator: the project's strategy of undergrounding along rail corridors, which historically has not been widely tested at this scale but offers clear risk mitigation over overhead alternatives[2][5].
