# Ukrainian Incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast: Forecasting Potential Capture of Bolshoye Soldatskoye

The Ukrainian incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast represents a significant development in the ongoing conflict. To assess whether Ukrainian forces will capture Bolshoye Soldatskoye before October 1, 2024, we need to examine the current status, rate of advance, and strategic factors at play.

## Current Status of Ukrainian Advances

Ukrainian forces launched a cross-border operation into Russia's Kursk Oblast on August 6, 2024, making rapid initial progress. By August 7, Ukrainian forces had made confirmed advances up to 10 kilometers into Russian territory, penetrating at least two Russian defensive lines and a stronghold[1]. Geolocated footage published on August 6 and 7 showed Ukrainian armored vehicles advancing to positions along the 38K-030 route approximately 10 kilometers from the international border[1].

Russian sources reported that Ukrainian forces had captured 11 settlements by August 7, including:
- Nikolaevo-Daryino (1.5 kilometers north of the Sumy Oblast border)
- Darino (three kilometers north of the Sumy Oblast border)
- Sverdlikovo (east of the Nikolaevo-Darino-Darino area)[1]

Ukrainian forces were also reportedly operating within Lyubimovka, which is eight kilometers north of the Sumy Oblast border[1].

## Extent of Territory Controlled

By August 10, Ukrainian forces largely maintained their previously reported positions in Kursk Oblast and had advanced slightly further than their previously confirmed positions[2]. Geolocated footage and Russian reporting indicated that Ukrainian forces were operating in:

- A forest area north of Lyubimovka (south of Korenevo)
- Northwest of Sudzha near Kazachya Loknya and Yuzhny
- West of Sudzha near Zaoleshenka and Goncharovka[2]

Additional geolocated footage showed Ukrainian forces holding positions north of Sudzha near Cherkasskoye Porechnoye, as well as north of Sverdilkovo (northwest of Sudzha) and within Rubanshchina (just west of Sudzha)[2].

By August 14, reports suggested that Ukraine had doubled its controlled territory in Kursk Oblast since the beginning of the operation[3]. This indicates a continued expansion of Ukrainian presence in Russian territory.

## Russian Response and Defensive Efforts

The Kremlin's response to the Ukrainian offensive in Kursk Oblast has been contradictory. Russian officials have attempted to balance presenting the effort as a notable Ukrainian escalation while avoiding overstating its potential implications to prevent domestic discontent[1].

Some Russian milbloggers heavily criticized the Russian military command for failing to detect preparations for or prevent Ukrainian offensive operations into Kursk Oblast[1]. This suggests possible intelligence and defensive failures on the Russian side that may have contributed to Ukrainian success.

Russian forces have attempted counterattacks in some areas. For example, Russian milbloggers claimed that Russian forces, including elements of the 810th Naval Infantry Brigade and the Chechen Akhmat Spetsnaz "Aida" Detachment, seized Martynovka and Zamostye (just south of Sudzha)[2]. However, the effectiveness of these counterattacks appears limited based on the available information.

## Factors Affecting Potential Capture of Bolshoye Soldatskoye

Several factors will influence whether Ukrainian forces can capture Bolshoye Soldatskoye before October 1, 2024:

1. **Rate of Advance**: Ukrainian forces advanced approximately 10 kilometers within the first day or two of the operation[1]. If they maintain a similar pace, they could potentially reach deeper targets like Bolshoye Soldatskoye.

2. **Russian Defensive Reorganization**: The initial Russian response appeared disorganized, with milbloggers criticizing the military command[1]. However, Russia may reorganize its defenses and deploy additional forces to halt Ukrainian advances.

3. **Ukrainian Strategic Objectives**: It's unclear whether capturing Bolshoye Soldatskoye is a strategic objective for Ukrainian forces. Their goals may be focused on other areas or limited to creating a buffer zone.

4. **Logistical Sustainability**: As Ukrainian forces advance deeper into Russian territory, maintaining supply lines becomes more challenging. This could limit the extent of their advance.

## Assessment

Based on the available information, Ukrainian forces have demonstrated the capability to advance rapidly into Russian territory and hold captured positions[1][2][3]. The operation has already penetrated multiple Russian defensive lines and captured numerous settlements.

However, the specific question of whether Ukrainian forces will capture Bolshoye Soldatskoye before October 1, 2024, depends on factors not fully addressed in the available information, including:

- The exact distance between current Ukrainian positions and Bolshoye Soldatskoye
- Whether Ukrainian forces are advancing in that direction
- The strength of Russian defenses in the area
- Ukrainian strategic priorities

The rapid initial advance and continued expansion of territory under Ukrainian control suggest that further advances are possible, but whether these will include Bolshoye Soldatskoye specifically remains uncertain based on the available information.
