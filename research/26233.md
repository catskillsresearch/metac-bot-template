- There are no other major MCU releases in 2024, increasing the film's event status and likely boosting its box office potential[3].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Box Office Mojo will provide the official domestic opening weekend figure for "Deadpool & Wolverine" on its dedicated page.
- Boxoffice Pro, Deadline, and The Quorum are the primary industry sources for projections and tracking data[1][2][3].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- Projections, while robust, are not guarantees. Factors such as last-minute competition, critical reception, or unforeseen events could affect the final opening weekend tally.
- The R-rated status, while not a hindrance for previous "Deadpool" films, is still a limiting factor compared to PG-13 superhero releases.
- All data and projections are as of July 18, 2024; actual results may vary.

## Conclusion

Based on all available data as of July 18, 2024—including record-breaking pre-sales, strong industry projections, and the absence of major competition—it is highly likely that "Deadpool & Wolverine" will surpass the combined domestic opening weekends of "Deadpool" and "The Wolverine" ($185,548,391). Multiple independent projections place the film's opening above this threshold, with the lowest credible estimates only slightly below and most in the $175M–$200M+ range[1][2][3].
