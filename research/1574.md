## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- From 1961 to 2018, global real GDP grew at an average annual rate of 3.5%, resulting in a 7.1-fold increase over that period.
- The only negative global GDP growth year since 1961 was 2009, following the global financial crisis[4].
- As of the third quarter of 2018, world GDP was estimated at $80.078 trillion (in 2010 USD)[2].
- Growth rates have been relatively stable, typically between 2% and 5% annually, barring major shocks like the 2008 financial crisis and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic[4].

## 2. Recent Announcements and Shocks Affecting the Metric

- The COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 caused a significant contraction in global GDP for that year, but growth returned in subsequent years[4].
- The Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022 introduced economic uncertainty, including disruptions to energy and commodity markets[4].
- Despite these shocks, medium-term forecasts (2025-2030) project global GDP growth rates returning to around 3% annually[4].
- The U.S. Congressional Budget Office (CBO) forecast in 2019 projected U.S. real GDP growth at an average of 1.9% per year for 2018–2028, which may be lower than the global average but sets a relevant context for advanced economies[5].

## 3. Authoritative Sources and 2028 Forecasts

- The IMF’s World Economic Outlook database provides forecasts for global GDP in nominal and real terms. For 2028, the IMF projects world GDP (current prices) at $127.6 trillion[1], but this is not inflation-adjusted to 2010 USD.
- Statista projects global GDP to be about $117.6 trillion in 2028 (nominal)[2].
- Forecasts for real GDP growth (inflation-adjusted) suggest that, assuming a return to trend growth of approximately 3% annually from the 2018 baseline of $80.078 trillion (2010 USD), world GDP in 2028 would be:

\[
\text{GDP}_{2028} = 80.078 \times (1.03)^{10} \approx 107.6 \ \text{trillion (2010 USD)}
\]

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- The biggest uncertainties are the long-term effects of COVID-19, ongoing geopolitical instability, and the possibility of future economic shocks.
- Estimates of world GDP can vary depending on methodology and the base year of inflation adjustment.
- The IMF and World Bank may update their base years, which can shift figures even if real growth is unchanged.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

- Given the 2018 baseline of $80.078 trillion (2010 USD) and a projected average real growth rate of ~3% per year, the most likely range for world GDP in 2028 is **$105–110 trillion (2010 USD)**.
- There is a small chance of a lower outcome (below $100 trillion) if major shocks persist, and a smaller chance of a significantly higher outcome if global productivity growth accelerates unexpectedly.
- The central forecast is therefore **$108 trillion (2010 USD) for world GDP in 2028**, with a 90% confidence interval of $100–115 trillion (2010 USD).
