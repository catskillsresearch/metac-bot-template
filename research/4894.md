## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status (as of July 2020)

- Slaughterhouses were legal and widely used across the UK. No country had yet banned slaughterhouses entirely[1][2].
- Meat consumption was culturally entrenched and remained high, with no legislative moves toward a total ban[1][2].
- Activist arguments, such as those articulated by Dean Mullen, forecasted dramatic shifts in animal rights and societal attitudes by 2050, but these were not yet realized in policy[1].

## 2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- In May 2024, the UK passed a landmark law banning the export of live animals for slaughter, a significant animal welfare measure and the result of decades of activism and broad public support (87% in a 2020 consultation)[3][5].
- This law exemplifies the incremental progress in animal welfare but does not restrict domestic slaughterhouses; it targets only transportation for slaughter[3][5].
- Academic proposals and advocacy exist for a global ban on industrial animal agriculture by 2050, mapping out a pathway involving regulatory, financial, and transitional policies, though these ideas have not yet translated into concrete UK legislation[4].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The Long Now Foundationâ€™s Long Bets platform documents the terms and context of the public bet, as well as the rationale of both sides[1].
- Metaculus, a forecasting platform, reflects a consensus that no country has yet banned slaughterhouses and considers a UK ban by 2050 unlikely without dramatic change[2].
- Compassion in World Farming and other organizations provide updates on recent legislative victories such as the live export ban[3][5].
- Academic legal reviews outline conceptual frameworks for a global ban but note significant barriers to implementation[4].

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- A total ban on slaughterhouses represents a far more radical policy change than export or welfare reforms. No UK political party or government as of July 2020 had proposed such legislation[1][2].
- Societal attitudes can shift, especially over 30 years, but predicting the pace and direction of change is highly uncertain.
- The development of alternative proteins and technological innovation could disrupt meat production and consumption, but adoption rates and regulatory responses are unclear as of the date in question.

## 5. Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the historical trend of incremental reforms, the absence of precedent, continued popularity of meat, and the lack of legislative proposals for a slaughterhouse ban as of 2020, the probability of a full ban in the UK by 2050 remains low. However, the pace of change in societal attitudes, technological alternatives, and animal welfare regulation could increase this probability modestly if accelerated by breakthroughs or major cultural shifts.

> **Adjusted forecast (as of July 2020): The probability that slaughterhouses will be banned in the United Kingdom by 2050 is low (likely under 20%) but not negligible, given evidence of incremental reform and emerging advocacy. The forecast should be updated as new legislative trends, technological advances, or major shifts in public opinion arise.**
