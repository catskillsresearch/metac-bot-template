## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- **Historical Precedent:** Early cryonics organizations in the 1960s and early 1970s often went bankrupt, primarily because they relied on ongoing payments from patients' families. When these funds or interest waned, organizations could not maintain preservation, leading to the thawing and disposal of patients[3].
- **Shift in Funding Model:** Alcor, founded in 1972, learned from these failures and currently maintains patient care funds in trust structures designed to support indefinite storage. As of December 31, 2021, Alcor reported significant assets, including $1.89 million in net property and equipment. It is also the beneficiary of five irrevocable trusts, some held in perpetuity, which provide ongoing income[3][4].
- **Financial Stability (as of 2021):** Alcor’s 2021 financial statements and IRS Form 990 filings show ongoing operations, modest depreciation expenses, and no indicators of imminent financial distress[3][4]. There is no evidence of major recent deficits or sudden losses in these filings.

## 2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- As of 2021, there are no public announcements of major structural changes, new revenue streams, or acute threats to Alcor's solvency in their official documentation[3][4].
- The transition to trust-based funding for patient care is a critical policy shift compared to earlier failed organizations; this structure aims to protect against the classic failure mode of running out of operational funds[3].
- There is no evidence of Alcor substantially increasing risk through expansion, acquisition, or speculative investments as of the most recent filings[3][4].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Alcor’s audited financial statements and Form 990 submissions for 2021 are publicly available and provide primary evidence of their current financial position and structural protections[1][3][4].
- Historical analyses confirm that trust-based perpetual care funds are a significant improvement over earlier models, though not a guarantee against all risks[3].

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- **Extremely Long Time Horizons:** The core challenge is the indefinite timeline before revival technology exists, if ever. Even with prudent financial management, unpredictable external factors (economic crises, legal changes, catastrophic events) could threaten continuity over centuries.
- **Trust Structure Risks:** While trust funds are designed for long-term care, they are not immune to mismanagement, investment losses, or regulatory changes that could erode their value.
- **No Track Record for Ultimate Success:** No cryonics patient has ever been revived, so the required duration of institutional continuity is without precedent.

## Probabilistic Assessment (as of 2021)

- **Reference Case Probability:** Historically, nearly all early cryonics organizations failed within decades[3].
- **Alcor’s Adjusted Probability:** Given Alcor’s structural improvements, financial reserves, and trust-based care, the near-term (next decade or two) bankruptcy risk appears substantially lower than historical organizations. However, over multi-century timelines, risk remains high due to compounding uncertainties.
- **Summary Judgment:** As of 2021, it is more likely than not that Alcor will avoid bankruptcy in the short to medium term (10–30 years), but the probability of surviving until the first patient revival (which may require centuries) is difficult to estimate and likely less than 50%, given the unprecedented duration and myriad existential risks.
