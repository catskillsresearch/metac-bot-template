## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- During his first administration, President Trump revoked the White House credentials of dozens of journalists, establishing a precedent for restricting press access as a tool in contentious media relations.
- In the closing stages of the 2024 election campaign, numerous journalists were denied access to Trump’s election event, showing a willingness to limit media credentials in politically sensitive contexts.
- As of January 2025, the Trump administration has publicly committed to restoring, not revoking, press credentials, specifically reversing the Biden-era decision that had reduced the credentialed press pool by over 440 reporters[3][5]. The stated policy is to broaden, not restrict, access and to welcome new applicants under clear criteria[1][3][5].
- No credible sources report the Trump White House has revoked the media credentials of reporters from two or more outlets as of January 31, 2025[1][3][5].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt announced on January 28–29, 2025, that the White House would restore credentials to journalists who lost them under the previous administration, emphasizing a commitment to First Amendment values and broader press access[1][3][5].
- The White House Correspondents’ Association has expressed concern over the lack of advance notice and the principle of government discretion in press access, underscoring the scrutiny such decisions will face[5].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Official White House press briefings and statements are the primary source for credential policy announcements[1][3].
- Reports from major news organizations (AP, CNN, Fox News, etc.) and statements from the White House Correspondents’ Association provide independent verification of changes to press access[3][4][5].
- Legal analyses and court rulings clarify the White House’s authority and limitations regarding credential revocations[2].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- The Trump administration’s adversarial history with the press increases the plausibility of future credential revocations, especially if relations deteriorate.
- No current policy or credible report as of January 31, 2025, indicates a revocation that would trigger a “Yes” resolution under the question’s criteria.
- The administration’s stated openness to broader press access could shift rapidly, particularly if disputes with critical outlets intensify.
- Any revocation must be publicly announced or credibly reported and apply to at least two credentialed reporters from each of two previously credentialed outlets to count for resolution.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the current trajectory—public commitments to restore and expand press access, lack of recent revocations, and heightened scrutiny—the probability of the White House revoking the credentials of reporters from two or more outlets before January 1, 2026, appears lower than under prior Trump administration trends. However, Trump’s combative stance toward critical media and historical precedent mean that a non-trivial risk remains, particularly if relations with the media sour. As of January 31, 2025, the likelihood should be considered modest—but not negligible—pending significant changes in policy or public disputes.
