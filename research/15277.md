# Belarus-EU Relations: Assessing Candidacy Prospects Before 2030

The question of Belarus becoming an EU candidate country before 2030 requires examination of historical trends, current relations, and geopolitical factors that would influence such a development.

## Current Status of Belarus-EU Relations

Relations between Belarus and the European Union have been consistently strained since Alexander Lukashenko came to power in 1994. The EU has repeatedly condemned the Belarusian government for authoritarian and anti-democratic practices, imposing various sanctions over the years[2]. A brief improvement in relations occurred in 2008, but the situation deteriorated again following the 2010 Belarusian presidential election, which led to mass demonstrations, arrests, and new targeted sanctions[2].

The relationship reached a new low in June 2021 when Belarus officially suspended its membership in the EU's Eastern Partnership[2]. This decision represented a significant step backward in Belarus-EU cooperation and signaled Minsk's further pivot away from European integration.

Public opinion data from 2023 shows limited support for EU integration among Belarusians, with only about one-third having a positive image of the European Union[4]. This suggests a lack of strong domestic pressure for EU candidacy.

## Recent Developments

In 2023, the EU launched a Consultative Group to provide "a high-level platform for exchanges between EU representatives and Belarusian democratic" forces[1]. This indicates the EU's policy of engaging with Belarusian opposition rather than the current government.

Since late 2020, EU member states have ceased appointing new ambassadors to Belarus, reflecting a diplomatic freeze[5]. The only exception to the EU's united stance has been Hungary, which has maintained and even sought to expand relations with the Lukashenko government[5]. Hungarian Foreign Minister Péter Szijjártó's recent visit to Belarus (in 2024) to discuss expanding trade and cooperation on nuclear energy represents a rare breach in EU unity regarding Belarus policy[5].

## Comparative Analysis with Previous EU Candidates

When comparing Belarus to successful EU candidate countries, several critical differences emerge:

1. **Democratic institutions**: All successful candidate countries demonstrated commitment to democratic principles, while Belarus has moved in the opposite direction.

2. **Rule of law**: Belarus's legal system remains under political control, unlike the reforms undertaken by Eastern European countries that joined the EU.

3. **Geopolitical alignment**: Belarus has deepened its integration with Russia rather than pursuing European integration.

4. **Diplomatic relations**: The current diplomatic freeze between the EU and Belarus contrasts sharply with the intensive dialogue that characterized previous successful candidacies.

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on the available evidence, the probability of Belarus becoming an EU candidate country before 2030 is extremely low for the following reasons:

1. **Current trajectory**: Belarus has actively moved away from EU cooperation by suspending its Eastern Partnership membership and aligning more closely with Russia[2].

2. **Political barriers**: The Lukashenko regime has shown no interest in pursuing EU membership and continues practices that directly contradict EU values and requirements.

3. **EU policy stance**: The EU's approach of imposing sanctions and engaging only with democratic opposition forces indicates no path to candidacy under the current Belarusian government[1][5].

4. **Russian influence**: Russia's apparent plan to increase control over Belarus by 2030 would further prevent any westward orientation[5].

5. **Procedural timeline**: Even if a dramatic political change occurred in Belarus, the process of becoming a candidate country typically takes several years, requiring substantial reforms that would be challenging to implement before 2030.

## Potential Scenarios That Could Alter This Assessment

The only plausible scenario that could lead to EU candidacy would involve:

1. A change in government in Belarus leading to democratic reforms
2. Rapid implementation of legal and economic reforms aligned with EU standards
3. Geopolitical realignment away from Russia
4. Unanimous support from all EU member states

The likelihood of all these conditions being met before 2030 appears minimal based on current evidence.

## Conclusion

The prospect of Belarus becoming an EU candidate country before 2030 faces overwhelming obstacles. The current political regime, Belarus's suspension from the Eastern Partnership, ongoing EU sanctions, and Russia's increasing influence all suggest that EU candidacy is highly improbable within this timeframe. While unexpected political changes can occur, the multiple barriers and limited timeframe make this outcome extremely unlikely.
