## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Downtown San Francisco's February minimum temperatures are typically above 40°F, with the 1991–2020 normals showing average lows well above this mark[5].
- However, record lows for February have historically fallen below 40°F, indicating that such events, while rare, do occur[5].
- In February 2023, the temperature dropped to 39°F on the 23rd and 24th, demonstrating that sub-40°F lows are possible in recent years.
- In February 2024, the temperature did not fall below 40°F, suggesting a warmer trend for that year.

## Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- There have been no significant announcements or policy changes as of January 2025 that would directly impact the likelihood of a sub-40°F temperature in San Francisco for February 2025.
- Broader climate trends, such as ongoing global warming, may contribute to fewer cold extremes, but local variability remains significant.

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The Iowa State University Mesonet is the official resolution source for this question, specifically the data calendar for the San Francisco Downtown weather station[3].
- Additional historical data can be cross-verified with the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) and Weather Underground, though only the Iowa State Mesonet will be used for resolution[2][1].

## Limitations or Uncertainties in Measurement

- Weather is inherently variable, and while historical data provides guidance, it cannot guarantee future outcomes.
- The question will only resolve based on the Iowa State University Mesonet data; missing data (coded as "MM") will not be considered.
- The possibility of missing or delayed data could affect the timing of resolution, but not the underlying measurement.

## Summary

Based on historical data, it is uncommon but not unprecedented for San Francisco's downtown temperature to dip below 40°F in February. The most recent years show both outcomes: 2023 saw sub-40°F lows, while 2024 did not. No new factors as of January 2025 significantly alter the probability. The event remains possible but unlikely, and the final determination will rely exclusively on the Iowa State University Mesonet data for February 2025.
