## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- **State of Cryonics as of 2018**: By 2014, around 250 people in the US were cryonically preserved, with roughly 1,500 more planning to undergo the procedure[1]. As of 2022, major US organizations (Alcor, Cryonics Institute) reported about 234 and 250 patients respectively, indicating slow but steady growth in adoption[4].
- **Technical Feasibility**: No human or complex mammal has ever been revived after cryopreservation. Only simple organisms (e.g., embryos, some small animals) have survived freezing and thawing, typically after much shorter durations and with more robust cell structures[1][2][4].
- **Revival Criteria**: The bar for "successful revival" is extremely high: sustained consciousness, alertness, and responsiveness confirmed by independent medical experts for at least 24 hours.

## 2. Reference Cases and Key Differences

| Reference Case                | Status as of 2018         | Key Differences Affecting Forecast                        |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Embryo cryopreservation       | Routine, high success     | Embryos are single/few cells; much more damage-tolerant[2]|
| Small animal organ freezing   | Partial, experimental     | Only partial tissue/thin slices revived, not whole organs[3]|
| Human/complex mammal revival  | Never achieved            | Whole-body/brain damage during freezing and thawing[1][4]  |

- **Damage During Cryopreservation**: Vitrification techniques reduce, but do not eliminate, ice crystal formation and cellular damage. Current protocols cannot prevent all damage, particularly in the brain, which is critical for identity and function[1][3].
- **Technological Hurdles**: Hypothetical revival methods often invoke advanced nanomedicine or molecular repair, technologies that remain speculative and may require breakthroughs beyond current scientific understanding[3].

## 3. Recent Announcements/Policies

- **Industry Growth**: More individuals are expressing interest in cryonics, but this has not corresponded to technical breakthroughs in revival[4].
- **No Scientific Consensus or Regulatory Milestone**: No peer-reviewed studies or regulatory body has recognized a successful revival of a mammal or human after cryopreservation[4].

## 4. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Alcor and Cryonics Institute (industry data)[4]
- Peer-reviewed literature on cryopreservation (embryo and organ research)[2][3]
- Wikipedia and science journalism (historical overview)[1][4]

## 5. Limitations and Uncertainties

- **Measurement Uncertainty**: The field is dominated by speculative, unproven methods for revival. No standardized protocol for assessing viability post-preservation exists for humans.
- **Forecasting Uncertainty**: Expert probabilistic estimates vary widely, from highly optimistic (1 in 2 odds) to extremely pessimistic (1 in 10^6). A detailed probabilistic analysis put the odds of successful revival at about 1 in 567, but this figure is not based on experimental success and remains highly speculative[5].

## 6. Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the absence of any successful revival of a complex mammal or human, the major unknowns regarding preservation damage, and the speculative status of proposed revival technologies, the probability that any human cryonically preserved for at least one year as of 2018 will be revived before January 1, 2050 is extremely lowâ€”likely well below 1%. While technical interest and institutional capacity are growing, there have been no substantive breakthroughs to shift this baseline forecast.

> There is no direct evidence or credible pathway as of 2018 suggesting likely success before 2050; thus, the forecast remains highly pessimistic.
