## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Since 2012, Russia has maintained a federal blocklist of websites deemed undesirable, with major Western social media platforms like Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook blocked shortly after the 2022 invasion of Ukraine[3][5].
- YouTube has remained the last major Western social media platform accessible in Russia, with over 93 million monthly users as of 2024[3].
- The Russian government has repeatedly pressured YouTube to comply with censorship demands and has publicly criticized the platform for hosting content that contradicts official narratives[3][4][5].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- In July 2024, Roskomnadzor began deliberately degrading YouTube’s performance, making access slower or unreliable for many users[1][4][5]. This move was publicly described as a "forced step" against YouTube’s administration, not Russian users[4].
- On August 8, 2024, millions of Russian users experienced significant disruptions accessing YouTube, widely interpreted as a precursor to a full ban[5].
- Russian officials and state media have openly discussed the possibility of a complete ban in autumn 2024, with some reports claiming that preparations for blocking are underway[1][5].
- Despite these actions, as of August 27, 2024, YouTube had not yet been officially added to the Roskomnadzor blocklist, and access, while degraded, was not fully blocked[1][5].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The Roskomnadzor official blocklist site is the primary source for confirming whether youtube.com is officially blocked.
- Additional verification can be obtained from credible news outlets and technical monitoring organizations reporting on internet accessibility in Russia[1][5].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- Technical throttling and partial disruptions can make it difficult to distinguish between a full ban and severe performance degradation.
- The Russian government may implement a ban without immediate public announcement or may use ambiguous language, complicating verification.
- The final resolution depends on the explicit inclusion of youtube.com in the Roskomnadzor blocklist or clear confirmation from credible sources.

## Summary

As of August 27, 2024, YouTube remains accessible in Russia, though with significant throttling and disruptions. There is strong evidence of government intent to ban the platform, and technical measures have already been implemented to degrade access. However, the decisive step of officially blocking youtube.com had not yet occurred by this date. The situation remains fluid, and a ban before October 1, 2024, is plausible but not confirmed as of the latest available information[1][3][4][5].
