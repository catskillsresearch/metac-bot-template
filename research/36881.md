# Forecasting Medicaid Spending Cuts in the 2025 Reconciliation Bill

As of April 10, 2025, Congress has passed a budget resolution that sets the stage for a reconciliation bill with potentially significant impacts on Medicaid spending. Based on available information, I'll analyze the potential decrease in Medicaid spending from FY 2025 to FY 2034 that might result from the reconciliation process currently underway.

## Current Status of the Reconciliation Process

On April 10, 2025, Republicans in Congress passed a concurrent budget resolution, providing reconciliation instructions to congressional committees[4]. This resolution establishes different reconciliation tracks for each chamber:

- House committees are instructed to increase deficits by $2.3 trillion, with major cuts to Medicaid
- Senate committees are instructed to increase deficits by approximately $5.8 trillion, without clear implications for Medicaid cuts[4]

The House Energy & Commerce Committee, which has jurisdiction over Medicaid, is targeting a markup of their portion of the bill, with the chamber hoping to clear the legislation in May 2025[1]. The Senate Finance Committee also has jurisdiction over Medicaid spending[2].

## Projected Medicaid Cuts

The most significant indicator of potential Medicaid cuts comes from the reconciliation instructions to the House Energy & Commerce Committee, which call for $880 billion in savings over the ten-year budget window[1][2]. According to Congressional Budget Office (CBO) analysis, the Committee cannot reach this target without making cuts to Medicaid or Medicare[2].

Several key factors suggest that Medicaid will bear the brunt of these cuts:

1. **Limited Alternative Options**: When both Medicare and Medicaid are excluded, the Energy & Commerce Committee oversees only $581 billion in total spendingâ€”far less than the $880 billion target for cuts[2].

2. **Medicaid's Budget Share**: Medicaid accounts for $8.2 trillion of the $8.8 trillion total funding under the Energy and Commerce Committee's jurisdiction over 10 years, representing approximately 93% of their budget authority[2].

3. **Required Magnitude**: To reach the $880 billion savings target, the changes to Medicaid would have to be significant[2].

## Potential Approaches to Medicaid Cuts

Based on the information available as of April 10, 2025, several policy options are being considered to achieve these Medicaid savings:

1. **Reducing Federal Matching Rates for Expansion**: The Affordable Care Act's Medicaid expansion allows states to cover adults with incomes up to 138% of the Federal Poverty Level ($21,597 for an individual in 2025). Currently, the federal government covers 90% of these costs, compared to approximately 70% for traditional Medicaid. Reducing this higher federal matching rate is one approach being considered[1].

2. **Capping Payments to States**: Another approach under discussion involves capping payments to states based on the number of enrollees[1].

3. **Establishing Spending Limits for Expansion Population**: This approach would set caps on federal spending for the Medicaid expansion population, potentially resulting in 3.3 million people losing coverage[5].

## Contextualizing the $880 Billion Target

To put the $880 billion in potential federal Medicaid cuts in context:

- This represents approximately $88 billion per year over the ten-year budget window
- These cuts would represent 29% of state-financed Medicaid spending per resident[3]

## Reconciliation Timeline and Process

The House hopes to clear the reconciliation legislation in May 2025, sending it to the Senate with a goal of final passage by July 4, 2025[1]. However, significant differences between the House and Senate approaches may complicate this timeline.

The budget resolution allows for total deficit increases of nearly $6 trillion, reflecting the assumption that Congress can use a "current policy baseline," meaning they don't need to pay for extending expiring tax cuts (which cost $4.5 trillion)[4]. It requires House committees to offset the tax cuts by at least $1.7 trillion, but only $4 billion in spending cuts for Senate committees[4].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors create uncertainty in forecasting the exact amount of Medicaid cuts:

1. **House-Senate Differences**: The significant differences between House and Senate reconciliation instructions may lead to protracted negotiations.

2. **Committee Discretion**: While the $880 billion target is clear, the specific mechanisms for achieving these cuts remain under development.

3. **Political Considerations**: The impact of Medicaid cuts on millions of Americans may influence the final legislation.

Based on the available information as of April 10, 2025, the most likely forecast is that the reconciliation bill will aim to decrease total Medicaid spending by approximately $880 billion from FY 2025 to FY 2034, though the final amount could be modified during negotiations between the House and Senate.
