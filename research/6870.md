## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The global total fertility rate (TFR) has declined from about 4.8–5.0 in 1950 to 2.2–2.4 in 2021–2023[2][3][4][5].
- This decline has been steady but not abrupt; it took 70 years for the TFR to more than halve[2][5].
- As of 2021, 46% of countries had fertility above the replacement rate (2.1), with the highest rates in sub-Saharan Africa[2][5].
- The TFR is projected to continue declining, but at a slowing rate, reaching around 1.8 by 2050 under mainstream scenarios[2][5].

## Reference Cases and Projections

| Year | Global TFR | Source      |
|------|------------|-------------|
| 1950 | ~4.8–5.0   | [2][5]      |
| 2021 | ~2.2–2.4   | [2][3][5][4]|
| 2050 | ~1.8 (proj)| [2][5]      |
| 2100 | ~1.6 (proj)| [2][5]      |

No model from the UN, IHME, or World Bank projects a TFR below 1.0 by 2046.

## Key Differences and Potential Accelerators

- The Guardian article and Shanna Swan’s research highlight environmental threats (e.g., hormone-disrupting chemicals) potentially impacting human fertility[5].
- Swan’s projections regarding sperm count draw attention to possible biological constraints, but there is no evidence or model suggesting a global TFR collapse to 0.25 by 2046.
- Historical precedent shows even the most severe policy interventions (e.g., China’s one-child policy) did not lead to such low fertility rates.
- Population momentum and heterogeneity: Fertility declines first in high-income countries, while low-income countries (especially in Africa) sustain higher fertility, slowing the global aggregate decline[2][5].

## Recent Announcements/Policies

- Pro-natal policies are being implemented in some countries to counteract declining fertility but have shown limited effectiveness in reversing trends[2].
- No major global policy or event as of 2021 suggests a sharp, universal fertility collapse.

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- United Nations Population Division
- Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME)
- World Bank
- Our World in Data

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- Forecasts assume no unprecedented global catastrophe (e.g., pandemics, environmental collapse) that would impair human reproductive capacity far beyond observed trends.
- Measurement of TFR depends on registration completeness and may be less accurate in some low-income regions, but margin of error is not large enough to change the assessment[2][5].
- The possibility of disruptive new technologies (e.g., artificial reproduction) or environmental disasters is not incorporated into mainstream models, representing a source of deep uncertainty.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given all authoritative projections, the observed historical rate of fertility decline, and the absence of any credible forecast or mechanism likely to reduce TFR to 0.25 by 2046, it is virtually certain (probability >99.9%) that the global fertility rate will **not** fall to or below 0.25 births per woman before 2046.
