### Key Factual Information Relevant to Forecasting a Pardon for Peter Navarro Before April 1, 2025

- Peter Navarro, former Trump adviser, was convicted and jailed for contempt of Congress.
- As of February 20, 2025, Navarro remains incarcerated and has publicly stated he does not want a pardon, saying, "I have no regrets"[1].
- There have been no public reports or official announcements indicating that Navarro has received or is about to receive a presidential pardon as of the knowledge cutoff date.
- Presidential pardons, particularly for political allies, have precedent but are highly discretionary and unpredictable.
- The decision to pardon is solely at the discretion of the sitting president and may occur regardless of the recipient's public statements.
- Authoritative sources for verification would include major news outlets (such as the Wall Street Journal) and official government communications.
- There is inherent uncertainty in forecasting pardons due to their political and personal nature, and the lack of any public indication as of February 20, 2025, that a pardon is forthcoming.
