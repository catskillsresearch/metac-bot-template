## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of mid-2025, Próspera is operational as a ZEDE (Zone for Employment and Economic Development) on Roatán, Honduras, but has not achieved significant population growth. Early ambitions targeted 10,000 residents by 2025, but this milestone is widely doubted to be met by that date[1][4][5].
- The physical footprint remains small, with only a few developed buildings and a "slim" community. The project is still in the early stages of building out both infrastructure and an active resident base[1][5].
- Próspera’s legal and regulatory autonomy, low taxes, and pro-business environment are intended to draw residents and investment, but these advantages have not (as of 2025) translated into rapid population growth[2][5].

## 2. Recent Announcements and Policies

- Próspera continues to market itself as a business-friendly, innovation-focused city, emphasizing its unique legal system and low taxes[2][5].
- There are ongoing plans to expand its territory and connect its separate plots to facilitate future growth, but much of this land remains undeveloped as of 2025[5].
- The ZEDE model in Honduras has faced legal and political scrutiny, which may affect investor and resident confidence, though ZEDEs remain operational as of 2025[1].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Wikipedia provides a historical and legal overview, confirming operational status and the original resident targets[1].
- Metaculus and other forecasting platforms track predictions and community assessments regarding Próspera’s population targets[4].
- Substack articles and Próspera’s own website describe current development status, community size, and expansion plans[2][5].

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- Measurement depends on official population reporting by Próspera; if such data are not published or are ambiguous, resolving the forecast will be difficult[4].
- Political and legal uncertainties surrounding ZEDEs could impact future expansion and resident attraction.
- The current slow pace of infrastructure and community development suggests significant risk to rapid scaling, barring major changes in market demand, investment, or legal context[5].

## 5. Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

- Reference cases (e.g., other new cities or special economic zones) suggest that reaching 10,000 residents in a decade or two, starting from near zero and with limited infrastructure, is a challenging milestone—especially without a strong existing urban core or massive external investment.
- Key differences for Próspera include: physical isolation, limited land control, nascent infrastructure, and mixed local sentiment.
- Given the current trajectory, continued operational status, but slow pace of resident and infrastructure growth, the probability that Próspera will have at least 10,000 residents at any point before 2035 appears low.

**Estimated probability: 10–20%.**

This reflects substantial uncertainty, but assigns a low likelihood given current evidence and historical analogs.
