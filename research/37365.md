## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- For March 2025, the inventory/sales ratio for US apparel, piece goods, and notions merchant wholesalers (NAICS 4243) was 2.06, calculated from inventories of $27,813 million and sales of $13,479 million[2].
- Over the past year, this ratio has generally ranged between 2.0 and 2.2, reflecting stable inventory management practices in the sector. The broader wholesale industry ratio has been notably lower (about 1.3–1.4)[3][4].
- Apparel wholesalers typically maintain higher inventory/sales ratios than the overall wholesale trade sector due to the seasonality and fashion-driven nature of their inventory.

## 2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- As of May 26, 2025, there have been no reports of major policy changes, supply chain disruptions, or macroeconomic shocks that would significantly alter inventory or sales patterns for apparel wholesalers in April 2025.
- Broader economic indicators and retail apparel inventory/sales ratios have shown stability as of late 2024 and early 2025, suggesting no imminent volatility in the wholesale apparel channel[5].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The US Census Bureau's Monthly Wholesale Trade Report (Table 2, NAICS 4243) will provide the definitive April 2025 inventories and sales figures for this metric[1][2].
- The FRED database and YCharts provide timely tracking of the published ratios[2][4].
- Statista provides context for the retail sector but is not directly applicable to the wholesale metric[5].

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- April 2025 data is not available as of May 26, 2025, so this assessment is based on historical trend, recent stability, and absence of known shocks.
- Seasonal effects can cause minor fluctuations, but apparel wholesaler ratios have been relatively stable over the past year.
- Final values may be subject to revision, and the reported figure will be rounded according to US Census Bureau reporting practices.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the historical trend (2.0–2.2), the March 2025 value (2.06), and the lack of disruptive news, the most probable inventory/sales ratio for April 2025 is:

- Point forecast: **2.05**
- 80% confidence interval: **[2.00, 2.10]**

This reflects a high likelihood of continued stability, with modest seasonal adjustment.
