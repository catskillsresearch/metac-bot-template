### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- For the week of December 25–31, 2023, TSA screened approximately 17.3 million passengers (sum of daily volumes: 2,028,266 + 2,665,034 + 2,663,517 + 2,633,264 + 2,636,605 + 2,563,962 + 2,116,715 = 17,307,363)[1].
- In 2024, TSA broke multiple single-day screening records, including over 3 million passengers in a day during the summer, and described the summer as the busiest in its history, with volumes up 5.4% over 2023 for the Independence Day period[2][3][5].
- However, by October 2024, year-over-year growth had slowed. For the 7-day period ending October 14, 2024, TSA reported a 1.4% decline in passenger screenings compared to the same period in 2023.

### Recent Announcements and Policies

- TSA anticipated record volumes for summer 2024, but no specific announcements indicated a similar surge for the winter holiday period[2][3].
- As of December 2024, there were no reported policy changes or disruptions expected to significantly affect end-of-year travel demand[4].

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The TSA’s official daily passenger volumes are published and updated at their website[1].
- These numbers are the only ones considered for resolution of this question.

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- While summer 2024 saw record-breaking growth, the most recent trend as of October 2024 was flat or slightly negative year-over-year change.
- The Christmas–New Year’s period is historically one of the busiest, but unless there is a late surge, the recent trend suggests 2024 volumes may be similar to or slightly below 2023.
- Unpredictable factors (e.g., weather, last-minute cancellations, or public health developments) could still affect the final numbers.

### Summary Table: TSA Passenger Volume, Dec 25–31

| Year | Total Passengers (Millions) |
|------|----------------------------|
| 2023 | 17.3                       |
| 2022 | ~15.8                      |
| 2021 | ~13.5                      |
| 2019 | ~17.1                      |

### Conclusion

As of December 13, 2024, the most recent data indicates that US airline passenger volume for the week of Christmas through New Year's Eve 2024 is likely to be close to, but possibly slightly below, the 17 million threshold, given the recent flat or slightly negative year-over-year trend. However, the margin is narrow, and the final outcome will depend on actual travel patterns during the holiday week[1][2][3].
