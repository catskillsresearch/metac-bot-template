# Will Apple Run an Ad at Super Bowl LIX (2025)?

Based on the information available as of February 3, 2025, here's an analysis of whether Apple will run a television commercial during Super Bowl LIX on February 9, 2025.

## Current Status and Recent Developments

As of early February 2025, Fox has already sold out of all its Super Bowl advertising inventory, with 30-second spots commanding approximately $7 million each[4]. This indicates extremely high demand for advertising slots during the upcoming game, which will be held at Caesars Superdome in New Orleans.

While specific information about Apple running a commercial during the Super Bowl LIX broadcast is not definitively confirmed in available sources, we do know that Apple Music will be sponsoring the Super Bowl LIX halftime show for the third consecutive year[4]. The halftime show will feature Kendrick Lamar as the headline performer.

## Historical Context

There are indications that Apple had a presence in Super Bowl advertising in the previous year (2024), specifically with an Apple Vision Pro campaign[5]. This suggests Apple has recently been active in Super Bowl advertising, though past participation doesn't guarantee future involvement.

## Advertising Landscape for Super Bowl LIX

The advertising landscape for Super Bowl LIX shows several notable trends:

- Fox reported selling out of advertising inventory by early November 2024[4]
- The 2024 Super Bowl attracted over 115 million viewers, maintaining the event's status as a premier advertising platform[4]
- Some brands announced their Super Bowl plans very early, with Skechers confirming its 12th appearance just three months after the 2024 game[4]
- There appears to be a shift in how brands are approaching AI in their campaigns, moving from showcasing the technology to using it as a behind-the-scenes tool for better storytelling[5]

## Limitations and Uncertainties

The available information has several limitations:

1. While we know Apple Music is sponsoring the halftime show, this doesn't necessarily mean Apple itself will run a commercial during the broadcast
2. Complete lists of confirmed advertisers for Super Bowl LIX were not available in the search results as of the knowledge cutoff date
3. Companies sometimes make last-minute decisions about Super Bowl advertising, though Fox's reported sell-out of inventory suggests most slots were claimed well in advance

## Conclusion

Based on the available information as of February 3, 2025, we cannot definitively determine whether Apple will run a television commercial during Super Bowl LIX. While Apple Music is confirmed as the halftime show sponsor for the third consecutive year, and Apple has had Super Bowl advertising presence in the recent past, there is no explicit confirmation of an Apple commercial for the 2025 game in the available sources.
