## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of August 19, 2024, Zambia has not reported any confirmed mpox cases, including Clade I or its subclades[3].
- Clade I mpox (including subclade Ib) has rapidly spread in 2024, with confirmed cases in several countries neighboring the DRC: Burundi, Rwanda, Uganda, Central African Republic, and Congo[1][4].
- The DRC remains the epicenter, with the majority of cases and deaths, and is the source of the new Clade Ib strain[1][4].
- Neighboring countries such as Burundi, Rwanda, and Uganda reported their first mpox cases only in late July 2024, indicating recent cross-border transmission[4].
- Zambia shares borders with the DRC and other affected countries, increasing its risk of importation.

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- The WHO declared mpox a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on August 14, 2024, highlighting the rapid regional spread of Clade I mpox and the need for coordinated international response[3].
- The Zambia National Public Health Institute (ZNPHI) has activated high alert surveillance, with systems in place to rapidly detect and respond to suspected mpox cases[3].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The Zambia National Public Health Institute (ZNPHI) is the primary national authority for disease surveillance and reporting in Zambia[3].
- The World Health Organization (WHO) and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) provide regular updates on mpox epidemiology and regional spread[1][4][5].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- There is a risk of underdetection or delayed confirmation due to limitations in surveillance, laboratory capacity, or reporting lag[3].
- As of August 23, 2024, there are no credible reports of confirmed Clade I mpox in Zambia, but the situation is evolving rapidly in the region[3][4].
- The high alert status and robust surveillance in Zambia reduce the risk of undetected outbreaks, but cannot eliminate it entirely.

## Summary

As of August 23, 2024, there is no confirmed Clade I mpox infection in Zambia. However, the rapid spread of Clade I mpox in neighboring countries, Zambia’s proximity to the DRC, and active surveillance efforts mean the risk of importation and subsequent confirmation remains elevated in the coming weeks. The situation should be closely monitored through updates from ZNPHI and WHO.
