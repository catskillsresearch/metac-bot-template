# Forecasting the 2024 CMA Female Vocalist of the Year Award

The 58th Annual Country Music Association (CMA) Awards are scheduled for November 20, 2024, at the Bridgestone Arena in Nashville, Tennessee[4]. To assess whether Kelsea Ballerini or Lainey Wilson will win the Female Vocalist of the Year award, we need to examine their current nominations, recent achievements, and historical context.

## Current Nominations

Both artists are officially nominated for the 2024 CMA Female Vocalist of the Year award, alongside three other contenders:

- Kelsea Ballerini
- Lainey Wilson
- Ashley McBryde
- Megan Moroney
- Kacey Musgraves[2][4][5]

## Lainey Wilson's Position

Lainey Wilson enters the 2024 CMA Awards with significant momentum:

- She is the **reigning Entertainer of the Year** and a **two-time Female Vocalist** winner[1]
- Wilson has secured **four nominations** for the 2024 ceremony, including:
  - Entertainer of the Year (her second nomination in this category)
  - Female Vocalist of the Year (her third nomination in this category)
  - Single of the Year for "Watermelon Moonshine"
  - Music Video of the Year for "Wildflowers and Wild Horses"[1]
- Her career total now stands at 19 CMA nominations[1]
- She is co-hosting the 2024 CMA Awards alongside Luke Bryan[3]

Wilson's performance at the ceremony has been announced - she will perform her current single "4x4xU" during the show[3].

## Kelsea Ballerini's Position

The search results provide limited specific information about Kelsea Ballerini's recent achievements or additional 2024 CMA nominations beyond her Female Vocalist nomination[2][4][5].

## Comparative Analysis

When comparing the two artists' current positioning:

1. **Recent Success**: Lainey Wilson has demonstrated significant recent success with her reign as Entertainer of the Year and previous Female Vocalist wins.

2. **Nomination Count**: Wilson has four nominations at the 2024 ceremony, suggesting broader industry recognition across multiple categories.

3. **Visibility**: Wilson's role as co-host of the ceremony provides additional visibility and prominence.

## Limitations in Forecasting

Several factors limit our ability to make a definitive forecast:

1. **Voting Process**: CMA Awards are determined by voting among CMA members, which includes industry professionals whose preferences may not always align with commercial success or critical acclaim.

2. **Competition**: The category includes other strong contenders, particularly Kacey Musgraves, who has seven prior nominations in this category and 22 career nominations total[1].

3. **Incomplete Information**: The search results provide limited information about Ballerini's recent achievements or momentum heading into the awards.

4. **Historical Patterns**: While Wilson's status as a previous winner could suggest continued favor among voters, the CMA has also shown willingness to recognize different artists over time.

## Conclusion

Based on available information as of November 14, 2024, Lainey Wilson appears to have stronger momentum heading into the 2024 CMA Awards due to her status as reigning Entertainer of the Year, previous Female Vocalist wins, multiple current nominations, and co-hosting role. However, award outcomes remain inherently unpredictable, and Kelsea Ballerini remains a viable contender in the category.

The winner will be revealed during the live broadcast on ABC on November 20, 2024[4].
