### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Kamala Harris is widely recognized for her use of the phrase "I'm speaking" during debates, particularly in the 2020 vice presidential debate against Mike Pence, where she used it to assert herself when interrupted[1][4].
- The phrase has since become a hallmark of her public persona and debate style, often cited as an example of her assertiveness and composure under pressure[4][5].
- In recent campaign events, Harris has used similar language, such as "I am speaking now," to emphasize her right to speak, sometimes eliciting positive reactions from audiences[5].

### Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Metric

- For the September 10, 2024, presidential debate with Donald Trump, the debate organizers have announced that microphones will be muted for the candidate who is not scheduled to speak. This rule is intended to prevent interruptions, a key factor that previously prompted Harris to use the phrase "I'm speaking"[5].
- Both Harris and Trump have agreed to participate in the debate, and the format is expected to be enforced as planned[5].

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Video and transcript evidence from the 2020 vice presidential debate confirm Harris's use of the phrase "I'm speaking" in response to interruptions[1][2].
- News coverage and analysis highlight the phrase's significance in Harris's debate style and its resonance with supporters[4][5].
- Reports on the upcoming debate detail the new microphone muting policy and its intended effect on debate dynamics[5].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- The primary uncertainty is whether any circumstance during the debate will prompt Harris to use the exact phrase "I'm speaking" or "I am speaking," given that interruptions are less likely due to the muted microphone policy.
- While Harris has used similar language in campaign events, there is no guarantee she will use the exact phrase in the debate unless provoked by an interruption or similar situation[5].
- The resolution depends strictly on the literal use of the phrase during the live debate, not in pre- or post-debate commentary or campaign events.

### Summary

Given Harris's history and the phrase's association with her debate persona, it is plausible she might use "I'm speaking" if the situation arises. However, the planned use of muted microphones significantly reduces the likelihood of interruptions, and thus the probability that she will say the phrase during the debate is lower than in previous debates.
