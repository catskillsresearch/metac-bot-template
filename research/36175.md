# Will Denver's Highest High Exceed Honolulu's Lowest Low Before April 1, 2025?

Based on the available data as of March 19, 2025, I'll analyze the likelihood of Denver's highest high temperature exceeding Honolulu's lowest low temperature before April 1, 2025.

## Denver Temperature Trends (March 2025)

Denver's temperature data for March 2025 shows significant variability, which is typical for this transitional month:

- Early March began relatively warm with highs reaching 61°F on March 2[5]
- A cold front moved through on March 3-4, dropping temperatures significantly[2][4]
- Mid-month temperatures fluctuated, with several days reaching the 60s[5]
- The forecast for late March shows the highest temperatures of the month:
  - March 27: High of 73°F
  - March 28: High of 72°F[5]

The first week of March 2025 saw a snowstorm that moved through Colorado, bringing cooler temperatures to the Denver metro area, with highs dropping to the 40s for most of that week[4]. This was followed by a warming trend as the month progressed.

## Historical Context for Denver March Temperatures

Denver's normal March temperature patterns provide important context:

- The March mean temperature in Denver is 41.6°F (based on 1991-2020 data)[1]
- The highest temperature ever recorded in March in Denver's history was 84°F on March 26, 1971[1]
- March is typically Denver's snowiest month, averaging just under a foot of snow[4]

Temperature data for Denver is collected at Denver International Airport, which has been the official recording location since March 1995[1].

## Limitations in Assessment

There are several significant limitations in this analysis:

1. **Lack of Honolulu Data**: The available information does not include any temperature data for Honolulu, Hawaii for March 2025 or historical patterns.

2. **Incomplete Denver Data**: While we have forecasts through March 29, there are still two days remaining in March that could potentially see higher temperatures.

3. **Forecast Uncertainty**: Weather forecasts beyond a few days have inherent uncertainty, especially for specific high/low temperatures.

## Conclusion

Based solely on Denver's data, the highest projected temperature before April 1, 2025, appears to be 73°F on March 27[5]. Without Honolulu's temperature data, it's impossible to determine if this will exceed Honolulu's lowest low temperature for the same period.

For a complete assessment, temperature data from Daniel K. Inouye International Airport in Honolulu would be required, along with verified (rather than forecasted) temperature readings from both locations as they occur through the end of March 2025.
