Based on the available weather forecast data as of March 19, 2025, I can provide partial information to help assess whether Denver's highest high temperature will exceed Honolulu's lowest low temperature before April 1, 2025.

## Denver Temperature Forecast (March-April 2025)

The weather forecast for Denver in March 2025 shows varying temperatures throughout the month. According to the available data, the highest projected high temperatures in Denver before April 1, 2025 are:
- March 27, 2025: 73°F[1]
- March 28, 2025: 72°F[1]
- March 17, 2025: 68°F[1]

For the beginning of April, the forecast shows:
- April 1, 2025: 54°F high and 32°F low[2][3]

## Limitations in Assessment

There are several significant limitations in making a complete assessment:

1. **Missing Honolulu Data**: The search results do not contain any temperature forecasts for Honolulu, Hawaii for the relevant time period. Without this crucial information, it's impossible to determine if Denver's highest high will exceed Honolulu's lowest low.

2. **Forecast Reliability**: Weather forecasts become less reliable the further into the future they project. The March and early April forecasts available as of March 19, 2025, are subject to change.

3. **Historical Context**: Typically, Honolulu has a much more stable climate than Denver, with average lows rarely dropping below 65°F even in winter months. Denver, being in a continental climate zone, experiences much more temperature variability.

## Verification Sources

To properly verify this question when it resolves, one would need to check:

1. The official temperature records from Denver International Airport, which can be accessed through the National Weather Service's Automated Surface Observing System (ASOS)[4].

2. The official temperature records from Daniel K. Inouye International Airport in Honolulu, also available through the ASOS system.

Without complete data for both locations, a definitive forecast cannot be provided at this time. The resolution of this question will depend on the actual recorded temperatures at both airports during the specified period.
