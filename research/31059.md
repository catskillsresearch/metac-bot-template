### Key Factual Information for Forecasting

- The New York Times Best Sellers list is compiled using a proprietary, partially editorialized process based on sales data from a wide range of bookstores and wholesalers, with adjustments for bulk orders and a preference for independent bookstore sales[1][2].
- Over the past 20 weeks, the number of new books tagged as "New this week" on the Hardcover Fiction list has ranged from 1 to 8, with most weeks seeing between 3 and 6 new entrants.
- In the comparable period a year ago, the lists for December 31, 2023, and January 7, 2024, had 0 and 1 new entrants, respectively, suggesting a post-holiday dip in new releases.
- There have been no recent announcements or policy changes affecting the compilation of the list as of December 20, 2024.
- The holiday season often leads to fewer new releases, as publishers may delay major launches until after the new year.

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- The exact methodology is secret and subject to editorial discretion, making precise prediction difficult[1][2].
- Seasonal effects and publisher strategies can cause significant week-to-week variation.

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The New York Times Best Sellers list itself is the authoritative source for the number of "New this week" tags for any given week.
- Historical lists and public explanations of the methodology provide context for interpreting trends[1][2].

### Conclusion

Based on historical trends, the proprietary and editorialized nature of the list, and the typical post-holiday lull, the most likely number of books tagged as "New this week" for the week of January 5, 2025, is in the lower rangeâ€”most plausibly **'0-2'**.
