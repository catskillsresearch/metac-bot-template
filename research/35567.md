# Will Grand Theft Auto VI be released in Europe in 2025?

Based on information available as of February 27, 2025, here is a comprehensive analysis of the likelihood of Grand Theft Auto VI being released in Europe in 2025.

## Current Status and Release Timeline

Rockstar Games officially announced Grand Theft Auto VI in December 2023, confirming it would be coming to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S gaming systems in 2025[1]. As of early 2025, the game was still targeting a release in Fall 2025, though Rockstar had remained relatively quiet about development progress[2].

The most definitive and recent information comes from Take-Two Interactive's earnings call held on February 6, 2025, where executives reaffirmed the "Fall 2025" release window to shareholders. During this call, they stated: "This calendar year is shaping up to be one of the strongest ever for [the company], as we plan to launch *Sid Meier's Civilization 7* on 11th February, *Mafia: The Old Country* in the summer, *Grand Theft Auto 6* in the Fall, and *Borderlands 4*."[5] This suggests a release timeframe between September and December 2025.

There have been some unofficial sources suggesting more specific dates. For instance, a leak on the XUruguay video game store website listed the game for release on September 17, 2025, which would align with Take-Two's fall 2025 plans and coincidentally mark exactly 12 years since the release of GTA V[4].

## Regional Release Information

As of February 27, 2025, Rockstar Games and Take-Two Interactive have not made any official announcements specifically addressing regional release plans for Grand Theft Auto VI in Europe or other territories. The announcements have only confirmed the general 2025 release timeframe without specifying regional availability.

Historically, Rockstar Games has typically opted for simultaneous global releases for major titles in the Grand Theft Auto series, suggesting that if the game launches in 2025, it would likely be available in Europe at the same time as other major markets.

## Potential Uncertainties

Despite the official commitment to a Fall 2025 release, there have been persistent rumors about potential delays. Prior to the February 2025 earnings call, industry publications had reported speculation about possible delays, with Kotaku noting that "While early 2025 was at one point possible, it's no longer the target for Grand Theft Auto VI's launch"[3].

Game development timelines are notoriously subject to change, especially for projects of this scale and importance. Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick has described the upcoming game as "extraordinary and worth waiting for" and "breathtaking"[3], suggesting the company places high importance on quality, which could potentially impact release timing if development challenges arise.

## Conclusion

Based on the most recent official information available as of February 27, 2025, Grand Theft Auto VI is scheduled for release in Fall 2025[5]. While no specific information about European availability has been announced, Rockstar's historical approach to global releases suggests the game would likely be available in Europe simultaneously with other regions. However, as with any major game development project, there remains the possibility of delays or changes to release plans.
