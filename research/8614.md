## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of November 2021, there is no public record of a non-state actor independently developing and assembling a deployable nuclear weapon. Historical incidents have involved theft, smuggling, or intent, but not successful indigenous development[1].
- The international non-proliferation framework is robust. The NPT, IAEA safeguards, and UN Security Council Resolution 1540 all specifically target the prevention of nuclear weapons proliferation—including to non-state actors—and are widely enforced[2][5].
- Efforts by groups like al-Qaeda and ISIS to acquire nuclear weapons have been documented, but have not resulted in the construction of a working device. Past incidents, such as Project Sapphire, demonstrate the risk of unsecured materials but also the effectiveness of international counter-proliferation efforts[1].

## Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- The Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW) and reaffirmations of the NPT have reinforced global non-proliferation norms, with stress on full implementation and complementarity between treaties[2].
- The UN and Security Council continue to highlight the need for vigilance against new proliferation risks, including those posed by emerging technologies and non-state actors, and have urged the strengthening of enforcement mechanisms[4][5].
- The IAEA's safeguards and verification protocols have been expanded and strengthened, improving detection and deterrence of illicit nuclear activity[5].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Official reports from the IAEA, the United Nations, and national intelligence agencies serve as primary sources for verification of any such development or incident[5].
- Policy statements and treaty documentation from NPT and TPNW review conferences provide context on international commitment and enforcement[2][4].
- Security Council resolutions, especially 1540, directly address and monitor the risk of WMD proliferation to non-state actors[5].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- While international frameworks are strong, they are not infallible. The risk of theft, black-market sales, or lapses in material security remains a concern[1].
- Measurement is limited by the clandestine nature of nuclear proliferation efforts. A breakthrough by a non-state actor could go undetected for some time, though this is increasingly unlikely given current surveillance and intelligence capabilities[1][5].
- Probabilistic assessment cannot exclude the possibility entirely, but the current trajectory and barriers suggest the likelihood is extremely low barring unprecedented lapses in security or international cooperation.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

- Given historical precedent, current international cooperation, robust technical and logistical barriers, and improved monitoring, the probability that a non-state actor will indigenously develop a deployable nuclear weapon by 2030 is extremely low—well below 1%—but not absolutely zero[1][5].
