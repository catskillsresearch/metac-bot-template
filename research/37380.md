# US Regular Gasoline Price Forecast for June 23, 2025

As of May 28, 2025, I've analyzed the available data to forecast the US regular gasoline retail price for June 23, 2025. This analysis incorporates recent projections, historical trends, and market indicators to provide a comprehensive assessment.

## Current Price Trajectory and Projections

The Energy Information Administration (EIA) expects US regular gasoline retail prices to average $3.16 per gallon during the second quarter of 2025, which includes our target date of June 23[2]. This represents a continuation of the declining price trend observed since 2023. Looking at the broader context, the EIA projects an annual average of $3.09 per gallon for 2025, down from $3.31 per gallon in 2024[2].

The most recent EIA Short-Term Energy Outlook (STEO) released in early May 2025 indicates that gasoline prices across the United States will average $3.14 per gallon over the combined second and third quarters of 2025, representing a 9% decrease from the same period in 2024[3]. This suggests a relatively stable price environment as we approach the end of Q2.

## Seasonal Factors and Market Indicators

June 23 falls near the end of the second quarter and the beginning of the summer driving season. Historically, gasoline prices tend to peak in late spring and early summer due to increased demand and the switch to summer-blend fuels. However, the EIA's quarterly projections show only a minimal difference between Q2 ($3.16) and Q3 ($3.12) of 2025[2], suggesting a more stable price environment than in typical years.

Recent futures markets provide additional insight. As of mid-May 2025, RBOB gasoline futures were trading at $2.13 per gallon for July delivery[4]. When accounting for taxes, distribution costs, and retail margins that are added to the wholesale price, this aligns with the EIA's retail price projections.

## Alternative Forecasts

GasBuddy's 2025 Fuel Price Outlook, published in January 2025, projected a slightly higher annual average of $3.22 per gallon[5]. Their monthly projections would place June 2025 in the higher range of their annual forecast, though still below their April peak forecast of $3.46 per gallon[5].

## Factors Influencing the Forecast

Several key factors are driving the projected price decreases in 2025:

1. Lower crude oil prices are the primary driver of the gasoline price reduction[1]
2. Increasing fleetwide fuel economy is contributing to decreasing gasoline consumption[1]
3. These downward pressures are partially offset by decreasing U.S. refinery capacity[1]

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on all available information, the most likely price range for regular gasoline in the US on June 23, 2025, is between $3.10 and $3.20 per gallon. The EIA's specific Q2 projection of $3.16 per gallon represents the most authoritative point estimate[2].

Given that June 23 falls at the very end of Q2, and the EIA projects a slight decrease to $3.12 for Q3[2], there is a reasonable probability that the actual price could be slightly lower than the Q2 average, perhaps around $3.14 per gallon.

The resolution metric (GASREGW) represents a weekly average based on sampling approximately 900 retail outlets. This sampling methodology introduces some uncertainty but generally provides a reliable national average.
