## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of 2021, most transformative progress in advanced AI systems is led by large for-profit corporations such as Google (DeepMind), Microsoft, and OpenAI (which restructured into a capped-profit model in 2019). These organizations possess the necessary computational resources, data access, and financial capital to pursue AGI-scale projects[1][3].
- Academic institutions and non-profits play a critical role in foundational research and talent development but are less able to support the immense compute and engineering scale required for AGI. Historically, breakthroughs like GPT-3, AlphaGo, and similar milestones have emerged from corporate or corporate-backed labs[3][5].
- National governments, especially the US and China, have articulated ambitions for AI leadership and are increasing investments in AI research, but as of 2021, visible AGI-aligned progress is still primarily associated with the private sector[4].

## 2. Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Metric

- The trend toward commercialization and proprietary development in AI is accelerating. OpenAI’s transition to a “capped-profit” model in 2019 exemplifies this shift, reflecting the scale of investment needed for AGI research.
- Government policies, especially in the US and China, are increasing national AI research funding. However, these often result in partnerships with private industry or are aimed at enabling, rather than directly developing, AGI[4].
- No major nationalization or large-scale public AGI development project had overtaken the private sector’s pace by November 2021.

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Surveys and analyses (Metaculus, AI Multiple) consistently show that expert and community sentiment expects AGI to be delivered by a for-profit or hybrid-for-profit entity, based on observed patterns and resource constraints[1][3].
- Wikipedia and Our World in Data provide overviews of institutional contributions and the rapid growth of corporate-led AI research[1][5].

## 4. Limitations or Uncertainties in Measurement

- The definition of AGI is not universally agreed upon, and the resolution of the question depends on consensus about what constitutes AGI.
- Collaborative projects between corporations, universities, and governments further complicate attribution, though the question resolves positively for all involved if a for-profit is part of the group.
- Sudden policy changes, nationalizations, or unforeseen breakthroughs by non-profit or government groups could shift probabilities.

## 5. Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the historical dominance of for-profit corporations in achieving and demonstrating major AI breakthroughs, their leading role in AGI-enabling infrastructure, and current investment trends, the probability that the group responsible for the first AGI will be part of a for-profit corporation is high—likely exceeding 70% as of 2021-11-05. This assessment adjusts downward from certainty due to the non-negligible possibility of a major government-led or non-profit breakthrough, or a collaborative effort in which for-profits are not involved.
