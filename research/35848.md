# Forecasting Analysis: TCJA Individual Tax Cuts Extension

As of May 2025, we are approaching a significant tax policy crossroads with the scheduled expiration of key provisions from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) at the end of this year. This analysis examines the current landscape and factors relevant to forecasting whether these provisions will be extended using a "current policy" baseline in Senate reconciliation.

## Current Status of TCJA Individual Tax Provisions

The TCJA individual tax provisions are set to expire after December 31, 2025, which would result in significant tax changes for most Americans[1]. Without congressional action, key provisions affecting individuals will revert to pre-2017 levels, including:

1. **Tax Rates and Brackets**: The current top marginal tax rate of 37% would revert to 39.6%[2]
2. **Standard Deduction**: The nearly doubled standard deduction would be reduced by approximately half[1]
3. **Child Tax Credit**: Enhanced credits would revert to lower pre-TCJA levels
4. **Estate and Gift Tax Exemptions**: These would return to lower thresholds

If Congress does not act, more than 62% of tax filers would experience tax increases in 2026[5].

## Political Landscape and Extension Scenarios

The political composition of Congress following the 2024 elections is a critical factor in determining the fate of these tax provisions. Republicans have stated their intention to use the budget reconciliation process to extend the TCJA if they control Congress[3]. This approach is particularly significant because reconciliation bills can bypass the Senate filibuster, requiring only a simple majority for passage.

Three main scenarios have emerged:

1. **Long-term extension**: If Republicans control Congress, they aim to use reconciliation to extend the TCJA provisions long-term or permanently[3]

2. **Short-term extension**: In a divided government scenario, a compromise could lead to a 1-2 year extension to allow for further negotiations, similar to what occurred with the Bush tax cuts in 2010[3]

3. **Expiration**: If Congress fails to act, provisions would expire, though complete expiration is considered unlikely given the broad impact on taxpayers[3]

## Current Policy Baseline Considerations

While the search results don't explicitly address the "current policy" baseline approach, understanding the budgetary implications is important for forecasting. Under a traditional "current law" baseline, extending the TCJA would be scored as increasing the deficit. However, a "current policy" baseline would assume these tax cuts continue and therefore have a smaller budgetary impact.

The Penn Wharton Budget Model has analyzed various options that could be considered if the TCJA is extended:

- **Option 1**: Extend the TCJA except for the top rate, which would revert to 39.6% for income above $547K (single) or $615K (married filing jointly). This would reduce the cost of extension by $402 billion over 10 years[2]

- **Option 2**: Extend the TCJA but introduce a new 39.6% top rate for income above $1 million. This would reduce extension costs by $222 billion over 10 years[2]

- **Option 3**: Extend the TCJA but introduce a 39.6% top rate for income above $2.5 million (single) or $5 million (married filing jointly), reducing extension costs by $22 billion over 10 years[2]

These options suggest potential compromise approaches that could influence reconciliation strategies.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors create uncertainty in forecasting this outcome:

1. The search results don't provide specific details about current Congressional leadership positions on using a "current policy" baseline in reconciliation

2. The exact partisan makeup of the Senate following the 2024 elections is not specified in the available information

3. The search results don't contain information about any preliminary rulings from the Senate Parliamentarian regarding the viability of a "current policy" baseline approach

4. The timeline for potential reconciliation action in 2025 is not detailed in the available information

## Conclusion

Based on the available information as of May 2025, we can conclude that:

1. The expiration of TCJA provisions at the end of 2025 would have widespread tax implications for Americans

2. Republicans have expressed clear intent to use reconciliation to extend these provisions if they control Congress

3. Various compromise approaches exist that could influence how extensions are structured

4. The viability of using a "current policy" baseline in reconciliation remains a critical unknown factor that will significantly impact the forecast

The resolution of this question will likely depend on the combination of partisan control of Congress, procedural rulings by the Senate Parliamentarian, and potential compromise approaches between the parties as the expiration deadline approaches.
