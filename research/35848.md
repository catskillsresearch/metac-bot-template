## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) introduced major temporary individual tax cuts: lower tax rates/brackets, a near doubling of the standard deduction, expansion of the child tax credit, and an increased estate and gift tax exclusion[1][2][5].
- These provisions are set to expire at the end of 2025 unless extended by legislative action[1][2][4].
- There is strong partisan divide: Republicans broadly support making these provisions permanent, while Democrats oppose permanent extensions on deficit and distributional grounds[2][4].

## Recent Announcements and Policy Actions

- As of early 2025, House and Senate Republicans are actively pursuing legislation to extend TCJA provisions, including via budget reconciliation[1][2].
- The cost of extending the expiring cuts is estimated at $4 trillion over 10 years, complicating reconciliation under standard "current law" baseline rules[4][5].
- Reports indicate Republican leaders are seeking to base their reconciliation bill on a "current policy" baseline, which assumes the tax cuts continue and thus reduces the official score of their extension[1][3]. This approach is procedurally contentious and would require either a favorable ruling from the Senate parliamentarian or a decision to override precedent[2].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The Tax Policy Center and Bipartisan Policy Center provide up-to-date trackers and analyses of legislative actions on the TCJA[1][4][5].
- Major legislative news outlets (such as The Hill, cited in the original question) track parliamentary debates and procedural rulings in the Senate.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- As of April 10, 2025, no reconciliation bill using a "current policy" baseline has been enacted, nor is there public confirmation that the Senate parliamentarian has allowed its use[1][2].
- The outcome hinges on Senate control, internal party discipline, and procedural decisionsâ€”especially whether the parliamentarian permits deviation from the "current law" baseline.
- If the "current policy" baseline is rejected, alternatives include a temporary extension or a return to the traditional "current law" scoring, both of which could alter the legislative strategy[2].
- Previous precedent and Senate rules favor the "current law" baseline, making the path to a "current policy" baseline uncertain.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

- The current situation is unprecedented: while there is clear Republican intent and political pressure to use a "current policy" baseline, no authoritative procedural ruling or precedent exists as of April 10, 2025[1][2].
- Key differences from reference cases (e.g., 2012 Bush tax cut extension) include the scale of the deficit impact and heightened partisanship.
- Given these facts, the probability of TCJA individual tax cuts being extended via reconciliation using a "current policy" baseline before October 1, 2025, remains uncertain but plausible if:
  - Republicans maintain or gain Senate control and unity,
  - They secure a favorable procedural ruling (or override the parliamentarian),
  - There is sufficient political will to confront likely procedural and public backlash.

However, the lack of precedent and the possibility of alternative approaches (such as a temporary extension or bipartisan compromise) introduces significant uncertainty, making a positive resolution (as narrowly defined) less than a majority likelihood as of the current date.
