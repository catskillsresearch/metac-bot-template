## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- **NATO Policy:** Since the start of the Ukraine War, NATO and its member states have consistently declared they will not deploy combat troops to Ukraine, largely due to fears of direct confrontation with Russia and escalation to nuclear conflict[3].
- **Russian Buildup:** By end of 2024, Russia had roughly 700,000 troops in Ukraine, with significant increases in military production and capabilities, putting pressure on Ukraine’s defenses and raising questions about the West’s ability to deter further Russian gains without more direct involvement[1].
- **NATO Readiness:** NATO has increased its military readiness, with the NATO Response Force previously able to mobilize 40,000 troops quickly, and more recent exercises suggesting preparations for much larger deployments, including contingency planning for up to 800,000 troops[4][5].

## 2. Recent Announcements and Policies

- **France’s Position:** In early 2024, French President Emmanuel Macron stated that sending troops to Ukraine could not be ruled out, although France later backtracked due to internal and allied opposition[3].
- **US/UK Position:** Both the US and UK reiterated their strong opposition to deploying combat troops to Ukraine, maintaining the longstanding NATO consensus[3].
- **Postwar Scenarios:** Current European negotiations are focusing on assembling a postwar deterrence force for Ukraine, with discussions about potentially 50,000 European troops from several countries, but only after hostilities have ceased and likely as part of a peace or armistice arrangement[3].
- **NATO Exercises:** In 2024, NATO conducted its largest series of drills since the Cold War, emphasizing readiness for rapid deployment but stopping short of actual plans to station combat troops inside Ukraine while fighting persists[5].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- **Bruegel analysis** details the scale of Russian deployments and Western concerns about defense capacity[1].
- **Politico Europe** provides insight into ongoing European debates and discussions about potential future troop deployments, particularly in postwar scenarios[3].
- **IISS** and **YouTube reports** track both NATO readiness levels and public statements about troop mobilization[4][5].

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- **Escalation Risks:** Direct NATO deployment remains extremely risky due to Russian nuclear threats, making open combat troop presence highly unlikely absent a dramatic change in the military or political environment.
- **Policy Shifts:** While France and some European leaders have floated the possibility, internal NATO consensus and US/UK resistance remain strong constraints.
- **Postwar Possibilities:** The most credible scenario for NATO troop presence is after a ceasefire or peace agreement, likely in a deterrence or stabilization role, but not during active hostilities.
- **Measurement Ambiguities:** Definitions of “significant numbers” and “combat troops” are precise in this forecast, reducing ambiguity but requiring clear, sustained deployment and open admission.
- **War Developments:** The forecast could change rapidly if the war escalates or if Ukrainian statehood is threatened by total military defeat.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Based on current trends, historical precedent, and recent policy statements as of March 2024, the probability that NATO combat troops will be **openly and significantly present in Ukraine before January 1, 2027** is **low to moderate**. The baseline probability remains low (estimated at 10–20%) while active fighting continues, due to strong US/UK opposition and nuclear escalation fears. However, the probability increases (up to 30–40%) in the event of a postwar stabilization or deterrence mission, especially if Russia and Ukraine reach a peace agreement that leaves uncontested Ukrainian territory under Kyiv’s control and Europe perceives a need for a security guarantee[3][4][5].
