## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- In 2019, the CDC estimated that over 2.8 million antimicrobial-resistant infections occurred annually in the US, resulting in more than 35,000 deaths per year; if including C. diff (not typically resistant), this figure rises to 48,000 deaths[2].
- Globally, bacterial antimicrobial resistance (AMR) was responsible for at least 1.27 million deaths in 2019, with AMR implicated in nearly 5 million deaths overall[3].
- Forecasts published in *The Lancet* (GRAM project, 2024) project a 67.5% increase in annual deaths directly attributed to bacterial AMR from 1.14 million in 2021 to 1.91 million in 2050 globally[5]. This suggests a roughly 2% annual growth rate, far slower than the pace needed to double US deaths in just six years.

## Recent Announcements or Policies

- There have been continued calls for stewardship, prevention, and development of new antibiotics, but no major breakthrough or change in US policy trajectory since 2019 is noted[2][5].
- Surveillance and tracking systems have improved, but no reports indicate a sudden spike in deaths or infections[2].
- Internationally, the trend is upward but gradual, emphasizing the need for preventive action rather than reflecting a current crisis of doubling mortality[5].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC): Annual reports and AR Threats Report[2].
- The Lancet/GRAM Project: Global burden and forecasts of AMR[1][5].
- World Health Organization (WHO): Fact sheets and global estimates[3].

## Measurement Limitations and Uncertainties

- Estimates may vary due to differences in definitions (direct vs. associated deaths), inclusion of pathogens (e.g., C. diff), and improvements in tracking/reporting systems[2].
- Some deaths may be underreported or misattributed, but improved data sharing and harmonization efforts decrease this risk[2].
- Global projections may not map directly to the US context, given differences in healthcare infrastructure, stewardship, and antibiotic usage.

## Comparative Assessment

| Factor                                            | 2019 Value (US) | Doubling Threshold | 2025 Forecast Trend         |
|---------------------------------------------------|-----------------|-------------------|----------------------------|
| Annual deaths (CDC, AR infections)                | ~35,000         | 70,000            | Gradual increase, not doubling[2][5] |
| Annual deaths (CDC, including C. diff)            | ~48,000         | 70,000            | Still under threshold      |
| Global AMR deaths (direct, 2019)                  | 1.27 million    | N/A               | 1.91 million by 2050[5]    |

**Key Difference Affecting Forecast:** No evidence of a surge or step-change in US AMR deaths since 2019; increases are steady and significant but not doubling within six years.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given historical rates, global trends, and absence of a disruptive event or breakthrough, the probability that a credible US source (e.g., CDC) will report at least 70,000 annual US deaths from antibiotic-resistant infections by the end of 2025 is **very low**â€”likely well under 10%.
