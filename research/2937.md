### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- In 2019, the CDC reported more than 2.8 million antimicrobial-resistant infections and over 35,000 deaths per year in the US[4][3].
- Including C. diff (not typically resistant, but associated with antibiotic use) brings the total to about 48,000 deaths annually[3][4].
- The global burden of AMR was estimated at 1.27 million direct deaths in 2019, with projections of a steep global rise by 2050[1][2][5].
- As of early 2025, CDC's published figures for the US remain at "more than 35,000" deaths per year; there is no indication of a significant increase or doubling since 2019[3][4].

### Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Metric

- The CDC and global partners have continued to implement antimicrobial stewardship, infection prevention, and surveillance programs to mitigate the rise of AMR deaths[3][4].
- No major policy changes or events have been reported that would lead to a sudden surge in US AMR mortality.

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- CDC Antimicrobial Resistance Facts and Stats[3]
- CDC 2019 Antibiotic Resistance Threats Report[4]
- WHO Antimicrobial Resistance Fact Sheet[1]

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- Variability in how deaths are attributed: "Directly caused by" vs. "associated with" antibiotic resistance.
- Inclusion or exclusion of C. diff can change reported totals by more than 10,000 deaths annually[3][4].
- Reporting lags and differences in surveillance methodologies may affect the precision of annual figures.

### Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the flat trend in reported US deaths from antibiotic-resistant infections (35,000â€“48,000 per year including C. diff) and the absence of evidence for rapid acceleration, the likelihood that CDC or another credible source will report at least 70,000 annual US deaths from antibiotic-resistant infections by December 31, 2025, is very low. There is no data to support a doubling within this period.
