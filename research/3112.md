## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of 2019, neither Mars nor the Moon hosts a permanent human population. The largest sustained human presence beyond Earth is the International Space Station (ISS), with up to seven crew members at a time.
- Mars colonization has been most publicly championed by SpaceX, which envisions a self-sustaining city on Mars, potentially reaching tens of thousands of residents in the long term[3].
- The Moon has been the focus of renewed interest for exploration (e.g., NASA Artemis program), but near-term plans center on small, rotating crews in scientific or staging outposts, rather than mass colonization.
- SpaceX’s stated Mars plan, as of 2025 updates, is to land the first Starships on Mars in 2026, with the long-term goal of a large-scale, self-governing colony[1][2][3]. No comparably ambitious or well-funded plans exist for the Moon.

## 2. Key Differences Affecting the Forecast

| Factor            | Mars                                  | Moon                                 |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Distance from Earth | 55–400 million km                  | ~0.38 million km                    |
| One-way Comm Lag  | 3–22 minutes                          | ~1.3 seconds                        |
| Gravity           | 0.38 g                                | 0.17 g                              |
| Rotation Period   | 25 hours                              | 1 month                             |
| Atmosphere        | Thin, mostly CO₂ (~1% of Earth)       | Negligible                          |
| Solar Energy      | ~44% of Earth (variable, dust storms) | Same as Earth, but long night cycles |
| Vision/Advocacy   | Mass colonization (SpaceX)            | Small science outposts (NASA, etc.)  |
| Launch Frequency  | ~every 26 months (Mars window)        | Any time                            |
| Logistical Support| Minimal, high-latency, high cost      | Rapid, low-latency, lower cost      |

**Key Differences:**
- The Moon is vastly easier to reach, resupply, and evacuate, and offers near-instant communication. This strongly favors earlier, smaller-scale settlement.
- Mars plans are, as of 2019 and 2025 updates, more ambitious in population scale, but face major technical, physiological, and logistical barriers to rapid population growth[1][2][3].
- Lunar efforts lack a comparable “city-size” vision, but the infrastructure challenge is orders of magnitude lower.

## 3. Recent Announcements and Policies

- SpaceX continues to publicly target Mars as a site for a large, self-sustaining settlement, with first crewed Starship launches as early as the late 2020s and a long-term goal of 1 million people. The most recent 2025 update continues to emphasize Mars as the primary destination for mass colonization[1][2][3].
- Lunar programs (e.g., NASA Artemis) remain focused on small crews and short-duration missions. No government or consortium has announced plans for a lunar settlement on the scale of 10,000 residents.

## 4. Measurement Limitations and Uncertainties

- The population criterion (10,000 residents for 3+ years) is extremely ambitious for either Mars or the Moon within the 21st century.
- Measurement depends on reliable, official definitions of residency, which may be influenced by future administrative or political changes.
- Uncertainties include future launch costs, the pace of technological advancement, the health implications of long-term low gravity, and sustained funding or political support.
- There is a possibility that neither body will reach the threshold by 2100.

## 5. Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

- Based on plans and advocacy as of 2019–2025, Mars is the only body with a major entity (SpaceX) explicitly targeting a city-scale human settlement[1][2][3]. However, the technical and logistical challenges are much greater than for the Moon.
- The Moon’s proximity and ease of access make it a much more likely candidate for smaller-scale, incremental settlement, but there is no current roadmap to 10,000 long-term residents.
- **Probabilistic Assessment:** While Mars has the more ambitious announced plans, the practical barriers mean it is more likely that the Moon will reach 10,000 permanent residents first—if either body does so before 2100. However, given the absence of any concrete lunar program aiming at that scale, the probability for either is extremely low, and the question may well remain unresolved.
- **Forecast:** The Moon is more likely to host 10,000 permanent residents before Mars, but the probability of either outcome occurring before 2100 is very low.
