# Will Elon Musk Be Interviewed by Jon Stewart on The Daily Show?

As of March 19, 2025, there is an ongoing public exchange between Elon Musk and Jon Stewart regarding a potential interview on The Daily Show, but no confirmed interview has taken place yet.

## Current Status

In late February 2025, Elon Musk responded to a social media post suggesting he should appear on The Daily Show by stating, "I will do it if the show airs unedited."[1] The Daily Show's official account replied on March 5, 2025, with "Elon Musk, we'd be delighted."[1][2] This exchange indicates initial willingness from both parties to arrange an interview, though with conditions from Musk's side.

## Recent Developments

Following The Daily Show's acceptance of his terms, Musk made additional comments that complicated the situation. He characterized Jon Stewart as "much more a propagandist than it would seem" and claimed "John is too set in his ways. He used to be more bipartisan."[1]

On March 3, 2025, Stewart addressed these comments directly on his show:

"I'm really not sure what he thinks bipartisan means, but it's generally not 'I support Donald Trump and also Germany's AFD party. That's not bipartisan. That's just the same.'"[1]

Stewart further extended the invitation while challenging Musk's characterization:

"I do have some criticisms about Doge. I support in general the idea of efficiency and delivering better services to the American public in cheaper and more efficient ways. And if you want to come on and talk about it on the show, great."[1]

He added: "If you don't want to, sure. But can we just drop the pretense that you won't do it because I don't measure up to the standards of neutral discourse that you demand and display at all times? Because quite frankly, you know it, I know it."[1]

## Factors Affecting Likelihood

Several factors may influence whether this interview materializes before April 1, 2025:

1. **Time constraints**: With less than two weeks remaining between the latest available information (March 19) and the resolution deadline (April 1), scheduling challenges could prevent the interview from occurring.

2. **Continued public disagreement**: The tone of the exchange suggests tension between the two figures, which could either motivate or discourage an actual interview.

3. **Musk's condition**: The requirement for an unedited broadcast adds a production consideration that, while accepted by The Daily Show, represents an unusual format for the program.

## Limitations in Forecasting

Based on the available information as of March 19, 2025, we cannot definitively determine whether the interview will occur before April 1. The public exchanges indicate both interest and friction, but no confirmed scheduling has been announced. The short timeframe remaining before the resolution deadline further complicates the forecast.
