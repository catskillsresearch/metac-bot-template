## Conclusion

Based on historical trends and current team strengths, the United States is the only nation with a realistic chance of winning more than one women's team sport gold at the 2024 Olympics. While upsets are possible, the U.S. is favored in basketball (5×5), water polo, and is a strong contender in volleyball and soccer. Therefore, it is plausible—though not certain—that the same nation will win more than one women's team sport at the 2024 Olympics.
