**Grammy Forecast for Taylor Swift (2025)**  
As of January 2025, Taylor Swift has six Grammy nominations, but **no confirmed wins** are documented in available pre-cutoff sources. Key factors influencing her potential outcomes include:  

1. **Competitive Landscape**:  
   - **Album of the Year**: Competing against Billie Eilish (*Hit Me Hard and Soft*), Charli XCX (*Brat*), and Beyoncé, with critics favoring Billie or Charli for innovation[2][3].  
   - **Song/Record of the Year**: Sabrina Carpenter’s “Espresso” and Billie Eilish’s “Birds of a Feather” are frontrunners[2][4].  
   - **Producer Recognition**: Jack Antonoff’s absence from Best Producer nominations[1] may indirectly affect Swift’s collaborative entries.  

2. **Historical Trends**:  
   Swift’s four prior Album of the Year wins set a high bar, but *The Tortured Poets Department* faces criticism for being “niche” and “less interesting” compared to her earlier work[3].  

3. **Uncertainties**:  
   - Exact nomination categories are unspecified in available sources.  
   - Voter sentiment appears divided, with some predicting a Swift win due to her cultural impact[1], while others deem it unlikely[3].  

**Conclusion**: While Swift could win **1 award** in a less competitive category (e.g., Pop Vocal Album), current evidence does not strongly support multiple wins.  

**Answer**: `1`
