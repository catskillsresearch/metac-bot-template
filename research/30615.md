# Forecasting BLS Nonfarm Payroll Numbers for November 2024

The upcoming Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) report on nonfarm payroll employment for November 2024 will be a critical indicator of the U.S. labor market's health. Based on available data as of December 2024, this analysis examines relevant factors to help forecast whether the November figures will show an increase.

## Current Labor Market Status and Recent Trends

The most recent BLS data shows that the U.S. economy added only 12,000 jobs in October 2024, representing a significant underperformance compared to expectations[3][5]. This figure was approximately 90% below growth estimates and marked a sharp departure from the six-digit job growth observed in nearly every other month of 2024[4][5].

Despite this minimal job growth, the unemployment rate remained steady at 4.1% for the second consecutive month[3][5]. This suggests that while job creation slowed dramatically, there wasn't a corresponding surge in unemployment, indicating a potential stabilization rather than deterioration in the overall labor market.

### Industry-Specific Performance

October 2024 showed significant variation across industries:

- **Growth Sectors**: Health care (+52,300 jobs) and government (+40,000 jobs) continued to show strength[2]
- **Declining Sectors**: Manufacturing experienced substantial losses (-46,000 jobs)[2]
- **Other Industries**: Mixed performance with aerospace and defense (+2,500), architecture and engineering (+3,500), automotive (-6,000), construction (+8,000), scientific research and development (+400), and utilities (-1,700)[2]

The insurance industry specifically saw a decrease of 1,400 jobs in October, though the unemployment rate for insurance carriers and related activities declined from 3.1% in August to 1.5% in October[4].

## Factors Affecting October's Performance

A key consideration when analyzing October's unusually low job growth is the impact of natural disasters. Two hurricanes made landfall in the southeast region between late September and early October 2024, which likely affected employment estimates[2][4]. Economists have attributed the October slowdown partially to employees being temporarily off payrolls as a result of these hurricanes[4].

This suggests that October's weak performance may be an anomaly rather than the beginning of a sustained downward trend. The BLS has indicated that data revisions will be noted in future reports, potentially adjusting October's figures[2].

## Broader Economic Indicators

Despite the slowdown in job creation, other economic indicators remain positive:

- "Real" average hourly earnings (wages adjusted for inflation) increased by 1.4% between October 2023 and October 2024[2]
- The labor market, while "slightly cooling," was still described as "stable" by analysts[4]
- The insurance industry, despite October losses, had added more than 28,000 jobs since the start of 2024[4]

## Historical Context

The October 2024 unemployment rate of 4.1% represents only a modest increase of three-tenths of a percent from 3.8% over the previous 12 months[5]. Additionally, the number of long-term unemployed (jobless for at least 27 weeks) showed little movement at about 1.6 million people[5].

In November 2024, the level of job postings remained 60% above its pre-pandemic baseline, suggesting continued demand for workers despite the October slowdown[1].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors create uncertainty in forecasting November's nonfarm payroll numbers:

1. **Natural Disaster Effects**: The full impact of the hurricanes on October's numbers and potential recovery in November remains unclear[2][4]
2. **Seasonal Adjustments**: November typically sees seasonal employment changes that may affect the numbers
3. **Data Revisions**: The BLS often revises previous months' figures, as evidenced by the revision of September's numbers in the insurance sector[4]
4. **Industry Variation**: The significant disparity between growing and declining sectors suggests that overall numbers may mask important underlying trends[2]

## Conclusion

While October 2024 showed unusually weak job growth of only 12,000 new positions, several factors suggest this may be a temporary anomaly rather than a new trend. The impact of hurricanes, continued strength in sectors like healthcare and government, stable unemployment rates, and wage growth all indicate underlying resilience in the labor market.

Based on available data, there are reasonable grounds to expect that November 2024 nonfarm payroll numbers could show improvement over October's performance, potentially returning to positive growth, though perhaps not at the six-digit levels seen earlier in 2024. However, significant uncertainty remains due to the factors outlined above.
