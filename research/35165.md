# Forecasting Taiwan ADIZ Violations (February 15 - March 15, 2025)

To forecast the number of aircraft violating Taiwan's air defense identification zone (ADIZ) between February 15 and March 15, 2025, I'll analyze historical patterns, recent trends, and relevant contextual factors based on data available as of February 17, 2025.

## Historical Trends and Current Status

The frequency of Chinese aircraft incursions into Taiwan's ADIZ has shown a clear upward trajectory over recent years:

- In 2020, Taiwan recorded approximately 380 total air incursions into its ADIZ[4]
- Monthly averages increased substantially from 81 intrusions in 2021 to 178 through the first half of 2024[2]
- The most significant spike occurred in August 2022 following then-US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taipei[2]

The most recent complete month of data (January 2025) shows 255 PLA aircraft incursions into Taiwan's ADIZ[3]. This represents a continuation of the "new normal" that began following President Lai Ching-te's inauguration in May 2024, after which monthly violations consistently exceeded 200[3][5].

Taiwan's Ministry of National Defense reported that January 2025 saw 235 aircraft and maritime vessels entering the ADIZ, with 131 aircraft specifically crossing the median line between China and Taiwan[5]. While this represents the second lowest monthly total since May 2024, it remains significantly higher than pre-2024 averages[3].

## Recent Developments Affecting ADIZ Violations

Several factors may influence the forecast period:

1. **Established Pattern Since Lai's Inauguration**: Following President Lai's inauguration in May 2024, monthly ADIZ violations shot over 280 and have remained consistently high[5]. This suggests a deliberate Chinese strategy rather than temporary escalation.

2. **Strategic Intent**: The PRC has normalized over 200 ADIZ incursions per month since May 2024, with the apparent goal of degrading Taiwan's threat awareness and raising the threshold for its threat response[3]. This indicates a sustained campaign rather than reactive incidents.

3. **Recent Defense Acquisitions**: On January 16, 2025, Taiwan's Ministry of National Defense announced a new order of American surface-to-air missile systems and two new mobile radar systems for threat detection[5]. Such acquisitions could potentially trigger increased Chinese military activity as a response.

4. **Seasonal Patterns**: While not explicitly mentioned in the available data, any seasonal patterns in PLA operations could affect the forecast period.

## Measurement Methodology and Limitations

When forecasting ADIZ violations, it's important to understand the measurement methodology:

- Taiwan's de facto ADIZ ends at the median line of the Taiwan Strait, meaning aircraft tracked on the Chinese side of the median line are not included in official counts
- The figures do not include PLA activity around Taiwan's outlying islands of Kinmen and Matsu, which are west of the median line[3]
- Taiwan's MND quietly shortened the warning distance for air raid warnings from 70 to 24 nautical miles at the end of 2022 due to the increased volume of PLA activity[3]

## Forecast Considerations

Based on the available data, several key points should inform any forecast for the February 15 - March 15, 2025 period:

1. The "new normal" established since May 2024 suggests monthly totals exceeding 200 aircraft are likely to continue
2. January 2025's total of 255 aircraft provides the most recent baseline[3]
3. The consistent pattern since May 2024 indicates that dramatic deviations from recent months are unlikely without significant new political developments
4. The correlation between Taiwan and Japan ADIZ violations suggests broader regional patterns in PLA Air Force and Navy operations[2]

Given these factors, and considering that January 2025 represented the second lowest monthly total since May 2024 while still reaching 255 aircraft, a reasonable forecast would likely fall within a similar range, barring any major political developments or escalations during the forecast period.
