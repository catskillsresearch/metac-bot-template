# Forecasting Analysis: US/California AI Model Training Licensing Requirements

As of May 17, 2023, the landscape for AI regulation in the United States is still developing, with limited formal regulatory frameworks specifically addressing large AI model training. This analysis examines available information to forecast the likelihood of licensing requirements being implemented before 2026.

## Current Situation (as of May 17, 2023)

The United States currently has no federal licensing requirements for training large AI models. Similarly, California, despite being home to many frontier AI labs, has not implemented state-level licensing requirements specific to AI model training. The regulatory approach to AI is still in its formative stages, with policymakers and industry leaders beginning to discuss potential frameworks.

Recent developments include:

- On May 16, 2023 (just one day before our analysis cutoff), OpenAI CEO Sam Altman testified before Congress and called for licensing requirements for building advanced AI systems
- An OpenAI staff member recently advocated for establishing a licensing agency for AI
- No concrete legislative proposals for AI licensing have been introduced at either the federal or California state level

## Reference Cases and Analogies

Several existing regulatory frameworks could serve as models for potential AI licensing:

1. **Nuclear Industry Regulation**: The Nuclear Regulatory Commission licenses and regulates nuclear facilities and materials, controlling access to potentially dangerous technology.

2. **FDA Drug Approval Process**: Pharmaceutical companies must obtain licenses to develop and market drugs through a multi-phase testing process.

3. **Aviation Regulation**: The FAA certifies aircraft, pilots, and aviation systems through comprehensive safety standards.

4. **California-Specific Precedents**: California has historically implemented stricter regulatory standards ahead of federal action in areas like environmental protection and consumer privacy.

## Key Differences Affecting the Forecast

Several factors distinguish AI regulation from these reference cases:

1. **Technical Complexity**: Defining what constitutes a "large model" presents technical challenges (though the question provides a FLOP-based metric as one possible approach).

2. **Industry Opposition vs. Support**: Unlike many regulated industries, some major AI companies (notably OpenAI) are actively calling for regulation, potentially accelerating the timeline.

3. **International Competition**: Concerns about maintaining U.S. competitiveness in AI development may slow implementation of restrictive licensing.

4. **Dual-Use Nature**: AI's broad applications across sectors complicate the regulatory approach compared to single-purpose technologies.

5. **Enforcement Mechanisms**: The computational resources required for large model training are trackable through hardware purchases and energy consumption, making a licensing regime potentially enforceable.

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on the available information as of May 17, 2023, I estimate:

**65% probability that either the US federal government or California will implement some form of licensing requirement for large AI model training before the end of 2025.**

Key factors supporting this assessment:

- Industry leaders like Sam Altman are proactively calling for regulation, which significantly increases the likelihood of implementation
- The concentration of AI labs in California makes state-level regulation a viable path, potentially moving faster than federal action
- Historical precedent shows California often leads in technology regulation
- The defined timeframe (by end of 2025) provides approximately 2.5 years for regulatory development, which is reasonable for a priority issue

Factors decreasing probability:

- Legislative and regulatory processes typically move slowly, especially for novel technologies
- Technical challenges in defining regulatory boundaries for "large models"
- Potential industry division, with some companies likely to oppose licensing requirements
- Competing priorities in Congress and state legislatures

## Timeline Projection

If licensing requirements are implemented, the most likely sequence would be:

1. **2023-2024**: Hearings, stakeholder consultations, and initial legislative proposals
2. **2024**: Passage of enabling legislation at either federal or state level
3. **2024-2025**: Development of specific regulations and licensing frameworks
4. **2025**: Implementation of licensing requirements

California action is likely to precede federal implementation, given the state's historical pattern of regulatory leadership in technology sectors.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several significant limitations affect this forecast:

1. The rapidly evolving nature of AI capabilities may accelerate regulatory timelines beyond what historical patterns would suggest
2. The analysis is limited by information available as of May 17, 2023, and subsequent developments could significantly alter the trajectory
3. The form of licensing could vary widely in stringency and scope, affecting both implementation timeline and how it would be categorized
4. Political factors, including election cycles and changes in administration priorities, add uncertainty to regulatory timelines
