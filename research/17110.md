## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of May 2023, there were no US federal or California state requirements for licenses or permits to conduct large AI model training runs[1].
- Calls for such licensing—including from OpenAI's CEO Sam Altman—were publicized in May 2023, but had not translated into legislative proposals or enacted regulations by that time[1].
- Since 2023, the regulatory focus in the US has shifted toward export controls on advanced AI chips and reporting requirements for advanced AI models, as well as evolving copyright policies to address the use of protected works in AI training[3][4][5].
- The US Copyright Office, in its May 2025 report, emphasized voluntary and collective licensing for content used in AI training rather than compulsory government-imposed licensing frameworks, and recommended against compulsory licensing for this purpose[5].

## 2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- **Export Controls (2025):** New regulations require US companies to retain controlled advanced chips domestically and impose reporting requirements for certain advanced AI models, but do not establish a general licensing regime for AI training runs[3][4].
- **Copyright Licensing (2025):** The US Copyright Office’s 2025 report focuses on voluntary and collective licensing for copyrighted content in AI training datasets, not for the act of training models itself, and explicitly discourages compulsory licensing[5].
- No federal or California state legislation requiring a license to train large AI models has been enacted or is pending as of May 2025.

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Metaculus aggregation and documentation confirm the absence of a licensing requirement as of mid-2023 and track ongoing policy developments[1].
- The US Copyright Office report provides comprehensive analysis of the licensing landscape for AI training data, noting a preference for market-driven solutions and voluntary licensing[5].
- Federal regulatory announcements detail new export controls and reporting requirements, but these fall short of imposing a licensing regime for model training[3][4].

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- While policy debate and regulatory scrutiny of advanced AI systems is increasing, especially around safety and content use, the probability of a broad licensing regime being implemented before 2026 remains low, given the lack of legislative proposals, industry resistance, and policy recommendations favoring less intrusive approaches[1][5].
- Future regulatory shifts are possible, particularly in response to new AI safety incidents or political developments, but as of May 2025, no concrete steps toward licensing for AI training have materialized.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the lack of legislative or regulatory action toward licensing requirements for training large AI models in both the US and California, alongside policy recommendations against compulsory licensing for AI training, the probability that such a licensing regime will be in place before the end of 2025 remains very low—likely under 10% barring unforeseen rapid regulatory action[1][5].
