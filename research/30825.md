## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- **Historical December AQI:** In December 2023, Delhi experienced some of its worst air quality in recent years, with daily AQI values often in the "Very Poor" (301–400) and sometimes "Severe" (401–500) categories. However, "Hazardous" AQI (over 300 by U.S. standards, but typically over 400 in Indian reporting) was not sustained for a third of the month. For example, December 23, 2023, was an outlier with an AQI of 411, but this level was not maintained for a significant portion of the month[4][5].
- **2024 Year-to-Date AQI:** As of early December 2024, only 6% of hours have been classified as "Hazardous," with 12% as "Very Unhealthy" and 33% as "Unhealthy." This indicates that "Hazardous" air quality is relatively rare, even in a year with notable pollution events.
- **Recent AQI Readings:** In early December 2024, AQI values in Delhi are in the "Poor" (201–300) to "Very Poor" (301–400) range, with no stations reporting "Hazardous" levels as of December 5, 2024[1].

## Meteorological and Emission Factors

- **Winter Pollution Drivers:** Delhi's winter air quality typically deteriorates due to a combination of local emissions (construction, traffic, biomass burning) and meteorological factors (low temperatures, low wind speeds, shallow boundary layer). Biomass burning is a significant contributor, especially as temperatures drop[3].
- **2024 Weather Context:** The 2024 monsoon was above average, leading to cleaner air in mid-year, but winter brings the usual risk of severe pollution episodes. However, there is no indication of an extraordinary event that would push "Hazardous" AQI to a third of late December[3].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- **Emergency Measures:** In November 2024, Delhi authorities declared a "medical emergency" and closed schools due to hazardous air, but such measures are reactive and do not indicate a sustained increase in "Hazardous" AQI for the forecast period.
- **No Major Policy Shifts:** There have been no reported policy changes likely to significantly worsen or improve air quality for late December 2024.

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- **AirNow Historical Data:** The official resolution source is AirNow's historical AQI data for New Delhi, which will provide the definitive hourly breakdown for December 16–29, 2024.
- **Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB):** Regular bulletins and forecasts provide context on air quality status and meteorological conditions[1][5].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- **Forecast Uncertainty:** While historical data and current trends suggest a low probability of "Hazardous" AQI for a third of late December, sudden meteorological changes or pollution events could alter this outcome.
- **Data Availability:** The resolution depends on AirNow data being available for the specified period.

## Conclusion

Based on historical patterns, current year-to-date data, and early December 2024 trends, it is unlikely that New Delhi will experience "Hazardous" AQI for at least one third of the last two weeks of December 2024. The most probable outcome is that "Hazardous" conditions will remain below this threshold.
