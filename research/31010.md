## Key Factual Information for Forecasting

**1. Historical Posting Trends**

- Elon Musk is an exceptionally prolific user of X, averaging approximately 101 tweets per day between October and November 2024[1]. This high frequency is consistent throughout the day and night, with bursts of activity that can exceed 12 tweets per hour during peak periods[4].
- Musk’s posting frequency increased after acquiring Twitter, and by late 2024, his activity is described as so frequent that it appears nearly continuous on activity graphs[2].
- There is no evidence of a recent slowdown or intention to reduce his posting volume.

- The New York Times and The Economist, as institutional accounts, typically post less frequently. While specific recent figures are not provided in the search results, their posting patterns are generally more restrained and focused on news and editorial content, not matching the personal, high-frequency engagement style of Musk.

**2. Recent Announcements or Policies**

- No recent announcements or platform policy changes have been reported that would likely alter the tweet volume of any of these accounts for the period in question.
- Elon Musk’s ongoing public controversies (e.g., with the SEC) have not resulted in any observable reduction in his posting frequency[3].

**3. Authoritative Sources for Verification**

- Social Blade is the designated authoritative source for tweet counts for all three accounts, and will be used for final resolution.

**4. Limitations and Uncertainties**

- Social Blade’s data depends on X’s public metrics and may be subject to minor discrepancies or delays.
- If any account changes its posting behavior unexpectedly during the period, this could affect the outcome, but there is no evidence suggesting such a change is likely.

## Conclusion

Based on all available data as of December 14, 2024, Elon Musk (@elonmusk) is overwhelmingly likely to send out more tweets in the 10-day period from December 21-30, 2024, than either The New York Times (@nytimes) or The Economist (@TheEconomist)[1][2][4].
