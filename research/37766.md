## All-In Podcast: Probabilistic Ranking Assessment for June 28, 2025

**1. Historical Trends and Current Status**
- The All-In podcast remains a recognized voice in business and tech, hosted by prominent venture capitalists[1].
- As of early June 2025, Spotify's top chart positions are dominated by mainstream and celebrity-driven podcasts, including The Joe Rogan Experience, The Mel Robbins Podcast, and IMO with Michelle Obama and Craig Robinson[3][5].
- All-In is not listed in published top podcast lists for June 2025, nor mentioned as a leading competitor in recent industry summaries[3][5].

**2. Recent Announcements and Policies**
- No reported major format changes, viral episodes, or promotional campaigns have affected All-In’s exposure or ranking in the weeks leading up to June 12, 2025.
- Spotify’s expansion of video podcasting and its massive global growth have increased competition for chart positions, favoring podcasts with broader appeal or multimedia integration[3].

**3. Authoritative Sources for Verification**
- Spotify official charts: [Spotify Podcast Charts - United States](https://podcastcharts.byspotify.com/)[2]
- Industry summaries and third-party trackers: Ausha, Resonate Recordings[3][5]

**4. Limitations and Uncertainties**
- Podcast chart positions are volatile and can change weekly or daily depending on episode releases, viral moments, and algorithmic shifts[4].
- The absence of All-In from current top lists does not guarantee it cannot climb, but recent data does not support a top-20 placement.
- Measurement is limited to snapshot rankings, not a continuous average.

### Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

| Rank Range                  | Probability (%) | Rationale                                                                                                                          |
|-----------------------------|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| First through twentieth     | 10             | No evidence of All-In charting this high recently; dominated by bigger, mainstream podcasts[3][5].                                  |
| Twenty-first through fortieth| 30             | Possible but not indicated by current rankings; plausible for a popular, niche show with a strong base[3].                          |
| Forty-first through fiftieth| 25             | Reasonable given historical performance for established business podcasts not currently in the top 20[3].                            |
| Fifty-first through sixtieth| 20             | Possible if recent episodes underperform or competition increases.                                                                  |
| Sixty-first or beyond       | 15             | Less likely given the show’s continued relevance and fanbase, but possible with market shifts.                                      |

**Most likely range:** Twenty-first through fiftieth.
