## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Since 1993, Poland has maintained some of the most restrictive abortion laws in Europe. The number of legal abortions performed annually has remained very low, never exceeding 1,110 per year (e.g., in 2019), which is 30-100 times lower than rates in other European countries[1][2].
- In January 2021, a Constitutional Tribunal ruling eliminated fetal impairment as grounds for legal abortion, restricting legal abortions to cases where the mother's life or health is endangered or the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest[3][5].
- After this ruling, the rate of legal abortions dropped further, and access has become even more limited due to a "chilling effect" on healthcare providers[1][3].

## 2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- The new government led by Donald Tusk (from late 2023) campaigned on liberalizing abortion laws, including a pledge to allow abortion up to 12 weeks, but has not delivered substantive legal change as of October 2024[1][3].
- Tusk stated in August 2024 that there is no parliamentary majority for liberalization and no further legislative efforts are expected before the next election cycle, likely not before 2027[1].
- The only policy changes since 2021 have been clarifications to existing guidelines, emphasizing that mental health grounds should be treated like physical health, but not expanding eligibility for legal abortion[1].
- NGOs have stepped up support (e.g., helping women travel abroad or order abortion pills), but these abortions are not counted in official Polish statistics and do not affect the metric for legal abortions within Poland[2].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Polish government agencies (e.g., Ministry of Health) remain the official source for legal abortion statistics.
- International human rights organizations and media, such as Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, and Reuters, provide independent reporting and analysis[1][2][3][5].

## 4. Limitations or Uncertainties in Measurement

- Official statistics may undercount legal abortions due to underreporting and reluctance among doctors to perform the procedures even when legal, stemming from fear of legal repercussions[1][3].
- The number of illegal or extraterritorial abortions (e.g., women traveling abroad or obtaining abortion pills online) is believed to be much higher but is not included in the official count[2].
- The forecast hinges on political developments, specifically whether a future government achieves a parliamentary majority to liberalize abortion law. As of late 2024, this appears unlikely before at least 2027[1].

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given:
- The current law restricts legal abortion to a very narrow set of circumstances, with no imminent prospect of liberalization.
- Even if a law liberalizing abortion were passed after the next election (earliest plausible: 2027â€“2028), implementation and uptake would take time, making it improbable for the number of legal abortions to reach the 11,100 threshold in a single year before 2031.
- As of late 2024, there is no indication of imminent legislative change or surge in official legal abortions[1][2][3].

**Probability of at least one year with 11,100 or more legal abortions in Poland before 2031:**
- Extremely low (well under 5%, barring an unexpected, rapid political and legislative shift).
