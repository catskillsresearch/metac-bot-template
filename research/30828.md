# Forecasting Biden's Executive Orders: November-December 2024

To assess whether President Biden will sign 4 or more executive orders between Election Day (November 5, 2024) and January 1, 2025, I'll analyze his historical patterns and current activity.

## Current Status and Recent Activity

As of December 5, 2024, President Biden has issued one executive order since Election Day 2024:

- Executive Order on Establishing a Second Emergency Board to Investigate a Dispute Between New Jersey Transit Rail Operations and Its Locomotive Engineers Represented by the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen (signed November 21, 2024)[5]

This means Biden would need to sign at least three more executive orders in December 2024 to reach the threshold of four post-Election Day executive orders.

## Historical Patterns and Trends

President Biden has issued a total of 143 executive orders during his presidency through December 5, 2024[5]. His executive order issuance shows several notable patterns:

1. **Monthly variation**: Biden's executive order output varies significantly by month, with some months having zero and others having as many as 25 (January 2021).

2. **December patterns**: Looking at previous Decembers:
   - December 2021: 6 executive orders
   - December 2022: 2 executive orders
   - December 2023: 3 executive orders

3. **Annual average**: Biden has averaged 37 executive orders per year, which is the third-lowest average among presidents since 1981[5].

4. **Recent slowdown**: Biden did not issue any executive orders in several months of 2024, including January, May, August, and October[5].

## Factors Affecting Potential December 2024 Executive Orders

Several factors could influence Biden's executive order activity in December 2024:

1. **Lame duck period**: As Biden is in his final weeks in office, he may use executive orders to cement policy priorities before the transition.

2. **Historical precedent**: The range of 2-6 executive orders in previous Decembers suggests December 2024 could reasonably fall within this range.

3. **Recent pace**: Biden issued only one executive order in November 2024, suggesting a potentially slower pace in his final months.

4. **Administrative focus**: The administration may be focused on transition activities rather than new policy initiatives.

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

The most reliable sources for tracking executive orders include:

1. The Federal Register's presidential documents section, which officially publishes all executive orders[2][3].

2. The White House's Presidential Actions portal, which lists executive orders as they are signed[1].

3. News organizations that track presidential actions, such as Ballotpedia, which reported Biden's November 2024 executive order[5].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors create uncertainty in forecasting Biden's executive order activity:

1. **Timing flexibility**: Presidents can sign multiple executive orders in a short period if desired, making precise timing predictions difficult.

2. **Unpredictable events**: National or international developments could prompt unexpected executive actions.

3. **Reporting delays**: There can be delays between when an executive order is signed and when it is published or reported.

4. **Transition priorities**: The focus on transition to a new administration may affect the pace and nature of executive actions.

Based on historical patterns, particularly Biden's December averages (3.67 executive orders across three previous Decembers) and considering he has already issued one post-Election Day executive order, it appears plausible but not certain that he could reach the threshold of four or more executive orders in this period.
