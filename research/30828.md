# Forecasting Analysis: Will Donald Trump Win the Nobel Peace Prize Before 2029?

To forecast whether Donald Trump will win the Nobel Peace Prize before 2029, I'll analyze historical patterns, current nominations, and relevant contextual factors that may influence the outcome.

## Historical Context and Current Status

Donald Trump has been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize multiple times, with nominations in 2018, 2020, 2021, and most recently in January 2024 by Congresswoman Claudia Tenney for his role in brokering the Abraham Accords[1][5]. Additionally, in March 2025, Congressman Issa, who serves as Vice Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, nominated Trump for the prize[3].

The Abraham Accords, signed in September 2020, normalized relations between Israel, Bahrain, and the United Arab Emirates, with Morocco and Sudan later joining the agreement[1]. These accords have been highlighted as a significant diplomatic achievement, challenging the long-standing belief that Middle East peace agreements were impossible without resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict[1].

It's important to distinguish between nominations and winning the prize. While Trump has received multiple nominations, he has not yet been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize despite these nominations[2]. Being nominated is relatively accessibleâ€”qualified nominators include members of national assemblies, university professors, and previous laureates, among others.

## Comparative Analysis with Previous Winners

When comparing Trump's situation to reference cases:

**Previous U.S. Presidents who won the Nobel Peace Prize:**
- Theodore Roosevelt (1906)
- Woodrow Wilson (1919)
- Barack Obama (2009)

Trump has criticized the Nobel committee for awarding the prize to Obama early in his presidency in 2009, stating that Obama "had no idea why he got it" and suggesting the committee doesn't award the prize fairly[2]. This criticism might potentially influence the committee's perception of Trump as a candidate.

## Key Factors Affecting the Forecast

Several factors could influence Trump's chances of winning the Nobel Peace Prize before 2029:

**1. Political Developments:**
- Trump's nomination in March 2025 indicates continued support for his recognition[3].
- The long-term impact of the Abraham Accords will continue to be evaluated over the coming years.

**2. Trump's Personal Interest:**
- Reports indicate Trump has a "deep obsession" with winning the Nobel Peace Prize[2], suggesting he may continue to pursue diplomatic initiatives that could strengthen his case if he returns to a position of political influence.

**3. Committee Considerations:**
- The Norwegian Nobel Committee, appointed by Norway's parliament, makes the final decision[2].
- Historical patterns suggest the committee sometimes makes politically balanced selections over time.

**4. Competition:**
- Each year brings new peace initiatives and humanitarian efforts from global leaders and organizations that compete for the recognition.

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on the available information as of May 2025, the likelihood of Donald Trump winning the Nobel Peace Prize before 2029 appears low to moderate. While he has received multiple nominations, including recent ones in 2024 and 2025[1][3][5], several factors work against his chances:

1. Despite multiple nominations during and after his presidency (2018, 2020, 2021, 2024, 2025), he has not yet been selected as a winner[2][4].

2. His criticism of the Nobel committee may not endear him to the selection process[2].

3. The committee has historically valued sustained peace efforts and demonstrable outcomes, which may require more time to evaluate the long-term impact of initiatives like the Abraham Accords.

However, factors that could improve his chances include:

1. Continued international recognition of the significance of the Abraham Accords.

2. Potential future diplomatic initiatives if he returns to a position of influence.

3. The precedent of former U.S. presidents receiving the award, though this is relatively rare.

Given these considerations, Trump's chances of winning the Nobel Peace Prize before 2029 appear to be approximately 15-25%, representing a possible but not probable outcome. This estimate could shift significantly based on future geopolitical developments and Trump's future activities in the international arena.
