## 1. Comparison to Reference Cases

- **Historical Status:** From 1903 to 1999, the U.S. controlled the Panama Canal Zone. The 1977 Torrijos–Carter Treaties transferred full control to Panama as of December 31, 1999[2][4].
- **Post-1999 Precedent:** Since the handover, Panama has exercised exclusive de facto control. The U.S. retains no explicit legal right to intervene or reclaim control under the current Neutrality Treaty, which only guarantees the canal’s neutrality[4].
- **Past U.S. Interventions:** The last direct intervention was the 1989 invasion to depose Noriega, not to seize the canal. No U.S. administration since then has attempted to reclaim the canal.

## 2. Key Differences Affecting the Forecast

- **Political Rhetoric and Intent:** President Trump, since his 2024 election, has aggressively criticized Panama’s control, describing the 1977 agreements as a “foolish gift” and alleging undue Chinese influence. He has stated intentions to “take it back” and has not ruled out military means[1][2][4].
- **Concerns About China:** While China does not control the canal, Chinese companies operate adjacent ports and have invested in Panamanian infrastructure. U.S. officials cite this as a national security concern, heightening the risk of confrontation[1][2].
- **Recent U.S. Actions:** The U.S. Department of Defense announced in April 2025 an expanded partnership with Panama to “secure the canal and deter China.” However, no operational or administrative control by the U.S. has been established[3].
- **Legal and Diplomatic Barriers:** The Neutrality Treaty provides no clear legal mechanism for U.S. intervention or takeover, and any such move would be internationally controversial and likely resisted by Panama and the broader region[4].
- **Regional and Economic Risks:** Significant U.S. threats or actions against Panama could destabilize trade, damage U.S.-Latin American relations, and provoke wider backlash[2][4].

## 3. Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

- **Baseline Probability (pre-2024):** Extremely low (<1%), as there was no credible pathway or intent for U.S. seizure.
- **Post-2024 Adjustment:** Given Trump’s escalatory rhetoric, new security cooperation, and heightened U.S.-China rivalry, the probability increases but remains low, as there is no operational movement toward de facto control[1][2][3][4].
- **Risks/Triggers:** The forecast would change if:
  - The U.S. Congress or President issues orders and deploys forces to the canal region.
  - Panama’s government collapses or requests U.S. intervention.
  - Major crisis involving Chinese interests and U.S. security is invoked as justification.
- **Current Probabilistic Estimate (as of April 24, 2025):**
  - **Chance U.S. takes de facto control before Jan 21, 2029:** 5–10%
    - This reflects elevated risk relative to the post-1999 baseline, but remains low due to legal, diplomatic, and practical constraints.
    - There is no current evidence of U.S. operational or administrative control, nor clear indications that Panama would agree to a transfer.

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- **Political volatility:** U.S. domestic politics may change, potentially reducing or increasing the risk.
- **Regional dynamics:** Panamanian and regional responses are unpredictable; international pressure could deter U.S. action.
- **Measurement:** The assessment is based on available statements, treaties, and observable deployments, but unpublicized planning or covert action cannot be ruled out.
- **Resolution criteria:** A “Yes” requires observable de facto U.S. control, not mere rhetoric or threats.
