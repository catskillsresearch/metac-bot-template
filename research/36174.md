Based on historical weather data for Warsaw, Poland, it is highly unlikely that temperatures will reach 70°F (21.1°C) between March 19 and April 1, 2025.

## Historical Weather Trends for Warsaw in March

The typical temperature range for Warsaw in March shows that reaching 70°F would be exceptionally rare:

- Daily high temperatures in Warsaw during March typically range from 38°F (early March) to 50°F (late March), rarely exceeding 61°F[5]
- The average high temperature in March is approximately 6.8°C (44.2°F)[3]
- Nighttime temperatures average around -1°C (30.2°F)[3][4]

Historical data indicates that March in Warsaw is characterized by cold weather with temperatures between 1°C and 7°C (33°F and 44°F), necessitating warm clothing[2]. The month typically experiences gradual warming as it progresses, but even late March temperatures remain well below the 70°F threshold.

## Precipitation and Other Weather Factors

March in Warsaw typically includes:
- 13 days with some rainfall and an average monthly rainfall of 27mm[4]
- 3 to 8 days of rain throughout the month[2]
- Some snowfall can be expected[2]
- Approximately 4 hours of sunshine per day (30% of daylight hours)[4]

These precipitation patterns and limited sunshine further suggest conditions that are not conducive to unusually high temperatures.

## Verification Sources

For verification of actual temperatures during the specified period, the following sources would be authoritative:

1. Iowa Environmental Mesonet (as specified in the resolution criteria)
2. Polish Institute of Meteorology and Water Management (IMGW)
3. AccuWeather historical data for Warsaw[1]
4. Weather Atlas historical records for Poland[3]

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors create uncertainty in this forecast:

1. **Climate variability**: While historical averages provide guidance, weather can occasionally deviate significantly from normal patterns
2. **Climate change impacts**: Warming trends may increase the likelihood of temperature extremes, though the magnitude remains uncertain for specific short-term periods
3. **Measurement specificity**: The resolution criteria specifically references Warsaw airport (EPWA) measurements, which may differ slightly from city center temperatures
4. **Short-term forecasting limitations**: Precise temperature predictions beyond 7-10 days have reduced reliability

Based on all available historical data, temperatures reaching 70°F in Warsaw between March 19-31, 2025 would represent a significant anomaly, as March temperatures rarely exceed 61°F in this region.
