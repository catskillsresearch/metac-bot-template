# Will Warsaw, Poland Reach 70°F Before April 1, 2025?

Based on historical weather data and forecasts available as of March 19, 2025, it is highly unlikely that Warsaw, Poland will experience temperatures reaching 70°F (approximately 21.1°C) before April 1, 2025.

## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

Historical weather data for Warsaw in March shows consistently cold temperatures:

- The typical daytime maximum temperatures in Warsaw during March range around 6°C (42.8°F)[4][5]
- The historical high temperature for March in Warsaw is approximately 6.8°C (44.2°F)[3]
- Nighttime temperatures in March typically drop to around -1°C (30.2°F)[3][5]

March in Warsaw is characterized as "very cold," requiring warm clothing[2]. The temperature range typically falls between 1°C and 7°C (33°F and 44°F), which is substantially below the 70°F (21.1°C) threshold specified in the question[2].

## Recent Weather Patterns

Weather patterns for Warsaw in March 2025 are expected to follow historical trends:

- Approximately 13 days with some rainfall are expected during the month[4][5]
- The average monthly rainfall is around 27mm[4][5]
- Some snowfall is anticipated during March[2]
- There are typically only 4 hours of sunshine per day (about 30% of daylight hours)[4][5]

These conditions are not conducive to temperatures reaching as high as 70°F, especially considering that March 2025 is already partially complete as of the knowledge cutoff date (March 19, 2025).

## Verification Sources

The most authoritative sources for verifying Warsaw's temperature include:

- The Iowa Environmental Mesonet (specified in the resolution criteria)
- Weather data from the University of East Anglia, the Met Office, and the Netherlands Meteorological Institute, which are cited as sources for the long-term weather averages[4][5]
- AccuWeather's historical data and forecasts for Warsaw[1]

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors could affect the accuracy of this forecast:

- Extreme weather events or unusual climate patterns could potentially cause temperature anomalies
- Climate change may be causing gradual shifts in seasonal temperature patterns
- Short-term weather forecasts become less reliable beyond 7-10 days
- The resolution specifically refers to measurements at Warsaw airport (EPWA), which may differ slightly from city center temperatures

However, even considering these uncertainties, the historical data strongly suggests that temperatures reaching 70°F in Warsaw before April 1, 2025, would represent an extreme anomaly far outside normal ranges for that time of year.

## Conclusion

Based on all available historical data and forecasts as of March 19, 2025, it is highly improbable that Warsaw, Poland will experience temperatures reaching 70°F before April 1, 2025. The typical maximum temperatures for March in Warsaw are approximately 25-30°F lower than the specified threshold.
