## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Alabama experienced widespread drought through much of 2024, but conditions began to improve in December due to increased rainfall[2][4].
- By mid-February 2025, drought conditions had notably improved across much of the state, especially in the interior and northern regions. Severe (D2) drought was eliminated in parts of Alabama, according to the National Centers for Environmental Information and regional climate reports[2][4].
- Beneficial rain events in February 2025 provided further relief, though some drought persisted, particularly in southern Alabama[3][4].
- The latest Drought Monitor map (late February 2025) shows significant improvement in Alabama’s drought status, with only limited areas still experiencing drought[4].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- The Alabama Office of Water Resources (OWR) issues drought declarations based on current conditions and short-term forecasts, but as of the latest updates, the trend has been toward improvement, not escalation[1].
- No major new policies or emergency declarations have been announced as of February 2025 that would significantly alter the drought status or population affected.

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The U.S. Drought Monitor, accessible via drought.gov, is the official source for population-in-drought metrics and will be used for resolution[4].
- The Alabama Office of Water Resources provides state-level drought declarations and updates[1].
- NOAA’s National Centers for Environmental Information and regional climate extension services provide monthly and weekly updates on drought conditions[2][4][5].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- The Drought Monitor’s population estimates are based on census data overlaid with drought-affected areas, so rapid changes in drought status may not be immediately reflected in population figures.
- While northern and interior Alabama have improved, southern Alabama remains at risk for drought persistence or expansion, especially if the forecasted warmer and drier conditions continue[5].
- The exact population affected on March 28, 2025, will depend on short-term weather patterns in March, which are inherently uncertain.

## Forecast Assessment

Given the substantial improvement in drought conditions across much of Alabama by late February 2025, especially in the more populous northern and central regions, and the absence of severe drought in those areas, it is unlikely that 1.5 million or more Alabama residents will be living in drought on March 28, 2025. However, if drought expands in the south or conditions worsen unexpectedly, this could change, but current trends suggest a lower risk of exceeding the 1.5 million threshold.
