### Key Trends and Current Status

- **GOP Trifecta and Reconciliation Use:** Republicans control the presidency and both chambers of Congress (53 Senate seats), enabling use of the reconciliation process to sidestep filibusters for budget-related legislation[1][2][3].
- **Budget Resolution Passed:** As of late April 2025, the House has passed a budget resolution initiating reconciliation, with committee markups set for late April and early May[2][3][4].
- **Ambitious, Uncertain Timeline:** Senior GOP leaders, especially Speaker Mike Johnson, have targeted Memorial Day (late May) for a House vote on a major reconciliation package. However, there is widespread skepticism about meeting this goal due to unresolved intra-party disputes, particularly over the scale of spending cuts and the content of tax and safety-net reforms[1][3][4].
- **Committee Deadlines:** The nonbinding May 9 deadline for committees to report their pieces of the bill is at risk of slippage, especially for the Energy & Commerce and Ways & Means Committees, which are central to the package[3][4].

### Recent Announcements and Policies

- **Key Legislative Priorities:** The reconciliation bill is expected to address Trump’s 2017 tax cuts, border security, and energy permitting, all of which face procedural hurdles (e.g., Byrd Rule budget constraints) and political debate within the GOP caucus[1][3].
- **Debt Ceiling Impact:** If the government hits its borrowing limit sooner than expected (potentially as early as late May or June), legislative urgency could increase, but this would require rapid intra-party agreement, which currently appears elusive[3].

### Probabilistic Assessment

| 2025 Period             | Probability Rationale                                                                                      |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Before July             | Low: Committee markups and intra-party disputes make a June signature unlikely[1][3][4].                 |
| July - August           | Moderate: If the House passes a bill in June, the Senate and conference process could push signature into summer, but disputes may persist. |
| September - October     | High: Historical precedent and ongoing disputes point to this window as most likely for a completed, signed reconciliation bill.             |
| November - December     | Moderate: If intra-GOP disputes and Senate amendments delay final passage, could slip into year-end.       |
| Not in 2025             | Low: GOP leadership is highly motivated to enact policy before 2026, especially with tax cuts expiring.    |

**Most Likely Outcome:**  
Based on current progress, historical timelines, and unresolved disputes, the signing of a reconciliation bill by President Trump is most probable in **September - October 2025**[1][3][4]. Early passage (before July) is highly unlikely unless there is a dramatic breakthrough in party negotiations.

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Official Congressional Records (House and Senate roll calls)
- White House press releases on bill signings
- Congressional Budget Office updates

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- The nonbinding nature of internal deadlines means slippage is possible.
- Unpredictable events (e.g., economic shocks, a sudden debt ceiling crisis) could accelerate or delay proceedings.
- Internal GOP disagreements may result in significant changes to the bill's content or timeline[1][3].
