## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- When a single party holds the presidency and both chambers of Congress but lacks a 60-vote Senate majority, the budget reconciliation process is typically used to advance major legislative priorities, as it allows passage with a simple majority and is immune to filibuster[5].
- In 2025, Republicans are using reconciliation to pursue priorities like extending the 2017 Trump tax cuts, with many provisions expiring at year’s end. The House passed a reconciliation bill on May 22, 2025[1].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- House leadership, including Speaker Mike Johnson and Ways & Means Chair Jason Smith, have publicly targeted having the bill on President Trump’s desk by July 4, although this is acknowledged as ambitious[5].
- Senate leaders have not committed to this date but aim to conclude the process by mid-summer, before the August recess. The reconciliation instructions from the budget resolution expire on September 30, so this serves as a practical deadline[5].
- The House process encountered delays and narrowly advanced from committee, indicating ongoing challenges that could slow the process further[4].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- National Conference of State Legislatures documents the May 22 House passage of the reconciliation bill[1].
- Cherry Bekaert’s tax policy analysis tracks leadership timelines and the procedural deadlines[5].
- Thomson Reuters reports on House committee setbacks and subsequent progress, illustrating the legislative headwinds faced[4].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- The Senate may amend or delay the bill, especially if provisions violate the Byrd Rule or trigger intra-party dissent.
- The reconciliation process, while streamlined, still faces potential procedural hurdles and political negotiations that can extend timelines.
- Leadership deadlines are often missed, but the expiration of reconciliation instructions on September 30, 2025, and the looming expiration of tax cuts on December 31, increase time pressure[5].

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Based on current progress (House passage in May), leadership’s stated goals, and historical precedent—but allowing for likely Senate delays—the **most likely period for President Trump to sign a reconciliation bill into law is July–August 2025**.

| Option                  | Probability Assessment |
|-------------------------|-----------------------|
| Before July             | Low                   |
| July - August           | Most Likely           |
| September - October     | Possible              |
| November - December     | Less Likely           |
| Not in 2025             | Unlikely              |
