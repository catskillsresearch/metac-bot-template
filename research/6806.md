## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of 2021, successful lab-grown organ transplants in humans were limited to relatively simple tissues (e.g., bladders, vaginas, urethras). No full-scale complex vital organ (heart, liver, lung, kidney) had been transplanted into a human[1].
- By 2025, research on organoids—miniaturized, simplified versions of organs grown from stem cells—had advanced rapidly. Recent breakthroughs include the development of "multi-zonal" human liver organoids capable of mimicking key human liver functions and, when transplanted into rodents, significantly improving survival rates after liver injury[4].
- Animal studies have demonstrated feasibility for more complex organs: lab-grown lungs in pigs and functional "mini-kidneys" in mice[1].
- Investment and regulatory momentum have increased, with biotech startups securing substantial funding to accelerate organoid research and federal agencies signaling support for alternatives to animal testing[2].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- In April 2025, researchers reported a significant advance with multi-zonal liver organoids that doubled survival in rodent models, and demonstrated the ability to mass-produce these organoids, potentially paving the way for future clinical trials in humans[4].
- Biotech companies are increasingly focused on creating human organoids for drug testing and disease modeling, supported by sizable private investment and a policy shift from agencies like the FDA and NIH toward reducing animal testing[2].
- New concepts, such as growing entire "bodyoids" (lab-grown human bodies lacking brains) as a potential organ source, are being explored at leading research institutions, reflecting a surge in technical ambition and the pursuit of scalable solutions[5].

## Key Differences from Reference Cases

- The transition from animal models to human application remains a major challenge. While animal studies show significant promise, no complex, fully functional lab-grown vital organ has been transplanted into a human as of mid-2025[1][4].
- The technical complexity of vascularization, immune compatibility, and function in complex organs remains a central barrier, but research is advancing rapidly, driven by improved stem cell techniques and organoid engineering[1][3][4].
- Regulatory and ethical challenges may introduce delays even after technical feasibility is demonstrated.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- No reported clinical trials or successful human transplants of full lab-grown vital organs as of May 2025.
- While investment and technical advances are accelerating, the leap from animal success to human clinical use typically requires years of development and rigorous testing.
- Uncertainties remain regarding large-scale manufacturing, immune rejection, and long-term functionality post-transplant.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the pace of progress, increased funding, and new technical approaches, it appears moderately probable that at least one human will successfully receive a lab-grown complex vital organ (heart, liver, kidney, or lung) by 2035, meeting the criteria of 100 days survival and substantial health benefit. The probability is likely above 50% but well short of certainty, as key technical and regulatory hurdles remain.
