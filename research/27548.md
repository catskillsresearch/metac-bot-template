### Key Factual Information Relevant to Forecasting CDC Mpox Risk Assessment

**1. Current CDC Risk Assessment (as of July 8, 2024)**
- The CDC’s most recent qualitative analysis rates the risk to the general US population as "VERY LOW." The CDC is monitoring developments in Africa and preparing to update this assessment, but has not indicated any imminent change[1].

**2. Status of Mpox in the United States**
- As of August 22, 2024, there are no known cases of clade I mpox in the United States. The US government states the risk to most Americans from clade I mpox is very low, and the country is well-prepared to detect and contain any cases that might occur domestically[1].
- Surveillance (including wastewater testing) has only detected clade IIb mpox in the US as of late May 2024[5].

**3. CDC and Federal Announcements**
- The CDC’s Health Alert Network (August 7, 2024) reiterates that the risk of clade I mpox spreading to the US is very low. Recommendations focus on travelers and at-risk groups, not the general public[2].
- The US response includes robust diagnostic capacity and vaccination recommendations for at-risk populations, but no indication of elevated risk for the general public[1][2].

**4. Scenario-Based Risk Assessments**
- The Johns Hopkins Center for Outbreak Response Innovation (June 2024) places the risk to the general public as "Low" even in the event of a summer surge, with higher risk only to specific subpopulations (e.g., MSM, sex workers, healthcare workers)[5].

**5. Definitions and Thresholds**
- For the CDC to assess risk as "High" or "Very High," there must be widespread exposure, high infectiousness, or very low immunity in the general population. Current data do not support these conditions[1][2][5].

**6. International Context**
- The WHO declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern due to clade I mpox in Africa, but this has not translated into increased risk domestically, according to all available CDC and US government statements[1][2].

### Limitations and Uncertainties
- The CDC is updating its risk assessment in response to developments in Africa, but as of August 23, 2024, there is no evidence of domestic transmission or increased risk to the US general public.
- All authoritative sources indicate the risk remains low, and there is no indication that the CDC will assess the risk as exceeding "High" before October 1, 2024.

### Authoritative Sources for Verification
- CDC official risk assessments and Health Alert Network updates[1][2].
- Scenario-based risk assessments from Johns Hopkins[5].
- US government press releases and CDC surveillance data[1][2][5].
