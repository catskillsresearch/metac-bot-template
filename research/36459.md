# Will the 2017 TCJA Individual Tax Cuts Be Extended Using a "Current Policy" Baseline?

As of April 10, 2025, the extension of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) individual tax provisions is a major focus in Congress, with significant developments regarding the potential use of a "current policy" baseline in Senate reconciliation.

## Current Status of TCJA Extension Efforts

The TCJA's individual tax provisions are scheduled to expire at the end of 2025. If Congress takes no action, several key provisions will revert to pre-2017 levels, including:

1. Tax brackets would increase for most taxpayers
2. The standard deduction would return to pre-TCJA levels (with inflation adjustments)
3. Child tax credits would be reduced
4. Estate tax exemptions would decrease

Republicans in Congress are actively working to extend these provisions, with the Senate taking a particularly notable approach through its budget resolution process.

## Senate's "Current Policy" Baseline Approach

The Senate's budget resolution, introduced in early April 2025, explicitly seeks to make permanent the individual tax cuts from the TCJA that are set to expire at the end of 2025[5]. Critically, this resolution employs a "current policy" baseline accounting method, which:

- Treats the estimated $3.8 trillion cost of extending the TCJA tax cuts as having no budgetary impact
- Results in an official deficit of only $1.5 trillion under the Senate resolution[5]
- Effectively allows for additional tax cuts beyond the TCJA extension[4]

This approach represents a significant departure from traditional reconciliation bills, which have historically used a "current law" baseline that would count the full cost of extending expiring provisions[5].

## House vs. Senate Budget Proposals

There are notable differences between the House and Senate approaches:

- The House's budget resolution authorizes $4.5 trillion in tax cuts over ten years, which would mostly cover the estimated $4.6 trillion cost of extending TCJA[4]
- The Senate's resolution would increase deficits by $5.3 trillion, higher than the House proposal[5]
- The Senate's use of the current-policy baseline is the key distinction, as it treats the $3.8 trillion TCJA extension as having zero cost, with the $1.5 trillion representing additional tax cuts beyond TCJA's extension[4][5]

For the reconciliation process to move forward, both chambers must pass identical budget proposals before congressional tax writing committees can proceed with the actual tax legislation[5].

## Political Dynamics and Challenges

Several political factors complicate the path forward:

1. **House Republican Resistance**: Some deficit-minded House Republicans may resist the Senate's approach due to the larger deficit implications[5].

2. **Narrow Margins**: With only a handful of votes to spare in both chambers, Republicans face challenges finding a bill with enough support to pass in both the House and Senate[4].

3. **Competing Priorities**: Some House Republicans insist on program cuts (like Medicaid) to offset tax cuts, while others oppose substantial program reductions[4].

## Potential Outcomes

Based on current developments, several scenarios remain possible:

1. **Long-term Extension**: If Republicans maintain control of Congress after the 2024 election, they could use reconciliation to extend the TCJA with the current policy baseline approach[2].

2. **Short-term Extension**: If government remains divided, lawmakers might extend the TCJA tax breaks by one or two years to allow more time for negotiations[2].

3. **Bipartisan Agreement**: Congress could potentially reach a bipartisan agreement addressing expiring provisions in a long-term or permanent way, similar to what happened with the Bush tax cuts in 2012[2].

4. **Expiration**: Though unlikely for all provisions, if Congress fails to act, the TCJA provisions would expire and revert to pre-2017 levels[2].

## Conclusion

As of April 10, 2025, the Senate's budget resolution explicitly seeks to use a "current policy" baseline to extend the TCJA individual tax cuts permanently. While this approach has advanced in the Senate, it still faces potential challenges in the House and must navigate the complex reconciliation process. The ultimate outcome will depend on political negotiations, procedural rulings, and potential compromises between the chambers in the coming months.
