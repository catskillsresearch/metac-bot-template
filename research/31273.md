# Forecasting Analysis: New Major Armed Conflicts in 2025

The early 2020s have witnessed a significant increase in global armed conflicts, with conflict-related fatalities reaching levels not seen since the early 1990s. This analysis examines available data to forecast whether a new war or substantial escalation will reach the 5,000 fatality threshold in 2025.

## Current Conflict Landscape

### Global Conflict Trends

The world has experienced a dramatic surge in armed conflicts in recent years. Data from the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (ACLED) shows that conflict-related deaths increased by 30% from 2023 to 2024, with at least 233,597 people killed in conflicts during 2024[1]. This represents a continuation of an alarming trend, as the number of violent incidents has nearly doubled over the past five years[1].

As of early 2025, several major armed conflicts are ongoing, with six conflicts having caused at least 10,000 direct, violent deaths in the previous year:

1. Myanmar conflict: 5,030 fatalities recorded in early 2025[5]
2. Middle East conflicts (Israel/Palestine/Lebanon/Syria/Iraq/Iran/Yemen): 7,355 fatalities in early 2025[5]
3. Sahel region insurgencies: 7,067 fatalities in early 2025[5]
4. Sudan/South Sudan conflict: 9,089 fatalities in early 2025[5]
5. Russia-Ukraine war: 29,956 fatalities in early 2025[5]
6. Ethiopia conflict: 1,624 fatalities in early 2025[5]

The ACLED Conflict Index for July 2024 indicated that 1 in 7 people worldwide were exposed to conflict in 2024, with 50 countries experiencing extreme, high, or turbulent levels of conflict[4]. The index recorded over 165,273 political violence events worldwide from July 2023 to June 2024, marking a 15% increase from the previous 12-month period[4].

### Potential Escalation Points

Several factors suggest potential for new conflicts or substantial escalations in 2025:

1. **Spillover from existing conflicts**: The Afghanistan-Pakistan skirmishes (2024-present) are listed as an ongoing conflict, suggesting a relatively new conflict that could potentially escalate[5].

2. **Regional tensions**: The Middle East conflict zone has seen dramatic escalation, with violence in Lebanon increasing by 958% in 2024 as Israel staged a large-scale military intervention[1]. This regional instability could spark new conflicts or substantial escalations in 2025.

3. **Russia's ongoing expansion**: Violence in Russia increased by 349% in 2024 amid its invasion of Ukraine[1], potentially creating conditions for new conflict fronts or substantial escalations.

4. **Sudan's civil war**: The conflict in Sudan caused approximately 14,000 civilian deaths in 2024[3] and has already resulted in 9,089 fatalities in early 2025[5], indicating significant potential for further escalation or regional spillover.

## Comparative Analysis

To assess the likelihood of a new conflict or substantial escalation reaching 5,000 deaths in 2025, we can examine recent precedents:

1. **New conflict emergence rate**: The data indicates that new conflicts have continued to emerge, such as the Afghanistan-Pakistan skirmishes that began in 2024[5].

2. **Escalation patterns**: The Middle East conflict zone saw a 958% increase in violence in Lebanon in 2024[1], demonstrating how quickly existing conflicts can escalate or spread to new frontlines.

3. **Fatality thresholds**: Several ongoing conflicts have already surpassed the 5,000 fatality threshold in early 2025, including Myanmar (5,030), Middle East conflicts (7,355), Sahel region (7,067), Sudan/South Sudan (9,089), and Russia-Ukraine (29,956)[5].

## Key Factors Affecting the Forecast

1. **Global conflict trend**: The overall trend shows a 15% increase in political violence incidents from July 2023 to June 2024[4] and a 30% increase in conflict-related deaths from 2023 to 2024[1], suggesting a continuing upward trajectory in global conflict.

2. **Regional instability**: Multiple regions show high potential for new conflicts or escalations, particularly the Middle East, South Asia, and Africa.

3. **Historical precedent**: The data from 2024 shows that several conflicts can rapidly escalate and cross the 5,000 fatality threshold within a year.

4. **Current conflict intensity**: Six major conflicts are already causing significant fatalities in early 2025, increasing the risk of spillover or new fronts emerging.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors limit the precision of this forecast:

1. **Data reliability**: Conflict death tolls are often contested and difficult to verify, especially in active conflict zones.

2. **Temporal limitations**: The data available for 2025 is partial and may not reflect full-year trends.

3. **Definitional challenges**: The distinction between "new conflicts" and "substantial escalations" can be ambiguous, particularly when conflicts involve multiple parties or fronts.

4. **Reporting delays**: There may be significant delays in reporting fatalities from remote or restricted conflict zones.

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on the available data, there appears to be a high probability that a new war or substantial escalation to a previous war will kill at least 5,000 people in 2025. This assessment is supported by:

1. The continuing upward trend in global conflict fatalities (30% increase from 2023 to 2024)[1]
2. The emergence of new conflicts in 2024 (e.g., Afghanistan-Pakistan skirmishes)[5]
3. Multiple regions showing potential for new or escalating conflicts
4. The rapid escalation patterns observed in 2024, particularly in Lebanon (958% increase)[1]

Given these factors, and considering that we are still early in 2
