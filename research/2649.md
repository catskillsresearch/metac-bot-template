**1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status (as of March 2019)**

- The Square Kilometre Array (SKA) is an ambitious, multinational radio telescope project, aiming for unprecedented sensitivity and resolution.
- As of March 2019, the Square Kilometre Array Observatory (SKAO) had just been established (March 12, 2019) by seven founding countries (Australia, China, Italy, Netherlands, Portugal, South Africa, UK), with others expected to join[3][5].
- The SKA was planned in two phases:
  - SKA1 (~10% of total capability) by 2023.
  - SKA2 (full array) by 2030, reaching the full scientific scope as outlined in the original design.
- Project headquarters established at Jodrell Bank, UK (opened July 2019)[3].
- Initial construction contracts were scheduled for late 2020[3].
- Site selection (South Africa and Australia) and environmental approvals had recently progressed, enabling the start of construction planning[4].

**2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric**

- March 2019: Establishment of SKAO marks a transition from planning to organizational execution[3][5].
- Environmental and governmental approvals in South Africa and Australia were progressing, enabling future construction[4].
- As of 2019, no major funding or political crises had been reported, but full financial commitment from all partners remained a work in progress[3][5].

**3. Authoritative Sources for Verification**

- Official SKA and SKAO documentation and announcements[3][5]
- Government agencies involved in science infrastructure (e.g., South African DST, Australian Government)[4][5]
- Peer-reviewed and conference literature (e.g., SPIE proceedings)[2]

**4. Limitations and Uncertainties in Measurement**

- Large international science projects (e.g., ALMA, JWST, LHC) historically experience significant delays during transition from design to construction, often due to:
  - International coordination challenges
  - Funding gaps or slowdowns
  - Technical or engineering surprises
  - Political changes in member countries
- As of March 2019, SKA had not yet awarded major construction contracts—a phase that often reveals hidden obstacles.
- The ambitious technical goals and multi-country governance increase schedule risk.
- The reference plan (SKA2 completion by 2030) left little margin for delay under typical large-project uncertainty, especially since only the organizational phase was just beginning.

**Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment (as of March 2019)**

- Reference case: Most megascience projects of similar scope and international complexity experience 2–5 year delays from initial full-scope targets.
- Given SKA's status as of March 2019—governing body just established, contracts not yet awarded, multi-phase technical ramp-up—there is a significant risk of delay.
- While the official plan called for SKA2 completion by 2030, the historical trend and project status suggest a substantial chance of missing the 2031 threshold.

**Estimated Probability (as of March 2019):**
- Probability SKA (including SKA2) operational before 2031: **~35–50%**
  - Rationale: While the schedule was theoretically feasible, the combination of early-stage status, international complexity, and the pattern of delays in similar projects made on-time completion less likely than not.

**Summary Table: Reference vs. SKA as of March 2019**

| Factor                | Reference Projects (e.g., ALMA, JWST) | SKA (2019) Status           | Impact on Forecast        |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------|
| Construction Start    | Contracts awarded, site prep begun     | Contracts not yet awarded   | Negative (delay risk)    |
| International Scope   | Large, but fewer hosts                 | Multiple hosts (AU, SA)     | Negative (complexity)    |
| Funding Secured       | Often incomplete at start              | Not fully locked            | Negative (uncertainty)   |
| Technical Ambition    | High, but incremental                  | Very high, phased           | Negative (risk)          |

**Key Limitation:** If major partners withdrew or funding was delayed, the operational date could slip well beyond 2031. Conversely, exceptional international cooperation could keep the project on schedule, but this was historically rare.
