## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Zillow’s October 2024 rent report highlights that rent growth has slowed significantly, with high levels of concessions and a continued trend of slow year-over-year rent growth expected into November 2024[2].
- The report specifically notes that “November will likely show continued high levels of concessions and slow year-over-year rent growth,” indicating that the market is not experiencing rapid increases in rent at this time[2].

## Recent Announcements or Policies

- There are no notable recent policy changes or announcements affecting the Orlando rental market mentioned in the available sources.
- The broader context is that the rental market in many U.S. cities, including Orlando, has cooled compared to the rapid increases seen in previous years, with increased supply and more incentives for renters[2].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The definitive source for the year-over-year rent increase figure is Zillow’s Observed Rent Index (ZORI), available on the Zillow Housing Data page. The CSV file for “ZORI (Smoothed): All Homes Plus Multifamily Time Series” with “Metro & U.S.” geography and “Orlando, FL” as the region should be used for precise measurement, as per the resolution criteria.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- The most recent data available as of the knowledge cutoff is for October 2024. The November 2024 data will be published after the cutoff date, so the exact year-over-year figure for November 2024 is not yet available.
- The trend of slowing rent growth and increased concessions suggests that the year-over-year increase is likely to be modest, and possibly below 1.0%, but this cannot be confirmed until the November 2024 data is released[2].
- If the chart and CSV differ, the CSV takes precedence for resolution.

## Summary

Based on the latest available information, Zillow’s October 2024 rent report indicates a continued slowdown in year-over-year rent growth for Orlando, FL, with expectations for November 2024 to remain slow. While the exact figure for November 2024 is not yet published, the prevailing trend makes it less likely that the year-over-year increase will reach or exceed 1.0%. The final resolution depends on the official ZORI data for November 2024, which will be available after the knowledge cutoff.
