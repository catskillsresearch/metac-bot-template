## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- AI has dramatically improved the speed and accuracy of short- and medium-term weather forecasts, with models like Microsoft’s Aurora and Cambridge’s Aardvark Weather outperforming traditional physics-based systems[1][2][5].
- These AI models deliver local and global forecasts in minutes rather than hours, and with reduced computational requirements[5].
- Despite these advances, the accuracy of weather forecasts still drops significantly beyond 10–14 days, with long-range (months ahead) local forecasting remaining highly uncertain[1][4].
- AI models currently excel at predicting everyday weather but have limited skill with rare/extreme events and long-term local patterns[3].

## Recent Announcements and Developments

- The Aardvark Weather system, announced in March 2025, is a fully AI-driven model capable of replacing the entire traditional forecasting pipeline and generating both global and local forecasts rapidly[5].
- Microsoft’s Aurora, announced in May 2025, is a large AI foundation model that sets new standards for speed and efficiency in weather and environmental forecasting[2].
- Leading meteorological agencies (e.g., ECMWF) are deploying hybrid AI-physics models for medium-range forecasts, but as of 2025, none claim accurate 6-month local predictions[5].
- Researchers and practitioners acknowledge that, while progress is rapid, AI models remain limited in long-range and extreme event prediction[3].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Peer-reviewed publications (e.g., Nature, 2025) on Aardvark Weather[5].
- Official announcements from Microsoft (Aurora)[2].
- Yale Environment 360 and PopSci coverage of AI weather forecasting breakthroughs[1][4].
- University of California and Alan Turing Institute analyses on the limits of AI weather prediction[3][5].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- The chaotic nature of the atmosphere imposes fundamental limits to deterministic forecasting, particularly for local events months in advance.
- While AI is making seasonal forecasts more skillful, achieving a 6-month local forecast with the required accuracy likely requires a fundamental breakthrough not yet on the horizon[3][4].
- Forecast skill for 6-month local weather remains much lower than 7-day forecasts, even with state-of-the-art AI.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Based on the current trajectory of AI weather forecasting, the probability that an AI model meeting all specified criteria (accurate 6-month local forecasts exceeding 2022 7-day local forecast skill, peer-reviewed, real-world tested) will be developed and officially recognized before 2030 is **very low**. Barring an unforeseen scientific breakthrough, the question is most likely to resolve **No**.
