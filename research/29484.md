## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- **FDA Approval**: Moxidectin was approved by the US FDA in 2018 for the treatment of onchocerciasis in individuals aged 12 and older, marking the first new drug approval for this disease in over 20 years[1].
- **WHO Recommendations**: As of September 2024, the WHO continues to recommend annual ivermectin treatments for onchocerciasis, while recognizing moxidectin as a safe and effective alternative with potential advantages, such as longer efficacy and greater reduction in skin microfilariae[2].
- **Prequalification Status**: WHO prequalification (PQ) is a prerequisite for many countries to approve and procure medicines. As of November 1, 2024, moxidectin has not been added to the WHO PQ list for onchocerciasis[2].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- **Additional Clinical Trials Required**: The WHO has unexpectedly required extensive extra clinical trials for moxidectin, which has delayed the PQ process and introduced significant uncertainty about the timeline for approval[1].
- **Funding for PQ Process**: In June 2024, GiveWell granted $637,549 to Medicines Development for Global Health (MDGH) to support completion of the WHO PQ process for moxidectin, indicating ongoing but incomplete efforts[1].
- **Forecasts**: GiveWell has internally forecasted an 80% likelihood of moxidectin being prequalified before 2027, but not specifically before 2025[1].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- **WHO Prequalification List**: The official WHO PQ list and announcements are the definitive sources for confirming PQ status[2].
- **MDGH and GiveWell Updates**: Updates from MDGH and GiveWell provide insight into the progress and challenges of the PQ process[1].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- **Unpredictable Regulatory Timelines**: The requirement for additional clinical trials by WHO has introduced delays and uncertainty, making it difficult to predict the exact timing of PQ approval[1].
- **No Public Announcement**: As of November 1, 2024, there is no public announcement or credible report confirming that moxidectin has achieved WHO PQ for onchocerciasis.

## Conclusion

Based on all available evidence as of November 1, 2024, there is no indication that the World Health Organization will prequalify moxidectin for onchocerciasis before January 1, 2025. The process has encountered unexpected delays, and authoritative forecasts suggest PQ is more likely to occur after 2025.
