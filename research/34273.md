## Historical Trends and Current Status
- **TikTok Ban**: The US Supreme Court upheld a law that could ban TikTok in the US unless it is sold to a new owner by January 19, 2025[1][2]. This law was passed due to concerns about national security and data collection by ByteDance, TikTok's parent company[1][3].
- **Current Availability**: As of January 18-19, 2025, TikTok temporarily stopped functioning in the US and was removed from app stores[3].

## Recent Announcements/Policies
- **Executive Order**: President Trump issued an executive order to delay the ban for 75 days, potentially giving TikTok more time to find a buyer or resolve its legal status[1].
- **Legal Challenges**: TikTok and its users argued that the ban violates First Amendment rights, but the Supreme Court upheld the law[1][2].

## Authoritative Sources
- NYU Law Professor Christopher Jon Sprigman and MSU experts like Nancy Costello are available to comment on legal aspects[1][2].
- Axios and CBS News provide updates on the legal timeline and implications[3].

## Limitations or Uncertainties
- **Legal Uncertainty**: The effectiveness of President Trump's executive order in overriding a federal law is uncertain, as constitutional law experts note that executive orders cannot override federal laws[1].
- **Sale or Restructuring**: TikTok's availability depends on whether it can be sold to a US company or restructured to comply with the law before April 5, 2025[1][3].

Given these factors, the possibility of TikTok becoming available again before April 5, 2025, hinges on legal developments and any potential sale or restructuring of the company.
