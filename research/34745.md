# Forecast Analysis: Pedro Sánchez's Premiership Through 2025

Pedro Sánchez currently serves as the Prime Minister of Spain, having secured his third term in office on November 16, 2023, following a snap general election in July of that year[1]. To assess whether he will remain in this position through December 31, 2025, I'll analyze his current political standing, recent activities, and the stability of his government.

## Current Political Position

Sánchez leads a minority coalition government that depends on support from a variety of political parties:

- His government relies on the left-wing Sumar alliance and various pro-independence and regionalist parties[1]
- This political arrangement has forced him to make significant concessions to maintain power, most notably the controversial amnesty law for Catalan separatists[5]
- Despite facing protests over these concessions, Sánchez has maintained his governing coalition[1]

Sánchez has demonstrated remarkable political resilience, consistently finding ways to survive politically challenging situations. Political observers characterize his approach as "making virtue of necessity," taking a pragmatic stance toward the difficult political circumstances he faces[5].

## Recent Governmental Activities (2025)

As of May 2025, Sánchez remains active in his role as Prime Minister:

- In March 2025, he emphasized Spain's commitment to "strengthening the multilateral order and Europe"[2]
- On April 22, 2025, he announced that Spain would allocate 2% of GDP to security and defense, framing this as part of a broader plan for Spain's development as "one of Europe's major economic, scientific and security powers"[4]
- On April 28, 2025, he addressed a significant power outage affecting Spain, demonstrating his continued leadership during crises[3]
- He has positioned himself as a leader among EU members supporting the recognition of the State of Palestine[5]

## Stability Assessment

Several factors suggest Sánchez's position may remain stable through 2025:

1. **No scheduled elections**: No general elections are scheduled before the end of 2025, removing one potential mechanism for change in leadership

2. **High barrier for removal**: Under Spanish law, removing Sánchez would require either his resignation or a successful motion of no confidence, which demands an alternative majority - a challenging prospect in Spain's fragmented political landscape

3. **Demonstrated resilience**: Sánchez has already weathered significant political storms, including electoral setbacks in regional elections before the July 2023 general election[1]

4. **Ongoing policy initiatives**: His government continues to announce and implement major policies extending into 2025, suggesting confidence in governmental continuity[4]

However, several risk factors could threaten his position:

1. **Coalition fragility**: His government depends on support from multiple smaller parties with diverse interests, creating potential instability

2. **Public opposition**: The amnesty law and other concessions to regional parties have sparked protests[1]

3. **Economic or security challenges**: Major crises could undermine his government's standing, as evidenced by his need to address the April 2025 power outage[3]

## Forecast Assessment

Based on the available information, Sánchez appears likely to remain Prime Minister through the end of 2025. His government, while facing challenges, has demonstrated stability into mid-2025. The absence of scheduled elections and the high procedural barriers to removing a sitting Prime Minister through a motion of no confidence favor continuity.

Sánchez's political skill at navigating difficult situations and forging necessary compromises has been repeatedly demonstrated throughout his career, earning him a reputation for political survival against seemingly impossible odds[5]. His continued policy announcements extending through 2025 further suggest an expectation of remaining in office.

While his coalition remains vulnerable to potential fractures, and public opposition to some policies persists, the structural factors of Spain's political system and Sánchez's demonstrated ability to maintain necessary support suggest he is more likely than not to remain in office through December 31, 2025.
