## Historical Trends and Current Status

- In 2020, U.S. healthcare spending reached 18.6% of GDP, rising sharply from 16.6% in 2019, largely due to COVID-19's economic impact[2][4].
- By 2023, health spending as a share of GDP stabilized at 17.6%, similar to pre-pandemic levels (17.5% in 2019)[1][3][4].
- Annual per capita health spending has continually increased, reaching $14,570 in 2023[3][4].
- Over the past five decades, health spending as a share of GDP has steadily trended upward, with only minor dips during strong economic growth or short-term responses to crises[4][5].

## Reference Cases: International Comparisons

- Other high-income countries with single-payer or robust universal health coverage systems (e.g., Canada, UK, Australia) spend significantly less as a share of GDP on healthcare—often between 9–12%—while achieving comparable or better health outcomes[2].
- The U.S. uniquely combines high administrative costs, elevated provider and pharmaceutical prices, and significant underinsurance, leading to its outlier status in health spending[2].

## Key Differences Affecting the Forecast

- **Administrative Savings**: Single-payer systems typically realize major reductions in administrative expense through streamlined billing and unified negotiation[2]. The U.S. administrative burden is notably high, so this is a potential source of savings.
- **Provider and Drug Prices**: Single-payer systems often negotiate lower prices for services and drugs. If the U.S. system adopts similar strategies, costs could fall[2].
- **Utilization Increase**: Expanded coverage may drive higher utilization, especially among previously uninsured or underinsured populations, which could offset efficiency gains[2].
- **Transition/Implementation Costs**: The transition to a single-payer system may entail upfront costs, including IT modernization, retraining, and phased roll-outs, which may temporarily raise expenditures.
- **Political and Policy Uncertainties**: Final spending outcomes depend on specific policy design, such as payment rates to providers and inclusion/exclusion of benefits.

## Recent Announcements/Policies

- As of 2020, no U.S. single-payer system had been implemented nationally. Debate over proposals (like "Medicare for All") was ongoing, and projections varied widely due to different modeling assumptions[2].
- The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and independent analysts continued to monitor and report health spending trends, but no major policy shifts toward single-payer had occurred by the cutoff date[1][3].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- **Forecasting Uncertainties**: The net effect on health spending as a share of GDP depends on balancing reduced administrative and price costs against higher utilization and possible transition costs.
- **Measurement Issues**: The official government measurement (e.g., CMS National Health Expenditures) may not immediately capture all transition-related costs or savings.
- **International Generalizability**: U.S. demographics, provider structure, and baseline prices differ from reference countries, so results may diverge from international experience[2].

## Probabilistic Assessment

Given U.S. historical trends, international reference cases, and the range of expert forecasts as of 2020, the adoption of a single-payer system in the United States would likely reduce administrative costs and provider prices, trending toward lower health spending as a share of GDP. However, the effect could be offset by increased utilization and transition costs, especially in the five-year post-implementation window.

- **Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment**: There is a moderate probability (perhaps 60–70%) that U.S. health spending as a share of GDP would decrease in the five years after a single-payer system is implemented, compared to the five years before, provided the system includes robust cost control measures and provider payment reforms. The risk of cost increase remains substantial due to uncertainties about utilization surges and implementation challenges.
