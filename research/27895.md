## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Alexandre de Moraes has served as a minister of the Supreme Federal Court of Brazil since 2017, appointed by then-President Michel Temer[2][3].
- Supreme Court ministers serve until age 75 unless removed by impeachment, resignation, or death. Moraes is 55, making mandatory retirement decades away[1][2][3].
- The Brazilian Supreme Court has played an increasingly prominent role in defending democratic institutions, particularly during and after the Bolsonaro administration, with Moraes at the center of several high-profile investigations and rulings[1][3].

## Recent Announcements and Political Developments

- In August 2024, Moraes ordered the suspension of X (formerly Twitter) in Brazil, escalating tensions with Elon Musk and certain political groups[3][5].
- Far-right parliamentarians have announced plans to collect signatures for an impeachment petition against Moraes, aiming to file it on September 9, 2024. The accusations stem from alleged misuse of the Superior Electoral Court to produce reports against Bolsonaro allies[4].
- Moraes’s office has denied any irregularities, stating that all procedures were official and documented[4].
- As of September 3, 2024, there is no evidence that the impeachment process has advanced beyond the planning or signature-gathering stage, nor that the Senate has taken up the matter[4].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Multiple reputable sources, including Americas Quarterly, AFP, and Brasil de Fato, confirm that as of September 3, 2024, Alexandre de Moraes remains an active minister of the Supreme Federal Court[1][2][3][4][5].
- There are no credible reports of resignation, removal, or confirmation of a successor as of this date.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- While an impeachment petition is reportedly imminent, the process is lengthy and requires Senate approval, making removal before October 1, 2024 highly unlikely unless extraordinary developments occur[4].
- Political dynamics can change, but as of the knowledge cutoff, there is no indication of imminent cessation of Moraes’s role.

## Conclusion

Based on all available factual information as of September 3, 2024, there is no credible evidence or authoritative reporting to suggest that Alexandre de Moraes will cease to be a minister of the Supreme Federal Court of Brazil before October 1, 2024. Impeachment efforts are in the early stages and have not advanced to a point where removal is imminent.
