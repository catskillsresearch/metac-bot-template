## 1. Historical Trends and Current Status

- The United States has a long tradition of strong constitutional press protections, but journalists have faced arrest and, more rarely, criminal charges in the course of their work.
- During the 2020 protests, over 140 journalists were arrested in the US, a historic spike. However, most did not lead to sustained criminal charges; many were dropped or reduced. By 2021, arrests fell to 59, and the trend continued downward in subsequent years as protest activity diminished [5].
- The U.S. Press Freedom Tracker remains the authoritative source, cataloging incidents where journalists are arrested or charged for acts related to journalism, using a broad definition that includes freelancers and independent reporters [1][4].
- Globally, the number of jailed journalists reached near-record highs in 2024, but the US continues to see far fewer such cases compared to authoritarian countries [2][5].

## 2. Recent Announcements and Policies

- In his second term, President Trump has continued rhetoric critical of the press, including calls for the jailing of journalists who publish leaks or sensitive materials.
- Despite aggressive rhetoric, actual criminal prosecutions of journalists in the US remain rare, largely due to legal constraints and First Amendment protections. Most legal threats have focused on issues like refusal to reveal sources, trespass, or alleged violations of wiretapping or computer laws—not on the act of publication itself [4][5].
- No recent federal policy or law has substantially weakened press protections as of March 2025, but the political climate remains adversarial.

## 3. Authoritative Sources

- The U.S. Press Freedom Tracker is the primary source for incident-level data on journalist arrests and charges in the US [1][4].
- Reports from the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) and Reporters Without Borders (RSF) provide international context and track jailings globally [2][5].

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- Most incidents in the US involve arrests at protests or during newsgathering, with charges often dropped.
- The distinction between arrest and criminal charge is crucial; the metric in question is charges, not arrests.
- Political volatility or major national security cases (e.g., major leaks) could change the risk landscape rapidly.
- The forecast depends on the continued operation of the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker; any interruption could affect final resolution [1].

## 5. Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

- From 2021–2024, the annual number of journalists arrested or criminally charged has trended downward, with most years seeing fewer than 30 such incidents where charges are filed [5][4].
- Given current trends, barring a major national crisis or unprecedented crackdown, it is reasonable to forecast:
  - 2025: 10–25 journalists may face criminal charges
  - 2026: 10–25 journalists may face criminal charges
- The most likely outcome for the total number of journalists in the US facing criminal charges related to their work before 2027 is **20–50**. A value in the **30–40** range is a plausible median estimate, with higher numbers possible only in the event of extraordinary events (e.g., mass protests, major leaks, or policy changes).
