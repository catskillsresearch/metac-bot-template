## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of May 30, 2025, James Comey is under investigation by the Secret Service and the Department of Homeland Security in response to posting "86 47" on Instagram, which some interpreted as a coded threat against President Trump[1].
- Comey has publicly denied the accusation and is cooperating with authorities, having already been interviewed by the Secret Service[1].
- Historically, high-profile former officials are rarely arrested for ambiguous social media posts unless clear evidence emerges of intent or direct threat to a protected individual.
- Secret Service investigations of perceived threats are common, but actual arrests—especially of prominent figures—require compelling evidence and often follow extended legal review.

## 2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem confirmed the investigation is ongoing and that Comey has been interviewed, but no arrest or charges have been announced as of this date[1].
- The Secret Service has issued a statement that they "vigorously investigate anything that can be taken as a potential threat," but also stated they do not comment further on protective intelligence matters[1].
- There is no public evidence of a warrant or immediate plans to take Comey into custody.

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- CBS News and other reputable outlets have confirmed the ongoing investigation and the absence of any arrest as of May 30, 2025[1].
- Formal resolution would rely on further statements from law enforcement agencies, court records, or credible news outlets reporting an arrest.

## 4. Key Differences and Uncertainties

- Unlike typical reference cases, this situation involves a former FBI director, which raises the threshold for arrest due to public scrutiny, legal caution, and political sensitivities.
- The timeline is short (one month), and no evidence has been made public that would warrant immediate arrest.
- The definition of "arrest" is broad for this question, but still requires a clear custodial action, not just questioning or investigation.
- Investigations of perceived social media threats often close without arrest, especially when the subject cooperates and there is plausible deniability or ambiguity.

## 5. Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

- Given current information, the probability that James Comey will be arrested before July 1, 2025, is **low**—estimated at less than 5%.
- This assessment could change if new evidence emerges or if authorities shift from investigation to criminal charges, but as of now, such developments appear unlikely within the specified timeframe.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- Information is subject to change quickly; a sealed indictment or sudden escalation cannot be ruled out, though there is no indication of this as of the current date.
- The public may not be immediately notified of an arrest, but major media and official announcements typically follow quickly for such a high-profile figure.
