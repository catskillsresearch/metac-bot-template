# SNAP Eligible Food Items: Will "Snack Foods" Remain Listed?

Based on the available information as of March 6, 2025, I can provide the following analysis regarding whether "snack foods" will still be listed on the USDA's "What Can SNAP Buy?" page on April 1, 2025.

## Current Status of SNAP Eligible Foods

The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) provides food benefits to low-income families to supplement their grocery budget so they can afford nutritious food essential to health and well-being[1]. As noted in the question description, "snack foods" is explicitly mentioned on the USDA's "What Can SNAP Buy?" webpage as of February 19, 2025, indicating that snack foods are currently eligible for purchase with SNAP benefits.

## Recent Developments and Potential Changes

There are several factors that could potentially impact whether "snack foods" remains listed as SNAP-eligible by April 1, 2025:

1. **Project 2025 Recommendations**: There is information suggesting that "Project 2025" has outlined policy recommendations that would negatively impact federal nutrition programs[3]. While specific details about changes to SNAP-eligible foods are not provided in the search results, this initiative could potentially influence SNAP policies.

2. **Potential Policy Shift**: The NY Post article from February 14, 2025, cited in the question description, indicates that a Trump USDA chief has discussed the possibility of banning "bad food and sugary drinks" from SNAP purchases. This suggests that there may be consideration of restricting certain food categories, which could potentially include some items currently classified as "snack foods."

## Fiscal Year 2025 SNAP Updates

The USDA has already announced Cost-of-Living Adjustments (COLA) for SNAP for fiscal year 2025, effective October 1, 2024[2]. These adjustments primarily affect maximum allotments, income eligibility standards, and deductions, but do not mention any changes to eligible food categories. The memorandum does not indicate any planned changes to the types of foods that can be purchased with SNAP benefits.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Based on the available information, there are significant limitations in forecasting whether "snack foods" will remain listed on the USDA's "What Can SNAP Buy?" page by April 1, 2025:

1. No official USDA announcement regarding changes to SNAP-eligible food categories is evident in the search results.

2. While there are indications of potential policy discussions around restricting certain foods, there is no confirmation that such changes have been finalized or scheduled for implementation by April 1, 2025.

3. The typical timeline for implementing significant changes to federal programs like SNAP often involves a regulatory process including public notice and comment periods, which can take months to complete.

## Conclusion

Based on the available information as of March 6, 2025, there is insufficient evidence to conclusively determine whether "snack foods" will be removed from the USDA's "What Can SNAP Buy?" page by April 1, 2025. While there are indications of policy discussions that could potentially affect SNAP-eligible foods, no confirmed changes specifically targeting "snack foods" or implementation timelines have been identified in the search results.

The most recent official USDA documentation regarding SNAP for FY 2025 focuses on benefit amounts rather than eligible food categories, suggesting that any major policy changes regarding eligible foods may not have been finalized or publicly announced as of the information available.
