**Key Historical Trends and Current Status**

- U.S. customs duties revenue in FY 2023 was $80 billion[5].
- Forecasts prior to major new tariff announcements expected only modest growth: $97 billion in 2024, declining slightly to $96 billion by 2034[5].
- Historically, customs duties have represented a small and fairly stable share of total federal tax revenue[4].

**Recent Announcements and Policies**

- As of January 24, 2025, President Trump announced plans to impose 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada and 10% on China, with possible broader application to other countries[2].
- If implemented broadly and maintained throughout FY 2026, such tariffs could meaningfully boost customs revenues.
- For reference, a *universal* 10% tariff is estimated to generate about $190 billion annually in revenue, but this assumes all imports are covered without significant trade reductions[3].

**Comparison to Reference Cases**

- The reference scenario (pre-tariff policy) projects customs duties revenues well below $160 billion in FY 2026[5].
- The proposed tariffs could shift the scenario closer to the "10% universal tariff" case, but announced tariffs currently target major partners, not all imports[2][3].
- Historical precedent (2018-2020 tariffs on China and others) shows that tariff hikes reduce import volumes, limiting revenue gains versus static projections[1][3].

**Key Differences Affecting the Forecast**

- The newly announced tariffs are broader and at higher rates than recent history, but not as sweeping as a universal tariff.
- The effectiveness of these tariffs in raising revenue depends on:
  - Speed and completeness of implementation
  - Whether imports from targeted countries are substantially reduced (by supply chain shifts, retaliation, or recession effects)
  - Legal, political, and international responses that could alter or reverse policy
- The risk of retaliation and import substitution is high, potentially blunting expected revenue gains[1][3].

**Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment**

- If the announced tariffs are implemented fully and maintained through FY 2026, customs revenue could approach the $160 billion threshold, but this would require:
  - Minimal import volume reduction (unlikely, based on past trade war experience)
  - No significant legal or policy reversals
- Mainstream forecasts and historical experience suggest that actual revenue will likely fall well short of $160 billion in 2023 dollars, due to the combination of reduced import demand, trade diversion, and policy uncertainty[5][2][1].
- **Probabilistic assessment:** As of January 31, 2025, the chance that U.S. customs duties revenue will reach or exceed $160 billion in FY 2026 (in 2023 dollars) is **low** (estimated well below 25%), unless tariffs are both broader and more durable than currently announced, and import volumes remain resilient.

**Limitations and Uncertainties**

- The actual policy scope, timing, and legal durability remain uncertain as of end-January 2025.
- Estimates vary depending on economic feedback (trade shrinkage, retaliation, recession risk).
- Final resolution depends on authoritative sources (Treasury, CBO) and could be influenced by inflation adjustments to 2023 dollars[2].
