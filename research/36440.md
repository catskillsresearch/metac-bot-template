# Tour de France 2025 Winner Forecast

As the 112th edition of the Tour de France approaches, cycling enthusiasts and bettors are already speculating about who will claim victory in the world's most prestigious bicycle race. Based on current information available as of May 2025, here's a comprehensive analysis of the potential winners.

## Current Favorites

Tadej Pogačar is the overwhelming favorite to win the 2025 Tour de France. The Slovenian rider from UAE Team Emirates is looking to claim his fourth yellow jersey, following victories in 2020, 2021, and most recently in 2024[3][4]. Despite already having three Tour wins and two second-place finishes in the last five years, the 26-year-old Pogačar is considered to be not yet at his peak performance level[3]. His dominance in 2024 was particularly impressive, as he achieved the rare feat of winning the Giro d'Italia, Tour de France, and World Championships in the same year[4].

The betting markets strongly reflect this sentiment, with Pogačar listed at -133 odds, clearly positioning him as the frontrunner[5]. However, these odds, while favorable, don't offer much value for bettors looking for significant returns[5].

## Main Challengers

Jonas Vingegaard (Visma-Lease A Bike) stands as Pogačar's most formidable rival. The Danish rider won back-to-back Tours in 2022 and 2023 and finished as runner-up in 2024[4]. Between Pogačar and Vingegaard, they have dominated the Tour, winning all editions since 2020[3]. Vingegaard is currently listed at +200 odds, making him the clear second favorite[5]. However, there are significant questions about his health and recovery from a previous injury, which could impact his performance[4][5].

Remco Evenepoel (Soudal-Quick Step) is positioned as the third contender. The Belgian rider finished third and claimed the best young rider's jersey in his Tour de France debut in 2024[4]. He has publicly stated his intention to compete directly with Vingegaard and Pogačar in 2025[4]. Evenepoel, who won the 2022 Vuelta a España, is particularly strong in time trials and could potentially take the yellow jersey during stage five's flat individual time trial[4]. His betting odds stand at +600, marking him as a valuable long shot for those looking beyond the top two favorites[5].

## Dark Horses

Primož Roglič (Bora-Hansgrohe) presents an interesting case. The Slovenian has an impressive palmares with four Vuelta a España titles and one Giro d'Italia crown but has experienced years of misfortune at the Tour de France, including crashes and injuries[4]. Despite his troubled history with the race, Roglič is considered a strong contender for a podium position if he can finally break his "Tour curse"[4]. His odds at +2200 for a top-three finish represent potentially significant value if he finds his form[5].

Carlos Rodríguez, who will lead Ineos Grenadiers, could also be a factor after finishing fifth overall and taking a stage win in his Tour debut in 2023[4].

## Key Factors That Could Influence the Outcome

Several factors could significantly impact the final outcome of the 2025 Tour de France:

1. **Vingegaard's Health**: The Danish rider's recovery from injury is mentioned as a major question mark. If he isn't at full strength, the competitive balance could shift dramatically in Pogačar's favor[5].

2. **Course Profile**: While the search results don't provide detailed information about the 2025 route, the course design always plays a crucial role in determining which riders have an advantage.

3. **Team Support**: The strength of each contender's team will be vital, particularly in the mountain stages and for protection against crosswinds and positioning in dangerous sections.

4. **Unexpected Events**: The Tour de France is notorious for crashes, illnesses, and other unpredictable events that can dramatically alter the race dynamics.

## Conclusion

Based on all available information, Tadej Pogačar appears to be the most likely winner of the 2025 Tour de France, with Jonas Vingegaard representing his most significant challenge if healthy. Remco Evenepoel and Primož Roglič are positioned as the next tier of contenders who could capitalize if either of the top two falter.

However, the Tour de France's unpredictable nature means that while forecasts can be made with some confidence, the three-week race often produces surprising outcomes that defy expectations. The battle between Pogačar and Vingegaard has defined recent Tours, and their rivalry looks set to continue shaping the narrative of the 2025 edition.
