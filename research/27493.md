### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The most recent available data shows that the US core CPI (excluding food and energy) rose by 0.2% month-over-month in July 2024, following a similar 0.2% increase in June[4].
- The annualized core CPI forecast for Q3 2024 is 2.6%, according to the Philadelphia Fed’s August 2024 Survey of Professional Forecasters. This implies an average monthly increase of approximately 0.21% (since \( (1 + 0.0021)^{12} \approx 1.026 \)), well below the 0.5% threshold[1].
- Core CPI inflation has been trending downward from its 2022 peaks, with private-sector forecasters expecting inflation to fall below 2.5% in 2024[5].

### Recent Announcements and Policies

- The Federal Reserve has maintained a restrictive monetary policy stance through 2023 and early 2024, contributing to the moderation in inflation pressures[4][5].
- No major new policy shocks or supply-side disruptions have been reported that would likely cause a sudden spike in core CPI for August 2024.

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) is scheduled to release the August 2024 CPI data on September 11, 2024[2].
- The Philadelphia Fed’s Survey of Professional Forecasters and the Cleveland Fed’s Inflation Nowcasting provide consensus and real-time estimates, both pointing to continued moderate inflation[1][3].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- While shelter costs remain a significant component of core CPI and have contributed to recent increases, their impact has not been sufficient to push MoM core CPI near 0.5% in recent months[4].
- Forecasts are subject to revision if unexpected economic shocks occur, but as of the latest data and projections, such a scenario is not anticipated.

### Conclusion

Based on all available data and forecasts as of August 22, 2024, there is no factual basis to expect the month-over-month percentage increase in US core CPI inflation for August 2024 to be 0.5% or more. Recent trends, professional forecasts, and the absence of major shocks all point to a continued moderate pace of core inflation, likely in the 0.2% range.
