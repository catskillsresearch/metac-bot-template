## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- **China’s Pledge**: Under the Paris Agreement, China committed to lowering its carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP (emissions intensity) by 60–65% from 2005 levels by 2030[2][5].
- **Progress to Date**: Multiple analyses indicate China had already reduced its emissions intensity significantly by 2017 and was on track to meet or exceed its targets. According to leading energy institutes and the Chinese government’s reporting, China’s emissions intensity had fallen by around 34% between 2005 and 2014, with continued declines expected[2].
- **Recent Emissions Trends**: By 2025, reports show that China’s emissions have started to decline year-on-year, indicating progress in decoupling emissions from economic growth, largely due to massive investments in clean energy and industrial policy shifts[4].

## 2. Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Metric

- **Policy Strengthening**: China’s national plans continue to reinforce the emissions intensity target, with a 2020 update confirming the 60–65% reduction goal and further raising ambition for non-fossil energy deployment and forest stock increases[3][5].
- **Clean Energy Expansion**: The rapid increase in renewable energy capacity and a plateauing or decline in coal use have contributed to emissions intensity reductions. For instance, 2025 analysis notes that clean energy growth has, for the first time, reversed the trend of overall CO2 emissions in China[4].
- **International Context**: Despite the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, China has reaffirmed its climate commitments, positioning itself as a leader in global climate governance[3].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- **Carbon Brief**: Provides detailed tracking and analysis of China’s emissions intensity trends and policy implementation[1][4].
- **C2ES and IGDP Reports**: Offer comprehensive assessments of China’s Paris commitments, progress, and policy details[2][5].
- **UNFCCC and International Agencies**: The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and agencies like the IEA and EIA evaluate national reporting and independent verification[2][5].

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- **Data Quality and Transparency**: While China’s reported data are generally in line with international estimates, there are ongoing concerns about transparency and independent verification, particularly at subnational levels.
- **Economic Variability**: The metric (emissions per GDP) is sensitive to both GDP growth rates and energy sector transitions. Unexpected economic slowdowns or rapid growth could affect the trajectory.
- **Policy Implementation Risks**: Achievement of the 60–65% reduction depends on continued enforcement and enhancement of clean energy and efficiency policies, as well as unanticipated technological or economic shocks.

## 5. Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the strong downward trend in emissions intensity, robust policy momentum, and multiple independent analyses as of 2017 and beyond, the probability that China will reduce its carbon emissions per unit GDP by at least 60% from 2005 levels by 2030 is high. Most expert assessments at the time placed the likelihood as greater than 80%, barring major policy reversals or economic disruptions[2][5]. This assessment is further supported by recent data showing accelerated progress in emissions reductions and energy transition.
