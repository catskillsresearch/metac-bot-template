## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Afghanistan and Israel have never had formal diplomatic relations; Afghanistan has not recognized Israel since 1948[1].
- The Taliban, after regaining control in 2021, has unequivocally stated it will not establish relations with Israel, even as it seeks ties with other nations[5].
- The Taliban's exclusion of Israel is rooted in its ideological stance and longstanding enmity, reinforced by alliances with anti-Israel actors in the region, notably Iran[4][5].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- In September 2021, Taliban spokesperson Suhail Shaheen publicly stated there is "no chance for ties with Israel," distinguishing Israel as the sole country with which the Taliban categorically refuses relations[5].
- The Taliban has repeatedly expressed anti-Israel sentiment and has supported Israel's adversaries, including public statements backing Iranian military actions against Israel and discussions of "joint action" with Iran against Israel during the Gaza conflict as recently as June 2024[4].
- There are no official statements from Israel suggesting a willingness or interest in recognizing the Taliban government.

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Reliable sources for diplomatic recognition include official statements from the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs, major international news agencies, and authoritative country profiles such as those maintained by the United Nations or reputable encyclopedias[1][5].
- For Taliban policies and international positions, statements from Taliban spokespeople and coverage by major global news outlets are relevant[5].

## Key Differences Affecting the Forecast

- Unlike some Muslim-majority states that have normalized relations with Israel, the Taliban's ideological opposition remains absolute, with no evidence of moderation.
- The Taliban regime remains largely unrecognized internationally, further reducing incentives or pathways for Israel to pursue recognition.
- The deep alignment between the Taliban and Israel's adversaries (e.g., Iran) exacerbates the diplomatic gulf[4].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- Forecasts could be disrupted by major geopolitical realignments, regime change in Afghanistan, or fundamental shifts in Taliban ideology or leadership; however, no such trends are currently observable.
- The forecast is based on public statements and observable policies as of May 2025; covert or unannounced diplomatic contacts, while possible, would not meet the resolution criteria requiring reliable media reporting.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the historical record, explicit policy statements, and current geopolitical context, the probability that Israel will recognize the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan before 2030 is exceedingly low—well below 1%, barring dramatic and currently unforeseeable changes.
