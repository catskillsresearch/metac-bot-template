# Forecasting AfD's Performance in the 2024 Brandenburg State Election

The upcoming Brandenburg state election on September 22, 2024, represents a significant political event in Germany's eastern region. Based on available information, I'll analyze factors relevant to forecasting whether the Alternative for Germany (AfD) will receive less than or equal to 28% of the vote.

## Recent Electoral Performance of AfD in Eastern Germany

The AfD has demonstrated substantial electoral strength in eastern German states in recent elections:

- In September 2024, the AfD achieved a historic victory in Thuringia, winning 32.8% of the vote - marking its first regional election win[4].
- The party also performed strongly in Saxony, securing a second-place finish with approximately 30% support[2][3].
- These results represent significant growth compared to previous electoral cycles and establish the AfD as a dominant political force in eastern Germany.

The party's performance in these neighboring eastern states provides important context for Brandenburg, as these regions share similar historical, economic, and demographic characteristics.

## Current Polling in Brandenburg

As of early September 2024, polling data indicated:

- The AfD was leading in Brandenburg with approximately 24% support[4].
- This represents potential growth from their 2019 performance in Brandenburg, where they received 23.5% of the vote (as mentioned in the question description).

## Factors Potentially Influencing AfD's Performance

Several factors could impact AfD's final vote share in Brandenburg:

**Factors potentially increasing AfD support:**

1. **Regional Momentum**: The AfD's strong performances in Thuringia and Saxony could create momentum heading into the Brandenburg election.

2. **Voter Discontent**: There is significant voter dissatisfaction with Chancellor Olaf Scholz's center-left national government, which has benefited the AfD[3].

3. **Eastern German Identity**: The AfD has successfully positioned itself as a party representing eastern German interests, particularly in former East German states[4].

4. **EU Election Performance**: In the June 2024 European Parliament elections, the AfD scored 15.9% nationally but performed significantly better in eastern Germany, emerging as the strongest political force in the region[4].

**Factors potentially limiting AfD support:**

1. **Brandenburg's Political Landscape**: While trending similarly to other eastern states, Brandenburg has its own distinct political dynamics that may differ from Thuringia and Saxony.

2. **Mobilization of Opposition**: The AfD's strong showing in other eastern states might mobilize opposition voters in Brandenburg to prevent a similar outcome.

## Comparative Analysis

When comparing Brandenburg to the other eastern states that recently held elections:

- Thuringia: AfD won with 32.8%[4]
- Saxony: AfD secured approximately 30%[2]
- Brandenburg (2019): AfD received 23.5% (per question description)
- Brandenburg (current polling): AfD at approximately 24%[4]

This suggests that while the AfD is showing strength in Brandenburg, its support level appears to be starting from a lower baseline than in Thuringia and Saxony.

## Conclusion

Based on the available information, forecasting whether the AfD will receive less than or equal to 28% in the Brandenburg election requires weighing several competing factors:

- The AfD has demonstrated significant electoral strength in neighboring eastern states, exceeding 30% in both Thuringia and Saxony.
- However, current polling places the AfD at approximately 24% in Brandenburg, which would need to increase by more than 4 percentage points to exceed 28%.
- The momentum from recent electoral successes could push the AfD's support higher, but Brandenburg's distinct political environment may limit this effect.

The final outcome will likely depend on campaign developments, voter turnout, and potential shifts in public opinion in the final weeks before the election.
