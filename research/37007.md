Based on the available information as of April 21, 2025, here's an analysis of whether the People's National Movement (PNM) will win the most seats in the upcoming Trinidad and Tobago general election scheduled for April 28, 2025.

## Historical Context

In the 2020 general election, the PNM narrowly secured victory with 22 seats compared to the United National Congress (UNC)'s 19 seats[3]. This close margin indicates that Trinidad and Tobago has been experiencing competitive elections, with the PNM maintaining a slight edge in recent years. The PNM is also notable as the country's oldest political party, having been founded in 1956[3].

## Current Polling Data

Recent polling data presents a mixed picture for the PNM's prospects:

- A WIC News poll conducted ahead of the April 28 general election (with data as of April 11, 2025) shows the UNC leading with 1,432 votes (72%) while the incumbent PNM trails significantly with just 362 votes (18%)[1]. Other parties received smaller shares: Patriotic Front (104 votes), Tobago's People Party (23 votes), and Progressive Democratic Patriots (3 votes)[1].

- However, another poll conducted between April 10-13, 2025, shows different results for Tobago specifically. In Tobago, the PNM is leading with 47% support, while the Tobago People's Party (TPP) has 32% and the Progressive Democratic Patriots (PDP) has 9%[2]. This poll also noted that 4% of respondents kept their choices private, 3% were undecided, and 4% indicated support for other parties or candidates[2].

## Coalition Dynamics

The UNC has established a "Coalition of Interests" with several smaller parties and organizations, including:
- The Laventille Outreach for Vertical Enrichment (LOVE) movement
- The Progressive Empowerment Party (PEP)
- The Oilfields Workers' Trade Union (OWTU)
- Other unions[3]

This coalition strategy appears to be a deliberate attempt to consolidate opposition votes against the PNM.

## Third-Party Impact

The 2025 election is expected to see participation from at least 18 political parties beyond the two major ones (PNM and UNC), with seven parties specifically targeting the two Tobago seats[3]. Notable third parties include:

- National Transformation Alliance (NTA)
- All People's Party (APP)
- Patriotic Front (PF)
- Tobago People's Party (TPP)
- Innovative Democratic Alliance (IDA)
- The Unity of the People (UTP)[3]

The fragmentation of votes among these smaller parties could potentially influence the final outcome, especially in closely contested constituencies.

## Regional Differences

There appears to be a significant regional divide in political support:
- In Trinidad, the UNC seems to have stronger support based on the WIC News poll[1]
- In Tobago, the PNM maintains a lead, though it faces competition from the TPP and PDP[2]

Given that Trinidad has significantly more constituencies than Tobago, the apparent UNC advantage in Trinidad could be decisive for the overall election outcome.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors limit our ability to make a definitive forecast:

1. The polls cited have different methodologies and sample sizes, making direct comparisons difficult
2. The WIC News poll does not specify if it was conducted across both Trinidad and Tobago or just in Trinidad
3. The polls do not provide constituency-level data, which is crucial in a first-past-the-post electoral system
4. Voter turnout and last-minute shifts in voter preference could significantly impact the final results

## Conclusion

Based on the available data as of April 21, 2025, the PNM faces significant challenges in maintaining its parliamentary majority. The UNC's strong showing in polls and its coalition-building efforts suggest a potential shift in political power. However, the PNM's traditional strength in Tobago and its historical resilience as the country's oldest party mean that the election outcome remains uncertain.

The April 28, 2025 election will likely be closely contested, with both regional dynamics and the impact of third parties playing crucial roles in determining whether the PNM can secure a plurality of seats.
