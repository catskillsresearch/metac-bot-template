# Forecasting Analysis: Project 2025's NOAA Breakup Objective

Based on the available information as of May 15, 2025, I'll assess the likelihood of Project 2025's objective to break up NOAA being marked as complete in the Project 2025 Tracker before July 1, 2025.

## Current Status and Key Developments

The Project 2025 policy blueprint, developed by the Heritage Foundation, explicitly calls for breaking up the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and commercializing its forecasting operations, particularly the National Weather Service[1]. The document describes NOAA as a primary component "of the climate change alarm industry" and recommends it "should be broken up"[1].

However, a significant development occurred in January 2025 when Commerce Secretary nominee Howard Lutnick explicitly rejected this proposal during his confirmation hearing. When directly asked if he agreed with Project 2025's plan for NOAA, Lutnick simply responded, "No"[2]. He further emphasized, "I have no interest in separating it. That is not on my agenda"[2].

This represents a crucial divergence between the Project 2025 blueprint and the actual policy direction of the current administration regarding NOAA. While President Trump had distanced himself from Project 2025 during his campaign, reports indicate he has since "tapped into [it] for ideas and personnel"[2].

## Comparative Analysis with Reference Cases

While no direct reference cases are provided in the search results, we can note that:

1. NOAA was facing budget cuts as of March 2025, with scientists warning about risks to public safety[3]
2. The Commerce Secretary nominee has taken a clear position against breaking up NOAA[2]
3. NOAA comprises the majority of the Commerce Department's budget during non-census years and handles critical functions from hurricane research to issuing severe weather warnings[2]

## Key Factors Affecting the Forecast

Several factors influence this forecast:

1. **Administrative Opposition**: The explicit rejection of the NOAA breakup plan by the Commerce Secretary nominee significantly reduces the likelihood of implementation[2]

2. **Timeframe**: With only approximately 1.5 months remaining until the July 1, 2025 resolution date, the administrative and legislative processes required to completely break up a major federal agency would be extremely difficult to complete

3. **Agency Scope**: NOAA's extensive responsibilities and budget allocation within the Commerce Department make it logistically challenging to dismantle quickly[2]

4. **Public Safety Concerns**: Scientists have warned that cuts to NOAA and the National Weather Service could put public safety at risk, potentially creating political resistance to a complete breakup[3]

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on the available evidence, I assess a low probability (approximately 15-20%) that the Project 2025 objective to break up NOAA will be marked as complete in the tracking spreadsheet before July 1, 2025.

The primary factors supporting this assessment are:
- The Commerce Secretary nominee's explicit opposition to breaking up NOAA[2]
- The limited timeframe remaining before the resolution date
- The complexity of dismantling a major federal agency with critical public safety functions

While budget cuts appear to be occurring[3], a complete breakup of the agency would require more substantial administrative action that appears unlikely given the current Commerce Department leadership's stated position.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several limitations affect this forecast:
- The search results do not provide information on any executive orders or legislative actions specifically targeting NOAA's organizational structure since March 2025
- The current status of Howard Lutnick's confirmation process is not specified in the search results
- The exact definition of what constitutes a "complete" breakup in the Project 2025 Tracker is not fully detailed

This forecast represents the most likely outcome based on publicly available information as of May 15, 2025, but remains subject to rapid policy changes that could occur in the coming weeks.
