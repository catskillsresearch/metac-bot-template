# Forecasting Analysis: AI Benchmarking vs. Human Pro Aggregate

As of July 20, 2024, I'm analyzing the likelihood that the winning bot in any Quarterly AI Benchmarking tournament will beat the human Pro aggregate before Q3 of 2025. This analysis considers available data, trends in AI forecasting capabilities, and the structure of the ongoing tournaments.

## Current Status of AI Forecasting Benchmarks

The Q3 AI Benchmarking tournament launched on July 8, 2024, marking the first of four quarterly tournaments with a total prize pool of $120,000 ($30,000 per tournament)[4]. This series aims to benchmark AI forecasting capabilities against human performance on real-world questions, with over 300 binary questions that resolve by early October 2024[4].

The tournament uses "spot forecasting" where only the final forecast counts for scoring, and employs standard tournament scoring to determine winners[4]. Ten Pro forecasters will forecast on at least 100 of the questions in the Bot tournament, providing the human benchmark for comparison[4].

## Technical Performance Trends in AI

Recent trends in AI performance show remarkable improvements across various benchmarks:

- By early 2024, AI systems demonstrated significant gains on challenging benchmarks introduced in 2023, with improvements of 18.8 and 48.9 percentage points on MMMU and GPQA respectively[5]
- On SWE-bench, AI problem-solving capability jumped from 4.4% in 2023 to 71.7% in 2024[5]
- The performance gap between closed-weight and open-weight models narrowed dramatically, from 8.04% in January 2024 to just 1.70% by February 2025[5]
- Similarly, the performance gap between leading American and Chinese models decreased substantially across multiple benchmarks by the end of 2024[5]

These trends indicate rapid advancement in AI capabilities across multiple domains and metrics, suggesting potential for similar improvements in forecasting tasks.

## Key Factors Affecting the Forecast

1. **Tournament Structure**: The first tournament (Q3 2024) is currently underway, with three more quarters (Q4 2024, Q1 2025, Q2 2025) before the Q3 2025 cutoff. This provides multiple opportunities for bots to outperform humans.

2. **Scoring Methodology**: The tournament uses average Baseline score to measure accuracy, with only questions forecast by both Pros and the winning bot included in the comparison[4].

3. **AI Improvement Rate**: The rapid pace of AI improvement seen in other benchmarks suggests that forecasting capabilities may similarly advance quickly over the coming quarters.

4. **Uncertainty Factors**: 
   - The complexity of real-world forecasting compared to other AI benchmarks
   - Potential limitations in how bots process probabilistic information
   - Unknown strategies employed by the human Pro forecasters

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on the available information as of July 20, 2024, I estimate a **65-70% probability** that at least one winning bot will beat the human Pro aggregate before Q3 2025. This assessment is based on:

1. The accelerating trend of AI performance improvements across various benchmarks[5]
2. Four quarterly opportunities (Q3 2024, Q4 2024, Q1 2025, Q2 2025) for bots to achieve this milestone
3. The narrowing performance gaps between different types of AI models, suggesting broad improvements in AI reasoning capabilities[5]
4. The significant resources being dedicated to this competition ($120,000 total prize pool)[4]

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- No historical data exists specifically for AI vs. human performance in forecasting tournaments
- The complexity of forecasting real-world events may present unique challenges for AI systems
- The tournament design and scoring methodology may favor certain approaches over others
- The quality of the human Pro aggregate is unknown but presumably represents expert-level forecasting
