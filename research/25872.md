### Key Factual Information as of 2024-07-08

**1. Historical Trends in Euro Semi-Finals**
- Recent European Championship semi-finals have typically produced between 2 and 4 goals in total (excluding penalty shootouts). For example:
  - Euro 2020: 1-1 (Italy vs Spain, after extra time), 2-1 (England vs Denmark, after extra time) — 4 goals total.
  - Euro 2016: 2-0 (Portugal vs Wales), 2-0 (France vs Germany) — 4 goals total.
- This pattern suggests that 4 goals is a common total for both semi-finals combined, but totals above 4 are less frequent.

**2. Euro 2024 Semi-Finalists' Scoring Records**
- Spain has been the tournament's most prolific attacking team, scoring 4 goals against Georgia and 2 against Germany in the knockout rounds[4][5].
- France has been defensively strong but less prolific in attack, with a 0-0 draw against Portugal (won on penalties) and a 1-0 win over Belgium in the knockouts[4].
- The other semi-finalists, England and the Netherlands, have had mixed scoring records, with England often involved in low-scoring matches and the Netherlands showing more attacking intent in some games[1].

**3. Current Tournament Scoring Trends**
- As of the quarter-finals, the average goals per match in Euro 2024 has been consistent with previous tournaments, with some high-scoring games but also several low-scoring, tightly contested knockout matches[1][4][5].

**4. No Recent Announcements or Rule Changes**
- There have been no changes to rules or policies that would affect the likelihood of goals in the semi-finals as of July 8, 2024.

**5. Limitations and Uncertainties**
- Semi-finals are often more cautious due to the high stakes, which can limit goal-scoring.
- Extra time goals count toward the total, but penalty shootout goals do not.
- The specific tactical approaches of the teams, especially the defensively solid France and the attacking Spain, introduce uncertainty regarding the goal total in their match[4].
- England and the Netherlands' match could be more open, but both teams have shown variability in attack and defense.

**Summary Table: Recent Euro Semi-Final Goal Totals**

| Year | Semi-Final 1 | Semi-Final 2 | Total Goals |
|------|--------------|--------------|-------------|
| 2020 | 1-1 (AET)    | 2-1 (AET)    | 4           |
| 2016 | 2-0          | 2-0          | 4           |
| 2012 | 4-2 (AET)    | 2-1          | 7           |
| 2008 | 3-0          | 3-1          | 7           |

**Conclusion:**  
Based on historical trends and current team form, there is a strong likelihood that the combined goal total in the two Euro 2024 semi-finals will be around 4, with a moderate chance of exceeding that number. However, the defensive approach of some teams and the high stakes of the matches could keep the total at or below 4.
