## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of March 2025, Tesla's market capitalization is reported at $844.9 billion, while Walmart's is $736.8 billion, according to a comprehensive list of the world's largest companies[5].
- Another source from March 6, 2025, lists Tesla at $260 billion and Walmart at $259 billion, with Tesla still marginally ahead[1]. This discrepancy likely reflects different reporting dates or calculation methods, but both indicate Tesla's market cap is higher than Walmart's as of early March 2025.

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- Tesla has experienced a significant decline in its stock price in early 2025, described by JPMorgan analysts as potentially historic, indicating strong downward momentum in its valuation[1].
- There are no major announcements or policy changes for Walmart that would suggest a dramatic shift in its market cap trajectory as of the latest available data.

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The CompaniesMarketCap website is specified as the resolution source for determining market capitalization on March 29, 2025.
- Additional verification can be found via financial news outlets and market data aggregators, such as Investing.com and Trefis[1][5].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- Market capitalization figures can vary between sources due to differences in reporting times, calculation methods, and currency fluctuations.
- Both Tesla and Walmart's market caps are subject to change due to stock price volatility, with Tesla historically exhibiting much higher volatility than Walmart.
- As of March 18, 2025, there is no definitive data indicating that Walmart will surpass Tesla by March 29, 2025, though the narrowing gap and negative momentum for Tesla make it a plausible scenario.

## Summary

As of March 18, 2025, Tesla's market cap remains higher than Walmart's, but the margin has narrowed considerably due to a sharp decline in Tesla's stock price. If current trends persist, it is possible that Walmart could overtake Tesla by March 29, 2025, but there is no conclusive evidence to confirm this outcome as of the latest available data.
