Based on available data as of March 18, 2025, here's an analysis to help forecast whether Walmart will have a higher market cap than Tesla on March 29, 2025:

## Current Market Cap Status

As of March 6, 2025, Tesla (TSLA) had a market capitalization of approximately $260 billion, which was slightly higher than Walmart's market cap of $259 billion[1]. However, there appears to be conflicting information, as another source indicates that as of March 2025, Tesla's market cap was $844.9 billion, while Walmart's was $736.8 billion[5].

This significant discrepancy makes it challenging to establish a definitive current baseline. If the $260 billion figure is accurate, the companies are extremely close in valuation, with Tesla only marginally ahead.

## Historical Trends

### Tesla's Market Cap Trajectory

Tesla has experienced significant volatility in its market capitalization:
- In 2023, Tesla's market cap ranged from approximately $656 billion to $830 billion[3]
- Tesla ranked 7th in market cap at the end of 2023 with a value of $789.93 billion[3]
- By March 2025, Tesla was positioned as the 10th largest company by market cap according to one source[5]

### Walmart's Market Cap Growth

- Walmart has shown steady growth in its market capitalization
- As of March 2025, Walmart ranked 13th globally with a market cap of $736.8 billion according to one source[5]
- This represents significant growth from previous years, positioning Walmart as a major player in the global market cap rankings

## Recent Developments

The query references a Business Insider article indicating that "Tesla's latest decline could be one for the history books" according to JPMorgan analysts. This suggests that Tesla may be experiencing a significant downturn in stock performance leading up to March 2025, which could negatively impact its market capitalization.

If Tesla is indeed experiencing a major decline as suggested by JPMorgan analysts, and if the companies are already close in market cap (as suggested by the $260 billion vs $259 billion figures), this could create conditions favorable for Walmart to surpass Tesla by March 29, 2025.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors limit the accuracy of any forecast:

1. **Conflicting data**: The significant discrepancy between reported market cap values for both companies makes it difficult to establish a reliable baseline.

2. **Market volatility**: Stock markets can experience significant fluctuations in short periods, especially for companies like Tesla that have historically shown high volatility.

3. **Limited context**: Without access to the full JPMorgan analysis or other recent analyst reports, it's difficult to gauge the severity and likelihood of Tesla's potential decline.

4. **Time horizon**: The forecast date (March 29, 2025) is less than two weeks from the latest available data, making short-term market movements particularly important but difficult to predict.

Given these limitations, any forecast should be considered with appropriate caution. The close proximity of the two companies' market caps (at least according to one source) and the negative sentiment around Tesla suggest that Walmart surpassing Tesla by March 29, 2025 is plausible, but far from certain.
