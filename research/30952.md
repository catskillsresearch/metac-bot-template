# Forecast Analysis: US CPI Change November 2025 vs. November 2024

As of May 24, 2025, I'll analyze whether the 12-month percentage change in the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) will be lower in November 2025 than the November 2024 baseline of 2.73258 percent.

## Current Inflation Trends

The most recent CPI data shows that inflation has been relatively moderate in early 2025:

- April 2025: The CPI increased by 0.3 percent on a not seasonally adjusted basis[1]
- April 2025: On a seasonally adjusted basis, the CPI increased 0.2 percent, following a 0.1 percent decrease in the previous period[2]
- The CPI value for April 2025 stands at 320.795 points, up from 319.799 in March 2025[5]

Core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, has been more stable:
- Core Consumer Prices increased from 325.66 to 326.43 points from March to April 2025
- The year-over-year Core CPI has remained steady at 1.80 percent as of April 2025[5]

## Key Factors Affecting November 2025 Projection

### Economic Policy Impacts

Current economic policies under the Trump administration could exert both upward and downward pressure on inflation:

- Potential tariff increases could drive prices higher for imported goods
- Immigration policy changes may create a tighter labor market, potentially increasing wage pressures
- Tax cuts and fiscal stimulus could increase consumer spending and demand-pull inflation[4]
- The Department of Government Efficiency initiatives aimed at reducing government spending could potentially counteract some inflationary pressures

### Federal Reserve Independence

The president has expressed interest in having more influence over Federal Reserve policy, which creates uncertainty about future monetary policy decisions and their impact on inflation control[4].

### Market Expectations

Current market forecasts suggest continued inflation through 2025 and beyond:
- The CPI is projected to trend around 331.91 points in 2026 and 339.54 points in 2027[5]
- As of May 2025, prediction markets estimate a 46% probability that November 2025 inflation will be lower than November 2024's 2.73258%[4]

## Forecast Assessment

Based on current data and trends, several factors suggest inflation may remain at or above the November 2024 level of 2.73258%:

1. Recent monthly CPI increases (0.2-0.3%) would translate to an annual rate of approximately 2.4-3.6% if sustained
2. The current year-over-year Core CPI of 1.80% is lower than the November 2024 overall CPI rate, suggesting potential for continued moderation
3. The upcoming CPI rebasing scheduled for July 2025 (with December 2024 = 100) may introduce some measurement variability[2]

## Confidence and Uncertainty

Key uncertainties affecting this forecast include:

- The impact of new tariff policies on consumer prices
- The effectiveness of government efficiency initiatives in controlling inflation
- Potential Federal Reserve policy changes that could occur before November 2025
- The next CPI report for May 2025 is scheduled for release on June 11, 2025, which will provide updated data[2]

## Conclusion

The available data suggests approximately a 40-50% probability that the November 2025 CPI 12-month percentage change will be lower than the November 2024 value of 2.73258%. While core inflation appears stable, policy-driven factors including tariffs, immigration changes, and fiscal stimulus create upward pressure that may offset efficiency gains and monetary tightening.
