### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of December 10, 2024, moderate to exceptional drought covers 36.8% of the United States including Puerto Rico, a slight increase from the previous week’s 36.5%[5][2].
- The most severe drought categories (extreme to exceptional) increased slightly to 4.1%[5].
- The prevailing weather pattern—a ridge over the West and a trough over the East—has limited precipitation in much of the country, contributing to persistent drought conditions[5][2].
- In recent years, the number of people affected by drought has fluctuated, sometimes exceeding 100 million during severe events, but often remaining below that threshold. The current percentage of land in drought is significant but not at historic highs.

### Recent Announcements or Policies

- No major new federal drought relief or water management policies have been announced in late 2024 that would immediately and dramatically alter the drought coverage or population affected.

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The U.S. Drought Monitor (USDM) is the official and authoritative source for both drought coverage and the population affected by drought. The USDM provides weekly updates and maintains a map archive for historical comparison[1][4].
- The National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) publishes weekly drought reports summarizing the latest USDM data[5][2].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- The USDM’s “population affected” metric is calculated by overlaying drought areas with census population data, which may introduce some lag or uncertainty, especially near the 100 million threshold.
- The most recent reports do not specify the exact number of people affected, only the percentage of land area in drought. Since not all drought-affected areas are densely populated, the population affected may be well below the percentage of land area in drought.
- Rapid changes in weather patterns could alter drought coverage in the final weeks of December, but as of December 11, 2024, there is no indication of a dramatic shift.

### Conclusion

Based on the most recent data available as of December 11, 2024, the United States is experiencing significant drought, but the percentage of land area affected (36.8%) suggests that the number of residents living in drought is likely below 100 million. Unless there is a rapid and significant expansion of drought into more populous regions before December 31, 2024, it is unlikely that the threshold will be met.
