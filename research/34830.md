# Forecasting the Total Number of Forecasters in the Q1 2025 Quarterly Cup

The Metaculus Q1 2025 Quarterly Cup participation can be forecast by examining historical trends, recent platform changes, and user growth patterns. Below is an analysis of the available information as of February 8, 2025.

## Historical Participation Trends

Metaculus Quarterly Cups have historically attracted hundreds of forecasters, with participation numbers fluctuating over time:

| Quarter | Total forecasters |
| ------- | ----------------- |
| Q3 2023 | 842               |
| Q4 2023 | 838               |
| Q1 2024 | 709               |
| Q2 2024 | 1002              |
| Q3 2024 | 760               |
| Q4 2024 | 379               |

The data reveals several key patterns:
- Participation was relatively stable in Q3-Q4 2023 (around 840 forecasters)
- Q1 2024 saw a decline to 709 forecasters
- Q2 2024 experienced a significant surge to 1002 forecasters (the highest in this dataset)
- Q3 2024 returned to more typical levels with 760 forecasters
- Q4 2024 showed a dramatic drop to 379 forecasters, less than half of the previous quarter

The sharp decline in Q4 2024 participation coincided with a major site rewrite published in early October 2024, suggesting that technical changes and user experience disruptions may have significantly impacted user engagement.

## Recent Developments Affecting Q1 2025 Participation

Several significant developments in early 2025 could influence participation in the Q1 2025 Quarterly Cup:

1. **Record User Growth**: Metaculus experienced unprecedented user growth between January 27 and February 2, 2025, with 11,050 new sign-ups. This is nearly five times the previous weekly record of 2,348 set in October 2024.

2. **New Tournament Launches**: The platform launched three major tournaments in early 2025:
   - ACX2025
   - Brazil Prediction Tournament
   - 2025 Bridgewater Forecasting Contest

3. **Platform Improvements**: Following the Q4 2024 Quarterly Cup, Metaculus published a retrospective on January 21, 2025, which may have addressed issues from the site rewrite[4].

4. **Scoring System Changes**: Metaculus implemented changes to its scoring system, leaderboard, and medals, which could affect user engagement and participation patterns[2].

## Analysis and Uncertainties

The Q1 2025 Quarterly Cup participation forecast faces several key considerations:

1. **New User Conversion Rate**: While there has been a massive influx of new users (11,050 in a single week), it remains uncertain what percentage will participate in the Quarterly Cup versus focusing exclusively on the specialized tournaments that attracted them.

2. **Recovery from Q4 2024 Drop**: The Q4 2024 participation (379 forecasters) represented a significant anomaly compared to historical trends. The extent to which participation will recover depends on how successfully Metaculus has addressed the issues from the site rewrite.

3. **Seasonal Patterns**: Q1 participation has historically been lower than other quarters (709 in Q1 2024 compared to 1002 in Q2 2024), suggesting potential seasonal effects.

4. **Cross-Tournament Engagement**: The presence of high-profile tournaments (ACX2025, Brazil Prediction Tournament, Bridgewater Forecasting Contest) could either:
   - Divert attention away from the Quarterly Cup, reducing participation
   - Introduce new users to the platform who then discover and participate in the Quarterly Cup

5. **Platform Stability**: The success of recent platform improvements following the Q4 2024 disruption will significantly impact user willingness to participate.

Given these factors, the Q1 2025 Quarterly Cup participation will likely fall between the recent low of 379 (Q4 2024) and the historical high of 1002 (Q2 2024), with the massive user growth potentially pushing numbers toward the higher end of this range if even a small percentage of new users participate.
