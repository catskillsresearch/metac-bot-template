## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- SpaceX has become the dominant provider of US government space launch services, responsible for the vast majority of military, civil, and commercial launches in recent years (98 of 109 US launches in 2023; 138 of 145 in 2024)[2].
- Since 2008, SpaceX has been awarded over $20 billion in federal contracts and funding, with more than $9 billion paid out as of June 2025. The total potential value could exceed $89 billion if all contracts are fulfilled[1].
- High-value contracts include a $1.8 billion deal with the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) and a $5.9 billion NSSL Phase 3 Lane 2 launch program[1][2].
- Historically, even amid political tensions, contracts with essential national security suppliers have rarely been cancelled abruptly unless clear alternatives are available.

## 2. Recent Announcements and Policies

- After initially partnering with the Trump administration via the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), Elon Musk's relationship with Trump soured rapidly following Musk's May 30, 2025, exit from government advisory roles.
- Trump publicly threatened to terminate all federal contracts and subsidies for Musk's companies, specifically mentioning SpaceX, as a means of reducing government spending[1].
- Musk briefly announced plans to decommission the Dragon spacecraft (vital for ISS missions) in response, but reversed this decision hours later[1].
- As of June 24, 2025, there have been no official reports of contract terminations, and SpaceX remains integral to ongoing national security and civil space missions[2].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Contract awards and modifications are publicly reported by the Department of Defense[3] and can be tracked for signs of cancellation.
- Major news organizations (Reuters, Fox Business, Breaking Defense) have provided detailed coverage of the Trump-Musk dispute and SpaceX's government contract status[1][2].
- NASA and Space Force agency releases are additional primary sources for contract developments.

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- Some contracts, especially those related to defense and intelligence, may be classified or undisclosed, making real-time tracking difficult[1].
- The question’s resolution depends on “credible sources,” and if only partial cancellations or renegotiations occur, estimating the total value may require expert judgment or third-party estimates.
- Political volatility and the lack of operational alternatives to SpaceX create both risk and inertia, making abrupt, large-scale cancellations plausible but operationally challenging.

## Probabilistic Assessment

Given the operational reliance on SpaceX for critical launches, the lack of alternative providers ready to assume those roles, and the absence (as of June 24, 2025) of any reported contract cancellations, the probability that contracts totaling at least $1 billion will be cancelled before September 2025 remains **low to moderate**. However, the risk is significantly elevated compared to historical baselines due to:

- Direct presidential threats and public animosity,
- Musk’s own provocative statements and temporary actions,
- The political incentive for Trump to demonstrate budget-cutting.

**Estimated probability:**  
- 15–25% chance that, before September 1, 2025, credible reports will confirm cancellation of SpaceX contracts with US agencies totaling at least $1 billion.

This is higher than in a typical political dispute but still not the base case, given the critical national security and civil spaceflight dependencies on SpaceX.
