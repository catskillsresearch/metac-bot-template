# Forecasting Russian Territorial Control in Ukraine by January 1, 2025

As of late 2024, the Russia-Ukraine war continues with evolving dynamics that will determine territorial control at the start of 2025. This analysis examines the available evidence to help forecast whether Russia will significantly expand its controlled territory in Ukraine by January 1, 2025.

## Current Territorial Situation

As of 2024, Russia maintains control over several key areas in Ukraine, including:

- Crimea (including Simferopol)
- Parts of Donetsk Oblast (including Donetsk city)
- Parts of Luhansk Oblast (including Svatove)
- Parts of Zaporizhzhia Oblast (including Tokmak)
- Parts of Kherson Oblast (including Nova Kakhovka)[5]

Russia's territorial strategy has evolved from attempting large-scale offensives to a more methodical approach of making smaller, incremental gains. Throughout 2024, Russia has been implementing what analysts describe as a strategy of "death by a thousand cuts" - subjecting Ukraine to slow but persistent territorial losses through multiple small-scale assaults rather than dramatic large offensives[1].

## Russian Strategic Objectives

Russia's territorial ambitions in Ukraine appear to operate along a spectrum of acceptable outcomes. According to strategic assessments, Russia's minimum acceptable territorial outcome includes:

1. Retention of the Donbas region
2. Maintaining the land bridge to Crimea (including Zaporizhzhia and Kherson oblasts)
3. Continued control of Crimea[5]

The land bridge is particularly important as it provides Russia with a ground-based connection between occupied Donbas and Crimea, simplifying governance, defense, and retention of these territories[5].

## Military Capabilities and Challenges

### Russian Forces

Russian military capabilities were projected to peak in late 2024, with increasing material challenges expected throughout 2025[4]. Despite these challenges, Russia has demonstrated the ability to sustain its military operations through industrial mobilization and manpower recruitment.

Putin has indicated an intention to implement his strategy of gradual territorial acquisition indefinitely, although domestic support for this approach remains a variable factor[1]. Russia's theory of victory relies on Ukraine's international partners failing to properly resource the Ukrainian Armed Forces (AFU)[4].

### Ukrainian Forces

Ukraine's ability to defend its territory and potentially reclaim lost areas depends heavily on continued international support. As of early 2024, Ukraine had "limited prospects for overturning Russian territorial annexations and troop reinforcements of stolen territory"[5]. However, some experts suggested that with sufficient support, particularly longer-range weapons, Ukraine could potentially defeat Russia's invasion in 2025[2].

## Expert Assessments for 2025

Military analysts have identified 2025 as potentially decisive in the conflict's trajectory. Some experts suggested that 2025 could be a "year of decision" in the Ukraine war[2]. However, the direction of this decision remains uncertain.

According to a Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) assessment from February 2024, "if Ukraine's partners continue to provide sufficient ammunition and training support to the AFU to enable the blunting of Russian attacks in 2024, then Russia is unlikely to achieve significant gains in 2025"[4]. This suggests that without a significant change in international support patterns, major Russian territorial expansion by January 2025 might be limited.

The same assessment noted that "if Russia lacks the prospect of gains in 2025, given its inability to improve force quality for offensive operations, then it follows that it will struggle to force Kyiv to capitulate by 2026"[4].

## Factors Influencing Territorial Control by January 2025

Several key factors will influence the territorial situation by January 1, 2025:

1. **International Support for Ukraine**: The level and consistency of military aid from Western partners remains crucial. Any significant reduction could create opportunities for Russian advances[4].

2. **Winter Operations**: Both Ukraine and Russia were planning their 2024 winter operations as of mid-2024[1]. The success or failure of these operations will directly impact territorial control at the start of 2025.

3. **Russian Military Sustainability**: While Russia has shown resilience in sustaining its war effort, material challenges were expected to increase in 2025, potentially limiting offensive capabilities[4].

4. **Ukrainian Defensive Capabilities**: Ukraine's ability to blunt Russian attacks in late 2024 will be critical in determining the territorial situation at the beginning of 2025[4].

5. **Technological Developments**: The rapidly evolving technological environment, particularly in drone warfare, could create strategic surprises that influence the trajectory of the war[1].

## Conclusion

Based on available information as of late 2024, Russia's ability to significantly expand its territorial control by January 1, 2025 appears contingent on several factors, particularly the level of international support for Ukraine. Expert assessments suggest that with continued Western backing, Russia would face challenges in making major territorial gains in early 2025[4]. However, Russia's strategy of incremental advances could still result in some territorial expansion, especially if international support for Ukraine wavers or if Russian winter operations prove successful[1][5].

The situation remains fluid, with both sides adapting their strategies in response to battlefield developments and international dynamics. While Russia maintains territorial ambitions, its ability to achieve significant expansion by January 2025 faces substantial military and logistical constraints[4].
