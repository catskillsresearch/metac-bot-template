## Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of March 2022, there were approximately 12,700 nuclear warheads globally, with about 2,000 on high alert—ready to launch on short notice. This marks a significant decline from the peak of 70,300 weapons observed in 1986, reflecting decades of arms control and bilateral disarmament agreements[4].
- Despite this reduction, not a single nuclear-armed state has fully eliminated its arsenal, and no nuclear warhead has been physically destroyed under a comprehensive, verified global disarmament regime[2].
- The U.S. and Russia possess the vast majority of warheads, with smaller stockpiles maintained by other nuclear-armed states (China, France, UK, India, Pakistan, Israel, North Korea)[4].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- The Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW) entered into force in 2021, representing a legal and normative effort to stigmatize and delegitimize nuclear weapons. By the end of 2022, 91 countries had signed and 68 had ratified the TPNW. However, none of the nine nuclear-armed states have joined[5].
- The NPT remains the cornerstone of nuclear arms control. While the NPT has facilitated reductions, its disarmament pillar remains incomplete: nuclear-armed states continue to modernize their arsenals and assert the necessity of deterrence for national security[1][3].
- In 2022 and 2023, TPNW member states adopted action plans and declarations rejecting nuclear deterrence and advocating further for disarmament, but practical progress toward full elimination among nuclear-armed states has been limited[3][5].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The Federation of American Scientists, the United Nations Office for Disarmament Affairs (UNODA), and the Nuclear Weapons Ban Monitor provide regular, transparent reporting on global arsenals and treaty progress[4][3][2].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- Reporting on warhead numbers is subject to classification, estimation, and potential undercounting, especially in states where transparency is limited[4].
- The emergence of new technologies, shifts in security environments, or major geopolitical realignments could alter nuclear postures in ways that are unpredictable from a 2022 vantage point.

## Key Differences Affecting the Forecast

- The pace of reduction has slowed, with some states increasing or modernizing their arsenals after years of decline[4].
- Major nuclear-armed states have not joined the TPNW and continue to justify possession on the grounds of deterrence[5].
- Disarmament advocacy and normative pressure have increased, but without binding commitments from nuclear-armed states, the practical impact is limited[5][3].
- No international authority currently exists with a mandate and capacity to verify the complete elimination of all warheads[3].

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Based on historical trends, current policies, and the lack of binding commitments from nuclear-armed states, the probability that the world will be entirely free of assembled nuclear warheads at any point before 2075 is very low—likely well below 10% as of 2022. While further reductions are plausible, complete elimination remains highly unlikely in the absence of major, currently unforeseen geopolitical shifts or breakthroughs in international governance and verification.
