## Key Historical Trends and Current Status (as of 2018-08-30)

- Early clinical research (2016) demonstrated that a single dose of psilocybin could significantly reduce depression and anxiety in patients with life-threatening cancer, with effects lasting at least six months[1].
- Studies at NYU and Johns Hopkins found that psilocybin-assisted therapy provided profound existential relief and improved quality of life for terminally ill patients, suggesting transformative potential beyond symptom management[1][5].
- The U.S. FDA granted psilocybin “breakthrough therapy” designation for treatment-resistant depression in 2018, which accelerates the development and review process but does not guarantee approval for other indications like EOL anxiety[5].
- As of 2018, psilocybin remained a Schedule I controlled substance in the U.S., leading to research being expensive and highly regulated, with DEA oversight needed in addition to FDA approval[5].
- Experts cited in mainstream media expressed optimism that psilocybin could become an accepted treatment for depression within a decade (i.e., by 2027), but specific forecasts for EOL anxiety were less certain.

## Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Metric

- The FDA’s “breakthrough therapy” designation in 2018 signaled regulatory openness to psychedelic therapies for severe psychiatric conditions[5].
- Political uncertainty in the U.S. Department of Justice raised concerns that non-FDA agencies (like the DEA) could slow progress, despite some pro-business signals from the administration[5].
- The lack of commercial incentives for drug developers, due to psilocybin’s public domain status, limited pharmaceutical investment and could slow large-scale, late-stage trials needed for approval[5].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Peer-reviewed studies published in the Journal of Psychopharmacology and JAMA Psychiatry (Ross et al., 2016; Griffiths et al., 2016; Grob et al., 2020)[1][5].
- Announcements and regulatory designations from the U.S. FDA regarding psilocybin’s breakthrough status[5].
- Statements from leading researchers and coverage in reputable science and health media outlets[5].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- While early results are promising, pivotal Phase 3 trials for EOL anxiety were not completed as of 2018, and regulatory approval requires robust replication of efficacy and safety.
- Approval for depression may occur first, and the narrower indication of EOL anxiety could face additional hurdles due to smaller patient populations and unique regulatory scrutiny.
- The role of the DEA and shifting U.S. federal policy could introduce further unpredictability into the approval timeline.
- Public and political attitudes toward psychedelics, as well as the lack of strong commercial incentives, could delay or complicate the approval process.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment (as of 2018-08-30)

Given the strong early clinical evidence, regulatory signals (breakthrough designation), and expert optimism for depression, but noting the additional barriers for EOL anxiety and the slow pace of psychiatric drug approval, a reasonable forecast as of mid-2018 would place the probability of psilocybin achieving clinical approval for EOL anxiety by 2027 in the range of 40-60%. The Qualia Research Institute’s 75% estimate likely reflects very optimistic assumptions regarding regulatory and political acceleration.
