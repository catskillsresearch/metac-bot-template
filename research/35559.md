# Will Rafał Trzaskowski be Elected President of Poland in 2025?

The upcoming Polish presidential election on May 18, 2025, represents a critical juncture in Polish politics. With incumbent President Andrzej Duda ineligible to run for a third term, this election could potentially end the Law and Justice (PiS) party's last hold on power in Poland's government[4]. Here's an analysis of the current situation and factors that may influence whether Rafał Trzaskowski will win the presidency.

## Current Polling Status

As of late April 2025, Rafał Trzaskowski, representing the Civic Coalition, leads in the polls:

- The latest IBRiS poll (conducted April 25-26, 2025) shows Trzaskowski with 33.2% support[5]
- His main challenger, Karol Nawrocki (backed by PiS), stands at 25.6%[5]
- Other candidates trail significantly: Sławomir Mentzen (Confederation) at 11.5%, Szymon Hołownia (Third Way) at 6.1%, and Magdalena Biejat (New Left) at 5.1%[5]

This polling suggests that no candidate is likely to secure the required 50% of votes in the first round, necessitating a second-round runoff on June 1, 2025, between the top two candidates (likely Trzaskowski and Nawrocki)[4][5].

## Recent Trends and Developments

While Trzaskowski maintains his frontrunner status, there are signs of a shifting race:

- Over the last month, Nawrocki has "dramatically reduced the gap in polls" to Trzaskowski[1]
- Trzaskowski's support has shown some stability since the official campaign launch in January 2025, with a slight increase from 30.8% in mid-April to 33.2% in late April[3][5]

## Political Context

The election takes place amid significant political transitions in Poland:

- The Civic Coalition, led by Donald Tusk's Civic Platform (PO), defeated PiS in the October 2023 parliamentary elections[2]
- The Civic Coalition also won the European elections in June 2024 with 37.06% of the vote[2]
- Poland is currently experiencing a difficult period of cohabitation between President Duda (PiS) and Prime Minister Tusk (Civic Coalition)[2]
- Tusk has repeatedly stated that Duda's presidency has prevented implementation of promised reforms[2]

This context is crucial because the presidential election could determine whether Tusk's government can fully implement its agenda. In Poland, the president has veto power over legislation, and the current parliamentary majority lacks the three-fifths majority needed to override presidential vetoes[2].

## Factors That May Influence the Outcome

Several factors could impact Trzaskowski's chances of victory:

1. **Second-round dynamics**: If the election goes to a second round as expected, the distribution of votes from eliminated candidates will be crucial. How supporters of candidates like Mentzen, Hołownia, and Biejat vote in a Trzaskowski-Nawrocki runoff could determine the winner.

2. **Urban-rural divide**: Poland has experienced significant political polarization between urban and rural areas, which could affect regional voting patterns.

3. **Campaign developments**: With the election still about a week away, campaign events, debates, and potential controversies could shift voter sentiment.

4. **Voter turnout**: Differential turnout among various demographic groups could significantly impact the final results.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several limitations should be considered when interpreting this forecast:

1. **Polling accuracy**: Polls represent a snapshot in time and may not accurately predict final voting behavior, especially in a polarized political environment.

2. **Narrowing race**: The fact that Nawrocki has been closing the gap suggests the race may be more competitive than earlier polls indicated[1].

3. **Undecided voters**: The polls don't clearly indicate the percentage of undecided voters, who could swing the election in either direction.

4. **Second-round uncertainties**: Predicting second-round voting behavior is particularly challenging, as it depends on complex voter preference transfers.

While Trzaskowski currently leads in the polls, the race appears to be tightening, and the outcome will likely depend on second-round dynamics if neither candidate secures an outright majority on May 18.
