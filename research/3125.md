## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- From 2009–2019, the United States ranked #12 among countries with the largest deterioration in Fragile States Index (FSI) score—signifying a notable, but not extreme, decline in stability[1].
- As of 2024, the US FSI score stands at 44.5, down from a recent peak of 46.6 in 2022, but still higher (worse) than the 2008 low of 32.8. The long-term trend since 2008 is one of steady worsening, though recent years hint at possible stabilization[5].
- Countries with the most rapid FSI deterioration in recent years have typically been those experiencing acute crises—violent conflict, political collapse, or natural disasters—resulting in much sharper, short-term increases in their FSI scores[1].

## Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Metric

- The US has faced several stressors in recent years, including heightened political polarization, civil unrest, and the COVID-19 pandemic.
- However, these have not translated into the kind of systemic breakdowns seen in the most rapidly deteriorating countries.
- No major new US government policies as of April 2020 seemed likely to result in abrupt, dramatic changes to the FSI trajectory comparable to countries experiencing coups, wars, or state collapse.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- The FSI’s ranking is relative; the US’s position in the top 20 depends on global trends, not just domestic ones.
- The index is sensitive to acute shocks—unpredictable events could push the US higher or lower in the rankings.
- Changes in FSI methodology or interruptions in publication could affect long-term comparability.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given that the US was #12 in deterioration for 2009–2019 but has faced less acute, systemic instability than countries in active conflict or collapse, and noting the recent trend toward stabilization, it is somewhat less likely that the US will remain in the top 20 deteriorators for the 2019–2029 period. A reasonable estimate, as of April 2020, would assign a probability of approximately 25–40% that the US remains among the 20 countries with the largest FSI score increase over the decade—lower than a simple extrapolation of the previous trend, due to the likelihood of more acute crises in other states overtaking the US in the deterioration ranking.
