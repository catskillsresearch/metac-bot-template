## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The US dollar’s share of global foreign exchange reserves has steadily declined over the past decade, dropping from about 65% in 2014 to 57.4% by Q3 2024, the lowest since 1994[2][4][5].
- This decline averages about 0.9 percentage points per year over the last decade, with the most recent quarters continuing this gradual trend (e.g., 58.3% in Q2 2024 to 57.4% in Q3 2024)[4][5].
- Despite the decline, the US dollar remains dominant compared to other major currencies: the euro is at 20%, yen at 6%, pound sterling at 5%, and renminbi at 2%[5].

## 2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- The 2024 US presidential election resulted in Donald Trump’s return to office, raising the prospect of increased tariffs and other protectionist measures[4]. Analysts suggest such moves could undermine global trust in the dollar’s stability, potentially accelerating the search for alternatives[4].
- However, the dollar’s "safe haven" role in periods of global uncertainty remains strong, which could slow any exodus from dollar reserves if geopolitical or financial instability rises[4].
- The "weaponization" of the dollar—using it for sanctions and political leverage—has also motivated some countries to diversify their reserves, but suitable large-scale alternatives remain limited[4].
- Expert consensus (e.g., OMFIF, Columbia Threadneedle) anticipates a further 10 percentage point decline in the dollar’s reserve share over the next decade, but this is a gradual process, not an imminent collapse[3][4].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The International Monetary Fund’s COFER database is the definitive source for quarterly measurements of global foreign exchange reserves and their currency composition[1][4][5].
- Additional analysis and commentary come from institutions such as Chatham House, OMFIF, and the Atlantic Council[2][4][5].

## 4. Limitations or Uncertainties in Measurement

- IMF COFER data covers 93% of total global reserves, making it highly representative but not fully comprehensive[4].
- Forecasts are subject to uncertainty from geopolitical shocks, disruptive financial innovations (e.g., digital currencies), and major policy shifts by the US or reserve-accumulating countries[4].

## 5. Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

- At the current pace of decline (about 0.5–1 percentage point per year), the dollar’s share would likely remain above 50% through Q3 2028. Four years from Q3 2024 (57.4%) at a 1 percentage point annual decline projects to about 53.4% by Q3 2028—still above the 50% threshold[4][5].
- While there is risk of acceleration in de-dollarization due to US policy shifts or rapid adoption of alternatives, there is no strong evidence that such a dramatic shift will occur in the next four years.
- Therefore, the probability that the US dollar remains above 50% of global allocated FX reserves through Q3 2028 is high—estimated at 75–85%, barring unforeseen systemic shocks.
