## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Justin Trudeau served as Prime Minister of Canada for nearly a decade, but by late 2024 and early 2025, his popularity had sharply declined, and there was mounting pressure within his party for him to step down[5].
- On January 6, 2025, Trudeau publicly announced his intention to resign as both Prime Minister and leader of the Liberal Party, stating he would remain in office until a new party leader was selected[1][2][5].
- The Liberal Party organized a leadership race, culminating in Mark Carney being elected as the new leader on March 9, 2025[3].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- During the transition period, Trudeau continued to serve as Prime Minister and responded to significant policy challenges, including new US tariffs on Canadian goods[3].
- Mark Carney was sworn in as Prime Minister on March 14, 2025, following his victory in the leadership race[3].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The transition was widely reported by major news outlets and is documented in reputable sources such as Wikipedia, PBS, and CPAC[1][3][5].
- The United Nations Heads of State list would reflect Mark Carney as Prime Minister after March 14, 2025, confirming the change in leadership per the resolution criteria.

## Limitations or Uncertainties

- All available sources consistently state that Trudeau ceased to be Prime Minister on March 14, 2025, which is before April 1, 2025[3].
