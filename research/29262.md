# Forecasting H5 Virus Risk Rating by CDC IRAT Before January 1, 2025

Based on available information as of October 2024, here is an analysis of factors relevant to forecasting whether an H5 virus will receive a "high" emergence risk rating (â‰¥8.0) from the CDC's Influenza Risk Assessment Tool (IRAT) before January 1, 2025.

## Current Status and Historical Trends

The most recent IRAT assessment for an H5N1 virus was published on August 9, 2024, evaluating the A/Texas/37/2024 strain (clade 2.3.4.4b)[1][3]. This assessment resulted in an emergence risk score of 5.79, placing it in the "moderate risk" category (scores between 4.0-7.9)[1]. This assessment was based on data available through June 26, 2024[2].

Historically, CDC has assessed multiple H5N1 viruses using the IRAT framework:

- A/American wigeon/South Carolina/AH0195145/2021 (clade 2.3.4.4b): Scored in the moderate risk category[1][2]
- A/mink/Spain/3691-8_22VIR10586-10/2022 (clade 2.3.4.4b): Scored 5.13 for emergence potential, also in the moderate risk category[4]

All recent H5N1 assessments have consistently fallen within the moderate risk range (4.0-7.9), with none approaching the high risk threshold of 8.0 or above[1][2][4].

## Recent Developments and Potential Impact

The CDC conducted its most recent IRAT assessment for the A/Texas/37/2024 virus prior to additional human cases reported in Colorado (as noted in the June 26, 2024 data cutoff)[2]. This suggests that new data from subsequent cases could potentially influence future assessments.

The CDC has indicated that "assessing risk is an iterative process with new information being assimilated regularly and response activities adjusted as indicated"[2]. This suggests that the CDC continues to monitor the situation and may update its assessment if significant new data emerges.

It's worth noting that the IRAT evaluates multiple risk elements to determine emergence potential, including:
- Human infections
- Transmission in animal models
- Receptor binding
- Population immunity
- Infections in animals
- Genomic analysis
- Antigenic relatedness
- Global distribution of animals
- Disease severity and pathogenesis

Significant changes in any of these factors could potentially influence future risk assessments.

## Verification Sources

The CDC regularly publishes IRAT assessments and updates on its website. Key resources include:

1. The CDC's Influenza Risk Assessment Tool (IRAT) Virus Descriptions page, which contains historical and current assessments[2]
2. The CDC's Bird Flu Response Updates, which provide regular information about ongoing monitoring and assessment activities[3][4]
3. Published IRAT Virus Reports, such as the August 2024 report on A/Texas/37/2024[1]

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors limit our ability to forecast whether an H5 virus will receive a high risk rating before January 1, 2025:

1. The IRAT assessment process is responsive to new data and evolving situations, making it difficult to predict future scores with certainty[2]
2. The most recent assessment was based on data through June 26, 2024, and subsequent developments could influence future assessments[2]
3. The search results do not indicate any clear trend toward increasing risk scores for H5 viruses; all recent assessments have remained in the moderate risk category[1][2][4]
4. The time required to collect sufficient data, conduct assessments, and publish results means that even if conditions change, there may be a lag before updated IRAT scores are released

Based on the available information, while the CDC continues to monitor H5 viruses closely, there is no clear indication in the current data that suggests an imminent shift from moderate to high risk categorization before January 1, 2025.
