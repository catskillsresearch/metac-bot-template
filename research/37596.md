## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Elio is a new Pixar animated film set for domestic theatrical release on June 20, 2025[1][3][5].
- Pixar’s original films (not sequels/franchises) have shown a wide range in opening weekend performance. Notably:
  - Inside Out ($90M, 2015), Coco ($50M, 2017), Onward ($39M, 2020, pandemic-affected), Elemental ($29.6M, 2023)[own knowledge].
- Recent years have seen Pixar originals struggle to match pre-pandemic openings, due in part to shifting streaming strategies and post-pandemic audience habits.
- However, summer 2025 is showing signs of animation box office recovery, with recent family releases exceeding tracking expectations[own knowledge].
- Elio’s release date puts it in a favorable summer slot with schools out, but it may face competition from other family offerings.

## 2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- Elio was delayed from March 2024 to June 2025, giving it a major summer release slot[3].
- Several key voice cast and director changes were announced, with Zoe Saldaña replacing America Ferrera and new directors coming on board in August 2024[3].
- Marketing has ramped up with multiple official trailers released in March and May 2025, indicating a standard pre-release campaign[2][4][5].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The definitive source for opening weekend domestic gross will be Box Office Mojo’s tracking page for Elio, which defines "domestic" as U.S., Canada, and Puerto Rico[3].

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- As of June 4, 2025, there are no published industry tracking numbers or pre-sales data for Elio’s opening weekend.
- Audience turnout for original animated films remains somewhat unpredictable post-pandemic.
- Critical reception and final marketing push may still influence the opening.

## 5. Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given these factors, the most likely domestic opening weekend gross for Elio is in the $35M–$45M range. This reflects:
- The historical performance of comparable Pixar originals.
- The summer release slot, which may boost attendance relative to recent Pixar openings.
- The lack of franchise recognition, which typically limits upside potential.
- The ongoing recovery of the family box office segment.

A reasonable probabilistic assessment would be:
- 70% probability: Elio opens between $30M and $45M
- 20% probability: Elio opens above $45M (if word-of-mouth or reviews are unusually strong)
- 10% probability: Elio opens below $30M (if competition or reception is weak)

Measurement will be according to the domestic gross reported by Box Office Mojo as of the close of opening weekend[3].
