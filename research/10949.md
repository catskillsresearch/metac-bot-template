## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of May 25, 2022, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine represented the largest European conflict since World War II, with significant casualties and major international condemnation—141 out of 193 UN members demanded Russia’s withdrawal from Ukraine[1][2].
- Russian leadership has historically reversed the policies of predecessors under certain conditions. After the Bolshevik Revolution (1917), Soviet leaders condemned imperial wars of the Tsarist era. In 1985, Mikhail Gorbachev withdrew Soviet forces from Afghanistan, calling the war a mistake and shifting Soviet foreign policy[1].
- While the Russian state, under Vladimir Putin, justified the Ukraine invasion using irredentist and security-driven narratives, some senior former officials (e.g., retired Col. Gen. Leonid Ivashov) publicly criticized the war, indicating a degree of elite dissent[1].

## 2. Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Metric

- As of the reference date, the Kremlin maintained strong domestic control and harshly suppressed anti-war protests, with little sign of organized opposition among the ruling elite.
- However, isolated voices among retired military and intelligence figures criticized the war, highlighting potential cracks in elite consensus[1].
- Internationally, Russia faced unprecedented sanctions and diplomatic isolation, increasing the cost of continued occupation and providing strong incentives for future leaders to reconsider the war’s legacy[2].

## 3. Comparison to Reference Cases

| Factor                                   | 1917 Regime Change         | Gorbachev/USSR–Afghanistan | Post-2022 Russia–Ukraine           |
|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Nature of War                            | Imperialist expansion      | Costly, unpopular invasion | Major invasion, “existential” framing |
| Level of Elite Dissent                    | High, revolutionary        | High, reformist leadership | Low but present (retired figures)  |
| International Pressure                    | High                       | High                       | Extreme (sanctions, isolation)     |
| Domestic Control by Incumbent             | Collapsed                  | Reformist transition       | Strong (as of 2022)                |
| Leader’s Justification of War             | Imperial glory             | Mistaken intervention      | Security, “denazification”         |
| Precedents for Reversal/Withdrawal        | Yes                        | Yes                        | Possible, but less likely soon     |

## 4. Key Differences Affecting the Forecast

- Putin’s regime, as of May 2022, exhibited far more centralized control and repression than late-Soviet or early-20th-century Russia, reducing the likelihood of open elite dissent[1].
- The ideological justification for the Ukraine war is tightly woven into the regime’s legitimacy, making repudiation riskier for a successor.
- However, historical precedents show that when leadership changes follow major crises, new leaders sometimes attempt to distance themselves from disastrous policies to gain legitimacy.
- The war’s costs—military, economic, and reputational—are mounting, which could incentivize a future leader to disapprove of or reverse Putin’s course, especially if the regime weakens or collapses[1][2].

## 5. Probabilistic Assessment (as of May 25, 2022)

Given:

- The presence of some elite dissent, but not yet at the critical mass seen in prior regime changes.
- The extreme international pressure and domestic costs.
- Historical precedents for repudiation following failed or costly wars.
- The strong domestic control and narrative invested in the war by Putin’s regime.

**A reasonable probabilistic assessment (as of May 25, 2022):**

- Probability that the next Russian leader will, by 2030, disapprove of the invasion (by statement or withdrawal/return of territory as defined): approximately 25–40%.
- Probability that the next Russian leader will maintain continuity or avoid explicit disapproval through 2030: approximately 60–75%.

## 6. Limitations and Uncertainties

- Succession scenarios are highly unpredictable in authoritarian systems; a sudden collapse could yield a reformist leader, while a managed transition may produce a continuity figure.
- Public opinion is difficult to gauge due to repression and propaganda; elite attitudes may shift in response to battlefield or economic shocks.
- The definition of “disapproval” is clear in the resolution criteria but may be difficult to measure if a leader expresses regret without policy change, or vice versa.
- External factors (military defeat, economic collapse, or international negotiation) could accelerate or delay a leadership transition and alter incentives for policy reversal.
