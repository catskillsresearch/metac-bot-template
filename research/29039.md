# Will the Botswana Democratic Party win the 2024 general election?

The Botswana Democratic Party (BDP) has maintained an unbroken record of electoral victories since Botswana's independence in 1966. As the October 30, 2024, general election approaches, several factors suggest the party is positioned to secure another term in power, despite facing significant challenges.

## Historical Electoral Performance

The BDP has experienced a gradual decline in popular support over recent decades:

- Support for the BDP has steadily decreased since 1979[5]
- In the 2014 general election, the party's popular vote fell below 50% for the first time[5]
- During the 2019 general election, the BDP rebounded to secure 52% of the popular vote[3]

This historical pattern shows that while the BDP's dominance has weakened over time, the party has maintained sufficient support to win elections within Botswana's first-past-the-post electoral system.

## Current Political Landscape

### BDP's Position

Recent analyses from global research firms provide a favorable outlook for the BDP:

- Fitch Solutions/Business Monitor International (BMI) anticipates that the BDP will secure victory in the October 2024 elections[1]
- BMI predicts that President Mokgweetsi Masisi will secure a second presidential term, which would mark the BDP's fourteenth consecutive electoral win[2]

However, public opinion surveys present a more challenging picture:

- The 2022 Afrobarometer survey found that only 22.3% of respondents would vote for the BDP in a national election[5]

### Opposition Fragmentation

The most significant factor favoring the BDP appears to be the disunity among opposition parties:

- The Umbrella for Democratic Change (UDC), the main opposition coalition, has experienced significant fragmentation[1]
- The Botswana Patriotic Front (BPF) announced its withdrawal from the UDC on April 6, 2023, choosing to contest the election independently[1]
- This followed the departure of the Botswana Congress Party (BCP) from the UDC in June 2023[1]
- The BCP had been the UDC member that secured the most seats in the 2019 elections[1]

According to BMI, "The failure of the UDC to form a stable coalition significantly enhances the BDP's prospects of retaining its parliamentary majority."[1]

## Expert Assessments

Political analysts and research institutions have provided the following assessments:

- BMI states: "This bodes well for the incumbent President Mokgweetsi Masisi, who we expect will secure a second presidential term"[2]
- The same report notes: "Given Botswana's history of political stability, we expect that risks to social stability will remain muted in the run-up to the election"[2]

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors create uncertainty in forecasting the election outcome:

1. **Limited polling data**: The only referenced opinion poll is the 2022 Afrobarometer survey, which showed low support for the BDP. More recent polling would provide better insight into current voter intentions.

2. **Opposition potential**: Despite fragmentation, opposition parties express confidence. The UDC spokesperson Moeti Mohwasa indicated they are ready for the elections and believes they are "ahead of the ruling BDP" in terms of human resources[3].

3. **Declining BDP support**: The long-term trend of decreasing support for the BDP suggests potential vulnerability, even if opposition disunity favors the incumbent party.

## Conclusion

Based on the available information, analysts predict that the BDP will win the October 2024 general election, primarily due to opposition fragmentation rather than the party's own popularity. The withdrawal of key parties from the UDC opposition coalition has significantly weakened the main challenger to the BDP's rule. However, the BDP's declining popular support over decades and poor showing in recent opinion polls indicate potential vulnerability if opposition forces were to unify effectively.

The most authoritative assessment comes from BMI, which explicitly forecasts a BDP victory and continuation of the party's decades-long rule in Botswana.
