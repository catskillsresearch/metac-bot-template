## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- **Public Opinion on Gene Editing for Intelligence:** A 2020 Pew Research poll found that only 17% of Americans considered it appropriate to change a baby’s genetics to make them more intelligent. Party breakdowns from a 2015 poll showed 18% of Democrats and 13% of Republicans supportive—indicating slightly more support among Democrats[2].
- **Association with Eugenics:** Some left-leaning commentators have explicitly associated embryo selection with eugenics, suggesting a potential for increased partisan polarization, but this has not translated into greater Republican support[2].
- **Legislative and Platform Trends:** The Republican Party has increasingly supported policies that restrict reproductive technologies involving embryos, including IVF, citing fetal personhood and religious liberty[1][4]. Democrats have generally supported expanded access to these technologies[3][4].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- **GOP Platform and IVF:** The 2024 Republican platform includes support for "fetal personhood," which threatens processes like IVF that involve embryo manipulation. This stance places the party at odds with even non-therapeutic uses of embryo selection[1].
- **Congressional Voting Patterns:** In 2024, Senate Republicans overwhelmingly blocked legislation to protect access to IVF, with only two Republicans breaking ranks, while Democrats uniformly supported such measures[3][4].
- **No Direct Votes on Embryo Selection for Intelligence:** As of February 2022, there have been no Congressional votes specifically on embryo selection for intelligence, so related votes and platform positions serve as proxies.

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Pew Research Center polls on gene editing and public opinion[2].
- Official party platforms and Congressional voting records on IVF and embryo-related legislation[1][3][4].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- **Poll Data Limitations:** Polls asking about gene editing for intelligence are rare, and attitudes may shift as the technology becomes more prominent.
- **Proxy Measurement:** Since no Congressional vote on embryo selection for intelligence has occurred as of 2022, forecasts rely on related technologies and issues.
- **Evolving Party Dynamics:** Party stances could shift if embryo selection becomes a more salient or differently framed political issue.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Based on available polling, party platforms, and recent legislative behavior, it is unlikely that Republicans will support embryo selection for intelligence more than Democrats if a Congressional vote were held in the near future. The most probable outcome, given current trends, is that Democrats will show greater support than Republicans for permitting embryo selection for intelligence.
