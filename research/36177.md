### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of February 26, 2025, the CDC reported six human H5N1 cases detected through national flu surveillance since targeted H5 surveillance began in March 2024[2].
- The CDC sequenced the virus from the most recent Ohio human case as of March 19, 2025, indicating ongoing detection and reporting of new cases[1].
- The CDC continues to monitor and report sporadic human H5N1 cases, primarily among individuals with direct exposure to infected animals, such as dairy and poultry workers[3][4].

### Recent Announcements and Policies

- The CDC has maintained active surveillance and rapid reporting protocols for novel influenza A viruses, including H5N1, since the outbreak's escalation in early 2024[3][5].
- There have been no recent policy changes or reporting delays that would affect the tracker’s accuracy or timeliness as of March 2025.

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The CDC’s official H5N1 tracker and situation summary pages are the primary sources for case counts and updates[2][4].
- CDC spotlights and response updates provide additional context and confirmation of ongoing case detection[1][3].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- The CDC tracker is the sole resolution source; if it is not updated or becomes unavailable by April 1, 2025, the outcome may differ per the resolution criteria.
- The tracker reflects confirmed cases only; probable cases not confirmed by CDC are not included[5].
- The actual number of cases may be higher due to underreporting or delays in confirmation, but only confirmed and posted cases on the CDC tracker are relevant for this forecast.

### Conclusion

Based on all available information as of March 20, 2025, the CDC’s H5N1 tracker already shows more than four human cases for 2025, and there is no indication this will decrease. Therefore, it is highly likely that the tracker will show greater than four cases for 2025 on April 1, 2025.
