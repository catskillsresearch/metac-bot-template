### Key Factual Information Relevant to the Forecast

- As of February 24, 2025, the CDC had confirmed three human cases of H5N1 in the United States for 2025[3].
- The CDC's March 19, 2025 update does not report any additional 2025 cases beyond those previously confirmed; it only provides cumulative totals since April 2024[1].
- No CDC or WHO announcements between February 26 and March 19, 2025, indicate that the number of confirmed 2025 cases has exceeded three[1][3].
- The CDC tracker referenced in the question is updated based on confirmed cases and is the authoritative source for this metric.
- There is evidence of possible undercounting due to asymptomatic or mild cases, but only laboratory-confirmed cases are included in the tracker[5].
- The CDC tracker may update retroactively, but as of the knowledge cutoff, there is no indication that more than three cases for 2025 would be shown by April 1, 2025[3][1].

#### Authoritative Sources
- CDC H5N1 tracker and situation updates[1][3][4]
- CDC press releases and spotlights[2]
- Peer-reviewed studies and news coverage of CDC surveillance[5]

#### Limitations and Uncertainties
- Surveillance gaps may mean actual infections are higher, but only confirmed cases are counted on the CDC tracker[5].
- The tracker could be updated retroactively, but no evidence as of March 20, 2025, suggests this will occur before April 1, 2025.

### Conclusion

Based on all available information as of March 20, 2025, the CDC's H5N1 tracker is highly unlikely to show more than 4 human cases for the United States in 2025 by April 1, 2025. The confirmed count remains at three, with no indication of imminent updates that would push the total above four[3][1].
