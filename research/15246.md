## 1. Historical Trends and Current Status

- The Treaty on the Creation of a Union State (1999) set ambitious goals for integration, including a shared head of state, currency, legislature, and policies. However, major elements such as a common currency, harmonized laws, and merged foreign policy have not materialized. Belarus has historically resisted full loss of sovereignty, and the Union State remained largely a framework for cooperation rather than a true federation[4].
- Economic ties have deepened: By 2024, trade turnover between Russia and Belarus reached nearly $60 billion, with ongoing increases and forecasts for further growth[5][2].
- As of May 2025, the formal progress of integration measures was about 32.6% (101 of 310 planned measures completed), indicating that while integration is proceeding, the majority of planned steps remain unfinished[1].

## 2. Recent Announcements and Policies

- In 2023, a leaked Russian strategy document outlined a plan for Russia to fully control Belarus by 2030, including harmonizing laws, merging defense and foreign policy, and prioritizing Russian interests across all sectors. This plan calls for “passportization,” a single monetary currency, and unified foreign policy—none of which have been realized as of mid-2025[4].
- The revised Union State treaty being prepared (as of early 2025) is set to further isolate Belarus from Europe and increase its dependence on Russia for security, including nuclear and conventional guarantees. However, this treaty still falls short of the original 1999 federal vision and does not yet implement the three resolution criteria[4].
- Military and security cooperation is intensifying, with major joint exercises and new defense agreements, but Belarus retains its own armed forces and has not merged its key institutions with Russia’s[3][4].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Official statements and data from the President of Belarus[2], Union State officials[5], and credible international media are primary sources for tracking progress on integration steps.
- Independent reporting on implementation of “passportization,” monetary unification, or loss of Belarusian foreign policy independence would be necessary for a binary resolution.

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- Measurement is limited by the opacity of internal Union State negotiations and the possibility of rapid political change.
- Although integration is accelerating, it remains incomplete: no widespread Russian passport distribution (“passportization”), no single currency (the Belarusian ruble remains official), and Belarus retains a separate foreign policy, despite increased coordination[2][4].
- External shocks (domestic unrest, leadership changes, or international sanctions) could alter the trajectory unpredictably.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given:
- The slow but steady pace of integration (only a third of integration measures completed by mid-2025)[1],
- The absence of any of the three resolution criteria being fully satisfied as of May 2025,
- The increased, but not total, alignment in security and economics,

The probability that Russia will significantly incorporate Belarus into the Union State before 2030 (i.e., at least two of the three criteria are met, or formal loss of Belarusian independence) appears elevated compared to the pre-2022 baseline, but remains below 50%. 

**Adjusted probability: 35–45%** that the threshold for “significant incorporation” will be reached before 2030, absent unforeseen shocks or acceleration of current trends. This reflects meaningful but incomplete progress toward Russia’s stated objectives and persistent Belarusian sovereignty.
