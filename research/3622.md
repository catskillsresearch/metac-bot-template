# Forecasting Harvard's Admit Rate for the Class of 2029

As we look ahead to the Harvard Class of 2029 admissions cycle, a careful analysis of recent trends provides valuable insights for forecasting the expected admit rate.

## Historical Trend Analysis

Harvard's undergraduate admission rates have shown a clear trajectory of increasing selectivity:

- Class of 2023: 4.50% admit rate with 43,330 applications[4][5]
- Class of 2024: 4.92% admit rate with 40,248 applications[5]
- Class of 2025: 3.43% admit rate with 57,435 applications[4][5]
- Class of 2028: 3.6% admit rate with 54,008 applications[1][2][3]

The data reveals a significant drop in the admission rate from the Class of 2024 to the Class of 2025, followed by a slight increase for the Class of 2028. This pattern reflects the extraordinary circumstances surrounding pandemic-era admissions and the subsequent normalization.

## Key Factors Influencing the Forecast

**Application Volume Trends**

Application numbers experienced a dramatic surge for the Class of 2025 (57,435 applicants), likely influenced by test-optional policies implemented during the pandemic[5]. While the number decreased slightly for the Class of 2028 (54,008 applicants)[1][2], it remains substantially higher than pre-pandemic levels, suggesting a "new normal" in application volume.

**Admission Consistency**

Despite fluctuations in application numbers, Harvard has maintained remarkable consistency in the absolute number of students admitted:
- Class of 2025: 1,968 admitted students[5]
- Class of 2028: 1,970 admitted students[1][2]

This indicates Harvard's commitment to maintaining a specific class size regardless of application volume.

**Yield Rate Considerations**

Harvard's yield rate (percentage of admitted students who enroll) has remained exceptionally high:
- Class of 2025: Record-high 85%[4]
- Class of 2028: 83.6%[2]

These high yield rates allow Harvard to admit fewer students overall while still meeting enrollment targets.

## Probabilistic Assessment for Class of 2029

Based on the analyzed trends and current patterns, I forecast the Harvard Class of 2029 admit rate will most likely fall between **3.4% and 3.7%**, with a central estimate of approximately **3.55%**.

This forecast assumes:
1. Application volume will remain relatively stable compared to recent cycles (52,000-55,000 range)
2. Harvard will continue admitting approximately 1,950-2,000 students
3. Yield rates will remain in the 83-85% range

## Uncertainties and Limitations

Several factors could shift this forecast:
- Potential changes to Harvard's admissions policies following recent Supreme Court decisions on affirmative action
- Shifts in application patterns as we move further from pandemic-era disruptions
- Changes in Harvard's financial aid offerings that might affect yield rates
- Broader economic conditions that could impact application decisions

Without more recent data on application trends or policy changes specific to the Class of 2029 admissions cycle, this forecast represents the most reasonable projection based on established patterns of extreme selectivity at Harvard.
