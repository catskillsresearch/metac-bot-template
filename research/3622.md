# Harvard Class of 2029 Admit Rate Forecast

As of February 11, 2020, Harvard University's undergraduate admissions have shown a clear downward trend in acceptance rates over the past decade. This analysis examines historical data available at that time to forecast the admit rate for the Class of 2029.

## Historical Trends

The most significant trend observable by early 2020 is the steady decline in Harvard's acceptance rates:

- Class of 2010: 9.3% acceptance rate
- Class of 2023: 4.6% acceptance rate

This represents a reduction of approximately 4.7 percentage points over 13 class years, or roughly 0.36 percentage points per year on average. The trend reflects increasing selectivity at Harvard and other elite institutions.

By early 2020, Harvard had maintained a relatively stable class size while experiencing growth in application volume, driving the decreasing acceptance rate. This pattern was consistent across the Ivy League and other highly selective institutions.

## Factors Affecting Future Admit Rates

Several factors observable by February 2020 would likely influence the Class of 2029 admit rate:

1. **Application Volume Growth**: Harvard had been experiencing generally increasing application numbers, driven by:
   - Growing interest in elite education
   - Expanded outreach to diverse and international applicants
   - The adoption of the Common Application making it easier to apply to multiple institutions

2. **Enrollment Management**: Harvard has historically maintained a relatively consistent undergraduate class size of approximately 1,600-1,700 students.

3. **Early Admission Trends**: By 2020, early admission programs were showing significantly higher acceptance rates than regular decision rounds, suggesting continued pressure on overall admit rates.

## Forecast for Class of 2029

Based on the historical trend from Class of 2010 to Class of 2023, and assuming a continuation of the observed patterns, the Class of 2029 admit rate would likely fall between 2.8% and 3.6%.

The calculation:
- The average annual decrease of approximately 0.36 percentage points per year
- From Class of 2023 (4.6%) to Class of 2029 represents 6 years
- Projected decrease: 0.36 Ã— 6 = 2.16 percentage points
- Projected Class of 2029 admit rate: 4.6% - 2.16% = 2.44%

However, this simple linear projection likely overstates the decline, as:
1. Admit rates cannot decrease indefinitely
2. Institutional constraints on class size and composition exist
3. Diminishing returns on application growth would eventually occur

A more reasonable forecast would adjust for these factors, suggesting an admit rate in the range of 3.0% to 3.8% for the Class of 2029.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

This forecast faces several significant limitations:

1. **Unpredictable Events**: Major economic, social, or policy changes after February 2020 could significantly alter admissions patterns.

2. **Institutional Policy Changes**: Any shifts in Harvard's admissions policies or class size targets would impact the admit rate.

3. **Application Volume Variability**: Year-to-year fluctuations in application numbers can cause significant variations in admit rates.

4. **Legal Challenges**: Ongoing litigation regarding admissions practices at elite universities could potentially impact future policies and acceptance rates.

This forecast represents a projection based solely on information available as of February 11, 2020, and should be considered in that historical context.
