### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The US core CPI (excluding food and energy) rose by 0.2% MoM in July 2024, after a 0.1% increase in June 2024[4].
- The annualized core CPI inflation rate for Q3 2024 is forecast at 2.6% by the Philadelphia Fed’s Survey of Professional Forecasters, implying an average monthly increase of about 0.21%[1].
- Shelter costs, a major component of core CPI, continue to exert upward pressure, making a flat or negative MoM reading less likely[4].
- Headline inflation has eased, but core inflation remains above the Fed’s 2% target and is proving more persistent[5].

### Recent Announcements and Policies

- There have been no major monetary policy shifts or economic shocks reported in July or early August 2024 that would likely cause a sudden drop in core CPI for August.
- The Federal Reserve has signaled increased confidence in inflation moderating but has not indicated expectations for a zero or negative core CPI reading in the near term[4].

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) is scheduled to release the August 2024 CPI report on September 11, 2024[2].
- The Philadelphia Fed’s Survey of Professional Forecasters and Cleveland Fed’s Inflation Nowcasting provide consensus forecasts and real-time estimates[1][3].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- Forecasts are subject to error, especially if unexpected economic shocks occur.
- Shelter and other sticky components of core CPI may not respond quickly to changing economic conditions, making sharp month-to-month drops rare.
- The BLS may revise seasonal adjustment factors, but the question resolves on first-release data.

### Conclusion

Based on all available data and forecasts as of August 22, 2024, the probability that the MoM percentage increase in US core CPI inflation for August 2024 will be 0.0% or less is low. Most professional forecasts and recent trends point to a continued, albeit modest, positive increase in core CPI for August 2024.
