# Forecasting Core CPI Inflation for August 2024

To assess whether the month-over-month percentage increase in core CPI inflation in the US for August 2024 will be 0.3%, we need to examine recent trends, current projections, and factors influencing inflation.

## Recent Core CPI Trends

The most recent data shows that core CPI (Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers excluding food and energy) rose by 0.2% month-over-month in July 2024, following a 0.1% increase in June 2024[4]. This indicates a slight acceleration in core inflation from June to July, though still at moderate levels compared to earlier periods.

Year-over-year, headline CPI fell to 2.9% in July 2024 from 3.0% in June, representing the smallest annual rise since March 2021[4]. While this refers to headline inflation rather than core inflation specifically, it suggests a general downward trend in inflation pressures.

## Professional Forecasts and Projections

The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia's Survey of Professional Forecasters released on August 9, 2024, provides projections for core CPI inflation:

- For Q3 2024 (which includes August), core CPI is projected at 2.6% (annualized), revised downward from the previous forecast of 3.0%[1]
- For Q4 2024, core CPI is projected at 2.6% (annualized)[1]
- For 2024 as a whole, core CPI is projected at 3.2% (annual average), down from a previous projection of 3.4%[1]

These quarterly projections are annualized rates, which don't directly translate to monthly figures but suggest expectations of moderate core inflation continuing through the remainder of 2024.

## Factors Influencing August 2024 Core CPI

Several factors may influence the August 2024 core CPI reading:

1. **Shelter Costs**: The July CPI report indicated that shelter costs were a significant driver of inflation, with the shelter index increasing by 0.4% month-over-month[4]. Since shelter is a major component of core CPI, its trajectory in August will heavily influence the overall core figure.

2. **Service Inflation**: Service prices, particularly in categories like motor vehicle insurance (which rose 1.0% in July)[4], have been contributing to core inflation persistence.

3. **Federal Reserve Policy**: The Federal Reserve's monetary policy stance and market expectations for interest rate cuts could influence inflation expectations and actual inflation outcomes.

## Assessment of 0.3% Forecast

Based on the available data, a 0.3% month-over-month increase in core CPI for August 2024 would represent a slight acceleration from the 0.2% increase observed in July. This would be consistent with the modest upward pressure seen from June to July but would be somewhat higher than the general disinflationary trend observed in headline figures.

The Survey of Professional Forecasters' downward revision of core CPI projections for Q3 2024 (from 3.0% to 2.6% annualized)[1] suggests that economists expect inflation to continue moderating, which might argue against a significant acceleration to 0.3% in August.

However, persistent shelter inflation and certain service categories could potentially push the monthly figure to 0.3% if these pressures intensify in August.

## Measurement Considerations

The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) is scheduled to release the August 2024 CPI data in September 2024[2]. The reported figure will be rounded to the nearest tenth of a percentage point, as was done for the July 2024 report where core CPI was reported as rising 0.2%[4].

It's worth noting that initial CPI releases are subject to potential revisions in subsequent months, though the question specifically focuses on the first reported number.
