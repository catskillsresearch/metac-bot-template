## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- In the 2019 Brandenburg state election, AfD secured 23.5% of the vote, establishing itself as a major political force in the region.
- In 2024, AfD has achieved significant results in other eastern German states: 32.8% in Thuringia and 30.6% in Saxony, reflecting a broader trend of rising support in the east[4].
- The party also performed strongly in the June 2024 European Parliament elections, particularly in eastern Germany, where it emerged as the largest party[4].

## Recent Polls and Announcements

- As of early September 2024, reputable media report that polls in Brandenburg have AfD "ahead at around 24%"[4].
- This figure is notably below the 28-30% range specified in the question.
- There are no reports or polls cited that place AfD at or above 28% in Brandenburg as of the latest available data.

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Final results will be published by the official state election authority and reported by major outlets such as Politico, Le Monde, and the Bundeswahlleiterin[1][3][4].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- Polls are snapshots and can shift in the final weeks before an election.
- Regional or national events, turnout changes, or late-campaign controversies could influence the final result.
- However, as of September 12, 2024, no available poll or analysis places AfD's projected vote share in Brandenburg above 28%.

## Conclusion

Based on all available factual information as of September 12, 2024, AfD is polling below the 28-30% range in Brandenburg, with the most recent figures suggesting support "around 24%." While the party has momentum in eastern Germany, there is no evidence to suggest its vote share in Brandenburg will be more than 28% and less than or equal to 30% in the 2024 state election[4].
