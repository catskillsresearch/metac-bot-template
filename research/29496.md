# Factual Information for Forecasting Perdue Foods LLC Recall Resolution

The USDA-posted recall of Perdue Foods LLC's frozen chicken products was announced on August 16, 2024, and understanding whether it will be closed before November 16, 2024 requires analysis of several key factors.

## Current Status and Recall Details

Perdue Foods LLC initiated a voluntary recall of approximately 167,171 pounds of frozen, ready-to-eat chicken breast nugget and tender products on August 16, 2024[1][3][4]. The products in question were produced on March 23, 2024, and may be contaminated with foreign material, specifically metal wire[3][5]. The recall was triggered after the company received consumer complaints about metal wire embedded in the products[3][5].

The affected products bear establishment number "P-33944" on the back of the package and include several specific items:
- Perdue Breaded Chicken Tenders
- Butcher Box Organic Chicken Breast Nuggets 
- Perdue Simply Smart Organics Breaded Chicken Breast Nuggets[5]

## Distribution and Consumer Impact

The recall has wide distribution, with at least 24 stores in Cobb County, Georgia alone being on the distribution list, along with many other locations throughout Georgia and nationwide[4]. The USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) expressed concern that some product may still be in consumers' freezers, and urged consumers not to consume the products but to throw them away or return them to the place of purchase[4].

As of August 19, 2024, there were no confirmed reports of adverse reactions or injuries due to consumption of these products[3][5]. Jeff Shaw, Perdue's senior vice president of food safety and quality, stated that "the material [was] a very thin strand of metal wire that was inadvertently introduced into the manufacturing process" and that the recall was initiated "out of an abundance of caution"[4].

## Recall Process Information

The USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) maintains records of recalls and their status, categorizing them as either active or closed[2]. While specific information about the timeline for closing this particular recall is not available, the FSIS website does track the status of recalls, with "Closed Recall" being a designated status category[2].

## Factors That May Influence Closure Timeline

Several factors could influence whether this recall will be closed before November 16, 2024:

1. **Time elapsed since announcement**: By November 16, 2024, approximately three months will have passed since the August 16 announcement, which may be sufficient time for the recall to be completed.

2. **Severity and scope**: The recall involves a significant amount of product (167,171 pounds), but the contamination appears to be limited to metal wire with no reported injuries as of mid-August 2024[3][5].

3. **Consumer response**: The effectiveness of consumer notification and product return/disposal will impact how quickly the recall can be closed.

4. **Resolution of the manufacturing issue**: Perdue would need to demonstrate that they have addressed the source of the metal wire contamination in their manufacturing process.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

The available information has several limitations for forecasting purposes:

1. No historical data is provided on the typical duration of similar FSIS recalls involving foreign material contamination.

2. There is no information about any follow-up actions taken by Perdue or FSIS since the initial announcement.

3. The search results do not indicate whether any additional consumer complaints or adverse events have been reported since mid-August 2024.

4. No specific criteria for closing this type of recall are detailed in the available information.
