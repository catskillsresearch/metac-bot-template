# Forecasting Kamala Harris's Net Favorability Rating

Based on available data as of the knowledge cutoff, here's an analysis of factors that could help forecast whether Vice President Kamala Harris's net favorability rating will exceed -8 by September 1, 2024.

## Historical Trends and Current Status

Vice President Harris has historically struggled with favorability ratings during her vice presidency. According to a June 2023 NBC News poll, Harris had a net-negative rating of -17, with 49% of registered voters viewing her negatively compared to just 32% with a positive view[3]. This was reported as the lowest for a vice president in the history of NBC's polling.

FiveThirtyEight's polling averages from June 2023 showed Harris with:
- 39.4% approval
- 52.3% disapproval[2]

This represented a net favorability of approximately -12.9, which was worse than her previous rating in the same tracker.

For historical context, other vice presidents had significantly better ratings at comparable points in their terms:
- Mike Pence: -4 in October 2019
- Joe Biden: +1 in December 2010
- Dick Cheney: +23 in May 2003
- Al Gore: +15 in March 1995[3]

The Los Angeles Times tracking data indicated that Harris's net favorability was lower than former Vice Presidents Pence, Biden, Cheney, and Gore[1]. Her favorability reportedly began declining in June (likely 2021) after she was tasked with addressing immigration issues, which has been a challenging policy area for Democrats[1].

## Factors Potentially Affecting Harris's Favorability

Several factors may influence Harris's favorability trajectory:

**Structural Challenges:**
- As noted by analysts, racism and sexism could be contributing factors to Harris's historically low numbers[1]
- FiveThirtyEight has documented how women politicians, especially women of color like Harris, are often held to different standards than their male counterparts[1]
- Harris has shown a particularly high unfavorability margin among men (17 percentage points according to Los Angeles Times data)[1]

**Political Association:**
- Harris's approval ratings have been largely tied to President Biden's ratings[1]
- The query indicates Biden's net favorability was -17.6 as of July 2024, significantly lower than Harris's -8.5

**Current Political Context:**
- Harris's current -8.5 net favorability (as of July 30, 2024) represents a substantial improvement from the -17 rating reported in June 2023
- Her current rating is nearly identical to former President Trump's -8.7 (as of July 30, 2024)

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several limitations affect the reliability of any forecast:

1. **Timing of Available Data**: The most detailed polling information in the search results is from 2021-2023, which doesn't capture recent developments in the 2024 campaign

2. **Volatility During Campaigns**: As noted in the FiveThirtyEight analysis, "it's still very early at this point, and a lot will likely change between now and the 2024 presidential election"[1]

3. **Measurement Variations**: Different polling organizations use varying methodologies to measure favorability, which can produce different results

4. **Contextual Changes**: Harris's role has evolved significantly from when these polls were conducted, particularly with her becoming the presumptive Democratic nominee

5. **External Events**: Unforeseen events between now and September 1, 2024, could significantly impact public perception

## Conclusion

The historical data shows Harris has struggled with favorability ratings throughout her vice presidency, with measurements significantly worse than the -8 threshold in question. However, the query indicates her rating has improved to -8.5 as of July 30, 2024, suggesting a positive trend compared to earlier measurements.

Given the limited timeframe between July 30 and September 1, 2024, and the relatively small gap between -8.5 and -8, even modest improvements in public perception could push her above the threshold. However, the historical volatility of favorability ratings during campaign seasons makes this difficult to predict with certainty.
