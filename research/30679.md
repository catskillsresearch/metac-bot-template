### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The Arctic, including Alaska's North Slope where Barrow/Port Rogers (Utqiaġvik) is located, has experienced rapid warming. According to the Arctic Council, Arctic temperatures are rising at three times the global annual average, leading to increased frequency of extreme temperature events and significant snow and ice melt[1].
- Historical data from the Barrow/Port Rogers station (PABR) shows that December average temperatures have trended upward over the past several decades, with some recent years recording anomalies of several degrees above the 1945-2023 average. However, anomalies of ≥6°F above the long-term mean for a single December remain relatively rare, even in the context of accelerated Arctic warming.
- The 1945-2023 December average for Barrow/Port Rogers is established and available on the Iowa Environmental Mesonet website, which will be used for resolution.

### Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- There have been no recent policies or announcements directly affecting the December 2024 temperature at Barrow/Port Rogers. However, ongoing global and regional climate change mitigation efforts may have long-term effects, but these are unlikely to impact the December 2024 outcome in a measurable way.

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The Iowa Environmental Mesonet (IEM) is the sole data provider for the resolution of this question. The relevant data can be found on their monthly summary page for the Barrow/Port Rogers station (PABR), which lists the "Average Daily Temperature (high+low)/2 [F]" for each month[1].

### Limitations or Uncertainties in Measurement

- As of the knowledge cutoff (December 3, 2024), December 2024 temperature data is not yet available, so no definitive answer can be given.
- While the Arctic is warming rapidly, monthly anomalies of ≥6°F above the 1945-2023 average are possible but not guaranteed for any given December.
- Short-term climate variability (e.g., Arctic Oscillation, El Niño/La Niña) can cause significant fluctuations in monthly temperatures, adding uncertainty to any forecast.
- The IEM data is considered authoritative for this metric, but any errors or delays in reporting could affect the resolution.

### Summary

- The Arctic is experiencing rapid warming, and extreme temperature anomalies are becoming more frequent.
- However, a December monthly average at Barrow/Port Rogers exceeding the 1945-2023 average by ≥6°F is possible but not assured based on historical trends.
- The outcome will be determined by the official data published by the Iowa Environmental Mesonet for December 2024.
