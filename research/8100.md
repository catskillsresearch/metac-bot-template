## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The US murder rate was 4.96 per 100,000 in 2018, following a long-term decline from peaks of around 10 per 100,000 in the early 1990s[1].
- In 2020, the murder rate surged to approximately 6.5 per 100,000, driven by pandemic disruptions, social unrest, and changes in policing following the death of George Floyd[1].
- This elevated rate continued into 2021, remaining well above the previous decade’s average but below historical peaks[1].

## Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Metric

- As of 2021, the US was undergoing significant debate and reform regarding policing, including funding reallocations and new training or oversight measures. The pandemic’s residual social impacts and economic recovery efforts were also ongoing.
- No major federal policy or legislation with a proven large-scale effect on homicide rates had taken effect as of late 2021, though local and state-level reforms were being implemented in various jurisdictions.

## Authoritative Sources and Forecasts

- The Metaculus community forecast as of late 2021 placed the most likely (median) US murder rate in 2030 at 5.6 per 100,000, with a 25th–75th percentile range from 4.3 to 7.1 per 100,000[1].
- Academic projections using experience curve models show considerable state-level variation, with some states expected to see increases and others declines by 2030, but national trends are generally expected to remain below historic highs[4].
- The United Nations projected a gradual global decline in homicide rates, but with only a modest reduction for the US-level by 2030[5].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- Long-term crime predictions are inherently uncertain due to:
  - Societal and policy shifts
  - Economic volatility
  - Demographic changes
  - Unpredictable events (e.g., pandemics, major unrest)
- Measurement is complicated by reporting changes (e.g., FBI’s transition to NIBRS), underreporting, and state-level variability[4].

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the reference cases, recent surges, and the likelihood of partial reversion but not a full return to pre-2020 lows, the most credible forecast for the US murder rate in 2030 is:

> **Median forecast:** 5.6 per 100,000  
> **Likely range (25th–75th percentile):** 4.3–7.1 per 100,000[1]
