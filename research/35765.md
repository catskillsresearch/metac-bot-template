# Forecasting a Partisan Impeachment of a Federal Judge Before 2027

As of May 2025, several factors suggest an increased likelihood of a partisan impeachment of a federal judge before January 3, 2027, though historical patterns indicate such events remain rare.

## Historical Context

Federal judge impeachment is an exceptionally rare occurrence in American history. Only 15 federal judges have ever been impeached, with just 8 convicted—averaging approximately one impeachment every 14 years[4]. The Constitution specifies that officials can be impeached for "treason, bribery, and other high crimes and misdemeanors"[1]. Historically, impeachment has been reserved for cases of serious misconduct rather than disagreements over judicial decisions.

The impeachment process requires:
- The House of Representatives to bring charges (impeach) by majority vote
- The Senate to conduct a trial and potentially convict with a two-thirds majority[1]

Of all impeachments initiated by the House (more than 60 proceedings), only 21 resulted in formal impeachment, and just 8 officials—all federal judges—were removed from office[1].

## Current Political Environment

The political climate in 2025 shows significantly heightened tensions between the executive branch and the judiciary:

- President Trump has explicitly called for the impeachment of Judge James Boasberg, who ruled against his administration in an immigration case involving the Alien Enemies Act of 1798[5]

- Conservative activist groups, notably the Article III Project, have mobilized substantial grassroots pressure, generating 164,000 communications to Congress urging lawmakers to support the impeachment of Judge Boasberg[5]

- The administration and its allies appear to be pursuing a multi-pronged strategy against the judiciary, including public criticism, calls for impeachment, and proposed budget cuts of $2 billion to the federal judiciary[5]

- Nearly 250 legal challenges to administration policies have resulted in approximately 25 nationwide injunctions by late April 2025, creating significant frustration within the executive branch[5]

Former federal judge John Jones III (a George W. Bush appointee) has characterized the situation as "an all-out war on the lower courts"[5].

## Key Factors Affecting Probability

Several elements increase the likelihood of a partisan impeachment:

1. **Specific Target Identified**: Unlike hypothetical scenarios, there is already a named judge (Boasberg) being targeted for impeachment

2. **Organized Pressure Campaign**: Well-organized advocacy groups are actively working to pressure Congress on this specific issue

3. **Executive Branch Support**: The President himself has publicly endorsed impeachment of a federal judge

4. **Partisan Polarization**: The current political environment shows high levels of partisan division, making a party-line vote more feasible

Factors decreasing the likelihood:

1. **Historical Rarity**: Impeachments of federal judges remain extremely uncommon

2. **Institutional Resistance**: The judiciary has pushed back against politicized impeachment, with senior judicial figures defending the independence of courts

3. **Constitutional Concerns**: Impeaching judges for their decisions rather than misconduct raises significant constitutional questions

## Forecast Assessment

Given the unprecedented nature of the current situation—with a sitting president explicitly calling for a judge's impeachment based on a ruling—the probability of a partisan impeachment attempt before January 2027 is substantially higher than historical baselines would suggest.

The combination of executive pressure, organized advocacy, and the specific identification of at least one target judge creates conditions where a partisan House vote to impeach (regardless of Senate conviction prospects) appears increasingly plausible, though still far from certain.

The timeline (approximately 19 months remaining) provides sufficient opportunity for the political pressure to translate into formal impeachment proceedings, particularly if additional controversial rulings emerge that further antagonize the administration.

While historical patterns would suggest a very low probability, the current extraordinary circumstances significantly elevate the likelihood of this outcome occurring before the specified date.
