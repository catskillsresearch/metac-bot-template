### Key Facts as of March 19, 2025

- The ISW (Institute for the Study of War) provides daily updated interactive maps tracking Ukrainian and Russian control in Kursk Oblast[1][2][3][4][5].
- The latest ISW campaign assessment and map update is from March 15, 2025, with a data cut-off at 11:00 am ET[1]. There is no indication in this update that Russia had fully retaken all territory in Kursk from Ukrainian forces by that date.
- Reuters reported on March 13, 2025, that Russia claimed it was poised to drive Ukraine out of Kursk, but this was a statement of intent rather than confirmation of completed territorial control.
- The ISW interactive map of Ukraine's offensive in Kursk Oblast is the authoritative source for verifying territorial control and will be used for resolution.

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- There is a gap between the last available ISW map (March 15, 2025) and the target date (March 31, 2025). No ISW map or assessment as of March 19, 2025, confirms full Russian control of Kursk.
- Russian official statements are not independently verified and may not reflect the actual situation.
- The ISW map may lag behind real-time events, and its updates are the only accepted resolution source.

### Conclusion

As of March 19, 2025, there is no factual basis to state that the ISW warmap will show Kursk as having been completely retaken by Russia on March 31, 2025. The most recent authoritative data does not confirm full Russian control, and future developments remain uncertain until further ISW updates are available[1][2][3][4][5].
