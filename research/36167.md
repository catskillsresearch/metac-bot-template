# Forecasting Russia's Potential Recapture of Kursk Oblast by March 31, 2025

Based on information available prior to March 19, 2025, here is an analysis of factors relevant to forecasting whether Russia will completely retake Kursk Oblast from Ukrainian forces by March 31, 2025.

## Current Status and Historical Context

As of mid-March 2025, Ukraine continues to maintain a presence in Russia's Kursk Oblast, as evidenced by the Institute for the Study of War's (ISW) ongoing tracking of "Ukraine's offensive in Kursk Oblast" through their interactive maps[1][2][3][4][5]. These maps specifically track "Ukrainian Advances in Russia," indicating that Ukrainian forces have maintained some territorial control within Kursk as of March 18, 2025[4].

On March 13, 2025, Russian officials claimed they were "poised to drive Ukraine out of Kursk," according to Reuters reporting mentioned in the question description. This suggests that while Russia was expressing confidence in their ability to reclaim territory, the complete recapture had not yet occurred as of that date.

## Recent Developments

The ISW has published regular Russian Offensive Campaign Assessments throughout early March 2025, with reports dated March 3, March 11, March 14, March 15, and March 18[1][2][3][4][5]. The consistent publication of these assessments indicates ongoing military activity in the region, though the specific details of territorial changes are not provided in the available information.

The fact that ISW maintains a dedicated interactive map specifically for "Ukraine's offensive in Kursk Oblast" separate from their general map of the Russian invasion suggests the situation in Kursk represents a significant and persistent military development[3][4].

## Forecasting Considerations

Several factors should be considered when forecasting whether Russia will completely retake Kursk by March 31, 2025:

1. **Timeline**: The forecast date (March 31) is approximately two weeks after the latest available information (March 18). This relatively short timeframe would require rapid Russian advances to completely eliminate the Ukrainian presence if substantial territory remains under Ukrainian control.

2. **Russian Claims**: Russia's March 13 statement about being "poised" to drive Ukraine out suggests they had not yet achieved this objective but were positioning forces to do so. The credibility of such claims should be weighed against independent assessments.

3. **Seasonal Factors**: Late March typically marks the beginning of the spring thaw (rasputitsa) in the region, which historically has impacted military mobility due to muddy conditions. This could potentially slow offensive operations by either side.

4. **Verification Methodology**: The resolution criteria specifically reference the ISW's interactive map as the authoritative source for determining territorial control, which provides a clear benchmark for assessment.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

The available information has significant limitations:

1. The search results do not provide details on how much territory Ukraine controls in Kursk Oblast as of mid-March 2025.

2. Without access to the actual content of the ISW assessments, we cannot determine the momentum of Russian counteroffensive operations or Ukrainian defensive capabilities in the region.

3. The search results do not include information about force deployments, resource allocation, or strategic priorities that would influence Russia's ability to recapture the entire oblast within the specified timeframe.

4. Weather conditions, which can significantly impact military operations, are not addressed in the available information.

Given these limitations, any forecast would need to acknowledge substantial uncertainty about whether Russia can completely eliminate the Ukrainian presence in Kursk Oblast by March 31, 2025.
