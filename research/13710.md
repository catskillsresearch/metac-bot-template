## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The *Democratic Peace Theory* posits that established democracies are highly unlikely to wage war against each other, a finding supported by extensive empirical research and statistical analysis[1][2][5].
- Historical records since World War II show very few, if any, wars between countries classified as full or robust democracies at the time of conflict[2][5].
- The theory is underpinned by structural factors (such as checks and balances, transparency, and electoral incentives) and normative beliefs (shared values and norms discouraging war among democracies)[1][2].
- The Democracy Index, as published by The Economist Intelligence Unit, is a widely used metric to define "full" and "flawed" democracies for such analyses.

## Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Metric

- While the number of democracies peaked in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, recent years have seen signs of democratic backsliding in several states, as noted in the Democracy Index reports[2].
- Geopolitical tensions have risen globally, but direct military conflict between established democracies has not occurred. Most recent large-scale wars have involved at least one autocratic or hybrid regime[2][4].
- Alliances such as NATO and the EU have provided additional institutional and economic incentives for peace among member democracies[4].
- Policies supporting free trade, multilateralism, and integration have generally been seen as stabilizing factors for democratic peace[4].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- *Democratic Peace Theory* research (summarized in academic reviews and the EIU Democracy Index)[1][2][5].
- The Economist Intelligence Unitâ€™s annual *Democracy Index* provides the standard for classification[2].
- Peer-reviewed studies and empirical analyses consistently find a strong dyadic democratic peace effect, though debate persists over causes and exceptions[1][2][5].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- Definitions of "democracy" and "war" are not universally agreed upon, and borderline cases can challenge the clarity of resolution[1][2].
- The long forecast horizon (to 2072) introduces substantial uncertainty, given the potential for regime changes, democratic erosion, or institutional breakdowns.
- Some critics argue that peace among democracies may be explained by shared interests, economic ties, or geographic factors, rather than regime type alone[1][2].
- The Democracy Index could be discontinued or revised, complicating future resolution.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the above:
- The risk of a major war between two countries classified as "full" or "flawed" democracies by the Democracy Index before 2072 remains low, in line with decades of historical evidence and robust theoretical arguments[1][2][5].
- However, the probability is not zero. Over a 50-year window, the chance of regime changes, conflicts over resources, or breakdowns in democratic norms could increase the risk, especially if global democratic backsliding continues or alliances weaken.
- Most credible forecasts as of late 2022 would assign a probability well below 20% for a qualifying war under the specified criteria, but above 0% due to inherent long-term uncertainties.
