## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Israel is a global leader in IVF, with 26 recognized IVF units and the highest per capita IVF usage worldwide[1].
- Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) is widely available and state-subsidized for preventing genetic diseases. Coverage extends to up to two children per family and spans all religious groups[1].
- Embryo selection for health-related genetic traits is routine, but non-medical selection (e.g., for sex or intelligence) is generally prohibited unless approved on a case-by-case basis, and is not publicly funded[5].
- Technological advancements include automated embryo selection tools, but these currently focus on improving pregnancy rates, not selecting for intelligence or other complex polygenic traits[3].

## 2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- The Ministry of Health strictly regulates embryo selection, allowing non-medical selection only under exceptional circumstances, subject to board approval[5].
- There is no official policy or pilot program for polygenic embryo selection for intelligence.
- No reports as of 2022 indicate that selection for intelligence is practiced at any significant scale.

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Israeli Ministry of Health documents on IVF regulation[1]
- Assuta Medical Center policies on embryo donation and selection[2]
- Official Ministry of Health application process for non-medical embryo selection[5]
- Media and academic reports on the technology’s scientific progress (not cited in current search results, but provided in the question background)

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- Current regulations prohibit non-medical embryo selection except with rare special permission, and the procedure is not included in the national healthcare basket[5].
- Social acceptance is high for medical genetic interventions, but public attitudes toward enhancement (intelligence selection) are less tested.
- Forecasting depends on potential regulatory changes, scientific advances (e.g., efficacy of polygenic selection), and shifting ethical norms, none of which are predictable with high certainty.
- Global progress on polygenic embryo selection for intelligence remains nascent as of 2022; no country is known to be at or near the >10% threshold required for positive resolution.

### Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given Israel's advanced infrastructure, permissive bioethics, and social acceptance of genetic interventions, it is plausible that Israel could be among the first to cross the >10% threshold if regulations are liberalized. However, as of 2022, regulatory barriers are significant and there is no evidence of imminent change. Therefore, the probability that Israel will be one of the first ten countries to have >10% of newborns selected for intelligence is moderate—higher than in most countries, but not assured.

A reasonable estimate as of January 2022 would be a 30-50% chance, with regulatory shifts as the critical variable.
