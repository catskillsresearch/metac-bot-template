## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- In 2016, renewables contributed 22.66% of global electricity generation[1].
- By 2023, this share had grown significantly, with record annual additions in wind and solar capacity.
- The IPCC's P3 pathway (2018) projected that renewables would account for up to 48% of global electricity generation in 2030 under a "middle-of-the-road" scenario[1].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- The COP28 summit in 2023 set a global target to triple renewable electricity capacity by 2030, resulting in accelerated policy action in major economies[4].
- The International Energy Agency (IEA) projects that more than 5,500 GW of new renewable capacity will be added globally between 2024 and 2030—almost three times the increase seen from 2017 to 2023[1][5].
- China is expected to account for almost 60% of this new capacity, with solar power leading the global expansion[5].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The IEA’s *Renewables 2024: Analysis and forecast to 2030* projects renewables will generate "almost half" of global electricity by 2030[5].
- Ember’s Global Renewable Target Tracker documents national targets and progress, supporting the trend toward high renewable shares[3].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- The IEA forecast suggests renewables will generate nearly 50% of global electricity, but actual performance may fall just below or just above the 48% threshold, depending on project execution, economic conditions, and how "renewables" are defined (e.g., inclusion/exclusion of large hydro)[5].
- There is inherent uncertainty in long-term projections due to possible delays in policy implementation, supply chain constraints, and economic shocks.
- National reporting standards and World Bank measurement methods may introduce minor discrepancies in the final percentage.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the rapid acceleration of renewable deployment since 2020, robust policy support, and authoritative projections from the IEA that the 2030 renewables share will be "almost half" of global electricity (i.e., close to but not clearly above 48%), the most likely outcome is that the share of renewables in global electricity production in 2030 will fall within the 25%–48% range. Recent trends and policy momentum make it highly improbable that the share will be below 25%, and while a result just above 48% is possible, the central forecast aligns closely with the upper bound of the range.

**Probabilistic assessment:**  
- Probability that renewables’ share in 2030 falls between 25% and 48%: **~75–85%**  
- Probability that it exceeds 48%: **~15–25%**  
- Probability that it remains below 25%: **negligible**
