# Forecasting Japan's Potential Clade I Mpox Infections Before October 1, 2024

The recent global spread of mpox Clade I presents a complex forecasting challenge regarding potential infections in Japan. Below is an analysis of available information as of August 2024 to help assess this possibility.

## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

The 2023-2025 mpox epidemic involves a new variant of Clade I mpox, specifically Clade Ib, which began circulating in Central Africa around September 2023[1]. As of September 2024, more than 29,000 cases and over 800 fatalities (approximately 3% fatality rate) have been reported, with the vast majority occurring in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC)[1].

The epidemic has shown concerning patterns of spread:

- The DRC has experienced an unprecedented number of Clade I mpox cases in 2024, with a 160% increase in cases compared to the same period in 2023[3]
- Transboundary spread has occurred to several neighboring countries[3]
- The newly identified Clade Ib appears to be causing more severe disease[3]
- Before April 2023, there were no formally documented cases of sexual transmission of Clade I mpox, but many clusters of sexual transmission have since been recorded in the DRC[3]

Epidemiological analysis indicates that Clade I has:
- A mean incubation period of 9.9 days (95% credible interval 8.5-11.5 days)[4]
- Generally slower transmission dynamics than Clade IIb[4]
- Limited presymptomatic transmission[4]

However, in South Kivu Province, where the newly identified subclade Ib has been associated with sustained human-to-human transmission, the effective reproduction number was estimated to be above the epidemic threshold (95% CrI 0.96-1.27)[4].

## Recent Announcements and Developments

On August 14, 2024, the World Health Organization declared the mpox epidemic a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC)[1]. This declaration was prompted by:

- The rapid geographic expansion of mpox due to Clades I, Ib, and IIb[2]
- Over 100 laboratory-confirmed cases of Clade Ib reported in four countries neighboring the DRC (Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, and Uganda) that had not previously reported mpox
- The emergence of a case in Sweden on August 15, 2024, marking the first Clade I mpox case reported outside the African continent

The spread to Sweden represents a significant development, as historically, Clade I MPXV had been reported only in 5 Central African countries.

## Factors Relevant to Japan's Risk

Several factors are relevant when assessing Japan's risk of confirming Clade I mpox infections before October 1, 2024:

1. **International travel connections**: Japan has significant international travel connections, including with countries that might have cases.

2. **Time frame consideration**: The period between mid-August (when the first case outside Africa was confirmed) and October 1, 2024, is approximately 6 weeks, which is sufficient time for potential spread given the incubation period of 9.9 days[4].

3. **Public health surveillance**: Japan has robust public health surveillance systems that would likely detect cases if they occur, though the novelty of Clade I in regions outside Africa might present initial diagnostic challenges.

4. **Precedent of international spread**: The confirmation of a case in Sweden demonstrates that international spread beyond Africa is already occurring.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several limitations affect the ability to forecast with precision:

1. **Under-reporting**: According to the European CDC, "The size of these outbreaks could be larger than reported due to under-ascertainment and under-reporting"[1].

2. **Limited testing**: A large proportion of clinically compatible cases have not been tested, suggesting the true number of cases may be higher than officially reported.

3. **Evolving transmission patterns**: The emergence of sexual transmission as a new mode of spread for Clade I introduces uncertainty about transmission dynamics[3].

4. **Limited historical data**: With Clade I historically confined to Central Africa, there is limited data on its behavior in different populations and healthcare settings.
