### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Greenland has been self-governing since 1979 and has the legal right to declare independence after a successful referendum, as per agreements with Denmark[1][3].
- The independence movement is popular, but the timing and practicalities are contentious. While 64% of residents in 2016 considered independence important, a 2017 survey found nearly 80% would oppose independence if it meant a lower standard of living[1].
- Greenland’s economy remains heavily dependent on Danish subsidies, and there are unresolved questions about economic and administrative viability post-independence[1][3].

### Recent Announcements and Policies

- Prime Minister Múte Egede, in his January 2025 New Year’s address, reaffirmed the goal of independence and announced the formation of a commission to define the referendum process, including what constitutes a legitimate referendum, the question to be posed, and campaign logistics[1][2][3].
- Egede and other officials have hinted that a referendum could coincide with the parliamentary elections scheduled by April 2025, but no specific date has been announced[2][4].
- The commission’s work must be completed before a referendum can be scheduled, and most political parties—including the most pro-independence—are not ready to set a date yet[1].
- As of January 31, 2025, there is no official announcement of a referendum date[1][3][4].

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Statements from Prime Minister Egede and coverage by major outlets (Politico, Euronews, Euractiv) confirm that while independence is a central issue, no date has been set for a referendum as of the cutoff date[2][3][4].
- Reports consistently note that the process is ongoing and that the commission’s work is a prerequisite for any scheduling[1][3].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- The situation is dynamic, and political developments could accelerate the process, especially with elections approaching.
- However, the need for the commission to conclude its work and the lack of consensus on timing make an official announcement before April 6, 2025, unlikely[1][3].

**Conclusion:**  
As of January 31, 2025, there is no factual basis to expect that the government of Greenland will officially announce a date for an independence referendum before April 6, 2025. The process is ongoing, but key procedural steps and political consensus are not yet in place[1][3][4].
