## Key Factual Information Relevant to Forecasting Recall Closure

**Current Status and Scope**
- The USDA recall for Boar’s Head deli meat began on July 26, 2024, initially covering liverwurst and expanding on July 30, 2024, to include over 7 million pounds of ready-to-eat meat and poultry products produced between May 10 and July 29, 2024[1][2].
- The recall includes 71 products under Boar’s Head and Old Country brands, distributed nationwide and internationally[1].

**Sell-By Dates and Shelf Life**
- Some recalled products have sell-by dates extending through October 17, 2024[1][3][5].
- Products were produced as late as July 29, 2024, with shelf lives that mean they could remain in commerce or consumer homes into October[1][5].

**Severity and Public Health Impact**
- The outbreak is the worst listeria incident in years, with at least nine deaths and dozens hospitalized as of late August 2024[4][5].
- Public health officials are concerned that more cases may emerge, as listeria symptoms can develop weeks after exposure, and not all consumers may be aware of the recall[5].

**Recall Closure Practices**
- FSIS typically keeps recalls open until all affected products are likely out of commerce, which often means waiting until after the latest sell-by or expiration date has passed.
- There is no public indication from FSIS or Boar’s Head that the recall is expected to close before October 1, 2024[1][2][5].

**Authoritative Source for Verification**
- The official recall status is maintained on the FSIS recall page for Boar’s Head Provisions Co., Inc.[1].

**Limitations and Uncertainties**
- The recall status can only be verified by checking the FSIS recall page after September 30, 2024, as per the resolution criteria.
- There is no precedent for early closure of a recall with ongoing public health risks and products still within their shelf life.
- Uncertainties remain regarding the pace of plant remediation and regulatory clearance, but the extended sell-by dates and severity of the outbreak make early closure unlikely.

## Conclusion

Based on the available facts as of September 13, 2024, the USDA’s recall of Boar’s Head deli meat is unlikely to be closed before October 1, 2024, due to the extended sell-by dates of affected products and the ongoing public health investigation[1][5].
