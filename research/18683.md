## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of May 2025, Russia controls approximately 19% of Ukraine's territory, including Crimea and large swathes of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia oblasts. This is a net increase since February 2022, with Russia gaining roughly 27,410 square miles of Ukrainian territory (excluding Crimea, the number is somewhat lower but still significant)[4].
- Ukraine has not reclaimed significant territory in these four oblasts since late 2023. Recent months have seen Russia making incremental territorial gains, such as capturing towns like Ulakly (Volnovakha district) in February 2025 and Ukrainsk (Pokrovsk district) in September 2024[1].
- The front line remains dynamic but has generally shifted in Russia's favor since early 2024. Russian control is consolidating in much of the occupied regions, with only small contested areas[1][4][5].

## 2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- Russian leadership, including President Putin, continues to demand the cession of all four occupied oblasts (Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, Zaporizhzhia) as a condition for peace, with no indication of willingness to return these areas to Ukraine[2].
- There is no evidence from 2024 or 2025 of a major Ukrainian counteroffensive retaking lost ground in these oblasts. Instead, Russia’s slow but steady advances continue[1][4][5].
- International support for Ukraine remains vital but faces political uncertainty in Western countries, potentially impacting Ukraine’s ability to reverse territorial losses[2].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Territorial control maps and data from the Institute for the Study of War, cited in Russia Matters[4][5].
- Wikipedia’s live updates on territorial control (using a variety of open-source intelligence and geolocated footage)[1].
- U.S. State Department human rights reports, providing context on areas under Ukrainian government control as of end-2023[3].

## 4. Limitations or Uncertainties in Measurement

- Front lines are dynamic and may shift due to military operations, political changes in Russia, Ukraine, or third countries, or unforeseen escalation.
- The status of small settlements may be ambiguous (“contested” or changing hands frequently)[1].
- Significant external events (e.g., collapse of Russian or Ukrainian state power, dramatic changes in Western policy) could rapidly alter control but are not predictable from current trends.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

- Given the current trajectory—ongoing Russian gains, hardened Russian demands, and the lack of significant Ukrainian counteroffensive success—the probability that Ukraine will not control all of its non-Crimean 2013 territory by February 2029 is high.
- A reasonable baseline estimate, based on observed trends and absent major unforeseen changes, would put the probability of Ukraine failing to regain all occupied non-Crimean territory by February 2029 at above 80%.
