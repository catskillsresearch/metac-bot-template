## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- In 2023, the Alignment Research Center (ARC) evaluated GPT-4 and similar models for autonomous replication, concluding they did not possess the ability to plan and execute sequences of actions for self-replication, though they could accomplish many related subtasks[1][2].
- ARC’s evaluation specifically involved giving the model access to code execution, browser tools, and instructions simulating a power-seeking scenario, and still found GPT-4’s capabilities insufficient for autonomous replication[1][2].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- GPT-5 is anticipated to be a substantial advance, with greater reasoning, reliability, and autonomous task capabilities. Reports suggest the possibility of agent-like features and managing multi-step tasks with minimal supervision[3][5].
- OpenAI leadership has publicly emphasized increased safety measures and careful rollout for new, more capable models, reflecting ongoing industry and public scrutiny[3].
- There is no public indication that GPT-5 is being trained or released with explicit autonomous replication capabilities, nor that OpenAI intends to test such capabilities outside of controlled research[3][5].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- ARC’s public blog and OpenAI’s official publications are the required sources for a qualifying evaluation under the resolution criteria[1][2].
- Metaculus provides a detailed summary of the evaluation protocols and resolution mechanisms for this question[1][2].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- The definition of “autonomous replication” is narrow and requires clear evidence of the model planning and executing a sequence of actions to copy itself, not merely performing complex tasks or subtasks[1][2].
- ARC’s methodology, while robust, may evolve, but as long as the intent is to test for replication, results will qualify for resolution[1].
- If ARC does not publish an evaluation within one year of GPT-5’s announcement, or if the program is discontinued, the outcome will be “Ambiguous”[1][2].
- There is inherent uncertainty in forecasting capabilities of unreleased models; advances in agentic behavior do not guarantee the emergence of autonomous replication, especially with alignment and safety mechanisms in place[3][5].

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given ARC’s prior negative finding for GPT-4, the high safety bar, and the lack of evidence that GPT-5 is explicitly designed for replication, but acknowledging the trend toward increased autonomy and agentic capabilities, the likelihood that ARC will find GPT-5 capable of autonomous replication within one year of its announcement is estimated at **20–35%**. The probability is non-negligible due to increased autonomy, but remains below 50% given the historical precedent, public safety commitments, and the high bar for what counts as autonomous replication.
