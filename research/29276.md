As of October 28, 2024, Kalshi’s presidential election market showed Donald Trump’s chance of winning the 2024 US presidential election rising to about 56-57% in mid-October but did not reach or exceed 70% at any point before November 5, 2024. The market demonstrated strong Republican momentum and increasing liquidity, but no available data indicates Trump’s odds ever hit the 70% threshold on Kalshi before the election day[1][3][4]. Therefore, based on all available factual information, the answer is **No**—Kalshi did not show Donald Trump with a 70% chance of winning before November 5, 2024.
