# Will Argentina Fully Dollarize Its Economy Before 2028?

Argentina's potential dollarization represents a significant economic policy shift with far-reaching implications. As of May 2025, the evidence suggests a complex and evolving situation that requires careful analysis to generate a probabilistic forecast.

## Current Status of Dollarization Efforts

President Javier Milei campaigned heavily on dollarizing Argentina's economy to combat the country's persistent inflation problems[1]. Since taking office, his administration has taken initial steps in this direction, including a significant adjustment of the official dollar rate from ARS $400 to $800 in December 2023[3].

However, the path to full dollarization appears to have evolved since Milei's election. While the president initially leaned toward complete dollarization, recent developments suggest a shift toward a dual currency approach where the peso and U.S. dollar would coexist[2]. As of mid-2024, government announcements indicated that official dollarization was "unlikely to happen" despite being central to Milei's economic agenda during his campaign[4].

The current monetary policy program aims to introduce a "free competition of currencies," allowing multiple currencies to be used simultaneously rather than exclusively adopting the dollar[4].

## Key Factors Affecting Dollarization Probability

### Political Constraints

Despite Milei's strong ideological commitment to dollarization, political realities present significant challenges. The search results indicate that "politics and his own fiscal policy currently stand in the way" of implementing full dollarization[2]. With Milei's Libertarian Party holding only 7 of 72 seats in the upper house and 38 of 257 in the lower house (as mentioned in the query), passing such a fundamental economic reform faces substantial legislative hurdles.

### Economic Considerations

The specter of hyperinflation continues to loom over Argentina, making dollarization increasingly viewed as a necessary component of a comprehensive reform package[2]. Milei, an economics professor for over 20 years, has framed dollarization not just as an economic necessity but as a moral imperative, arguing that printing money inevitably leads to inflation and loss of purchasing power[4].

However, concerns about Argentina's international competitiveness and export capabilities under dollarization remain significant. As the 28th largest exporter globally with an economy heavily reliant on commodities (comprising more than 60% of exports), Argentina must carefully consider how currency changes would affect its trade relationships with major partners like Brazil, China, and the United States[5].

### Implementation Timeline

The timeline for potential dollarization extends to January 1, 2028, providing approximately 2.5 years from now for policy implementation. This timeframe allows for gradual progression toward dollarization, potentially following a path of:
1. Continued currency controls adjustment
2. Implementation of dual currency system
3. Gradual transition to predominant dollar usage
4. Potential full dollarization

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on the available information, I assess the probability of Argentina fully dollarizing its economy before 2028 at approximately 35-45%.

**Factors increasing probability:**
- Persistent inflation problems creating economic pressure for radical solutions
- Milei's ideological commitment to dollarization
- Approximately 2.5 years remaining until the resolution date

**Factors decreasing probability:**
- Recent government signals moving away from full dollarization toward a dual currency system
- Political constraints in the legislature
- Concerns about impacts on trade competitiveness
- Implementation challenges

The most likely scenario appears to be continued movement toward increased dollarization through a dual currency system, with full dollarization remaining a possibility but not the most probable outcome before 2028.

## Key Uncertainties

Several significant uncertainties could substantially alter this forecast:
- Future inflation trends in Argentina
- Changes in political support for Milei's economic agenda
- International economic conditions affecting Argentina's exports
- Public acceptance of dollarization measures

These factors should be monitored closely as they may significantly shift the probability of full dollarization occurring before the resolution date.
