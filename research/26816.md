# Trump-Harris Debate Handshake Forecast: Available Information as of July 31, 2024

As of July 31, 2024, there is uncertainty about whether a debate between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris will occur, let alone whether they will shake hands during such an event. Here's the relevant information available to help forecast this question.

## Current Debate Status

A presidential debate between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris is currently scheduled for September 10, 2024, to be aired on ABC News[1]. However, Trump has recently expressed ambivalence about participating:

"The answer is yes, I'll probably end up debating. â€¦ But I can also make a case for not doing it," Trump said in an interview with Fox News's Laura Ingraham on July 30, 2024[1].

This statement represents a shift from his more definitive position on July 23, 2024, when he committed to debating Harris and indicated willingness to face her in multiple debates[2].

Trump's hesitation appears to stem from his dissatisfaction with the debate venue rather than reluctance to face Harris directly. He stated, "I don't like rewarding fake news... They're going to make tens of millions of dollars with this debate," and specifically added, "I don't like ABC"[1].

## Historical Handshake Patterns

While the search results don't provide specific information about potential handshakes between Trump and Harris, the query background offers relevant historical context:

1. Trump shook hands with Hillary Clinton in two of their three debates during the 2016 presidential campaign.
2. Neither Trump nor Harris shook hands with their respective opponents during the 2020 debates, though this was primarily due to COVID-19 protocols.
3. Most recently, Trump and Biden did not shake hands during their June 2024 debate, breaking with traditional debate protocol.

## Relationship Between Candidates

The personal relationship between Trump and Harris appears contentious, which could influence whether they would shake hands:

- Trump has reportedly labeled Harris as "pathetic" and used strong negative language to describe her.
- Harris has likened Trump to "predators," "fraudsters," and "cheaters" in her campaign rhetoric.

This mutual antagonism suggests potential reluctance to engage in the traditional handshake, similar to what occurred in the Biden-Trump debate in June 2024.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

The primary uncertainty is whether the debate will occur at all. Trump's recent statements indicate he may back out of the scheduled September 10 debate[1]. If no debate occurs, the handshake question would be annulled according to the resolution criteria.

Additionally, even if a debate does occur, recent precedent (the June 2024 debate) suggests that the traditional handshake protocol may no longer be standard practice in the current political climate.
