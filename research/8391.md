## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- There have been no state-on-state nuclear conflicts to date, so there is no direct historical precedent for the timing of a first strike.
- The overall expert-estimated probability of a nuclear conflict by 2030 is around 1.8% (superforecasters) to 5% (domain experts) as of late 2024[4].
- Major geopolitical flashpoints (Russia-NATO, China-Taiwan) are cited as the most likely triggers, but these crises do not show a consistent pattern of escalating specifically in June–September[4].
- Nuclear arsenals, notably China’s, are expanding and modernizing, but there is no evidence linking force posture changes or readiness cycles to specific seasons[2][3].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- No major state has announced military or nuclear alert postures that are cyclical or season-specific as of 2021-2024. Nuclear risk is driven by international tensions, which can escalate at any time of year[3][4].
- Expert risk assessments focus on geopolitical triggers rather than seasonal patterns[4].

## Differences Affecting the Forecast

- The main difference from reference cases (i.e., major conventional conflict) is that nuclear conflict would be unprecedented and driven by acute crisis or miscalculation, not seasonal cycles.
- Some nuclear winter models suggest greater sunlight in summer could enhance stratospheric smoke lofting and thus the cooling effect, but this does not affect the probability of conflict timing—only the potential impacts if conflict occurs during these months.
- There is no evidence of increased military exercises or crisis escalation windows in June–September that would make nuclear use more likely in this period.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given:
- The probability of nuclear conflict by 2030 is low (median 1.8–5%)[4].
- There is no evidence suggesting the June–September period is riskier for the initial outbreak of nuclear conflict.
- Political, military, and accidental triggers are not seasonally patterned.

**The probability that, if a nuclear conflict occurs by 2030, it starts in June–September is approximately proportional to the length of that interval (4 out of 12 months, or ~33%).** There is no strong reason to adjust this baseline probability up or down, so the forecast should remain close to one-third, conditional on a nuclear conflict occurring.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- There is very limited data—no historical nuclear wars and few nuclear crises—making statistical inference difficult.
- Forecasts depend on high-uncertainty expert judgment and scenario analysis.
- If future intelligence or patterns of military mobilization emerge that are seasonally skewed, this assessment would need revisiting.
