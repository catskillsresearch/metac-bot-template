### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- **Layoff Frequency**: Since 2022, large tech companies have experienced recurring waves of layoffs, with 2024 seeing continued reductions across the sector[1][3].
- **Company-Specific Activity**:
  - **Amazon**: Layoffs listed by TechCrunch in January and February 2024; recently ordered a full return-to-office and warned of restructurings, but no September layoff event is listed as of September 20, 2024[1].
  - **Apple**: Layoffs in February, April, and August 2024, with the latest affecting digital services, but no September event listed[1].
  - **Google/Alphabet**: Layoffs in January, April, May, and June 2024; no September event listed[1].
  - **IBM**: Layoffs in March 2024; no September event listed[1].
  - **Meta/Facebook**: No 2024 layoffs listed by TechCrunch[1].
  - **Nvidia**: No layoffs listed in 2024; company is known for avoiding layoffs[1].
  - **Oracle**: No layoffs listed in 2024, despite active rumor boards[1].
  - **Salesforce**: Layoffs in January and July 2024; no September event listed[1].
  - **Tesla**: Layoffs in April 2024; no September event listed[1].

### Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- Amazon’s September 16, 2024, order for employees to return to the office and warning of restructurings could indicate future layoffs, but as of the knowledge cutoff, no September layoff is listed on the TechCrunch tracker[1].
- Other companies have had recent layoffs or rumors, but none are confirmed for September 2024 on the tracker[1].

### Authoritative Source for Verification

- **TechCrunch’s “A comprehensive list of 2024 tech layoffs”** is the sole source for resolution. As of September 20, 2024, it does not list a September layoff event for any of the specified companies[1].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- The answer is strictly based on the TechCrunch tracker as of September 20, 2024.
- Layoff rumors, internal memos, or news reports not reflected on the tracker do not count.
- The tracker may update after the cutoff, but only information available by September 20, 2024, is considered for this forecast.

### Conclusion

**As of September 20, 2024, there is no factual basis from TechCrunch’s tracker to forecast that any of the listed large tech companies will announce layoffs before October 1, 2024. If no new events are added to the tracker for September, the answer will be “No.” However, ongoing restructuring signals at companies like Amazon could change this if new information emerges and is listed on the tracker before the end of September.**
