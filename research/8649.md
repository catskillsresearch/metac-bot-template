# Forecasting Analysis: Interstellar Objects of Non-Human Artificial Origin by 2100

As a forecasting analyst examining the question of whether two national space agencies will conclude by 2100 that an interstellar object has non-human artificial origin, I'll analyze the available evidence as of November 24, 2021, and provide a probabilistic assessment.

## Current Status and Historical Context

The discovery of 'Oumuamua in 2017 marked the first confirmed detection of an interstellar object passing through our solar system. This object displayed several unusual characteristics that initially puzzled astronomers:

- Highly elongated shape (up to 10 times longer than wide), unlike any known solar system object[1]
- Unusual brightness variations as it rotated every 7.3 hours[1]
- Non-gravitational acceleration in its trajectory without visible outgassing[4]
- Pancake-like flattened shape more extreme than other known objects[5]
- Entered our solar system at a velocity lower than expected for long-duration interstellar travel[5]

While these properties generated significant scientific interest and some speculation about potential artificial origins, the scientific community has generally favored natural explanations. As of March 2021, researchers from Arizona State University proposed that 'Oumuamua is likely composed of solid nitrogen, similar to the surface of Pluto, and was probably knocked off a Pluto-like planet about half a billion years ago[5].

## Key Factors Affecting the Forecast

**1. Scientific Consensus Trajectory**

The scientific discourse has moved toward natural explanations for 'Oumuamua. Initial mystery has gradually given way to plausible natural formation mechanisms[5]. This trajectory suggests that extraordinary evidence would be needed to reverse this trend toward natural explanations.

**2. Detection Capabilities and Future Discoveries**

The Vera C. Rubin Observatory (formerly LSST) is expected to become operational in the mid-2020s and should significantly increase our ability to detect interstellar objects. More discoveries will provide comparative data and potentially resolve questions about formation mechanisms.

**3. Evidentiary Threshold for Government Agencies**

For national space agencies to officially conclude artificial origin, the evidence would need to be overwhelming. Such a conclusion would represent one of the most significant scientific announcements in human history, requiring extraordinarily compelling evidence that cannot be explained by natural processes.

**4. Institutional Conservatism**

Major space agencies like NASA, ESA, and others maintain rigorous scientific standards and typically avoid speculative conclusions. They would require multiple lines of compelling evidence before making such an extraordinary claim.

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on the available information as of November 2021, I assess the following probabilities:

- **Low probability scenario (5-15%)**: Future interstellar objects display even more anomalous characteristics than 'Oumuamua, potentially including regular geometric patterns, non-natural material composition, or technological signatures that cannot be explained through natural processes.

- **Medium probability scenario (15-35%)**: Additional interstellar objects are discovered with unusual properties, but natural explanations continue to be developed. Scientific debate remains active but inconclusive regarding artificial origins.

- **High probability scenario (50-80%)**: Further study of interstellar objects leads to comprehensive natural formation theories that adequately explain their properties, reducing scientific interest in artificial origin hypotheses.

## Key Uncertainties

1. The rate of discovery of new interstellar objects with the deployment of more powerful observational tools
2. Whether future interstellar objects will display more or less unusual characteristics than 'Oumuamua
3. Advances in our understanding of planet formation and ejection mechanisms in other star systems
4. Development of more sensitive detection methods for artificial technosignatures

## Conclusion

Based on the available evidence as of November 24, 2021, the most likely outcome is that national space agencies will not conclude that an interstellar object has non-human artificial origin by 2100. Current scientific research is converging on natural explanations for 'Oumuamua's unusual properties, and the evidentiary threshold for such an extraordinary claim would be extremely high. However, this assessment carries significant uncertainty given the limited sample size of known interstellar objects and the long timeframe of the forecast.
