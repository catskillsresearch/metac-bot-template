# Forecasting Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue Air Quality Index Above 150 in Q3 2024

The Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue metropolitan area has experienced variable air quality challenges over the past decade, with wildfire smoke being the primary contributor to days with unhealthy air quality (AQI > 150). To assess whether the region will experience exactly one day with an AQI value above 150 in Q3 2024, we need to examine historical patterns, current conditions, and relevant environmental factors.

## Historical Trends and Current Status

The historical data provided shows significant year-to-year variability in the number of days with AQI values exceeding 150:
- 2014-2023 range: 0 to 11 days per year
- Average (2014-2023): 4.7 days per year
- Median (2014-2023): 3 days per year

This variability reflects the unpredictable nature of wildfire seasons, which are the primary driver of poor air quality in the Seattle region. As of July 29, 2024, there has already been one day in Q3 2024 with an AQI above 150 (July 5, 2024, with an AQI of 166).

## Factors Affecting Air Quality Forecasts

### Wildfire Conditions and Climate Factors

Air quality in the Seattle area is significantly influenced by wildfire activity, which typically peaks during the middle to late summer months until fall rains arrive. Several climate variables play crucial roles in determining wildfire risk and subsequent air quality impacts:

1. **Precipitation patterns**: Rainfall amounts affect vegetation dryness and fire risk
2. **Wind speed and direction**: Determines whether smoke from wildfires will be transported to the Seattle area
3. **Temperature**: Higher temperatures increase wildfire risk and can worsen air quality[2]

Climate hazards including increased temperatures, humidity, and extreme heat events can lead to worsening air quality. The projected increase in wildfire risk conditions and acres burned by wildfire suggests potential for continued air quality challenges in the region[3].

### Air Quality Monitoring and Reporting

The Washington State Department of Ecology maintains monitoring stations throughout the state to measure air pollution levels. These stations provide real-time data on air quality conditions, which are reported using the federal Air Quality Index (AQI)[1]. The AQI measures several criteria air pollutants and provides information about how recent levels in the air relate to potential health problems.

## Measurement Considerations and Limitations

Several factors create uncertainty in forecasting exact AQI values for the remainder of Q3 2024:

1. **Wildfire unpredictability**: The occurrence, intensity, and location of wildfires depend on multiple factors including weather conditions, human activities, and fuel availability.

2. **Weather variability**: Wind patterns can rapidly change, either bringing smoke into the Seattle area or clearing it out.

3. **Measurement methodology**: The EPA's outdoor air quality data tool reports the highest daily AQI across all monitoring sites in the Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue area, meaning localized air quality events can trigger area-wide classifications.

4. **Seasonal timing**: With two months remaining in Q3 2024 (August and September), there is substantial time for additional high AQI days to occur, especially as these months historically fall within peak wildfire season for the Pacific Northwest.

## Verification Sources

For ongoing monitoring and verification of air quality conditions in the Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue area, the following authoritative sources can be consulted:

1. EPA's Outdoor Air Quality Data tool, which provides historical and current AQI values
2. Washington State Department of Ecology's air quality monitoring network[1]
3. AirNow.gov, which provides real-time air quality data and forecasts

Given the historical patterns, current conditions (one day already exceeding AQI 150 in Q3), and the fact that the peak wildfire season typically extends through August and September, there remains significant uncertainty about whether the region will experience exactly one day with AQI > 150 in Q3 2024.
