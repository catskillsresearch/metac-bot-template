### Key Historical Trends and Current Status  
- **USDA recall volumes** remained below 100 annually since 2020, with 2024 on pace for ~80 recalls across all categories[5].  
- **Dairy-specific data** is absent from the provided sources, but dairy recalls typically constitute a small subset of total food recalls.  
- **HPAI's impact** on dairy recalls is not substantiated in the available data, though the question implies potential relevance.  

### Recent Announcements/Policies  
- **No dairy recalls** are mentioned in the provided 2023-2024 results, though a **September 2024 apple juice recall** occurred due to arsenic levels[4].  
- **Detection methods** (consumer complaints, corporate self-reports, regulatory inspections) remain unchanged[5].  

### Authoritative Sources for Verification  
- **Dairy Recall Tracker** (resolution source): https://www.cdr.wisc.edu/dairy-recall-tracker  
- **FDA Recalls Database**: https://www.fda.gov/safety/recalls-market-withdrawals-safety-alerts[1]  
- **USDA Recall Reports**: Implied by trends in [5], though no direct link is provided.  

### Limitations and Uncertainties  
- **Temporal cutoff**: No data exists for December 2024 as of 11/21/2024.  
- **Data granularity**: The provided sources lack dairy-specific recall counts.  
- **HPAI linkage**: No evidence connects HPAI to dairy recalls in the available materials.  

**Conclusion**: Insufficient data exists to confidently forecast December 2024 dairy recalls. Historical trends suggest recalls are possible but not guaranteed to exceed one.
