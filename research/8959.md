# Forecasting China's Total Fertility Rate in 2031

As of January 10, 2022, China faces significant demographic challenges that will influence its fertility trajectory over the next decade. This analysis examines available evidence to forecast China's total fertility rate (TFR) in 2031.

## Current Situation and Historical Trends

China's total fertility rate stood at 1.3 children per woman in 2020, well below the replacement level of 2.1 needed to maintain population size[2]. This continues a long-term declining trend despite the government's policy shifts away from strict population control. The fertility rate has fallen consistently despite the relaxation of the one-child policy in 2013 and further policy adjustments in 2016[4].

The demographic situation in China shows several concerning patterns:

- China's fertility rate has remained below the "low fertility trap" threshold of 1.5 (reached in 2019, before the pandemic)[4]
- The country is experiencing rapid population aging with increasing dependency ratios
- By 2030, China will have approximately 30% fewer women in prime childbearing years compared to current numbers[2]

## Comparative Analysis with Reference Cases

East Asian economies provide relevant reference cases for China's fertility trajectory:

- Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore have all experienced persistent ultra-low fertility despite pro-natalist policies
- These economies demonstrate that once fertility falls below certain thresholds, reversing the trend becomes extremely difficult
- The pan-Asian trend toward fewer children appears to be continuing regardless of policy interventions[2]

## Key Factors Affecting the Forecast

Several factors will likely influence China's fertility rate through 2031:

1. **Policy changes**: Despite repealing the one-child policy and now allowing up to three children, these policy adjustments have not reversed the declining trend
2. **Demographic momentum**: The shrinking pool of women in childbearing age (30% reduction by 2030) creates structural limitations on potential births[2]
3. **Socioeconomic factors**: Rising education costs, housing prices, and changing attitudes toward family formation continue to suppress fertility desires
4. **Cultural shifts**: Changing preferences regarding family size and increasing prioritization of career development among younger Chinese

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on available evidence as of January 2022, I forecast China's 2031 TFR as follows:

- **Most likely range**: 0.8 to 1.4 children per woman
- **Central estimate**: 1.1 children per woman[2]
- **Probability distribution**:
  - 10% chance of TFR below 0.8
  - 70% chance of TFR between 0.8 and 1.4
  - 20% chance of TFR above 1.4 but below 1.7
  - <5% chance of TFR reaching or exceeding replacement level (2.1)

This assessment is supported by:

1. Persistent downward pressure on fertility despite policy changes
2. Demographic structural constraints (fewer women of childbearing age)
3. The observed difficulty in reversing fertility declines in comparable East Asian societies
4. The continued fall in fertility despite the end of the one-child policy

## Uncertainties and Limitations

Several factors create uncertainty in this forecast:

- Potential for more aggressive pro-natalist policies, including significant financial incentives
- Possible technological interventions (e.g., assisted reproductive technologies)
- Measurement challenges in accurately capturing fertility rates
- Unpredictable social or economic shifts that could change family formation preferences

While China could theoretically implement more dramatic interventions (such as a "massive and unprecedented test tube baby program"), such measures would likely face practical limitations and would not affect women who have already had children or chosen to remain childless[2].
