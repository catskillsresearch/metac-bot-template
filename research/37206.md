## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- BRICS expanded dramatically at the 15th Summit (2023), inviting six new countries to full membership; four (Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, UAE) officially joined in January 2024. Indonesia became a full member after being invited at the 16th Summit and joined in January 2025[4][5].
- The 16th Summit (October 2024) introduced a new partner country framework, inviting 13 nations to this status, indicating a more measured approach to expansion, with partner status as a precursor to full membership[4].
- As of May 28, 2025, BRICS consists of Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, UAE, and Indonesia. Saudi Arabia and Argentina were previously invited but have not joined[5].

## 2. Recent Announcements and Policies

- The 17th BRICS Summit will take place in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on July 6–7, 2025[1][2][5].
- Brazil, as 2025 chair, has prioritized trade and investment, AI regulation, climate action, public health, and institutional development—focusing on internal consolidation and operational efficiency[5].
- No official public statements or press releases from Brazil or the BRICS Secretariat have confirmed plans to invite new full members at the 17th Summit as of May 28, 2025[3][5].
- The partner country framework remains active, but no country has been elevated from partner to full member since Indonesia[4][5].

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- Membership expansion requires unanimous consent among all current members, a process that can be slowed by internal politics or shifting geopolitical priorities.
- Many countries have expressed interest in joining, but formal invitation deliberations are typically confidential until consensus is reached.
- Partner country status is a new mechanism and could influence future full member invitations, but no clear signals have been made public.
- Last-minute negotiations or political developments could alter intentions before or during the summit.

## Probabilistic Assessment

Given the shift in focus from rapid expansion to institutional development, the lack of any confirmed new invitations or clear preparatory signals as of late May 2025, and the precedent of public announcements preceding previous expansions, the probability that a new country will be invited to full BRICS membership at the 17th Summit appears **low**. However, the ongoing partner framework and broad interest from potential members mean the probability is not zero.

**Estimated probability as of May 28, 2025:**
- Chance that at least one new country is invited to full BRICS membership at the 17th Summit: **~20%**

This estimate reflects the bloc’s current consolidation phase, the absence of public expansion plans, and the procedural hurdles to unanimous agreement.
