## Forecast: Will the Social Democratic Party of Austria Win the Most Seats in the 2025 Viennese State Election?

### 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The Social Democratic Party of Austria (SPÖ) has historically dominated Vienna, frequently winning the most seats in the city's state elections.
- In the 2024 Austrian general election, the far-right Freedom Party of Austria (FPÖ) made significant national gains, but these were much stronger in rural areas. In urban centers like Vienna, the SPÖ has remained comparatively resilient, while the Greens lost ground and the ÖVP suffered notable losses[5].
- The FPÖ’s support is closely tied to anti-immigration and anti-EU sentiment, which tends to be less pronounced in Vienna’s diverse, urban electorate[5].

### 2. Recent Polls and Election Indicators

- The IFDD poll from March 24, 2025, referenced in the question, is the most recent public indicator of party standings in Vienna. While the exact figures are not provided in the search results, the context from multiple sources suggests the SPÖ continues to lead in Vienna, consistent with historical trends and recent polling[5].
- National poll aggregations and recent election results confirm the SPÖ’s continued strength in urban areas, even as the FPÖ leads nationally[1][5].

### 3. Recent Announcements and Policy Developments

- The SPÖ has emphasized humane immigration policies and integration, which align with the priorities of many Viennese voters[3].
- Nationally, the SPÖ has played a central role in coalition negotiations aimed at excluding the FPÖ from government, reinforcing its position as a key political force[4].

### 4. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Poll aggregations and election analyses from Politico, Wikipedia, Le Monde, and CEU provide a reliable basis for assessing party trends and voter intentions[1][3][4][5].

### 5. Limitations and Uncertainties

- Polls are subject to change, especially close to election day, and may not fully capture late shifts in voter sentiment.
- Vienna’s unique political landscape means that national trends do not always directly translate to local results.
- Coalition dynamics and voter turnout can influence the final seat distribution.

### Conclusion

Based on historical dominance, recent polling, and the political context as of April 21, 2025, the Social Democratic Party of Austria is favored to win the most seats in the 2025 Viennese state election. However, uncertainties remain due to potential late shifts in voter preferences and the impact of national political dynamics.
