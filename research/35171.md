Based on information available as of February 18, 2025, here's an analysis to help forecast how many Oscars "The Brutalist" might win at the 97th Academy Awards:

## Current Status and Predictions

"The Brutalist" has been nominated for 10 Academy Awards in 2025. The film has emerged as a strong frontrunner in the Oscar race, particularly after its success at the Golden Globes. It won Best Drama Picture at the Golden Globes, which historically has been a reliable predictor for the Academy Awards Best Picture winner[2]. Since 2000, the Golden Globes' Best Drama Picture has gone on to win the Oscar for Best Picture nine times, most recently with "Oppenheimer" the previous year[2].

The film is described as "an epic historical drama, well over three hours long," which aligns with the Academy's traditional preferences[1]. Multiple sources are predicting "The Brutalist" to win Best Picture at the 2025 Oscars[1][2][4][5].

## Key Category Analysis

### Best Picture
"The Brutalist" is widely considered the frontrunner for Best Picture. After taking home Best Drama at the Golden Globes, many industry analysts are predicting it will win the top prize at the Oscars[4]. The Golden Globes' Best Drama category has matched with the Oscars' Best Picture winner 40 out of 81 times, giving "The Brutalist" strong statistical support[2].

### Best Actor
Adrien Brody is nominated for Best Actor for his performance in "The Brutalist." His chances of winning appear strong, with some sources predicting him as the winner[4]. His performance is described as "phenomenal" in portraying immigration and American troubles[4]. However, he faces stiff competition from Timoth√©e Chalamet for "A Complete Unknown," who spent five years preparing for his role as Bob Dylan[4][5].

### Best Director
Brady Corbet, the director of "The Brutalist," won at the Golden Globes, which may boost his chances at the Oscars[2]. However, detailed predictions for this category are limited in the available information.

## Factors That May Influence the Outcome

1. **Studio Support**: "The Brutalist" is an A24 film, a studio that has gained significant prestige in recent years[4].

2. **Critical Reception**: The film appears to have strong critical acclaim, being described as "extremely deserving"[2].

3. **Potential Controversies**: There has been some controversy surrounding the film regarding "the use of AI to enrich the actors' accents," which could potentially impact voting in certain categories[4].

4. **Competition**: Films like "Anora," "Conclave," and "A Complete Unknown" are also considered strong contenders in various categories[2][3].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

While "The Brutalist" has 10 nominations, the available information primarily focuses on its prospects for Best Picture and Best Actor. There's limited information about its chances in technical categories or supporting actor categories, which would be crucial for predicting a higher total Oscar win count.

Additionally, Oscar voting patterns can be unpredictable. While precursor awards like the Golden Globes provide some indication, they don't always align with final Oscar results. The Golden Globes missed predicting the Best Picture winner in 2021 when they awarded "The Power of the Dog" over "CODA"[2].

Based on the available information, "The Brutalist" appears poised to win at least Best Picture and has strong chances in the Best Actor category, with potential for additional wins in other categories among its 10 nominations.
