# Assessing the Likelihood of Russian Nuclear Weapon Use in Ukraine

The question of whether Russia might detonate a nuclear weapon in Ukraine or Ukrainian-held territory before October 1, 2024, requires careful analysis of recent developments, statements by Russian officials, and expert assessments of Russia's nuclear doctrine and decision-making.

## Russia's Nuclear Posture and Recent Statements

In June 2024, Russian President Vladimir Putin indicated potential changes to Russia's nuclear doctrine, while maintaining that nuclear weapons would only be used in "exceptional cases…when there is a threat to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country." Despite reaffirming Russia's official declaratory policy from 2020, Putin refused to "rule out the possibility of making changes to this doctrine"[1].

Putin's statements on June 20, 2024, suggested that potential changes to Russia's nuclear doctrine would be driven by concerns about adversaries' development of "explosive nuclear devices of extremely low power"[1]. This indicates a possible shift in Russia's threshold for nuclear use, though the specific nature of such changes remains unclear.

Since the beginning of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Putin has made several direct and indirect threats referencing Russia's nuclear weapons, particularly in the context of military setbacks and in protest of NATO support for Ukraine[1].

## Ukrainian Incursion into Kursk Oblast and Russia's Response

On August 6, 2024, Ukrainian forces launched a surprise offensive into Russia's Kursk Oblast, marking the first time Ukrainian army units had crossed the border into Russia since the beginning of the conflict[5]. During the first week of this counter-invasion, Ukrainian forces reportedly established control over approximately one thousand square kilometers of land in Russia's Kursk Oblast[5].

By August 15, 2024, Ukrainian Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi reported that Ukrainian forces had advanced between 500 meters and 1.5 kilometers in unspecified areas of Kursk Oblast on that day alone, and had advanced 35 kilometers deep since the beginning of the operation on August 6[2].

Significantly, despite this incursion into Russian territory, there has been no nuclear saber-rattling from Moscow in response[4]. This absence of nuclear threats following what could be considered a direct threat to Russia's territorial integrity has led some analysts to suggest that Putin's previous "red lines" regarding nuclear use may have been a bluff[4].

## Analysis of Russia's Nuclear Threats

The Ukrainian incursion into Kursk Oblast has created what some observers describe as "a full-blown crisis for the Kremlin"[4]. The lack of nuclear threats from Russia in response to this development has led some analysts to conclude that "bold military action by Ukraine has, at a stroke, exposed as a bluff Moscow's key strategy for keeping the West backed off: the fear of nuclear escalation"[4].

One practical consideration is that using nuclear weapons on Russian territory occupied by Ukrainian forces would be counterproductive for Russia, as noted by one analysis: "it would hardly help him to drop a nuke on Russian territory, after all"[4].

The Ukrainian operation in Kursk Oblast has likely expanded the Kremlin's consideration for what type of Ukrainian operations are possible along the border and highlighted what some analysts describe as a "strategic failure of imagination" on the part of Putin and the Kremlin[2].

## Russia's Nuclear Capabilities

Russia is estimated to possess between 1,000 to 2,000 tactical nuclear weapons in its stockpile. These nonstrategic nuclear weapons are smaller in yield than strategic nuclear weapons and are designed for battlefield usage against specific targets, even when friendly forces are in close proximity.

In May 2024, Putin ordered the Russian military to carry out tactical nuclear weapon drills in response to what Russia's defense ministry described as "provocative statements and threats" by NATO. This marked the first time such an announcement was made publicly, potentially signaling Russia's readiness to employ these weapons if deemed necessary.

## The Kursk Nuclear Power Plant Factor

An additional consideration in the current situation is the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant, which is located approximately 60 kilometers from the Ukrainian border[3]. The proximity of this nuclear facility to the area of conflict introduces another layer of complexity to the situation, as any military action near the plant could have severe consequences.

## Conclusion

Based on the available information as of August 15, 2024, there are several factors suggesting that Russia is unlikely to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine or Ukrainian-held territory before October 1, 2024:

1. Despite Ukrainian forces occupying Russian territory in Kursk Oblast—which could be interpreted as a threat to Russia's territorial integrity—Moscow has not issued nuclear threats in response.
2. The practical limitations of using nuclear weapons on Russian territory occupied by Ukrainian forces make such an action counterproductive for Russia.
3. The absence of nuclear threats following the Ukrainian incursion suggests that previous "red lines" may have been primarily intended as deterrence rather than actual triggers for nuclear use.

However, several factors increase uncertainty:

1. Putin's recent statements about potentially changing Russia's nuclear doctrine.
2. The unprecedented nature of the Ukrainian incursion into Russian territory, which may lead to unpredictable responses as the situation evolves.
3. Russia's demonstrated willingness to conduct tactical nuclear weapon drills and make nuclear threats throughout the conflict.

The situation remains fluid, and developments between now and October 1, 2024, could significantly alter this assessment.
