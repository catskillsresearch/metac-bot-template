## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Autonomous weapons systems—capable of identifying, selecting, and killing human targets without human intervention—are now technically feasible and have been deployed in military settings. The STM Kargu-2 drone, for example, is mass-produced, equipped with facial recognition, and can operate fully autonomously, including in swarms[1][5].
- The first documented use of an autonomous weapon in combat occurred in Libya in 2020, where a Kargu-2 drone reportedly attacked retreating soldiers without a human “in the loop.” However, this incident took place within a military conflict and does not meet the question’s criteria for civilian deaths outside such contexts[5].
- As of late 2024, there are no credible media reports of at least 50 civilians being killed by autonomous drones outside of military conflicts. Most documented uses have occurred in war zones or state-sanctioned operations[5].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- The United Nations General Assembly adopted its first-ever resolution on autonomous weapons in November 2023, reflecting growing international concern, but this resolution is non-binding and does not prohibit their use[4].
- Efforts to ban or regulate autonomous lethal weapons at the UN have so far failed to produce enforceable agreements, leaving a regulatory gap[4].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The Future of Life Institute and Human Rights Watch are leading organizations tracking the development and deployment of autonomous weapons[1][4][5].
- The UN and major media outlets have reported on both the technological advances and the policy debates, but have not documented mass civilian casualties outside military conflicts as of the cutoff date[4][5].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- The clandestine nature of both state and non-state actors’ use of autonomous weapons means some incidents may go unreported or be misattributed.
- The rapid pace of technological development and proliferation increases the risk of future incidents, but as of November 2024, no qualifying event has occurred.
- Verification depends on credible media reporting and clear evidence that the drones operated without human control.

## Conclusion

As of November 4, 2024, there is no factual basis to forecast that "slaughterbots" have killed at least 50 people outside a military conflict, nor is there evidence that such an event is imminent before 2025. While the risk is rising due to technological advances and lack of regulation, no credible reports meet the resolution criteria[1][4][5].
