## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The Impoundment Control Act (ICA) of 1974 restricts the President’s ability to unilaterally withhold or delay congressionally appropriated funds, requiring notification to Congress and subjecting impoundment to strict procedural rules[1].
- The Supreme Court has never squarely decided the constitutionality of the ICA. In Clinton v. New York (1998), the Court ruled the Line-Item Veto Act unconstitutional but did not address the broader question of impoundment authority. The Court has generally avoided direct decisions on the merits of broad presidential impoundment power, instead focusing on specific statutory or procedural issues[2][5].
- Historic precedent (Kendall v. United States ex rel. Stokes) rejects the notion that the President can unilaterally refuse to spend appropriated funds, a view reinforced by most modern legal scholarship[5].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- The Trump administration, during its second term, has openly challenged the ICA’s constitutionality and has taken steps perceived as impoundment, leading to repeated GAO findings of legal violations—most recently in May 2025 regarding the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure funds[3].
- Legal challenges to these actions are actively working through the courts, with the administration aiming to provoke a Supreme Court ruling on impoundment[2][4].
- In February 2025, Senator Mike Lee and Representative Andrew Clyde reintroduced companion bills to repeal the ICA, marking an explicit legislative effort to expand presidential impoundment authority[2].
- The administration’s position is that the ICA unconstitutionally restricts executive power, and the current political debate centers on whether the President should regain broader impoundment authority[2][4].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Congressional Research Service reports, Government Accountability Office (GAO) decisions, and Supreme Court case law serve as primary verification sources for developments in this area[1][3][5].
- Ongoing litigation and Congressional records of legislative activity will provide definitive updates on any statutory changes or court decisions.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- The Supreme Court’s docket is unpredictable; cases may not reach a merits decision before November 2026, particularly given procedural hurdles and the Court’s historical avoidance of broad rulings on impoundment[2][5].
- Even with active litigation and legislative proposals, the process of enacting a bill or obtaining a Supreme Court decision is typically lengthy, especially for constitutional questions with national impact.
- Political variables—such as Congressional composition, shifting public opinion, and the outcome of the 2026 midterm elections—may affect the legislative prospects for ICA repeal or modification.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the above:
- The likelihood of the Supreme Court issuing a final merits decision expanding presidential impoundment authority before November 3, 2026, is low but not negligible, given current active litigation and the administration’s stated intent. The Court’s historical reluctance and procedural delays remain significant barriers.
- The probability of Congress enacting a bill expanding impoundment authority is also modest, given the divided and contentious political environment, though not impossible with sustained executive and legislative pressure.
- Overall, an expert-adjusted estimate would place the probability of expansion of presidential impoundment authority—via Supreme Court decision or new law—before November 3, 2026, at approximately 20-30%. This reflects increased activity and political will, but significant legal and institutional inertia.
