# Forecasting Analysis: US Embryo Selection for Intelligence

To assess whether the United States will be among the first ten countries to have >10% of newborns selected for intelligence through embryo selection, I'll analyze the key factors that would influence this outcome based on information available as of January 31, 2022.

## Regulatory Environment

The United States has a relatively permissive regulatory framework regarding assisted reproductive technologies (ART) and embryo selection:

- As of 2022, there are no federal statutes in the US relating to sex selection or limits on the number of human embryos that may be created or transferred[1].
- Unlike many other countries that have instituted bans on elective sex selection for non-medical reasons, the United States has not implemented such restrictions[5].
- The FDA's role is primarily focused on infectious disease risk management rather than regulating the specific applications of embryo selection technology[2].

This regulatory environment creates conditions where embryo selection technologies can develop with fewer restrictions compared to other nations.

## Current Technology Status

Several indicators show the US is at the forefront of embryo selection technology:

- The first polygenically screened baby was born in the United States in 2021, demonstrating that the technology for genetic screening of embryos is already operational.
- US-based companies like Genomic Prediction (now operating as Lifeview) and Orchid are actively developing and commercializing embryo selection technologies.
- Preimplantation Genetic Testing (PGT) is increasingly used in IVF procedures, creating infrastructure that could support intelligence selection if the technology advances[5].

However, as of early 2022, the technology for reliably selecting embryos for intelligence (with the specified minimum of 3 IQ points improvement) remains unproven at scale.

## Public and Political Attitudes

American attitudes toward embryo selection present a mixed picture:

- Public polling shows limited support for using technology to enhance intelligence, with older Americans particularly skeptical.
- Younger Americans demonstrate greater openness to reproductive technologies, suggesting potential for increased acceptance over time.
- Political opposition exists from both conservative and progressive perspectives:
  - Right-leaning opposition often stems from religious beliefs that life begins at conception.
  - Left-leaning criticism frequently frames embryo selection as a form of eugenics.

The polarized nature of American politics could create obstacles to widespread adoption, even if the technology becomes reliable and affordable.

## Market and Economic Factors

Several market conditions would influence adoption rates:

- IVF procedures remain expensive in the US, with costs typically ranging from $12,000 to $25,000 per cycle, limiting accessibility.
- Insurance coverage for fertility treatments varies widely by state, with many states not mandating coverage.
- For embryo selection to reach >10% of newborns, either costs would need to decrease dramatically or insurance coverage would need to expand significantly.

## International Context

The global competitive landscape may influence US adoption rates:

- China's growing biotechnology industry and different regulatory approach could potentially lead to faster adoption there.
- American media and academic sources express concern about losing scientific leadership to China, which might create pressure for the US to embrace such technologies.
- Cultural attitudes toward genetic enhancement vary significantly across countries, with some potentially more receptive than the US.

## Forecast Considerations

For the US to be among the first ten countries with >10% of newborns selected for intelligence:

1. The technology must advance to reliably deliver at least 3 IQ points improvement.
2. Costs must decrease substantially to enable widespread adoption.
3. Public attitudes would need to shift toward greater acceptance.
4. Regulatory environment would need to remain permissive.
5. Healthcare systems would need to incorporate the technology.

Given the extremely long timeframe (until 2300), technological advancement is highly likely, but social and regulatory factors remain unpredictable.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several key uncertainties affect this forecast:

- The science of polygenic scoring for intelligence remains in early stages as of 2022.
- Long-term regulatory responses to embryo selection technologies are unpredictable.
- Public attitudes may shift dramatically in either direction over time.
- The potential emergence of alternative enhancement technologies could make embryo selection obsolete.
- The very definition and measurement of "intelligence" may evolve significantly over time.
