# Poverty Rate Forecast: Argentina First Half 2025

The question asks whether Argentina's poverty rate will be lower in the first half of 2025 compared to the 41.7% recorded in the second half of 2023. Based on available data as of May 2025, I can provide the following assessment.

## Current Status and Historical Trends

Argentina's poverty rate has shown a notable improvement since 2023. According to INDEC (Argentina's official statistics agency), the poverty rate dropped to 38.1% in the second half of 2024, down from 41.7% in the second half of 2023[5]. This 3.6 percentage point reduction occurred during President Javier Milei's first year in office.

The World Bank's projections for 2025 estimate Argentina's poverty rate at 15.6%, though it's important to note that this uses the World Bank's definition which typically differs from INDEC's methodology[1]. Meanwhile, some researchers suggest the poverty rate could fall as low as 30% during 2025[3].

## Policy Impact Assessment

Milei's government has implemented significant austerity measures aimed at controlling inflation, which had exceeded 140% when he took office. These measures include:

1. Fiscal responsibility policies
2. Economic liberalization
3. Significant cuts to government spending

While these policies initially caused economic hardship, with some economists warning that the short-term impact would increase poverty[2], the latest data suggests that the poverty reduction trend is materializing faster than some expected. The government attributes this improvement to their economic policies, stating: "The path of economic freedom and fiscal responsibility is the way to reduce poverty in the long term."[5]

## Measurement Considerations

Several factors affect the reliability of this forecast:

- **Definition discrepancies**: Different organizations use different poverty measurements, as evidenced by the significant gap between INDEC's figures and World Bank projections.
- **Economic indicators**: Current inflation projections for 2025 remain high at 62.7%, which continues to affect purchasing power[1].
- **Unemployment**: Projected at 7.6% for 2025, unemployment remains a factor in poverty rates[1].
- **Data timing**: The most recent official poverty statistics are for the second half of 2024, with first half 2025 data not expected until later in the year.

## Forecast Assessment

Based on the available evidence, the poverty rate in the first half of 2025 is likely to be lower than the 41.7% recorded in the second half of 2023. This assessment is supported by:

1. The already established downward trend (from 41.7% to 38.1%) as of the end of 2024[5]
2. The continued implementation of economic policies that have started showing results
3. Expert projections suggesting further poverty reduction in 2025[3]

However, it's important to note that economists have warned that official figures may not fully capture the economic reality for ordinary Argentines struggling with the effects of austerity measures[5]. The cost of the basic basket that determines the poverty line continues to increase, as evidenced by the rise to 356,073.46 USD in March 2025, up from 342,370.04 USD previously[4].

## Conclusion

The evidence suggests a greater than 50% probability that Argentina's poverty rate in the first half of 2025 will be below the 41.7% benchmark from the second half of 2023. The current trajectory and official data support this conclusion, though economic hardships continue for many citizens despite the improving official statistics.
