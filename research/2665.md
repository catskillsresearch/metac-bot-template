## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- In March 2019, Volkswagen Group announced a major expansion in electric mobility, raising its 10-year production target from 15 to 22 million fully electric vehicles based on the MEB platform by 2030. This was part of a broad push for CO2 neutrality, new model launches, and charging infrastructure expansion.
- The MEB platform launched as VW’s core modular EV platform, underpinning new models across brands like VW, Audi, Škoda, and SEAT, with production starting in 2020.
- As of 2025, VW’s electrification strategy includes up to 70 all-electric models planned by 2030, and ambitious goals for EV sales shares in key markets (e.g., targeting 55% of US sales to be fully electric by 2030)[3][4].

## 2. Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Metric

- In 2024, Volkswagen reaffirmed its commitment to electrification with a three-stage plan up to 2030: strengthen competitiveness, expand the electric model portfolio, and aim for global technology leadership[1][2].
- Despite these ambitions, recent statements from VW leadership and industry reporting indicate a scaling back of battery production plans. Originally targeting six battery cell plants with 240 GWh annual capacity by 2030, VW has reduced this to three plants and 170 GWh, citing slower-than-expected EV market growth[5].
- The company continues to introduce new EV models and invest in EV infrastructure, but is taking a more measured, cost-conscious approach in light of market realities.

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Official press releases and newsrooms from Volkswagen Group[1][2][3][4]
- Industry news reports on VW’s battery and EV production plans[5]

## 4. Limitations or Uncertainties in Measurement

- The forecast depends heavily on global EV demand, which has underperformed expectations in recent years, especially in Europe and North America.
- VW’s production numbers are also contingent on the successful scaling of battery cell supply, technological advancements, and the continued suitability of the MEB platform or its successors.
- External factors such as regulatory changes, supply chain disruptions, and competition may further impact total production volume by 2030.

## Probabilistic Assessment

Given VW’s original target and ongoing commitment, but factoring in recent market slowdowns and VW’s own reduction of battery and production targets, the likelihood that VW produces fewer than 22 million MEB-based fully electric vehicles by 2030 is now significantly higher than it appeared in 2019. The forecast should be adjusted from a 2019 baseline of “plausible but ambitious” to “more likely than not” that they will fall short of the 22 million target, owing to the industry headwinds and the company’s revised plans.

**Adjusted probability estimate (as of early 2025):**  
There is a greater than 60% chance that Volkswagen Group will produce fewer than 22 million MEB-based (or successor platform) fully electric vehicles by 2030, reflecting a moderate-to-high likelihood of shortfall relative to the original target.
