## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- **Obergefell v. Hodges** (2015) established a constitutional right for same-sex couples to marry, requiring all U.S. states and territories to recognize and license such marriages[1][2][4].
- The original decision was narrow (5–4), with strong dissents and significant public attention[1][2].
- Since 2015, the ideological makeup of the Supreme Court has shifted rightward due to several retirements and new appointments, giving the Court a solid conservative majority[5].
- In 2022, the Court overturned Roe v. Wade (Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health), signaling a willingness to revisit and reverse major precedents, especially those grounded in substantive due process[5].
- Justice Clarence Thomas, in his concurring opinion in Dobbs, explicitly called for reconsidering substantive due process precedents, naming Obergefell as a target for future review[5].

## 2. Recent Announcements and Policies

- Conservative legislators have increased calls for the Supreme Court to revisit Obergefell, with state-level resolutions and public statements arguing for the case to be reconsidered[5].
- More than two dozen states still have laws on the books restricting same-sex marriage, which could be reactivated if Obergefell is overturned[5].
- The Respect for Marriage Act, signed into law in 2022, guarantees federal recognition for same-sex (and interracial) marriages, providing some protection even if Obergefell is overturned[5].

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- The Supreme Court's willingness to overturn precedent depends on both the specifics of any future case and the preferences of the justices at the time of review. While the Court is more conservative, there is no sign as of 2022 that a direct challenge to Obergefell is imminent.
- Public opinion on same-sex marriage is considerably more favorable than on abortion, making the political consequences of overturning Obergefell much more severe.
- The passage of the Respect for Marriage Act changes the consequences of overturning Obergefell, as federal recognition would remain, but state-level bans could again be enforced in some states.
- Measurement is limited by the lack of a current, direct challenge to Obergefell on the Court’s docket as of April 2022.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the Court’s increased conservatism, explicit calls from some justices and lawmakers to revisit Obergefell, and the precedent of overturning Roe, the probability of Obergefell being overturned before 2030 is meaningfully higher than it was in 2015. However, several mitigating factors reduce the likelihood:

- Stronger public support for same-sex marriage compared to other issues.
- The political and social backlash potential.
- Recent federal legislation (Respect for Marriage Act) that would blunt the practical impact of an overturn.
- No direct challenge pending as of April 2022.

**Estimated probability as of April 2022:** Between 10% and 25% chance that the Supreme Court will overturn Obergefell v. Hodges before 2030.
