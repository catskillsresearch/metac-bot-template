## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The WHO has declared a PHEIC in response to zoonotic respiratory viruses that demonstrate significant human spread or potential for international impact. The 2009 H1N1 "Swine Flu" pandemic and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic both received PHEIC status after evidence of international spread in humans[3].
- In March 2024, Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) H5N1 was detected in US dairy cattle, with the first human infection in this context reported in April 2024. This marks a new mammalian host and raises concern about viral adaptation to humans.
- As of May 2024, there is no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission of HPAI H5N1, but the species jump to cattle is seen by experts as a potentially significant evolutionary step toward wider transmissibility.

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- The WHO has recently declared a PHEIC for the 2024 mpox upsurge due to geographic expansion and operational challenges, not just due to high person-to-person transmission[1][5]. This indicates WHO’s willingness to act preemptively when an event is unusual, has international implications, and requires coordinated response.
- The International Health Regulations (2005) clarify that a PHEIC must be of communicable disease nature, pose a risk of international spread, and require international coordination[2].

## Authoritative Verification Sources

- WHO official statements and website, which publish all PHEIC declarations and rationale[1][3].
- CDC and other national health agencies, while informative, do not resolve the forecast according to the criteria.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- A PHEIC declaration requires not just isolated human cases, but an event that the WHO deems as constituting an international public health risk requiring a coordinated response[3].
- Evolution of HPAI H5N1 toward sustained human-to-human spread is not guaranteed, and the virus may remain largely zoonotic.
- Surveillance and reporting have improved post-COVID-19, which may increase the likelihood of early or preemptive PHEIC declarations for novel zoonoses, even before large-scale human outbreaks.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the recent species jump of HPAI H5N1 to cattle, the known risk of zoonotic pandemics, and the WHO’s demonstrated willingness to declare PHEICs for events with unusual patterns and substantial international concern (as with mpox in 2024), the probability that an avian influenza virus in humans will be declared a PHEIC by the WHO before 2030 is **materially elevated compared to prior years**. While not certain, the risk is non-trivial and plausibly in the range of 30–45% over the next five years.
