### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of May 2025, Beirut International Airport (BEY) is served by 30 airlines with direct flights to 51–56 destinations, depending on the source[1][2][3][4].
- The number of direct destinations has remained relatively stable in recent months, with most trackers listing 54 or more scheduled routes[1][2][3].
- DirectFlights.com, which sometimes reports slightly lower figures, still lists 51 non-stop destinations as of May 2025[4].

### Recent Announcements and Policies

- Lebanon’s tourism and hospitality sectors face significant challenges due to economic pressures and regional security concerns[2][3][4].
- Reports in May 2025 highlight that Israeli attacks have dampened tourism expectations for the summer, which could impact airline schedules and route viability[3].
- No public announcements indicate a large-scale suspension of routes from Beirut as of the current date.

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- [FlightsFrom.com](https://www.flightsfrom.com/BEY) is the official resolution source for this question and currently lists 54 direct destinations[2].
- AirportInformation.com and FlightConnections.com both corroborate this figure, with the latter listing up to 56 destinations[1][3].
- DirectFlights.com, while slightly more conservative, still reports 51 destinations[4].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- The direct destination count can change rapidly due to airline schedule adjustments, especially in response to security incidents or economic downturns.
- Summer schedules (starting late June) may see seasonal route changes, but as of now, the count is above the threshold.
- The situation is fluid; a sudden escalation in regional conflict or further economic deterioration could lead to route suspensions before July 1, 2025.

### Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given that all major trackers currently list 51 or more direct destinations from Beirut, and most list 54 or more, the probability that there will be greater than 51 direct flight destinations on July 1, 2025, is high—estimated at 80–90%. However, this is subject to short-term risks from regional instability and airline operational decisions.
