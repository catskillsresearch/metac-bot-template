# Forecasting Analysis: Potential EU Exit by Founding Members Before 2027

As of November 15, 2016, the European Union faces unprecedented challenges following the UK's Brexit referendum. This analysis examines the likelihood of any founding member (Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, or Germany) triggering Article 50 before 2027.

## 1. Current Situation vs. Reference Cases

The UK's June 2016 Brexit vote represents the first member state decision to leave the EU, creating a novel situation with limited historical precedents. In 2016, Brexit was expected to result in significant social, economic, political, and institutional shifts within the Union[1].

**Historical Context:**
- No founding member has previously left the EU or its predecessor organizations
- Greenland (an autonomous territory of Denmark) withdrew from the European Communities in 1985
- The UK had a historically complicated relationship with European integration, maintaining opt-outs from the Euro and Schengen

**Current Eurosceptic Sentiment:**
- France: Marine Le Pen's National Front has gained significant support on an anti-EU platform
- Italy: The Five Star Movement and Northern League both express Eurosceptic positions
- Netherlands: Geert Wilders' Freedom Party has advocated for a "Nexit"
- Germany, Belgium, and Luxembourg maintain stronger pro-EU positions

## 2. Key Differences Affecting the Forecast

Several factors distinguish the founding members from the UK case:

**Economic Integration:**
- All founding members except Luxembourg use the Euro currency, creating significantly higher exit barriers than for the UK
- Economic integration between founding members is deeper than the UK-EU relationship was
- A constructed index capturing channels of integration indicates growing EU-UK bilateral integration over 30 years prior to Brexit[4]

**Political Factors:**
- The founding six have deeper historical ties to the European project
- Continental European countries may view the EU differently than the UK's island perspective
- Electoral systems in most founding members make it harder for single-issue parties to gain power

**Institutional Considerations:**
- Article 50 process requires a member state to formally notify the European Council
- The process entails complex negotiations lasting up to two years
- No legal mechanism exists for expelling a member state

## 3. Probabilistic Assessment

Based on available information as of November 2016, the probability of any founding member leaving before 2027 can be assessed as follows:

**High-Risk Factors:**
- Growing populist and Eurosceptic movements across multiple founding states
- Economic challenges in southern Europe, particularly Italy
- Migration pressures creating political tensions
- Potential contagion effect if Brexit is perceived as successful

**Mitigating Factors:**
- Euro currency creates significant economic barriers to exit
- Founding members have deeper institutional and cultural ties to the European project
- Economic analysis suggests significant costs to EU exits
- EU may reform in response to Brexit pressures

**Country-Specific Assessments:**

| Country | Risk Level | Key Factors |
|---------|------------|-------------|
| Italy | Moderate-High | Banking crisis, high debt, strong Eurosceptic parties |
| France | Moderate | Strong Eurosceptic opposition, but institutional barriers |
| Netherlands | Low-Moderate | Eurosceptic voices, but strong economic integration |
| Belgium | Very Low | Strong EU identification, hosts EU institutions |
| Germany | Very Low | Central to EU project, economically benefits |
| Luxembourg | Very Low | Strong EU identification, hosts EU institutions |

## 4. Conclusion

The probability of any founding member leaving the EU before 2027 appears low to moderate based on information available in November 2016. Italy presents the highest risk due to economic challenges and political dynamics, followed by France. The Netherlands shows some risk factors, while Belgium, Germany, and Luxembourg appear firmly committed to the EU.

The reversal of integration following Brexit will likely impact income and employment across the EU[4], potentially affecting political sentiment. However, the economic and political barriers to exit for founding members are substantially higher than they were for the UK.

The overall probability estimate for at least one founding member leaving before 2027 is approximately 15-25%, with this risk concentrated in Italy and, to a lesser extent, France.
