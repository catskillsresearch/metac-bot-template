### Forecast for OCHA's Final Pre-April 1, 2025 Water Production Snapshot

- **Most recent reported value (Feb 16–Mar 1, 2025):** 135,232 cubic meters per day[5].
- **Trend:** Steady increase from 85,325 (mid-Jan) → 97,167 (late Jan) → 116,671 (early Feb) → 135,232 (late Feb–early Mar)[1][2][4][5].
- **Drivers:** Improved fuel availability, operational groundwater wells, and targeted humanitarian interventions[2][5].
- **Constraints:** Up to 70% of produced water lost due to damaged distribution networks; actual delivered water is much lower[5].

#### **Forecasted Figure**
Based on the latest available data and the upward trend, the most likely figure OCHA will report in its final impact snapshot before April 1, 2025, is **approximately 135,000 cubic meters per day**. This estimate could be slightly higher if fuel and operational conditions continue to improve, but significant increases beyond this level are unlikely without major infrastructure repairs or policy changes.

#### **Limitations**
- The figure represents water produced, not water delivered to end users.
- Any sudden changes in fuel supply, security, or infrastructure could affect the actual reported value.
