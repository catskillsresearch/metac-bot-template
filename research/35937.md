### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of March 14, 2025, the Boston Celtics had a record of 48-19, which placed them second in the Eastern Conference standings[4].
- The Cleveland Cavaliers led the Eastern Conference with a 55-10 record, and the Oklahoma City Thunder led the Western Conference at 54-12, both with higher winning percentages than the Celtics[4].
- The Celtics clinched a playoff spot for the 11th straight season, reflecting their consistent performance, but they were trailing both the Cavaliers and Thunder in terms of winning percentage at this point[4].

### Recent Announcements and Policies

- There were no significant announcements or policy changes reported before March 14, 2025, that would directly impact the Celtics' ability to surpass the Cavaliers or Thunder in winning percentage by April 1, 2025.

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The NBA official standings page is the definitive source for determining which team has the highest winning percentage on April 1, 2025[1].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- The standings can change rapidly due to injuries, trades, or unexpected winning or losing streaks.
- Projections and simulations, such as those by Strat-O-Matic, predicted a strong finish for the Celtics but are not definitive; actual results may vary[5].
- Only the standings as they appear on the NBA official site on or after April 1, 2025, will resolve the question.

### Summary Table: Top NBA Teams as of March 14, 2025

| Team                   | Record   | Winning Percentage |
|------------------------|----------|--------------------|
| Cleveland Cavaliers    | 55-10    | .846               |
| Oklahoma City Thunder  | 54-12    | .818               |
| Boston Celtics         | 48-19    | .716               |

Given the Celtics' position as of March 14, 2025, they would need a significant winning streak and/or slumps from the Cavaliers and Thunder to have the highest winning percentage by April 1, 2025. While possible, the available data suggests they are not the frontrunner for this metric at the cutoff date.
