# Will China's GDP Overtake the US Before 2030?

As of May 2025, the latest economic data provides significant insights into the trajectory of both economies, allowing for a more informed forecast than was possible in February 2022.

## Current Economic Status

The most recent figures from the IMF World Economic Outlook (April 2025) show the United States GDP at $30.51 trillion, while China's GDP stands at $19.23 trillion[1]. This represents a substantial gap of approximately $11.28 trillion between the two economies. In 2024, the US economy reached approximately $29.2 trillion with a 2.8% growth rate, while China's economy expanded by 5.0% to reach approximately $18.9 trillion[3].

This gap is confirmed by other sources which indicate that on a nominal basis, the US will be ahead of China by $10.8 trillion in 2025[4]. However, it's worth noting that on a purchasing power parity (PPP) basis, China is already ahead of the US by approximately Int. $9.1 trillion[4].

## Growth Trajectories and Forecasts

Goldman Sachs recently raised its projections for both economies, expecting 4.6% Chinese GDP growth and increasing its forecast for fourth-quarter 2025 US GDP growth to 1.0% from 0.5%[2]. The consistent pattern shows China maintaining higher percentage growth rates than the United States, though starting from a lower absolute base.

China is expected to achieve its GDP growth target of around 5% in 2025, despite earlier predictions from global financial institutions that growth would fall below this target[5]. The Chinese government's approach to GDP targets differs fundamentally from Western economies - in China, GDP growth is treated as an input (a predetermined target that will be achieved through necessary interventions) rather than an output (a measure resulting from decentralized economic activity)[5].

## Key Factors Affecting the Forecast

Several structural differences between the economies influence their growth potential:

1. **Per Capita GDP Disparity**: The US had a significantly higher per capita GDP of $86,600 in 2024, compared to China's $13,445, highlighting the vast difference in economic productivity per individual[3].

2. **Economic Structure**: The US maintains a high-wage labor market and strong service-driven economy, while China continues its transition from export-led industrialization to domestic consumption-driven growth[3].

3. **Growth Strategy**: China faces a tradeoff between boosting domestic consumption and increasing infrastructure investment, with different implications for debt levels and economic sustainability[5].

4. **Debt Concerns**: China's debt-to-GDP ratio may increase more rapidly if infrastructure investment takes precedence over consumption and exports in achieving growth targets[5].

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on the current economic data and growth trajectories, China's nominal GDP overtaking the US before 2030 appears unlikely. The $10.8 trillion gap as of 2025[4] would require China to maintain a growth rate exceeding that of the US by approximately 7-8 percentage points annually for the remaining years until 2030, which is not supported by current forecasts.

Even with China's growth rate at 4.6-5.0% and US growth at 1.0-2.8%, the absolute dollar difference is too substantial to be closed within the 5-year timeframe from 2025 to 2030. Simple extrapolation suggests the convergence would more likely occur sometime in the 2030s, assuming current growth differentials persist.

The probability of China overtaking the US in nominal GDP terms before 2030 is estimated at less than 20%, barring any extraordinary economic disruptions to either country or significant changes in currency valuations.

However, it's important to note that on a PPP basis, China has already surpassed the US[4], which some economists consider a more meaningful measure of economic output for certain comparative purposes.
