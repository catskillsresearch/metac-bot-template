## Key Factual Information as of July 18, 2024

**1. Current Status and Renewal Terms**
- Verisign operates the authoritative registry for the .com TLD under a Cooperative Agreement with the US Department of Commerce (DOC) and a separate Registry Agreement with ICANN[3].
- The Cooperative Agreement between Verisign and the DOC is set to automatically renew for a six-year term unless the DOC provides written notice of non-renewal by August 2, 2024[3].
- The current .com Registry Agreement between ICANN and Verisign runs through November 30, 2024, but the DOC's Cooperative Agreement is the controlling government instrument for Verisign's operation of .com[3].

**2. Recent Announcements and Policy Developments**
- As of June 28, 2024, Verisign filed a notice with the SEC stating that the .com contract cannot be put out to competitive bidding, signaling Verisign's expectation that the agreement will continue[2].
- There is no public record or announcement from the DOC indicating that it has provided notice of non-renewal or intends to terminate or sunset the Cooperative Agreement before the August 2, 2024 deadline[2][3].
- Advocacy groups have called for the Biden administration to end Verisign's "government-designated monopoly," but there is no evidence of government action in response as of the latest available reporting[2].

**3. Authoritative Sources for Verification**
- The ICANN public comment archive and Verisign's SEC filings are primary sources confirming the agreement's terms and current status[2][3].
- News outlets and industry analysis (e.g., Domain Name Wire) have reported on the lack of government action to end the agreement as of late June 2024[2].

**4. Limitations and Uncertainties**
- The DOC could, in theory, provide notice of non-renewal up to August 2, 2024, but as of July 18, 2024, there is no evidence it has done so.
- Advocacy and political pressure exist, but there is no indication of imminent government action.
- The situation could change rapidly if the DOC issues a notice, but such an event would be widely reported and is not reflected in the available sources.

## Conclusion

Based on all available factual information as of July 18, 2024, there is no evidence that the US Department of Commerce has taken steps to terminate or sunset its Cooperative Agreement with Verisign before the August 2, 2024 deadline. Unless a last-minute notice is issued (which would be unprecedented and highly publicized), the agreement is expected to automatically renew, and Verisign will continue to manage the .com TLD.
