# Forecasting UK Electoral Reform: Proportional Representation by 2030

The question asks whether the UK House of Commons will be elected by proportional representation (PR) before 2030, with at least 15% of seats decided by some form of PR. Based on current evidence as of May 2025, I'll analyze key factors affecting this forecast.

## Current Status of Electoral Reform

As of May 2025, the UK continues to use the First Past the Post (FPTP) system for general elections to the House of Commons[4]. However, there has been significant movement on electoral reform in recent months:

1. The 2024 general election produced what analysts described as "the least proportional result in British history," reigniting debates about electoral reform[3].

2. In December 2024, the Elections (proportional representation) Bill, tabled by Liberal Democrat MP Sarah Olney, narrowly cleared its first hurdle in the House of Commons with a vote of 138 to 136[5].

3. Despite this initial progress, the Bill faced significant obstacles, with Downing Street stating it had "no plans" to reform the voting system, and the Bill was unlikely to progress due to lack of parliamentary time[5].

## Public Opinion and Political Support

Recent polling shows growing public support for electoral reform:

- As of February 2025, half of Britons (49%) support introducing a PR system, almost twice as many as the 26% who favor retaining FPTP[3].

- Support for PR is strongest among Green (72%), Reform UK (67%), and Liberal Democrat voters (61%), all parties that officially support electoral reform[3].

- Notably, a majority of Labour voters (53%) also support moving to a PR system, while Conservatives are more evenly divided (39% support PR, 42% support FPTP)[3].

- Of those expressing a preference, nearly two-thirds (64%) feel strongly about their position, with PR supporters feeling particularly strongly (66%)[3].

## Parliamentary Developments

The parliamentary situation shows mixed signals:

- The narrow passage of the Elections (proportional representation) Bill in December 2024 demonstrates there is some appetite for reform among MPs[5].

- However, the government has explicitly stated it has "no plans" to reform the voting system, creating a significant political obstacle[5].

- Parliamentary debates on proportional representation have continued into 2025, as evidenced by Hansard records from January 30, 2025[1].

## Comparative Analysis with Previous Reform Attempts

The current situation differs from previous reform attempts in several ways:

1. The 2011 referendum on Alternative Vote (AV) failed, but current polling shows stronger public support for PR than existed for AV.

2. The "least proportional result" from the 2024 election has created stronger motivation for reform than existed in previous cycles.

3. Cross-party support appears stronger, with even a majority of Labour voters now supporting PR.

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on the available evidence, I estimate the probability of the UK House of Commons being elected by proportional representation before 2030 at **25-30%**.

Key factors supporting this assessment:

- **Positive factors**: Growing public support across party lines, recent parliamentary progress with the Elections Bill, and the widely criticized disproportionality of the 2024 election results.

- **Negative factors**: Explicit government opposition, limited parliamentary time allocated to reform efforts, and the historical difficulty of changing electoral systems in the UK.

- **Timeline considerations**: With the current government stating no plans for reform, significant progress would likely require either a change in government position or a new government following the next general election (likely in 2029 based on the five-year cycle). This leaves limited time to implement changes before 2030.

## Key Uncertainties

Several factors could significantly alter this forecast:

1. A potential shift in the government's position on electoral reform, particularly if public pressure continues to grow.

2. The outcome of the next general election, which could bring pro-PR parties into power or coalition positions.

3. The specific type of PR system that might be proposed - mixed-member systems might face less resistance than complete overhauls.

4. Constitutional constraints and the parliamentary timetable, which could delay implementation even if legislation passes.

In conclusion, while there is growing momentum for electoral reform in the UK, significant political obstacles remain. The probability of achieving PR for at least 15% of House of Commons seats before 2030 remains moderate but not high, requiring substantial political shifts in the next few years to become reality.
