## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The USDA's "What Can SNAP Buy?" page has historically listed "snack foods" as eligible for purchase with SNAP benefits. As of May 5, 2025, and up to at least May 20, 2025, "snack foods" remains explicitly mentioned as an eligible purchase category[3].
- SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) rules have generally allowed a broad range of packaged and processed foods, including snacks, with only certain categories (e.g., hot foods, alcohol, supplements) explicitly excluded[4][5].

## Recent Announcements and Policy Developments

- In February 2025, the Trump administration's USDA chief publicly discussed the possibility of banning "bad food and sugary drinks" from SNAP, according to news reports. However, this was presented as a proposal or intention, not as an enacted rule or finalized policy change.
- There is no public evidence of a formal rulemaking process, new regulatory guidance, or administrative notice from the USDA since then indicating that "snack foods" will be removed from the eligible list by July 1, 2025.

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The USDA Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) official website's "What Can SNAP Buy?" page is the authoritative reference for eligible items[3].
- Additional guidance is available from the National Council on Aging and the Farmers Market Legal Toolkit, both of which confirm the current rules as of 2025[3][5].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- If the USDA were to expedite a policy change, it would likely still require formal rulemaking, which typically involves public notice, a comment period, and administrative reviewâ€”processes that usually take months.
- Sudden, unannounced changes that would remove "snack foods" from the eligible list and update the public-facing website before July 1, 2025, would be unprecedented and are not indicated by current official communications or public records.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the lack of evidence for a finalized or imminent rule change, the explicit mention of "snack foods" as of May 2025, and the slow pace of typical regulatory processes, it is highly probable that the USDA will still list "snack foods" on its "What Can SNAP Buy?" page as of July 1, 2025.
