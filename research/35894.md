# 2025 Wisconsin Supreme Court Election Forecast Analysis

The upcoming Wisconsin Supreme Court election on April 1, 2025, represents a pivotal moment in state politics with significant implications for the court's ideological balance. Based on information available as of March 10, 2025, here is an analysis to help forecast the potential winner.

## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

The Wisconsin Supreme Court experienced a major shift in 2023 when liberals gained control of the court for the first time in over a decade[2][4]. This current election is particularly consequential because:

- The race features conservative Waukesha County Judge Brad Schimel against liberal Dane County Judge Susan Crawford[4]
- The election will determine whether liberals maintain their majority through at least 2028 or whether conservatives regain influence through Justice Brian Hagedorn becoming the pivotal swing vote again[4]
- In the previous four years since Hagedorn's election, there were 61 decisions split 4-3 along ideological lines, with Hagedorn being in the majority for 50 of those cases[4]
- Under the first year of liberal control, the court decided only 14 cases, with just four split 4-3 along ideological lines[4]

## Recent Developments Affecting the Race

The 2025 Wisconsin Supreme Court election has already broken records in terms of campaign spending and national attention:

- As of early March 2025, the race had seen more than $33 million in spending, making it potentially one of the most expensive judicial contests ever[2]
- Groups affiliated with Elon Musk have contributed approximately $6 million to the race[2]
- The candidates advanced from the February 18, 2025 primary election[1]
- The race is officially nonpartisan, though Schimel has been endorsed by conservatives and Crawford by the state Democratic Party[2][4]

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

Several official sources will provide election results:

- The Wisconsin Elections Commission will provide official statewide results[1][3]
- County election websites across Wisconsin will post local results[3][5]
- St. Croix County, for example, will post unofficial results after 8 p.m. on election night (April 1) and official results after the Board of Canvassers convenes on April 8, 2025[5]

## Limitations and Uncertainties in Forecasting

Several factors complicate efforts to predict the winner:

- Wisconsin judicial elections are officially nonpartisan, which can make voter behavior less predictable than in explicitly partisan races[2]
- The unprecedented level of spending, particularly from national figures like Elon Musk, introduces new variables into the electoral dynamics[2]
- The 2023 election that flipped the court to liberal control suggests potential volatility in Wisconsin judicial politics[2][4]
- The race occurs in a presidential election cycle, which may affect turnout patterns compared to previous judicial elections[4]
- Justice Brian Hagedorn's role as a swing vote in the past demonstrates that justices don't always vote strictly along ideological lines once on the bench[4]

## Conclusion

The 2025 Wisconsin Supreme Court election between Brad Schimel and Susan Crawford represents a high-stakes contest with national implications. While polling data is not provided in the available information, the race's significance is underscored by record-breaking campaign spending and the potential to either cement liberal control of the court or restore a more balanced ideological composition with Justice Hagedorn as the swing vote. The outcome will likely depend on voter turnout, campaign effectiveness, and broader political dynamics in Wisconsin.
