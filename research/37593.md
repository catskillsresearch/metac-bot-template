### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Award for Favorite Female TV Star (Family) is determined by online fan voting, favoring actresses with strong youth and family appeal and active social media fanbases[1][3].
- Recent winners in similar categories include Miranda Cosgrove and Sofia Vergara, both from shows with large, engaged young audiences[3].
- 2025 nominees are: Anna Cathcart (XO, Kitty), Janelle James (Abbott Elementary), Jayden Bartels, Peyton List, Reba McEntire, and Ryan Kiera Armstrong[5][1].
- The award show will air live on June 21, 2025, in the U.S., with a global rollout following shortly after[5].

### Key Differences Affecting the Forecast

- Anna Cathcart (XO, Kitty) and Peyton List (Cobra Kai universe) are both associated with streaming hits popular among younger demographics, giving them an advantage in an online voting environment[1][5].
- Janelle James, while critically acclaimed in Abbott Elementary, comes from a show with a broader age appeal and may not draw as many young voters as Nickelodeon's core audience.
- Reba McEntire and Ryan Kiera Armstrong are both established, but may not command the same level of direct fan engagement among Nickelodeon’s primary viewers as Cathcart or List.
- Jayden Bartels has a strong social media presence, but her current role’s popularity relative to the others is less clear based on available data.

### Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Based on the above factors:
- Anna Cathcart and Peyton List are the most likely winners, with Anna Cathcart having a slight edge due to the recency and youth appeal of XO, Kitty, which has been heavily promoted and is trending among the target demographic[1][5].
- Janelle James is a strong contender but may be limited by demographic crossover.
- Reba McEntire, Jayden Bartels, and Ryan Kiera Armstrong are less likely under current patterns.

**Estimated probabilities:**
- Anna Cathcart: ~35%
- Peyton List: ~30%
- Janelle James: ~18%
- Jayden Bartels: ~8%
- Reba McEntire: ~5%
- Ryan Kiera Armstrong: ~4%

- Last-minute surges in fan voting or viral trends could shift the outcome.
