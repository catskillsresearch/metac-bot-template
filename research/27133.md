## Key Factual Information as of August 12, 2024

**Historical Trends and Current Status**
- Traditionally, US presidential debates are organized by the Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD), but in 2024, Trump and Biden agreed to bypass the CPD and scheduled two debates independently[1][4].
- The first debate between Donald Trump and Joe Biden took place on June 27, 2024[2].
- On July 21, 2024, Joe Biden announced he would no longer seek reelection, leaving the Democratic nomination open and the debate schedule in flux.

**Recent Announcements and Policies**
- A second debate between Trump and Biden was scheduled for September 10, 2024, to be hosted by ABC News[2]. However, after Biden dropped out, the status of this debate became uncertain.
- Trump publicly questioned whether the September 10 debate would proceed, suggesting it should be moved to Fox News and indicating no agreement had been reached with the new Democratic nominee[3].
- Trump has proposed three debates against Kamala Harris, who is expected to become the Democratic nominee, but as of August 12, 2024, there is no confirmation that any such debate is formally scheduled or agreed upon before October 1, 2024[3].

**Authoritative Sources for Verification**
- Major news outlets (CBS News, NBC, ABC News, Deadline Hollywood) confirm the uncertainty surrounding the second debate and the lack of confirmed debates between Trump and the new Democratic nominee as of the cutoff date[2][3][4].

**Limitations and Uncertainties**
- The Democratic nominee is in transition, and no formal, live debate between Trump and the new nominee (presumably Harris) is confirmed as scheduled or agreed upon before October 1, 2024.
- Only the June 27, 2024, debate between Trump and Biden is confirmed to have taken place.
- The September 10 debate's status is unclear, and there is no evidence of more than one debate between Trump and the Democratic nominee before October 1, 2024.

**Conclusion**
Based on all available information as of August 12, 2024, there is no evidence to suggest that Donald Trump will debate the Democratic nominee for president more than once before October 1, 2024. Only one debate (Trump vs. Biden on June 27) is confirmed, and the status of any additional debates remains uncertain.
