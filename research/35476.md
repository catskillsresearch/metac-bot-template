## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- NASA's SPHEREx (Spectro-Photometer for the History of the Universe, Epoch of Reionization and Ices Explorer) mission has been in development for several years, with a primary science goal of mapping the entire sky in infrared wavelengths to answer fundamental questions about the universe's structure and the origins of water and organic molecules[1][4].
- The mission was originally scheduled for launch "no later than April 2025," with the most recent official updates targeting late February 2025 for launch aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Vandenberg Space Force Base, California[1][3][4][5].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- As of December 2024, NASA and SpaceX were targeting late February 2025 for the SPHEREx launch[1].
- On February 15, 2025, Vandenberg Space Force Base announced a mission overview event and stated that SPHEREx was "scheduled to launch no earlier than Feb. 27, 2025"[5].
- As of February 24, 2025, multiple reputable sources reported the launch was set for Friday, February 28, 2025[4].
- There are no reports in the available sources of a delay, cancellation, or successful launch as of February 28, 2025.

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) official news releases[1]
- Caltech's SPHEREx mission updates[2]
- Vandenberg Space Force Base public affairs announcements[5]
- Science news outlets such as Space.com[4]

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- The available sources confirm the scheduled launch date but do not provide explicit confirmation that the launch occurred before April 1, 2025.
- There is no evidence of a launch delay or cancellation as of February 28, 2025, but absence of evidence is not evidence of occurrence.
- The resolution of this question depends on the actual event of launch, not just the scheduled date.

## Conclusion

Based on all factual information available as of February 28, 2025, NASA's SPHEREx space telescope was scheduled to launch before April 1, 2025, specifically on February 28, 2025. However, there is no explicit confirmation in the available sources that the launch actually occurred before April 1, 2025. Therefore, while the launch was planned for before April 1, 2025, it cannot be confirmed with certainty that it took place before that date based solely on the information available up to February 28, 2025[1][4][5].
