### 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of January 2025, the Kalshi market for "Which party will win the 2028 Presidential Election?" shows Democrats with a slight edge: 51% for Democrats, 49% for Republicans[5].
- Community forecasting platforms like Metaculus estimate a 55% probability that Democrats will be favored on Kalshi during the last week of 2025, based on current trends and market pricing[3].
- The 2024 election saw Donald Trump return to office, meaning there is no Democratic incumbent running in 2028, which historically increases uncertainty for the out-party but does not necessarily erase their market edge.

### 2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- No major policy announcements or political shocks have been reported as of January 10, 2025, that would significantly alter party favorability in prediction markets.
- Both major parties lack a clear 2028 frontrunner, with Democratic and Republican nominee odds spread across several candidates[5].

### 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Kalshi's official market for the 2028 presidential election party winner provides real-time prices and will be the definitive source for resolution[1].
- Metaculus tracks community forecasts specifically for whether Democrats will be favored on Kalshi at the end of 2025[3].
- Election Betting Odds and Benzinga track and report on Kalshi's live odds and candidate breakdowns[4][5].

### 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- The forecast is based on current market pricing and could shift due to major political events, candidate announcements, or external shocks.
- Prediction markets are generally accurate but not infallible; probabilities reflect current sentiment and available information, not certainties.
- The measurement depends on the median price over the last week of December 2025; even small shifts could flip the outcome.

### Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the current slight Democratic edge in the Kalshi market and the absence of major disruptive events, it is reasonable to assess that, as of January 2025, Democrats are modestly favored to be ahead in the last week of 2025. However, the margin is narrow, and the probability of Democrats being favored should be considered around 50-55%, reflecting both the market's current lean and the inherent uncertainty this far from the election[3][5].
