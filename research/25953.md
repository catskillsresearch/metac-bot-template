### Key Factual Information Relevant to the Forecast

- In the 2024 snap legislative elections, no party or alliance won an outright majority in the 577-seat National Assembly[1][2].
- The left-wing New Popular Front (NFP) alliance won the most seats (180–188), followed by President Macron’s Together (Ensemble) coalition (161–163 seats), and the far-right National Rally (RN) and its allies (142–143 seats)[1][2].
- The outgoing Prime Minister, Gabriel Attal, is from the Together coalition, but his government was already a minority and relied on case-by-case deals for legislative support[1].
- The French system allows the President to appoint the Prime Minister, but the government can be toppled by a vote of no confidence. The Prime Minister typically comes from the largest bloc or from a coalition able to avoid such a vote.
- The NFP, as the largest bloc, has claimed the right to nominate the Prime Minister, and there is no evidence of a formal agreement that would allow Together to retain the post[1][2].
- The new National Assembly is highly fragmented, making stable majority government formation difficult, but the Together coalition’s reduced seat count makes it unlikely they can secure or maintain the premiership without broad cross-bloc support[1][2].

### Recent Announcements and Policies

- Both Together and the NFP guided their third-placed candidates to withdraw in many districts to block the far-right, but this was a tactical move for the runoffs, not a governing coalition[1].
- There have been no public announcements of a governing pact between Together and the NFP that would keep a Together Prime Minister in office as of July 10, 2024.

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The official composition of the government, including the Prime Minister’s party, can be verified at the French government’s official site and the Interior Ministry[1].
- Election results and seat counts are available from the IPU Parline database, Politico, and Le Monde[1][2][5].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- The hung parliament creates significant uncertainty, and coalition negotiations could be protracted.
- While the NFP is the largest bloc, it does not have a majority, and the fragmented assembly could lead to unexpected alliances or a technocratic caretaker government.
- The President retains discretion in nominating the Prime Minister, but political realities make it unlikely that a Together Prime Minister could survive a no-confidence vote without broad support.

### Conclusion

Based on the available information as of July 10, 2024, it is unlikely that the Prime Minister of France will belong to the Together coalition on July 30, 2024. The Together coalition lost significant ground in the elections, and the left-wing NFP is asserting its claim to the premiership as the largest bloc. The fragmented parliament increases uncertainty, but the prevailing trends and seat counts do not favor Together retaining the post.
