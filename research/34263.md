# Forecasting Michael Jordan vs. Howard Schultz Net Worth Comparison

To forecast whether Michael Jordan's net worth will exceed Howard Schultz's by March 31, 2025, I'll analyze the available historical data and trends up to my knowledge cutoff of January 29, 2025.

## Michael Jordan's Net Worth Trajectory

Michael Jordan has demonstrated consistent growth in his net worth over recent years:

- In October 2023, Jordan was worth $3 billion, ranking him at No. 379 on the Forbes 400 list[1].
- By April 2024, his net worth had increased to $3.2 billion according to Forbes' 2024 Billionaires List[2].

This represents a $200 million increase (approximately 6.7%) over a six-month period, indicating a positive growth trajectory.

### Key Wealth Drivers

Jordan's wealth stems from multiple sources:

1. **Business Sale**: In August 2023, Jordan sold his majority stake in the Charlotte Hornets at a $3 billion valuation, which represented a significant financial windfall. This was nearly 17 times the franchise's value when he became principal owner in 2010[3].

2. **Nike Partnership**: Jordan earns substantial ongoing income from his Nike partnership, with a reported annual royalty check of approximately $260 million[3].

3. **Other Endorsements**: Throughout his career, Jordan has earned an estimated $2.4 billion (pre-tax) from endorsement deals with brands including McDonald's, Gatorade, and Hanes[3].

4. **NASCAR Investment**: In 2020, Jordan co-founded the Cup Series team 23XI Racing, which could represent another growing asset in his portfolio[3].

## Limitations in Forecasting

Several limitations affect the accuracy of any forecast:

1. **Limited Data on Howard Schultz**: The search results provide no information about Howard Schultz's current net worth, business activities, or wealth trajectory.

2. **Market Volatility**: Both individuals likely have significant investments in various markets, making their net worth subject to market fluctuations.

3. **Private Business Interests**: Both Jordan and Schultz may have private business dealings that could significantly impact their wealth but aren't publicly disclosed.

4. **Timing of Forbes Updates**: Forbes' real-time billionaires list may not reflect the most current valuations of all assets.

## Conclusion

Based on the available information, Michael Jordan has demonstrated consistent growth in his net worth, increasing from $3 billion in late 2023 to $3.2 billion by April 2024[1][2]. His diverse income streams from Nike royalties, other endorsements, and business investments suggest continued potential for growth.

However, without comparable data on Howard Schultz's wealth trajectory and business activities, it's difficult to make a definitive forecast about whether Jordan's net worth will exceed Schultz's specifically by March 31, 2025.

The resolution of this question will ultimately depend on both individuals' business decisions, investment performance, and market conditions in the first quarter of 2025.
