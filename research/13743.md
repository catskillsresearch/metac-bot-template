## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Since the 1960s, several states have developed and tested ASAT weapons, but only a handful of destructive, debris-generating kinetic tests have occurred, with the 2007 Chinese test being the most notorious for its fallout[5].
- As of December 2022, there have been no publicly confirmed cases of a non-test, operational ASAT attack against a satellite. All known uses have been for testing purposes.
- Growing commercial and governmental reliance on satellites for communications, navigation, and intelligence has increased incentives for both protection and potential targeting[5].

## 2. Recent Announcements and Policies

- The U.S. announced a unilateral moratorium on destructive direct-ascent ASAT missile testing but did not extend this to all types of ASAT weapons or prohibit their operational use[3][4].
- The 2022 United Nations resolution called on states to refrain from destructive direct-ascent ASAT tests, but it is non-binding and does not cover all weapon types or operational use[1].
- Policy focus is shifting toward non-destructive ASAT methods (e.g., jamming, cyber, directed energy) that are less likely to create debris, aligning with both military and diplomatic interests[5].
- Russia and China have not agreed to similar comprehensive bans, and their development and deployment of ASAT capabilities continue[3].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Unilateral and international policy documents (e.g., U.S. White House statements, UN resolutions)[1][4].
- Technical reports and open-source intelligence on ASAT capabilities and tests[5].
- Credible defense and space policy analyses[3].

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- Non-kinetic ASAT attacks (e.g., jamming, cyber) may be difficult to attribute or detect, possibly resulting in underreporting.
- The dual-use nature of many space technologies complicates intent assessment and verification.
- International policies are largely non-binding and do not eliminate the military utility or development of ASATs by key space powers.
- Escalation in a geopolitical crisis could override current diplomatic restraint.

## 5. Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

- Given the strong international norm against debris-generating kinetic ASAT use and increasing adoption of non-destructive alternatives, the probability of a destructive kinetic ASAT attack in a non-test context before 2030 appears low.
- However, the likelihood of a non-kinetic offensive ASAT operation (e.g., jamming, cyberattack, directed energy) is higher, especially amid rising global tensions and the strategic value of space assets.
- Overall, the probability that any type of ASAT weapon (kinetic or non-kinetic) will be used offensively against a satellite before 2030 is moderate—roughly estimated at 30–50%, driven primarily by the potential for non-kinetic actions and crisis escalation scenarios.
