## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of February 2025, Vox’s support among voters aged 18-24 in Spain stands at 27%, according to the latest 40dB poll published by El País—its highest support across all age groups[2].
- Vox is the most popular party among young voters (18-24 and 18-34), with its youth support growing steadily since the 2023 general election. The most recent data even place Vox at 27.4% among 18-24-year-olds, ahead of both the Socialist and center-right parties[2].
- This pattern mirrors broader European trends, as far-right parties have also seen increasing youth support in France and Germany[2].

## Recent Announcements and Policy Changes

- In July 2024, Vox withdrew from regional government coalitions, aligning itself more closely with the European far-right, which may consolidate its appeal among anti-establishment youth but risks alienating moderates[1].
- Government responses to youth protests and increased austerity may further drive disillusionment with mainstream parties, indirectly benefitting Vox[5].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The relevant metric is the 40dB direct voting intention poll for the 18-24 age group, as published by El País (e.g., the February 2025 barometer)[2].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- Youth voting intention is historically volatile and can shift rapidly in response to political events, scandals, or campaign dynamics.
- The 27% figure is already unusually high for a far-right party in Spain; surpassing it would likely require continued erosion of support for establishment parties or exceptional campaign developments.
- The outcome depends strictly on the final 2025 40dB poll. If this is published before October 1, 2025, the question is void.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given current trends, Vox is polling at or just above the 27% threshold among young voters. Structural factors and recent political developments suggest further growth is plausible but not guaranteed. The probability that Vox will surpass 27% among 18-24-year-olds by the end of 2025 is moderately above 50%, but subject to considerable uncertainty due to the volatility of youth preferences and external events.
