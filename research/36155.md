# Will a Max show win the 2025 GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Comedy Series?

Based on the available information as of March 18, 2025, this question can be definitively answered.

## Current Status

The 36th Annual GLAAD Media Awards nominees were announced on January 22, 2025[1][2][5]. Max had three shows nominated in the Outstanding Comedy Series category:
- Hacks
- The Sex Lives of College Girls
- Sort Of[1][2]

According to the official GLAAD announcement, **Hacks** (Max) has won the 2025 GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Comedy Series[1][2]. This information was published on the GLAAD official website, which clearly marks Hacks as the "WINNER" in this category.

## Context and Significance

The GLAAD Media Awards recognize media for fair, accurate, and inclusive representations of the LGBTQ community[1]. The awards are determined through a process involving over 700 GLAAD Media Award voters and volunteers who evaluate nominees based on four criteria: fair and inclusive representations, boldness and originality, cultural impact, and overall quality.

Max (formerly HBO Max) has shown strong representation in the comedy category with three of its shows nominated this year. The Sex Lives of College Girls was specifically noted for how it portrays characters "openly navigating and discovering their sexual identities in a light-hearted way"[5].

## Historical Context

While not extensive historical information is provided in the available sources, we can note that according to one source, the previous year's (35th GLAAD Media Awards) winner in this category was Apple TV+'s Ted Lasso[3].

## Conclusion

Based on the official announcement from GLAAD, a Max show (Hacks) has won the 2025 GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Comedy Series. This resolves the question as **Yes**.
