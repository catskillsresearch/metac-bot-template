### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The EUR/USD exchange rate peaked at 1.5852 in July 2008 and has since declined, with notable volatility.
- In September-October 2022, the euro briefly traded below parity (1 EUR < 1 USD), but by January 1, 2024, it had recovered to 1.1038[1][3].
- Throughout 2024, the euro has generally remained above 1.00 against the dollar, supported by modest Eurozone growth and a cautious approach from the US Federal Reserve[3][5].

### Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Metric

- The US Federal Reserve is expected to cut rates more slowly than previously anticipated, with a projected terminal rate of 3.75% in 2025, supporting the dollar's strength[2][4].
- The European Central Bank (ECB) is forecast to continue easing, potentially cutting rates to 1.75% or 2.5% by late 2024 or early 2025, which could weaken the euro but not necessarily push it below parity[2][4].
- The interest rate differential between the US and the Eurozone is expected to remain wide, but not enough to drive the EUR/USD below 1.00 under current baseline scenarios[2].

### Authoritative Forecasts and Projections

- JPMorgan predicts EUR/USD at 1.05 in June and September 2024, 1.09 in December 2024, and 1.12 in March 2025, all above parity[3].
- FXOpen and other analysts expect the euro to face downward pressure but generally remain above 1.00, with 2024-2025 forecasts ranging from 1.03 to 1.12[4][5].
- ING analysis suggests that, based on interest rate spreads and risk premiums, EUR/USD is likely to hover around 1.05 over the next two years[2].
- Most bank and algorithm-based projections for early 2025 place the EUR/USD between 1.03 and 1.12, with no mainstream forecast expecting a sustained drop below 1.00[5].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- Currency markets are highly sensitive to unexpected events, such as geopolitical crises, financial shocks, or abrupt changes in central bank policy[1].
- While the consensus is for the euro to remain above parity, a significant negative shock to the Eurozone or a sharp rise in US rates could push the EUR/USD below 1.00, even if only briefly[2][4].
- Forecasts are based on current economic trajectories and policy guidance, which can change rapidly.

### Conclusion

As of November 14, 2024, all major forecasts and available data suggest that the EUR/USD exchange rate is expected to remain above 1.00 through the end of 2024 and into early 2025. While a brief dip below parity cannot be entirely ruled out due to market volatility, there is no strong evidence or authoritative forecast indicating that 1 Euro will be worth less than 1 US Dollar before 2025.
