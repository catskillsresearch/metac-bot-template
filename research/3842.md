### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of March 2020, the many-worlds interpretation (MWI) of quantum mechanics remains a minority position among physicists. The most recent qualifying survey (arXiv:1612.00676, December 2016) found that 39% of respondents preferred the Copenhagen interpretation, 6% preferred the Everett (many-worlds) interpretation, and 36% had no preference. The remainder selected other interpretations or options[arXiv:1612.00676].
- Earlier surveys (e.g., Schlosshauer et al., 2013) show similar results: MWI is respected in some theoretical circles but has not achieved majority support among physicists overall.
- The Copenhagen interpretation continues to hold the largest share of support, though a significant portion of physicists express no preference or are agnostic regarding interpretations.

### Recent Announcements and Policies

- Up to March 2020, there have been no major announcements, policy changes, or experimental breakthroughs that would be expected to shift the majority of physicists toward accepting MWI.
- The debate remains largely philosophical, as no empirical test is known that could definitively distinguish MWI from other mainstream interpretations (such as Copenhagen or objective collapse models).

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The most authoritative sources for this metric are published surveys of physicists regarding their interpretation preferences. Examples include:
  - Schlosshauer, Kofler, and Zeilinger, "A Snapshot of Foundational Attitudes Toward Quantum Mechanics" (2013)
  - The December 2016 arXiv survey (arXiv:1612.00676)
- Additional relevant data may be found in future surveys conducted by major physics societies or published in peer-reviewed journals.

### Limitations and Uncertainties in Measurement

- Polls may not be fully representative due to sample size, selection bias, or focus on particular subfields (e.g., quantum foundations vs. experimental physics).
- The interpretation debate is influenced by philosophical as well as scientific considerations, which can slow changes in consensus.
- Future theoretical or experimental developments could alter the landscape, but as of March 2020, no such shift is evident.
- The definition of "acceptance" and the framing of survey questions can impact results; some physicists may express pragmatic indifference rather than active endorsement or rejection of MWI.
