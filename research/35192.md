# Will Julian Assange receive a pardon before April 1, 2025?

As of February 2025, Julian Assange's potential presidential pardon remains a topic of significant advocacy and debate. Based on available information, here's an analysis of factors relevant to forecasting whether Assange will receive a pardon before April 1, 2025.

## Current Status and Historical Context

Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, was released from custody in June 2024 following a 14-year legal battle that ended with him pleading guilty to charges of conspiring to obtain and disclose classified documents[2]. Despite his release, Assange's conviction under the Espionage Act remains a significant concern for press freedom advocates[2][5].

Assange made history as the first publisher to be convicted under the United States Espionage Act for publishing activities[5]. His prosecution has been criticized for potentially criminalizing routine journalistic conduct that has traditionally been protected by the First Amendment[1].

## Recent Advocacy for Presidential Pardon

As of January 2025, there has been substantial pressure on President Biden to use his pardon power before leaving office:

1. **Coalition of Rights Organizations (January 16, 2025)**: A coalition of press freedom and civil liberties organizations formally urged President Biden to pardon Assange to mitigate the damage to press freedom caused by his conviction[1].

2. **Australian Leaders' Appeal (January 17, 2025)**: A group of Australian leaders, including several Members of Parliament, wrote to President Biden requesting a full and unconditional pardon for Assange. Signatories included independent MPs Zoe Daniel, Helen Haines, Monique Ryan, David Pocock, Kylea Tink, and Andrew Wilkie, along with representatives from the Human Rights Law Centre, the Media Entertainment and Arts Alliance, and The Australia Institute[2].

3. **Public Petitions**: Various petitions have circulated calling for Assange's pardon, including one promoted by Robert F. Kennedy Jr.[4].

## Arguments For and Against Pardon

### Arguments Supporting Pardon:

- **Press Freedom Concerns**: Advocates argue that Assange's conviction "sets a deeply troubling precedent for press freedom globally" and "endangers journalists worldwide"[2].

- **Democratic Values**: Supporters contend that pardoning Assange would reinforce shared democratic values of transparency and freedom at a time when these principles are under pressure[2].

- **Reduction of Harm**: Freedom of the Press Foundation Director of Advocacy Seth Stern stated that while a pardon wouldn't undo all harm to press freedom, it would "help reduce the damage"[1].

### Arguments Against Pardon:

- **National Security Concerns**: Some argue that Assange's actions compromised national security and that pardoning him would "invite more illegal disclosures that would further erode American security"[3].

- **Legal Accountability**: Critics maintain that Assange "deserves to face the full legal consequences of his actions"[3].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors create uncertainty in forecasting this outcome:

1. **Presidential Discretion**: The pardon power is entirely at the president's discretion and often unpredictable.

2. **Political Considerations**: Presidential pardons, especially controversial ones, are often influenced by political calculations that may change rapidly.

3. **Timing Constraints**: With the April 1, 2025 deadline specified in the resolution criteria, the window for action is limited.

4. **Public Information Gaps**: The available information doesn't indicate President Biden's current stance on the pardon requests submitted to him in January 2025.

## Conclusion

As of February 20, 2025, while there is significant advocacy for a presidential pardon for Julian Assange, there is no definitive indication of whether such a pardon will be granted before April 1, 2025. The resolution of this question will depend on presidential decision-making that remains unpredictable based on publicly available information.
