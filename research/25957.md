Based on information available as of July 10, 2024, there are several factors that help forecast whether Tadej Pogačar will win the 2024 Tour de France.

## Historical Context and Current Form

Tadej Pogačar entered the 2024 Tour de France as one of the top favorites to win the yellow jersey. The Slovenian rider had already won the Tour twice previously and was coming off an impressive victory at the 2024 Giro d'Italia[2][5]. Cycling experts widely considered Pogačar to be in exceptional form, with one analyst noting that he "finished the [Giro] race stronger than he was when he started it"[2].

His main rival, Jonas Vingegaard of Visma-Lease a Bike, won the previous two editions of the Tour de France (2022 and 2023) and had found ways to make Pogačar suffer in the high mountains during those victories[3]. However, Vingegaard's preparation for the 2024 Tour was compromised by a crash that kept him from competing since April 2024[4]. This raised questions about whether he would be at 100% for the race[2].

## The "Big Four" Contenders

The 2024 Tour de France was unique in featuring what experts called the "Big Four" general classification riders:

1. Tadej Pogačar (UAE Team Emirates)
2. Jonas Vingegaard (Visma-Lease a Bike)
3. Primož Roglič
4. Remco Evenepoel

These four riders had collectively won nine of the twelve Grand Tours preceding the 2024 Tour de France[3]. While all four had realistic aspirations of winning, many experts were tipping Pogačar as the favorite[1][2][5].

## Team Strength

A significant advantage for Pogačar in 2024 was the strength of his UAE Team Emirates squad. According to experts, he had "probably the strongest team the Tour has seen in decades"[2]. Three of his teammates—Adam Yates (Great Britain), João Almeida (Portugal), and Juan Ayuso (Spain)—were considered capable of achieving podium finishes themselves[2]. This level of team support provided Pogačar with a strategic advantage over his rivals.

In contrast, Vingegaard's Visma-Lease a Bike team was described as having been "in shambles this entire season"[2], potentially limiting the support available to the defending champion.

## Course Considerations

The 2024 Tour route presented several challenging features that could influence the outcome:

- The race began in Florence, Italy (the first time Italy hosted the start)
- Early Alpine challenges, including the Col du Galibier as early as stage four
- The queen stage featuring the Cime de la Bonette, the highest road in Europe
- A gravel stage
- Mountain stages in the Pyrenees
- A departure from tradition with a mountainous individual time trial from Monaco to Nice for the finish[3]

This demanding course with significant climbing suited Pogačar's strengths as a versatile rider who excels in the mountains.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Despite the strong indicators favoring Pogačar, the Tour de France is notoriously unpredictable. The three-week race presents numerous opportunities for unexpected events such as crashes, illness, or tactical miscalculations that could dramatically alter the outcome[4]. Additionally, the predictions available were made either before the race began or during its early stages, and the situation could evolve as the race progressed.

Based on the information available as of July 10, 2024, Tadej Pogačar appeared to be in an excellent position to win the 2024 Tour de France, but the final outcome would depend on how the race unfolded through to its conclusion in Nice on July 21.
