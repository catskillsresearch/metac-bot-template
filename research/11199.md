## Comparative Analysis: June 2022 vs. May 2025

**Historical Trends and Current Status**

- In June 2022, expert consensus and Metaculus forecasts were skeptical that more than two of Gary Marcus’ five AI milestones would be achieved before 2030, with Marcus himself betting on no more than two[1][2].
- As of May 2025, despite remarkable development in large language models and robotics, none of the five operationalized Metaculus questions has been resolved positively. Marcus maintains his skepticism, stating in early 2025 that "no single system will solve more than 4 of the AI 2027 Marcus-Brundage tasks by the end of 2025," and that he "wouldn't be shocked if none were reliably solved by the end of the year"[3].
- Metaculus community forecasts for each sub-question (e.g., reading a novel, programming, cooking) continue to indicate significant uncertainty and low confidence in near-term positive resolution[1][4].

**Key Differences Affecting the Forecast**

- While the pace of AI advancement has quickened, particularly in language and code generation, robust, generalizable solutions to the five tasks remain out of reach[3][5].
- Scaling of large language models appears to be reaching a plateau for some tasks, with diminishing returns and increased acknowledgment that further breakthroughs may require new approaches rather than simple scaling[3].
- No major policy changes or targeted research initiatives have emerged that would directly accelerate progress on these specific benchmarks as of 2025[3].

**Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment**

- Based on current trends, expert sentiment, and the operational status of each Metaculus question, the probability that more than two of Marcus’ proposed AI achievements will be realized before 2030 remains below 50%. Continued skepticism from experts, lack of positive resolution for any sub-question, and uncertainty about necessary breakthroughs support this assessment.
- However, the inherent unpredictability of AI research leaves open the possibility of sudden progress that could affect this assessment prior to 2030.

**Limitations and Uncertainties**

- The criteria for "reliably" achieving each task may evolve, affecting resolution.
- Unexpected technological or algorithmic breakthroughs could rapidly shift probabilities.
