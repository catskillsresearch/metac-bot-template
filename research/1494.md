# Global Catastrophic Risk Assessment: Nuclear War Forecast

As of October 13, 2018, this analysis examines the likelihood of nuclear war causing a global catastrophe (defined as â‰¥10% population decrease within 5 years) before 2100.

## Historical Context and Current Status

Nuclear weapons have given humanity unprecedented destructive capacity since 1945. As of 2018, there are approximately 14,185 nuclear weapons globally, with Russia and the United States possessing about 13,400 of these weapons. The remaining warheads are distributed among France, China, UK, Pakistan, India, Israel, and North Korea.

The world has experienced numerous nuclear close calls, with at least 20 documented "near-miss" incidents that could have resulted in unintended nuclear detonation. During the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, President Kennedy estimated the odds of nuclear war at "somewhere between one out of three and even." Despite these close calls, no nuclear weapons have been used in conflict since 1945.

## Key Risk Factors

### Geopolitical Tensions

Several geopolitical flashpoints present ongoing nuclear risks:

1. **US-Russia Relations**: While tensions have decreased since the Cold War, the relationship remains complex and potentially volatile.

2. **India-Pakistan Conflict**: These nuclear-armed neighbors have engaged in four wars since 1947 (in 1947, 1965, 1974, and 1999) and came close to war again in 2008. Pakistan has explicitly stated it would respond to any Indian attack with nuclear weapons.

3. **North Korea**: Recent brinkmanship between North Korea and the US has included explicit nuclear threats.

### Catastrophic Potential

The Global Catastrophic Risks 2018 report categorizes nuclear war under "current risks from human action," highlighting its potential to cause widespread destruction[1]. Beyond immediate casualties, a nuclear exchange could trigger:

- **Nuclear Winter**: Studies indicate that even a regional nuclear war using approximately 100 weapons could release enough black carbon into the atmosphere to block sunlight, lowering global temperatures for several years.
- **Agricultural Collapse**: The resulting climate disruption could reduce global precipitation by approximately 10%, triggering widespread crop failures and food shortages.
- **Ozone Depletion**: Nuclear detonations could create new holes in the ozone layer, increasing harmful radiation exposure.

Recent calculations suggest that even a regional nuclear war could have major impacts on the planet's atmosphere and climate, potentially meeting the threshold for a global catastrophe.

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on available information as of October 2018, several factors influence the probability assessment:

1. **Historical Evidence**: The absence of nuclear war since 1945 might suggest lower probability than historical estimates like Kennedy's "one in three" odds. However, this observation is subject to survivor bias - we only observe histories where nuclear war hasn't occurred.

2. **Risk Distribution**: The Global Catastrophic Risks 2018 report indicates that nuclear conflict is one of several potential global catastrophic risks, alongside other threats like climate change, ecological collapse, pandemics, and emerging technologies[1][3].

3. **Interconnectedness**: Many catastrophic risks are "closely interconnected, and their boundaries sometimes blur," which could amplify or trigger cascading failures[3].

While the exact probability cannot be precisely determined, the evidence suggests that nuclear war remains a significant contributor to global catastrophic risk. If a global catastrophe were to occur before 2100, nuclear war represents one of the most plausible mechanisms capable of causing population decline at the specified threshold (10% within 5 years).

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors limit this assessment:

1. **Classification**: Many nuclear near-misses likely remain classified, particularly from non-US nuclear powers.

2. **Observer Selection Effects**: As noted in the Oxford Future of Humanity Institute research, our observation of a world without nuclear catastrophe may lead to underestimation of the actual risk.

3. **Complex Interactions**: The Global Catastrophic Risks 2018 report emphasizes that many risks are interconnected, making isolated probability assessments challenging[3].

4. **Evolving Technology**: Changes in military technology, command systems, and geopolitics could significantly alter risk profiles before 2100.

Given these factors, nuclear war represents a significant but not exclusive pathway to global catastrophe, with substantial uncertainty remaining about its relative probability compared to other global catastrophic risks.
