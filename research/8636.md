## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Since 1991, no major direct war has occurred between Russia and NATO members; interactions have largely been limited to proxy conflicts or brinkmanship. The 2014 Crimea annexation and ongoing conflict in Eastern Ukraine have kept tensions high but below the direct large-scale war threshold.
- The security environment in Eastern Europe, especially for Poland and the Baltics, has grown increasingly precarious due to Russian military posturing and hybrid operations.

## 2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- As of early 2025, Ukrainian intelligence reports that Russia has formulated 15 potential military conflict scenarios through 2045, with four involving Poland[3]. Six scenarios pertain to Northern Europe, highlighting the acute threat perceived by NATO’s eastern members.
- Russian strategic documents reportedly prioritize resolving the "Ukrainian issue" by 2026, suggesting that failed resolution could lead to broader confrontational planning through 2035[3].
- Expert surveys conducted in 2025 indicate that 45% of respondents believe Russia will be involved in a full-scale shooting war with NATO by 2035. Among those expecting another world war within the next decade, 69% anticipate a direct clash between Russia and NATO[1][5].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Metaculus defines the resolution criteria and provides a structured basis for measuring battle-related deaths and US involvement[2].
- Uppsala University’s Department of Peace and Conflict Research defines "battle-related deaths," setting an empirical threshold for assessing future conflict scope.

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- The precise threshold for US involvement that triggers the "US-Russia war" definition remains context-dependent, complicating clear forecasting.
- Modern conflict may involve cyber, proxy, and hybrid components, making attribution and casualty counting challenging.
- Political changes—such as leadership transitions, domestic unrest, or shifts in alliance structures—could upend current risk assessments.

## Probabilistic Assessment (as of 2021-11-18)

Given:
- Russian military posturing and explicit conflict planning toward NATO’s eastern flank[3]
- Heightened expert concern about Russia-NATO conflict risk by 2035, though US involvement remains a significant deterrent[1][5]
- The historical pattern of avoiding direct large wars between nuclear powers, and the high threshold for escalation to 1,000+ battle deaths

**Estimated probability (2021-11-18):**  
- The chance of a Russia-NATO (excluding US as primary belligerent) war with ≥1,000 battle deaths in a single year by 2035 is *low but non-trivial*, likely in the range of 5–15%.  
- The probability rises if the US remains hesitant to commit ground forces, and if Russian leadership perceives a window of opportunity in Eastern Europe, especially regarding Poland or the Baltics.
- However, the deterrent effect of NATO and the risk of rapid escalation to US involvement act as strong constraints.

> In summary, while the risk of a significant Russia-NATO (non-US) war by 2035 is higher than in the post-Cold War period—due to explicit Russian planning and deteriorating regional security—the probability remains modest, as mutual deterrence and alliance structures still weigh heavily against such a scenario[1][3][5].
