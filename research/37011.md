# Analysis of US Steel/Nippon Steel Merger Prospects

As of May 16, 2025, the proposed acquisition of US Steel by Nippon Steel remains in a precarious state with multiple significant challenges threatening its completion before July 1, 2025.

## Current Status

The Nippon Steel-US Steel merger was initially announced in December 2023, with Nippon offering to purchase US Steel for $55 per share (a 40% premium)[3]. However, the deal has faced substantial obstacles:

- On January 3, 2025, then-President Biden blocked the acquisition citing national security concerns[3]
- The Biden administration directed the companies to permanently abandon the transaction by June 18, 2025[5]
- Both companies filed a lawsuit on January 6, 2025, challenging this executive order[3][4]
- The Biden administration subsequently delayed enforcement of the block until June 18, 2025, allowing time for court review[3]

Most recently (May 10, 2025), Nippon Steel has indicated it is "doubling down" on efforts to complete the acquisition by mid-June[1]. The company's president believes they are moving closer to finalizing a deal that would resemble the structure of their original bid[1].

## Key Factors Affecting Merger Prospects

### Political Opposition

Both the previous and current administrations have expressed opposition to the deal:

- The Biden administration formally blocked the merger on national security grounds[3]
- President Trump has "consistently voiced his objection" to the acquisition "for more than a year"[5]
- Trump reportedly indicated he would allow Nippon to invest in US Steel but wants the company to remain American-owned[1]

### Ongoing Negotiations

Despite these challenges, Nippon Steel appears committed to pursuing the acquisition:

- Nippon's vice chairman is scheduled to visit Washington D.C. to discuss the potential deal with the Trump Administration[1]
- Following the D.C. visit, he plans to meet with local union leaders in Pennsylvania[1]
- The company is exploring various proposals, with making US Steel a "wholly-owned subsidiary" as their starting negotiation point[1]

### Union Opposition

The United Steelworkers union strongly opposes the merger:

- As of March 21, 2025, the union characterized the deal as "unsalvageable"[5]
- The union has expressed concerns that Nippon would follow plans to move investment and production from existing mills to Big River 2 in Arkansas[5]

## Probability Assessment

Given the June 18, 2025 deadline for the executive order to take effect and the requirement for an SEC Form 8-K filing to terminate the merger agreement, several scenarios emerge:

1. **Court Intervention**: If the courts rule in favor of the companies before June 18, the merger could proceed. However, with only one month remaining for legal resolution, this appears unlikely.

2. **Negotiated Solution**: Nippon Steel appears to be pursuing a compromise with the Trump administration. Their active engagement suggests they believe some form of deal remains possible.

3. **Forced Termination**: If no legal remedy or political compromise is reached by June 18, the companies would be compelled to abandon the transaction, likely resulting in the required SEC filing before July 1.

4. **Voluntary Abandonment**: The companies could determine that continued pursuit is futile and voluntarily terminate before the June 18 deadline.

## Conclusion

The merger faces substantial obstacles with limited time for resolution. While Nippon Steel continues to pursue the acquisition aggressively, the combination of:
- A looming June 18 deadline from the executive order
- Consistent opposition from both the previous and current administrations
- Strong union resistance
- Limited time for legal remedies

Suggests a high probability that the merger will collapse before July 1, 2025, resulting in the filing of an SEC Form 8-K announcing termination.

The most critical period will be between now and mid-June 2025, as Nippon Steel makes its final push to salvage the deal through negotiations with the Trump administration.
