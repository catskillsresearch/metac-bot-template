# Forecast: Solar Geoengineering Diplomatic Agreements by 2026

As of May 13, 2025, I'll analyze the likelihood that at least ten countries will commit to a diplomatic agreement restricting solar geoengineering before 2026.

## Current Status and Recent Developments

The Solar Geoengineering Non-Use Agreement initiative has gained significant momentum since its inception around 2022[1]. This initiative proposes five core prohibitions:

1. Prohibiting national funding for solar geoengineering technology development
2. Banning outdoor experiments of solar geoengineering technologies
3. Not granting patent rights for solar geoengineering technologies
4. Not deploying solar geoengineering technologies developed by third parties
5. Objecting to future institutionalization of planetary solar geoengineering as a policy option[4]

As of September 2024, countries across Africa, Latin America, the Pacific, and Europe had signaled support for this initiative, which was already backed by over 500 multidisciplinary academics and almost 2000 civil society organizations[2]. By March 2025, the number of supporting civil society organizations had remained at nearly 2000[5].

### Specific Country Positions

Several significant developments indicate growing momentum toward formal agreements:

- **Mexico**: Announced a national ban on solar geoengineering in February 2023[2]
- **African Ministers Conference on the Environment**: Called for a Non-Use agreement in May 2023[2][5]
- **European Parliament**: Passed a resolution calling for a Non-Use agreement in November 2023[2][5]
- **Vanuatu**: Made a strong call for Non-Use as of September 2024[2][5]
- **Germany**: Offered dialogue on such an agreement as of September 2024[2][5]
- **Pacific Islands**: Support led by Vanuatu and Fiji[5]
- **Africa Group**: Showed leadership by strongly opposing efforts to undermine the de facto moratorium on geoengineering under the Convention on Biological Diversity[2]
- **Global South countries**: Including Fiji and Colombia, supported the Africa Group's position[2]
- **EU**: Backed the Africa Group's position during negotiations on solar radiation management resolution at the sixth session of the United Nations Environment Assembly earlier in 2025[5]

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on the available information, I estimate the probability of at least ten countries committing to a diplomatic agreement restricting solar geoengineering before 2026 as **70-80%**.

### Key factors supporting this assessment:

1. **Existing momentum**: The significant increase in support from late 2023 through early 2025 shows accelerating interest[2][5].

2. **Regional blocks**: The African Ministers Conference and European Parliament resolutions suggest potential for multiple countries to commit simultaneously[2][5].

3. **Time remaining**: With approximately 7.5 months until the end of 2025, there is sufficient time for ongoing diplomatic efforts to formalize into commitments.

4. **Growing scientific consensus**: Support from over 500 academics from 50+ countries provides scientific legitimacy to these efforts[5].

### Factors limiting probability:

1. **Formal commitment gap**: While many countries have expressed support or called for agreements, it's unclear how many have formally committed to treaty obligations.

2. **Implementation challenges**: The comprehensive nature of the proposed prohibitions may slow formal adoption[4].

3. **Lack of centralized international framework**: Although some international agreements include sections on geoengineering, there is no international agreement exclusively governing solar geoengineering research[3].

## Conclusion

The trajectory of diplomatic momentum strongly suggests that reaching ten country commitments by the end of 2025 is likely. The combination of regional bloc support (particularly from Africa and the EU), individual country leadership (Mexico, Vanuatu, Germany), and growing civil society pressure creates favorable conditions for formalizing commitments within the timeframe.

The most significant uncertainty is whether expressions of support and calls for action will translate into formal treaty obligations in time. However, given the accelerating pace of developments observed through early 2025, the balance of evidence suggests the threshold of ten countries will likely be reached before 2026.
