## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of late 2024, there is significant and growing political momentum for restricting solar geoengineering, especially in Africa, Latin America, the Pacific, and Europe[2].
- Mexico enacted a national ban in February 2023, and the African Ministers Conference on the Environment called for a global governance mechanism for non-use in May 2023[2][5].
- The European Parliament passed a resolution in November 2023 supporting a non-use approach[2].
- Several countries, including Fiji, Vanuatu, Colombia, and EU states, have voiced support for restrictions or moratoria in international forums[2][5].
- Despite these moves, as of May 2025, there is no binding international treaty specifically restricting solar geoengineering, only sections in broader climate or biodiversity agreements[3].

## 2. Recent Announcements and Policies

- The Solar Geoengineering Non-Use Agreement initiative has gained support from over 500 academics and nearly 2000 civil society organizations, and multiple countries have signaled support[2][4].
- At the 79th UN General Assembly (September 2024), Pacific nations and Germany showed visible leadership for a non-use approach[2].
- The African Group and several Global South countries have advocated for a moratorium at the UN Environment Assembly[2][5].
- However, negotiations for binding commitments have repeatedly stalled, with the US and Saudi Arabia opposing or blocking progress[5].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The Solar Geoengineering Non-Use Agreement initiative website[1].
- Reports from the Center for International Environmental Law on political momentum[2].
- US Congressional Research Service analysis of international agreements[3].
- Academic and civil society calls for non-use[4].
- Legal Planet and Columbia Climate School reporting on UN negotiations and national actions[5][4].

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- Many national and regional statements are non-binding or aspirational, not treaty obligations.
- The distinction between national bans, parliamentary resolutions, and formal treaty commitments is critical for question resolution.
- Powerful states (US, Saudi Arabia, China) have not committed, and their opposition may slow progress[5].
- The timeline to 2026 is short for negotiating, signing, and ratifying new multilateral treaties, especially on a novel issue with divided global opinion.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the strong recent momentum but lack of binding multilateral action, the probability that at least ten countries will have committed as a matter of treaty obligation to restrict solar geoengineering before 2026 is moderate but not high. The most likely scenario is continued non-binding resolutions and national bans, with formal treaty-based commitments by ten or more countries remaining uncertain and less probable before the deadline.
