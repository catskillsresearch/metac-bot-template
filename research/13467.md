## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of May 2025, there is no binding international agreement exclusively governing or restricting solar geoengineering. Existing international law, such as under the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), includes a *de facto* moratorium on geoengineering, but this is not a dedicated treaty and does not constitute formal treaty ratification by ten or more countries focused specifically on solar geoengineering[3][5].
- Political momentum for a Non-Use Agreement is increasing. Since 2023, several significant milestones have occurred:
  - Mexico announced a national ban on solar geoengineering in February 2023.
  - The African Ministerial Conference called for a Non-Use Agreement in May 2023.
  - The European Parliament adopted a resolution supporting restriction in November 2023.
  - Pacific Island nations, particularly Vanuatu and Fiji, have shown leadership and vocal support.
  - Germany has offered dialogue toward such an agreement, and the EU has backed the Africa Group’s anti-geoengineering position in international negotiations[2][5].
- These actions are joined by support from nearly 2,000 civil society organizations and over 500 academics worldwide, emphasizing a growing global push for restrictions[2][5].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- As of September 2024, political leaders from Africa, Latin America, the Pacific, and Europe have publicly endorsed the idea of restricting solar geoengineering. However, most commitments remain at the level of resolutions, declarations, or national policies rather than binding treaties[2][5].
- The only explicit national treaty-level ban is Mexico’s, with other countries expressing support or intent but not yet formalizing restrictions as treaty obligations.

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The Center for International Environmental Law (CIEL) provides ongoing tracking and analysis of policy and treaty developments related to geoengineering governance[5].
- The official Solar Geoengineering Non-Use Agreement initiative documents and lists supporting governments and organizations[1].
- The US Congressional Research Service (CRS) report details the current state of international law and governance of solar geoengineering[3].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- There is ambiguity between political support, parliamentary resolutions, and formal treaty commitments. For this question, only treaty obligations count toward the threshold.
- While momentum is visible and several countries are engaged in discussions, the timeline for negotiating, signing, and ratifying a formal multilateral treaty—especially on contentious issues like geoengineering—is typically slow.
- No historical precedent exists for a dedicated multilateral anti-geoengineering treaty with ten or more parties in a short time frame.
- Some countries may prefer national legislation or non-binding declarations over formal treaty commitments.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the current pace of diplomatic activity and the distinction between political support and formal treaty commitments, it is unlikely—but not impossible—that at least ten countries will have committed as a matter of treaty obligation to discourage, restrict, or bar solar geoengineering by the end of 2025. The most likely scenario is continued advocacy, more national bans, and perhaps the initiation of treaty negotiations, but not the ratification by ten or more countries within the specified timeframe.

**Probabilistic Estimate:** Less than 35% chance that ten or more countries will have committed to such a diplomatic agreement before 2026.
