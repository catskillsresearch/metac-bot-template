# Forecasting Anchorage vs. Chicago December 2024 Lowest Temperatures

To forecast whether Anchorage's lowest December 2024 temperature will be lower than Chicago's, I'll analyze historical patterns, climate factors, and recent trends for both locations.

## Historical Temperature Patterns in Anchorage

Anchorage has a subarctic climate with cold winters and mild summers. The city experiences average daytime winter temperatures ranging from approximately 5 to 30°F (-15 to -1°C)[5]. The average January low temperature at Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport (PANC) is around 11°F (-11.7°C)[5].

Looking at historical extreme temperatures, Anchorage has recorded some notably cold December temperatures:
- December 5, 1916: -36°F (-38°C)[3]
- December 24-25, 1917: -36°F (-38°C)[3]
- December 20, 1917: -34°F (-36.7°C)[3]
- December 21 and 23, 1917: -33°F (-36.1°C)[3]

The all-time record low temperature for Anchorage was -38°F (-38.9°C) on February 3, 1947[3].

## Recent Winter Temperature Trends

The question notes that in December 2017, Chicago's lowest temperature was -3°F while Anchorage's was 5°F, meaning Chicago was colder. However, in December 2022, Anchorage reached -12°F on December 20th while Chicago recorded -9°F on December 23rd, making Anchorage colder that year.

This variability demonstrates that either city can experience more extreme cold in any given December, depending on specific weather patterns that year.

## Factors Affecting Winter Temperatures

Several factors influence winter temperatures in both locations:

1. **Geographic Position**: Anchorage's high latitude results in very short winter daylight hours (as little as 5 hours and 28 minutes)[5], which can contribute to colder temperatures. However, its coastal location provides some moderating influence.

2. **Weather Patterns**: Anchorage's weather is described as "very unpredictable" with some winters featuring "several feet of snow and cold temperatures"[5]. This variability makes forecasting challenging.

3. **Cloud Cover**: Anchorage is "often cloudy during the winter, which decreases the amount of sunlight experienced by residents"[5]. Cloud cover can sometimes act as insulation, preventing temperatures from dropping to extreme lows.

## Measurement Considerations

The question specifically requires temperature data from:
- Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport weather station (PANC)
- Chicago Midway Airport weather station (MDW)

It's worth noting that microclimate effects can cause temperature variations even within the same city. For example, the search results mention that the Campbell Airstrip weather station in Anchorage typically records "colder night temperatures in both summer and winter" compared to the airport location[5].

## Limitations in Forecasting

Several limitations affect the accuracy of this forecast:

1. **Unpredictability**: As noted in the search results, Anchorage weather on any given day is "very unpredictable"[5].

2. **Limited Recent Data**: The search results don't provide comprehensive recent temperature data for either city, making it difficult to identify very recent trends.

3. **Climate Change Impacts**: Changing climate patterns may affect historical temperature relationships between these cities.

4. **Specific Weather Events**: Extreme weather events like polar vortex disruptions can cause unusual temperature patterns that deviate from historical norms.

Based on the historical data available, both cities are capable of experiencing extreme cold in December, with Anchorage having recorded much lower historical extremes overall (-36°F in December historically)[3]. However, in recent years as noted in the question description, the relationship has varied, with Chicago sometimes experiencing lower December minimums than Anchorage.

The resolution of this question will ultimately depend on the specific weather patterns that develop in December 2024, which cannot be precisely predicted this far in advance.
