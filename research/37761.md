To forecast the St. Louis Fed Financial Stress Index (STLFSI4) for June 20, 2025, I'll analyze the recent historical data and trends available as of June 9, 2025.

## Recent STLFSI4 Trends

The most recent available data shows the following STLFSI4 values:

- May 23, 2025: -0.5083[1]
- May 16, 2025: -0.9028[1]
- May 9, 2025: -0.4794[1]
- May 2, 2025: -0.3449[1]

These figures reveal significant week-to-week volatility in the index. The STLFSI4 experienced a substantial drop to -0.9028 on May 16, 2025, which was noted as its lowest level since January 2025[3]. This was followed by a sharp increase of 39 basis points to -0.51 for the week ending May 23, 2025[2].

## Recent Pattern Analysis

Looking at the data pattern from May 2025:

1. The index improved (became more negative) from -0.3449 to -0.4794 between May 2 and May 9
2. It then improved dramatically to -0.9028 by May 16, reaching its lowest stress level since January[3]
3. Most recently, it rose (less negative) to -0.5083 by May 23, indicating an increase in financial stress[2]

Despite the recent increase, financial stress remained relatively low as of the last available reading[2]. The volatility observed in May 2025 suggests that the index can move substantially (up to 42 basis points) within a single week.

## Contextual Factors

The St. Louis Fed Financial Stress Index is constructed from 18 weekly data series, including:
- Seven interest rate series
- Six yield spreads
- Five other financial indicators

Each of these variables captures different aspects of financial stress, and they tend to move together as financial stress levels change in the economy.

## Limitations for Forecasting

Several limitations affect our ability to precisely forecast the June 20, 2025 value:

1. The search results do not include any STLFSI4 data after May 23, 2025, creating a gap of nearly one month to our forecast target
2. The next scheduled release was on June 5, 2025[4], but those figures are not available in the provided information
3. The index has shown considerable volatility, moving by as much as 42 basis points in a single week
4. Without information about recent monetary policy decisions, market events, or economic indicators from late May and early June 2025, it's difficult to predict the direction of the index

## Historical Context

Looking at earlier data from 2025, we can observe that:
- The February 14, 2025 reading was -0.8378[5]
- The January 31, 2025 reading was -0.7640[5]
- The January 17, 2025 reading was -0.8225[5]

This suggests that the index has generally remained in negative territory throughout 2025, indicating relatively low financial stress, though with fluctuations.

Given the recent volatility and the limited data available for June 2025, forecasting the exact STLFSI4 value for June 20 remains challenging. However, based on the 2025 trend so far, the index appears likely to remain in negative territory, indicating continued relatively low financial stress, barring any significant economic shocks or policy changes in the interim period.
