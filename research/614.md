## Reference Cases and Historical Trends

- As of 2018, the global vegan population was estimated at about 3%—roughly 230 million people worldwide[5]. 
- The UK saw a notable increase in vegans between 2014 and 2019, with the number quadrupling in that period, but even in 2024, only about 4.7% of the adult UK population is vegan[5].
- In the United States, surveys from 2018 indicate that about 1-4% of the population identifies as vegan[2][3][4].
- Interest in reducing animal product consumption is growing, particularly among younger demographics; nearly half of Brits aged 16–75 in a 2024 survey said they were considering reducing animal product intake[5].
- Historical examples of major dietary bans (e.g., alcohol prohibition in the US) were enacted under very different social and political conditions, with far broader support and—importantly—much simpler enforcement.

## Key Differences Affecting the Forecast

- **Scale of Adoption**: Veganism, even at its most popular, remains a minority lifestyle choice. Most increases are in the range of 2–5% of the population in Western countries[2][3][5].
- **Motivations**: The vegan movement is primarily driven by animal welfare (70%), environmental (53%), and health (27%) concerns[5]. However, translating these personal motivations into national bans is a significant challenge.
- **Political Feasibility**: No country, as of 2018 or since, has proposed a legal ban on all animal products. Even the most progressive policies focus on animal welfare improvements or product labeling, not outright prohibition.
- **Enforcement and Compliance**: Banning all animal products would require massive shifts in agriculture, food production, trade, and culture, surpassing the logistical and political challenges faced by past prohibition efforts.

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- There have been no governmental announcements or proposed legislation anywhere in the world as of 2018 targeting a total ban on animal product consumption.
- Growth in vegan product availability and public interest is significant but remains far from the threshold needed for legislative action on this scale[5].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- Self-reported dietary surveys may overestimate vegan adherence due to social desirability bias.
- Trends toward plant-based diets could accelerate with technological breakthroughs (e.g., lab-grown meat), but these do not guarantee legal bans.
- Political, cultural, and economic barriers are substantial and may be underestimated by current trend-based extrapolation.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the low prevalence of veganism, the absence of political momentum towards prohibition, and the immense logistical and cultural barriers, the probability that a country of at least 5 million people will legally ban all animal product consumption by 2100 appears very low—likely less than 5%.
