# Forecasting Analysis: Single Global Government by 2100

To assess whether one government will govern 80% of Earth's population and economy by 2100, I'll analyze demographic projections, historical precedents, and structural factors affecting global governance.

## Current Population Distribution

As of 2025, no single government controls more than 20% of the global population. China currently represents the largest share, but even this is below 18% of global population[1]. The question asks whether by 2100, a single government could control 80% of both population and GDP - a dramatic increase from current levels.

## Demographic Projections to 2100

Population projections indicate significant changes in the distribution of global population by 2100:

- The global population is expected to reach approximately 10.4-10.9 billion by 2100, with growth nearly stopping (less than 0.1% annually)[1][3]
- India is projected to surpass China as the world's most populous country by 2027[1]
- Nigeria will surpass the U.S. as the third-largest country by 2047[1]
- By 2100, India, Nigeria, and China are expected to be the three largest countries by population[4]
- Six countries (five in Africa plus Pakistan) are projected to account for more than half of the world's population growth through 2100[1]

These projections suggest **increasing fragmentation** rather than concentration of population. The three most populous nations in 2100 (India, Nigeria, and China) will represent a smaller percentage of global population than they do today, making the 80% threshold more difficult to achieve.

## Regional Population Trends

The regional distribution of population is expected to shift significantly:

- Europe and Latin America are both expected to have declining populations by 2100[1]
- Asia's population will peak around 2055 at 5.3 billion before declining[1]
- Africa is projected to experience significant population growth through 2100[5]

This diversification of population centers makes a single government controlling 80% less likely, as power would need to span multiple continents with different economic and cultural systems.

## Historical Precedents

The question notes that historically, only various Chinese empires and the Mongol and Roman Empires have exceeded 30% of global population. Even at their peaks, none approached 80%. These empires existed in eras with:

1. Slower communication and transportation
2. Less developed national identities
3. Lower technological barriers to conquest
4. Less economic interdependence

Modern conditions present greater obstacles to large-scale political unification than existed historically, when even 30% was rarely achieved.

## Structural Factors

Several structural factors make the 80% threshold extremely challenging:

1. **Increasing multipolarity**: Population and economic power are becoming more distributed across regions
2. **Technological barriers**: Modern military technology makes conquest more difficult and costly
3. **Identity and nationalism**: Strong national identities resist political consolidation
4. **Economic complexity**: Modern economies require specialized governance appropriate to local conditions

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on demographic projections and structural factors, I assess:

- **Very low probability** (<1%) that a single government will control 80% of both global population and economy by 2100
- **Low probability** (~5%) that any government will control even 40% of global population by 2100
- **Moderate probability** (~30%) that regional governance bodies (like an enhanced EU) might govern larger portions of population, but still well below 80%

The most likely scenario is continued fragmentation of governance with increased coordination through international bodies that fall short of the resolution criteria's definition of a government.

## Key Uncertainties

Several wildcards could significantly alter this assessment:

1. Revolutionary technologies enabling unprecedented centralized control
2. Global catastrophes forcing unified governance for survival
3. Dramatic shifts in fertility rates significantly different from current projections
4. Emergence of novel governance structures not resembling current nation-states

However, even these scenarios would face substantial obstacles to reaching the 80% threshold for both population and GDP.
