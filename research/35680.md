### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The DesignSafe-CI portal regularly publishes datasets and research outputs from the natural hazards research community. As of early 2025, the portal continues to be active, with several publications listed for January and February 2025[1][2][3][4].
- Annual citation and publication counts show consistent activity: in 2024, there were 344 citations referencing DesignSafe data, similar to previous years (346 in 2023, 277 in 2022)[5]. While these are citation counts, not direct publication counts, they reflect ongoing engagement and data publication.

### Recent Announcements or Policies

- No recent announcements or policy changes affecting publication rates on the portal are evident in the available sources.

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The official DesignSafe-CI Data Depot publication browser is the authoritative source for publication counts by date[1][2][3][4].
- The "Impact of Data Reuse" page provides annual citation statistics, indirectly reflecting publication activity[5].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- No direct data is available for the number of publications in March 2025 as of the latest search results.
- The annual citation data does not provide monthly breakdowns, so monthly publication rates must be inferred.
- The most recent publications are from February 2025, confirming ongoing activity but not specifying March numbers.
- Actual March 2025 publication counts can only be verified by checking the portal after April 1, 2025, as specified in the resolution criteria.

### Summary Table of Relevant Data

| Year | Total Citations (all types) |
|------|-----------------------------|
| 2024 | 344                         |
| 2023 | 346                         |
| 2022 | 277                         |

Given the steady activity and lack of evidence for a surge or drop, the most likely scenario is that March 2025 will see a publication count similar to recent months, but the exact number remains unknown until verified post hoc.
