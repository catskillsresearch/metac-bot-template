# Forecast Analysis: Countries Blocking X (Formerly Twitter) as of June 2025

As of June 5, 2025, Wikipedia currently lists seven countries that block access to X (formerly Twitter): China, Iran, Myanmar, North Korea, Russia, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela[1]. To forecast whether this list will remain unchanged by the end of June 2025, I'll analyze the current situation, historical patterns, and recent developments.

## Current Status and Historical Context

X (rebranded from Twitter in July 2023) continues to face government censorship in multiple countries[1]. The current blocking appears to be long-standing in most cases, with no recent changes to this list evident in the available information. The platform has undergone significant changes since Elon Musk's acquisition in October 2022, with Linda Yaccarino taking over as CEO in June 2023[4].

## Factors Affecting Potential Changes

### Platform Policies and Content Moderation

X's content moderation approach has evolved significantly under Musk's ownership, potentially affecting government attitudes toward the platform:

- The platform has faced criticism for allowing certain types of content that some consider hate speech or misinformation[4]
- In November 2023, the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) reported that 98% of reported hate speech related to the Gaza war remained on X after 7 days[4]
- The European Union halted advertisements on X in November 2023 due to concerns about increased hate speech and misinformation[4]

### Government Relations and Compliance

X's relationship with governments has shown some shifts:

- Under Musk's leadership, X has reportedly been "more willing to hand over user data to governments upon request" compared to previous Twitter management[5]
- The platform has been involved in various controversies with governments, including the Irish government in November 2023[4]
- X has implemented censorship of certain content, such as blocking links to documents allegedly obtained through hacking[5]

## Probabilistic Assessment

Given the information available, I assess the probability that Wikipedia will continue to list all seven countries as blocking X at the end of June 2025 as approximately **85-90%**.

This assessment is based on:

1. **Short timeframe**: With only about 3-4 weeks until the resolution date, significant policy changes or diplomatic breakthroughs would be required for any country to lift its ban, which typically takes longer to implement.

2. **No signals of imminent change**: The available information does not indicate any ongoing negotiations or policy shifts that would suggest imminent changes to the blocking status in any of the seven countries.

3. **Historical persistence**: Countries that implement such blocks tend to maintain them for extended periods unless there are major political shifts or platform policy changes.

4. **Potential uncertainties**:
   - Wikipedia editing could potentially lag behind real-world changes
   - Rapid diplomatic developments are always possible but unlikely in this timeframe
   - X could potentially make significant policy concessions to specific governments

## Limitations of This Forecast

- The available information doesn't include very recent (May-June 2025) developments that might signal imminent changes
- Wikipedia's updating process may have delays or inconsistencies
- The forecast doesn't account for unexpected political developments or major platform policy shifts that could occur in the coming weeks

Based on the current evidence and historical patterns, it appears highly likely that the list of countries blocking X will remain unchanged through the end of June 2025.
