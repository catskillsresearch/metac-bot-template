# Analysis of Netanyahu's Prime Ministerial Tenure Forecast for 2025

Based on the available information as of May 12, 2025, I can provide a partial assessment of Benjamin Netanyahu's status as Prime Minister of Israel and the outlook for the remainder of 2025.

## Current Status

As of May 11, 2025 (yesterday), Benjamin Netanyahu was still serving as the Prime Minister of Israel. This is confirmed by his participation and remarks at the Government meeting held on Sunday, May 11, 2025[1]. This indicates that Netanyahu has maintained his position for approximately 4.5 months of the 2025 calendar year so far.

## Forecast Limitations

The available information only confirms Netanyahu's status through May 11, 2025, which represents less than half of the forecast period in question. To definitively resolve whether Netanyahu will remain Prime Minister throughout all of 2025, we would need information covering the period through December 31, 2025.

According to the resolution criteria, the question will resolve as "Yes" only if Netanyahu retains the official title of Prime Minister for the entire duration from January 1, 2025, to December 31, 2025, inclusive. The criteria also specify that if Netanyahu steps back from his duties for more than 30 days, even while retaining the official title, the question would resolve as "No."

## Assessment Based on Available Data

Given the limited temporal scope of the available information (through May 11, 2025 only), I cannot provide a complete probabilistic assessment of whether Netanyahu will remain Prime Minister for the entire year of 2025. The search results do not contain any information about:

- Planned elections or potential government changes for the remainder of 2025
- Current approval ratings or coalition stability
- Health concerns or other factors that might lead to Netanyahu stepping down
- Ongoing legal proceedings that might affect his ability to serve

What we can confirm is that Netanyahu has successfully maintained his position through the first 4+ months of 2025, which represents approximately 36% of the time period in question.

## Conclusion

Based solely on the available information as of May 12, 2025, Benjamin Netanyahu remains the Prime Minister of Israel, having served continuously in this role since the beginning of 2025 through at least May 11, 2025. Without additional information about the political landscape, scheduled elections, coalition stability, or other relevant factors for the remainder of 2025, a complete forecast for the entire year cannot be provided.
