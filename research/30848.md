## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Benjamin Netanyahu is the sitting Prime Minister of Israel as of late May 2025, actively issuing public statements and leading government policy[1][2].
- He has survived multiple political and legal crises, including ongoing corruption trials and an International Criminal Court (ICC) arrest warrant for alleged war crimes, neither of which have, so far, forced him from office[2].
- Israeli law permits a prime minister to remain in office unless convicted and after all appeals are exhausted, providing significant legal insulation for Netanyahu[2].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- Netanyahu continues to assert his leadership, as evidenced by official statements as recently as May 19, 2025[1].
- There have been no public announcements of resignation, coalition collapse, or pending elections that would directly threaten his tenure in the immediate future.

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Official Israeli government communications confirm Netanyahu’s ongoing role[1].
- Media coverage documents both the legal challenges he faces and the divided public opinion[2].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- Public opinion is strongly against Netanyahu, with 72% of Israelis in July 2024 believing he should resign following the October 2023 security failures[2]. However, this has not translated into immediate political consequences.
- The stability of Netanyahu’s coalition remains a critical variable. While no imminent collapse is reported, Israeli politics can shift rapidly.
- Legal proceedings could accelerate or new evidence could emerge, but as of now, no conviction has been reached that would mandate his removal under Israeli law.
- Unforeseen events—such as a health crisis, coalition defection, or intensified international pressure—could alter the outlook.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

- Given Netanyahu’s proven political resilience, the legal framework protecting his tenure, and the absence of immediate threats from within his coalition, the probability that he will remain Prime Minister throughout 2025 appears moderately high.
- However, the combination of ongoing legal jeopardy, intense public opposition, and the ever-present volatility of Israeli coalition politics introduces significant downside risk.
- An adjusted forecast, based on current facts and historical precedent, would place the likelihood of Netanyahu remaining Prime Minister for all of 2025 as **above 50% but with substantial uncertainty**, likely in the 60–75% range, barring major unforeseen developments.
