**Key Historical Trends and Current Status**
- In 2024, Madrid's housing prices rose by approximately 20%, an unusually high rate attributed to strong demand and tight supply.
- As of Q1 2025, the annualized growth rate has slowed to 12.6%, with the citywide average price at €4,290/m²[5].
- National forecasts for 2025 anticipate a 3%–7.3% increase in Spanish property prices, with Madrid expected to slightly outperform the national average but to remain well below 2024's exceptional pace[2][4].

**Recent Announcements and Policies**
- BBVA Research projects a 7.3% rise in Spanish property prices in 2025, and Madrid’s growth rate has been slightly higher than the national average[4].
- Housing starts are set to grow by over 14% in 2025, gradually increasing supply and easing some of the upward pressure on prices[4].
- No major regulatory shifts or economic shocks have been reported that would likely trigger a return to the 20%+ growth seen in 2024.

**Authoritative Sources for Verification**
- The Idealista portal is the resolution source for actual price data.
- BBVA Research, WTG Spain, and The Luxury Playbook provide leading forecasts and market analysis[2][4][5].

**Limitations and Uncertainties**
- Only Q1 2025 data is available; the rest of the year may bring unexpected developments.
- Forecasts are based on nominal figures and do not account for inflation.
- A significant unexpected shock (economic, policy, or supply-related) could alter the trajectory but is not anticipated as of May 2025.

**Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment**
Given current data and expert projections, the probability that Madrid’s housing prices will rise by more than 18% from December 2024 to December 2025 is low. The most likely outcome is a continued but moderating rise in the range of 7%–13%, well below the 18% threshold required for a 'Yes' resolution[4][5][2].
