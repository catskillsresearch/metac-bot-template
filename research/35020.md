**1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status**

- In 2024, housing prices in Madrid rose by approximately 20%, a notably high rate compared to historic averages.
- As of Q1 2025, Madrid continues to see strong growth, with a year-on-year price increase of 15.1%—the highest among Spanish provincial capitals[5].
- The broader Spanish market is also experiencing growth, with national averages up 7.5% year-on-year in early 2025, but Madrid is outperforming the average[5].

**2. Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting Prices**

- The European Central Bank cut interest rates several times in 2024 and is expected to continue in 2025, supporting mortgage demand[2].
- Despite this, experts forecast a moderation in price growth for 2025, mainly due to the high price base and an increase in new supply, especially in Madrid[2].
- Market analysts suggest price increases in Madrid in 2025 will likely be in the range of 5–12%, with some outlier forecasts up to 15%, but not above 18%[2][3][4][5].

**3. Authoritative Sources for Verification**

- Idealista is the specified source for price verification, with current December 2024 values at €4,952/m². Final assessment will rely on Idealista’s published December 2025 data.
- Additional sector reports (Tinsa, Caixabank Research, Urbanitae Blog) reinforce the expectation of continued but moderating price growth[2][5].

**4. Limitations or Uncertainties**

- The 15.1% annual growth reported in early 2025 may not persist or accelerate, especially given the high base effect and potential for increased supply.
- Economic shocks, unexpected policy interventions, or abrupt changes in demand could alter price trajectories.
- Quarterly volatility and local market variations in Madrid may lead to short-term fluctuations, but sustained >18% growth appears unlikely given prevailing forecasts.

**Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment**

- The probability that Madrid’s average housing price per square meter will rise by more than 18% from December 2024 to December 2025 is low.
- While ongoing demand and supportive financing conditions remain, the consensus among analysts is for a moderation to single-digit or low double-digit growth in 2025[2][3][4][5].
- Therefore, the most likely outcome is **No**: prices will rise, but not by more than 18%.
