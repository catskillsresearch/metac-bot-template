## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of November 22, 2024, the Freddie Mac 30-year fixed mortgage rate stands at 6.84%[4].
- In early November 2024, rates hovered around 6.90%, matching a four-month high, before dropping to 6.75% by mid-November[3][5].
- The rate had previously crossed above 7% earlier in the fall but has since retreated below that threshold[2][3].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- The Federal Reserve implemented a rate cut in early November 2024, which contributed to a modest decline in mortgage rates[4].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The official resolution source is the Freddie Mac Primary Mortgage Market Survey (PMMS), which publishes weekly averages for the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage[1].
- The rate to be used for resolution is the one displayed on the Freddie Mac PMMS page when accessed by Metaculus Admins on or after December 31, 2024.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- Mortgage rates are influenced by a range of factors, including Federal Reserve policy, inflation data, and broader economic conditions, which can change rapidly.
- The exact rate used for resolution will be the one displayed at the time Metaculus Admins access the Freddie Mac PMMS page, regardless of the period it covers.
- Short-term volatility remains possible, but there is no current evidence of a sharp upward movement above 7% in the immediate future.
