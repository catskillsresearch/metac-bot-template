## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The Kalenjin people of Kenya have dominated long-distance running for decades, particularly in events from 800 meters upwards, including the marathon. Approximately 70% of elite Kenyan runners are Kalenjin, despite the group comprising only about 11% of Kenya's population[5].
- Kalenjin men have a particularly strong record in Olympic and major marathon victories. For example, Eliud Kipchoge, a Kalenjin, won the men's marathon at both the 2016 and 2020 Olympics and set the world marathon record[2][4].
- Kalenjin women have increasingly achieved international success in distance running over the past decade, though their dominance is not as overwhelming as the men's[5].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- There is no evidence of major policy changes or eligibility shifts that would significantly alter the participation of Kalenjin athletes in the 2024 Olympic marathons as of July 2024.
- Some Kalenjin athletes have competed for countries other than Kenya, which is allowed under Olympic rules and would still count toward the resolution criteria if they win[5].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The ethnic backgrounds of Olympic marathon winners can be verified through athlete biographies, official Olympic records, and reputable athletics databases such as World Athletics[2][3][4].
- Historical analyses and academic studies confirm the Kalenjin's dominance in distance running and their representation among elite marathoners[1][5].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- While Kalenjin men are perennial favorites, the women's field is more competitive internationally, with strong contenders from Ethiopia, Japan, and other nations.
- The outcome depends on race-day conditions, athlete health, and unforeseen events, making any forecast probabilistic rather than certain.
- The final Olympic start lists and results were not available as of July 15, 2024, so it is impossible to guarantee both marathon winners will be of Kalenjin origin.

## Summary

The Kalenjin people have a well-documented history of dominance in Olympic and international marathon running, especially among men, and increasingly among women. However, while they are strong favorites, particularly in the men's race, the women's marathon is more open, and there is no certainty—based on information available as of July 15, 2024—that Kalenjin athletes will win both events at the 2024 Paris Olympics.
