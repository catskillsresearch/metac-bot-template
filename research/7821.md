## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Hungary’s total fertility rate (TFR) peaked at 2.35 in 1975.
- Since 1994, TFR has stayed below 1.60. 
- According to the latest World Bank data, Hungary’s TFR was 1.51 in 2023[1][5].
- The TFR has shown modest fluctuations over the past two decades, typically ranging between 1.2 and 1.5 children per woman.

## 2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- Hungary has implemented several pronatalist policies in the 2010s and early 2020s, including tax benefits, subsidized housing, and financial incentives for families with children.
- Despite these policies, the TFR has not risen above 1.6 and remains below the EU average and well below the replacement level of 2.1.
- There is no evidence as of 2021 or later that these policies have caused a structural break in the fertility trend[5].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- World Bank Data (annual reporting of fertility rates)[1][5].
- United Nations Population Division: World Population Prospects[1].
- Eurostat: Demographic Statistics[1].
- Metaculus forecast aggregation[3].

## 4. Limitations or Uncertainties in Measurement

- The TFR is a well-established demographic indicator and is measured annually by national statistical offices and international organizations.
- Data may be subject to minor revisions or lags, but major discrepancies are rare for a country like Hungary.
- Uncertainties include possible future policy changes, shifts in migration, economic shocks, or societal changes that could affect family formation.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the persistent sub-replacement fertility in Hungary since the 1990s, the lack of recent evidence for a structural upturn, and the regional context, it is most probable that Hungary’s TFR in 2031 will remain in the range of 1.4 to 1.6 children per woman. 

A reasonable median point estimate for 2031 is **1.50 children per woman**.

- There is a moderate probability (60–70%) that the TFR will be within 1.4–1.6.
- There is a low probability (<10%) that the TFR will reach or exceed 1.7.
- There is a very low probability that TFR will fall below 1.3, given recent stabilization and policy support.

### Summary Table

| Year | TFR (children per woman) |
|------|-------------------------|
| 1975 | 2.35                    |
| 1994 | <1.60 (began sub-1.6 era) |
| 2023 | 1.51                    |
| 2031 (forecast) | 1.50 (median estimate) |
