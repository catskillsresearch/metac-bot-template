# Montana CI-128: Right to Abortion Initiative (2024) Forecast Analysis

Constitutional Initiative 128 (CI-128) is a ballot measure that would amend the Montana Constitution to expressly provide a right to make and carry out decisions about one's own pregnancy, including the right to abortion. The initiative will appear on the November 2024 ballot in Montana. Below is an analysis of available information that could help forecast its approval chances.

## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

Montana currently protects abortion access through a 1999 Montana Supreme Court precedent that interpreted the state constitution's right to privacy as including abortion rights[2]. This existing legal framework has allowed abortion to remain largely accessible in Montana despite attempts to restrict it[2].

CI-128 would create a specific, explicit protection for abortion rights in the Montana Constitution rather than relying on the current privacy interpretation[5]. The initiative would:

- Expressly provide a right to make and carry out decisions about one's own pregnancy, including abortion
- Prohibit government from denying or burdening the right to abortion before fetal viability
- Prohibit government from denying access when a healthcare professional determines it's medically necessary to protect the patient's life or health
- Prevent government from penalizing patients, healthcare providers, or those assisting someone exercising these rights[1][3]

The initiative successfully gathered the required number of signatures and was certified for the November ballot by Montana Secretary of State Christi Jacobsen on August 20, 2024[5].

## Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Initiative

The sponsor group behind CI-128, "Montanans Securing Reproductive Rights," announced in June 2024 that they had collected more than the required number of signatures to qualify for the ballot[2]. This was later confirmed by the Secretary of State's certification in August 2024[5].

Martha Fuller, head of Planned Parenthood Advocates of Montana, stated they were building a "serious field and media campaign" to inform voters about the initiative[2]. Their strategy involves "talking to every single voter across Montana as many times as we possibly can" to explain the importance of the measure and motivate them to vote for it[2].

The certification announcement in August 2024 launched the multi-month campaign over whether to solidify abortion access in Montana's constitution[5]. This effort is occurring alongside similar ballot initiatives in other states including Arizona and Missouri, which have also received certification to appear on November 2024 ballots[5].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

The official ballot language for CI-128 is available on the Montana Secretary of State website and in official legislative documents[1][3]. The complete language of the constitutional amendment specifies that the government can regulate abortion after fetal viability unless a treating healthcare provider determines the procedure "is medically indicated to protect the life or health of the pregnant patient"[2].

The Montana Secretary of State's office is the authoritative source for ballot qualification and election results[3][5]. Their certification on August 20, 2024, confirmed that CI-128 received the required number of signatures to appear on the November ballot[5].

## Limitations and Uncertainties in Measurement

Based on the available information, there are several limitations in forecasting the outcome of this ballot initiative:

1. No polling data is available in the provided sources to indicate current voter sentiment toward CI-128.

2. While abortion is currently legal in Montana under the state constitution's right of privacy, the search results don't provide information about how Montanans generally feel about explicitly adding abortion rights to the constitution.

3. The effectiveness of the campaign efforts by both supporters and opponents will likely influence the outcome, but details about opposition campaigns are not provided in the search results.

4. The initiative's scope and application would likely be defined over years through new state laws and judicial interpretation if passed[2], creating uncertainty about its full implications.

5. The results of similar ballot initiatives in other states could influence Montana voters, but outcomes from those states are not yet available.

As the November 2024 election approaches, more polling data and campaign information may become available to better forecast the likelihood of CI-128's approval by Montana voters.
