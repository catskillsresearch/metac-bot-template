# US State Department Arms Sales Approvals: Forecasting February 2025

To forecast the number of arms sales the US State Department will approve in February 2025, we need to examine historical patterns, recent policy changes, and the current regulatory framework governing US arms exports.

## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

The United States maintains its position as the world's largest arms exporter, operating through multiple approval channels. The formal Foreign Military Sales (FMS) process begins when a foreign country submits a Letter of Request (LOR) specifying their desired military capability[1]. This initiates a review process that ultimately requires State Department approval.

For commercially licensed arms sales, the President must formally notify Congress 30 calendar days before the Department of State issues export licenses[4]. This notification requirement creates a predictable timeline between initial approval and final authorization.

Recent data from the Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) provides insight into approval volumes:

- Between March 2020 and June 2023, BIS processed 26,422 license applications
- Of these, 24,741 were approved (93.6% approval rate)
- The total approved value reached $34.7 billion[2]

This high approval rate suggests that most proposed arms sales that reach the formal review stage are ultimately authorized, though these figures include sales that fall below Congressional notification thresholds.

## Recent Policy Developments

On January 17, 2025, the Department of State published an interim final rule in the Federal Register with a 240-day delayed effective date[3]. While the specific content of this rule isn't detailed in the available information, regulatory changes of this nature could potentially impact the approval process or criteria for arms sales in the coming months.

## Approval Thresholds and Congressional Oversight

The Arms Export Control Act (AECA) establishes different notification thresholds based on recipient countries:

- For Israel and NATO allies, the notification threshold can be as high as $100 million
- These privileged partners also benefit from a shortened 15-day window for congressional action[5]

Under US law, Congress must be notified of potential arms exports when their value reaches minimum thresholds[2]. However, many sales fall below these thresholds and proceed without congressional notification. Between March 2020 and June 2021, nearly $15.7 billion in licenses were approved and $961.7 million in weapons were shipped in this "under threshold" category[2].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors create uncertainty in forecasting February 2025 approvals:

1. The recently published interim final rule (January 17, 2025) may introduce changes to the approval process, though its 240-day delayed implementation means direct effects in February 2025 are unlikely[3]

2. The resolution criteria specifically counts approvals listed on the DSCA Major Arms Sales notifications page, which only includes sales above certain thresholds requiring congressional notification

3. The available data doesn't provide monthly approval rates, making it difficult to identify seasonal patterns or short-term trends

4. Geopolitical developments and emerging conflicts can rapidly alter approval priorities and volumes

## Conclusion

Based on the available information, forecasting the exact number of State Department arms sales approvals for February 2025 requires considering:

1. The consistently high approval rate (93.6%) for applications that reach formal review[2]
2. The recent regulatory change published on January 17, 2025, though its delayed implementation suggests minimal immediate impact[3]
3. The distinction between total approvals and those large enough to appear on the DSCA Major Arms Sales notifications page

While precise monthly figures aren't available in the search results, the data suggests a robust and active approval process with thousands of approvals over multi-year periods, though many of these would not appear on the DSCA Major Arms Sales page due to falling below notification thresholds.
