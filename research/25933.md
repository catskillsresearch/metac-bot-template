# Forecasting the CBOE S&P 500 3-Month Volatility Index (VXVCLS)

To assess whether the CBOE S&P 500 3-Month Volatility Index (VXVCLS) will be higher year-over-year on July 20, 2024, compared to July 20, 2023, I'll analyze the available data and relevant factors that could influence this volatility measure.

## Understanding VXVCLS

The CBOE S&P 500 3-Month Volatility Index (VXVCLS) is part of a suite of volatility indices that measure market expectations of future volatility. While the standard VIX index (often called the "fear gauge") measures 30-day expected volatility, the VXVCLS specifically measures the market's expectation of 3-month volatility implied by S&P 500 index option prices[1][2].

This index is one of several gauges offered by the Cboe Options Exchange that track expectations of future volatility based on real-time trading of S&P 500 options[4]. The VXVCLS is part of the S&P 500 VIX Futures Series, which offers investors directional exposure to volatility through publicly traded futures markets[3].

## Available Historical Data

Based on the available information, the VXVCLS is tracked daily and reported by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis through their FRED database[1]. The data is presented as an index value that is not seasonally adjusted[1].

Recent data points from the FRED database show the following values:
- May 1, 2025: 25.49
- April 30, 2025: 25.54
- April 29, 2025: 25.22
- April 28, 2025: 25.73
- April 25, 2025: 25.37[1]

However, the specific historical data for July 20, 2023, is not provided in the search results, which would be necessary for a direct year-over-year comparison.

## Factors Influencing Volatility Forecasts

When forecasting volatility indices like VXVCLS, several factors should be considered:

1. **Macroeconomic conditions**: Economic uncertainty, inflation concerns, and monetary policy decisions can significantly impact market volatility expectations.

2. **Market sentiment**: Investor confidence and risk perception directly influence volatility indices.

3. **Geopolitical events**: International conflicts, trade tensions, and political instability can drive market volatility.

4. **Seasonal patterns**: Volatility can exhibit seasonal patterns, though these are not always consistent.

5. **Term structure of volatility**: The relationship between short-term and longer-term volatility expectations can provide insights into market expectations[4].

## Limitations in Forecasting

Forecasting volatility indices presents several challenges:

1. **Inherent unpredictability**: Market volatility is reactive to unforeseen events and news.

2. **Mean-reverting tendency**: Volatility indices tend to revert to their historical means over time, but the timing of such reversions is difficult to predict.

3. **Data limitations**: The available search results do not provide the historical comparison point (July 20, 2023) needed for this forecast.

## Conclusion

Based on the available information, it is not possible to make a definitive forecast about whether the VXVCLS will be higher year-over-year on July 20, 2024, compared to July 20, 2023. The search results do not provide the historical data point for July 20, 2023, which would be necessary for this comparison.

For the most accurate assessment, it would be advisable to:
1. Obtain the specific VXVCLS value from July 20, 2023
2. Monitor current market conditions and potential volatility drivers
3. Consult the FRED database maintained by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis for the most up-to-date information[1][5]
