## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The US manufacturing share of GDP has been steadily declining for decades. In 1997, it was 16.1%; by 2021, it had dropped to 10.5%[1].
- Globally, manufacturing's share of world GDP fell from 19.0% to 16.5% over a similar period, indicating that the decline is not unique to the US, but more pronounced domestically[1].
- As of 2024, US manufacturing output is projected to reach $5.03 trillion in 2025, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 1.12% expected from 2025 to 2029[3].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- The Trump administration has implemented tariffs and announced regulatory changes and new trade agreements intended to support domestic manufacturing[1].
- Analysts project the US manufacturing industry will grow by about 15% through 2028, though growth is expected to be modest compared to the post-pandemic rebound in 2021[4].
- Despite these initiatives, expert sentiment is cautious, with many predicting such policies may slow the decline in manufacturingâ€™s GDP share rather than reverse it[1][4].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The FRED series "Value Added by Industry: Manufacturing as a Percentage of GDP" (VAPGDPMA) is the official resolution source for this metric[1].
- Additional projections and historical data are provided by Statista, Interact Analysis, and the Congressional Budget Office[3][4][5].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- The manufacturing share of GDP is subject to definitional and methodological changes, as well as data revisions after initial publication.
- Policy impacts, such as tariffs and regulatory changes, may have delayed or muted effects on output and GDP share.
- Broader macroeconomic factors (e.g., global demand, automation, currency fluctuations) could alter trajectories in unforeseen ways.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given these trends and inputs:
- Most likely range for the US manufacturing share of GDP in the first half of 2028: **9.7% to 10.3%**.
- Central forecast: **10.0%**.
- Upside scenario (strong policy impact): up to **10.5%**.
- Downside scenario (continued secular decline, weak policy effect): as low as **9.5%**.

It is unlikely, given all current evidence, that the share will materially exceed 10.5% or fall below 9.5% barring a major economic shock or unprecedented policy success[1][3][4].
