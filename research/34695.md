### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The Warren Buffett Indicator (Wilshire 5000 to GDP Ratio) measures the total US stock market value relative to US GDP. It is considered a broad gauge of overall US equity market valuation[1][4].
- As of December 18, 2024, the indicator stood at 200.31 according to Longtermtrends (the reference source for this metric in your question). Other reputable sources report similar figures: 211% as of December 31, 2024[1], and 189.2% (date not specified)[3].
- The ratio has been at historically elevated levels throughout late 2024, with the Wilshire 5000 market cap near all-time highs and GDP growth steady but not explosive[5].

### Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Metric

- No major policy changes, economic shocks, or significant market corrections have been reported in the search results that would suggest a dramatic change in the indicator by late February 2025.
- The US market remains highly valued, with the Wilshire 5000 at a multiple of 1.89x GDP as of August 2024, ranking in the top percentiles of historical valuation[5].
- Interest rates and monetary policy can affect valuations, but no specific new policies are cited in the results that would impact the ratio in early 2025[4].

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The Longtermtrends website is the resolution source for this metric, and as of December 18, 2024, the Buffett Indicator was 200.31.
- Other sources for cross-verification include CurrentMarketValuation (211% as of December 31, 2024)[1], GuruFocus (154.6% as of May 2025, but this may use a different methodology)[2], and BuffettIndicator.net (189.2%)[3].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- The indicator can fluctuate with daily changes in stock prices, while GDP is updated quarterly, leading to short-term distortions[1][4].
- The Wilshire 5000 includes companies with significant international revenues, while GDP is a domestic measure, which can skew the ratio[4].
- The indicator does not account for changes in interest rates, global economic conditions, or structural shifts in the economy[4][5].

### Forecast for February 28, 2025

Based on the most recent data and the absence of major market-moving events, the Warren Buffett Indicator is likely to remain close to its late 2024 level. A reasonable forecast for February 28, 2025, is that the indicator will be in the range of 190% to 210%, with the most likely value near 200%, barring unforeseen market volatility or economic shocks.
