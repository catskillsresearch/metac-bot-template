# IBEX 35 Forecast for 2025

The IBEX 35, Spain's benchmark stock market index, has shown strong performance in recent years. To assess whether it will close 2025 higher than it started (above 11,595.00), we need to examine current data and forecasts.

## Current Status and Recent Performance

As of February 2025, the IBEX 35 stands at 13,347.3 points, showing a slight increase from the previous month[5]. This current level already exceeds the 11,595.00 threshold specified in the resolution criteria. The index has demonstrated impressive growth in recent years, with a 23% increase in 2023 and a 14.78% rise in 2024, making it the second-best performing stock market index among major European markets.

## Forecasts for 2025

Several analytical services have provided forecasts for the IBEX 35 through 2025:

- According to analytical forecasts, the IBEX price may reach €14,945.61 by the end of 2025[3].
- More optimistic predictions suggest the index could reach as high as 30,000 points by the end of 2025[2].
- Wallet Investor suggests a more conservative growth trajectory, with the index gradually moving up to 9,026 points by the end of 2025[2].
- IBEX 35 Futures price is expected to reach up to $10,391.40, with analysts anticipating a long-term increase[4].

## Analysis of Potential Outcomes

The majority of forecasts indicate that the IBEX 35 will maintain or increase its value throughout 2025. With the February 2025 value already at 13,347.3 points, the index would need to experience a significant decline of more than 13% to fall below the 11,595.00 threshold by year-end.

While monthly fluctuations are normal for stock indices, the overall trend and forecasts suggest continued growth rather than decline. The IBEX 35 has shown resilience and strong performance in recent years, outperforming many other European indices.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

It's important to note several limitations in these forecasts:

1. Stock market predictions are inherently uncertain and subject to various economic factors, geopolitical events, and market sentiment.
2. The forecasts from different sources vary significantly, from conservative estimates to highly optimistic projections.
3. None of the sources provided specific information about potential economic challenges that might affect the Spanish market in late 2025.

## Conclusion

Based on the current value of 13,347.3 points as of February 2025 and the majority of forecasts predicting continued growth, it appears likely that the IBEX 35 will close 2025 above the 11,595.00 threshold. However, as with all market predictions, this outlook is subject to change based on evolving economic conditions and unforeseen events.
