# Historical Trends and Current Status of Taiwan ADIZ Violations

Chinese military aircraft incursions into Taiwan's Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) have shown a clear upward trend in recent years, with significant escalations following specific political events. This analysis examines relevant data to help forecast whether more than 60 Chinese aircraft will violate Taiwan's ADIZ in a single day between August 15 and September 15, 2024.

## Historical Patterns of ADIZ Violations

The frequency and scale of ADIZ violations have increased substantially over time. Monthly averages rose from 81 intrusions in 2021 to approximately 178 in later periods[2]. The year 2022 marked a significant milestone with 1,737 PLA aircraft tracked, exceeding the combined total from 2019, 2020, and 2021[5].

The highest daily totals recorded as of July 2024 are:
- 56 violations on July 10, 2024[4]
- 56 violations on October 4, 2021[4]

The record for most violations in a single month was 446 in August 2022, occurring during China's response to then-US Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan[3][4].

## Recent Escalation (2024)

Following President Lai Ching-te's inauguration on May 20, 2024, there has been a marked increase in ADIZ violations:

- May 2024: 289 violations, with 82 (28%) occurring on May 23-24 during the PRC's "Joint Sword 2024A" exercise[3]
- June 2024: At least 325 violations, the second-highest monthly total on record and the highest for any month without a large-scale PLA exercise[3][4]
- Early July 2024: 232 violations in just the first ten days, including 56 on July 10 alone[4]

This represents a significant escalation compared to previous periods, reflecting what analysts describe as "an intensified PRC pressure campaign against Taiwan under the new administration of Lai Ching-te, whom the PRC considers a dangerous separatist"[3].

## Triggers for Large-Scale Violations

ADIZ violations can be categorized into three types:
1. **Routine violations**: Regular incursions to normalize PLA behavior
2. **Training violations**: Related to military exercises
3. **Reactionary violations**: Involving 10+ aircraft, intended to signal Beijing's displeasure with geopolitical developments[5]

The largest spikes in violations typically correspond to specific political events or perceived provocations:

- August 2022: Record violations following Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan[3][4]
- December 25, 2022: 47 aircraft entered the ADIZ in response to President Biden signing the 2023 National Defense Authorization Act, which allocated $10 billion to improve Taiwan's defensive capabilities[5]
- May 23-24, 2024: 82 violations during "punishment" military drills following Lai Ching-te's inauguration[3]

## Factors Relevant to the August-September 2024 Forecast

Several factors may influence the likelihood of seeing more than 60 aircraft violations in a single day during the August 15-September 15, 2024 period:

1. **Continued pressure on Lai administration**: The PRC has maintained "fierce rhetoric" and increased military pressure since Lai's inauguration, viewing his administration as "hostile separatists"[4]. This baseline pressure is likely to continue.

2. **Potential triggering events**: Any perceived provocations, high-level visits by U.S. officials, new defense agreements, or statements supporting Taiwan could trigger reactionary violations exceeding previous records.

3. **Evolving violation patterns**: Since August 2022, China's ADIZ violations have evolved to include more combat aircraft and median line crossings[5], suggesting a potential willingness to escalate further.

4. **Resource considerations**: While the high frequency of violations is designed to drain Taiwan's resources and exhaust military personnel[3], maintaining extremely large-scale operations also requires significant Chinese resources.

## Measurement Considerations

When analyzing ADIZ violation data, it's important to note:

1. Taiwan's Ministry of National Defense (MND) reports do not include PRC vessels and aircraft around Taiwan's outlying islands such as the Kinmen and Matsu archipelagos[3][4].

2. Most violations (94.5%) occur in Taiwan's southwest ADIZ, with only 5.5% entering the eastern parts[2].

3. Taiwan uses a de facto ADIZ that ends at the median line, meaning aircraft tracked on the Chinese side of the median line are not included in the official counts.

Based on historical patterns and recent escalations, the possibility of exceeding 60 aircraft in a single day between August 15 and September 15, 2024, would likely depend on whether a significant triggering event occurs during this period. While the current record stands at 56 aircraft in a single day, the trajectory of increasing violations and heightened tensions following President Lai's inauguration suggests that surpassing this record is within the realm of possibility, particularly if a major political event provokes a strong response from Beijing.
