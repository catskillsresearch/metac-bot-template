# US Per Capita Chicken Consumption Forecast for 2025

Based on the latest available data as of December 2024, I can provide the following analysis regarding US chicken consumption forecasts for 2025.

## Current Forecasts

The National Chicken Council (NCC) has projected total chicken consumption in the United States to reach 108 pounds per capita in 2025, with broiler consumption specifically forecast at 102.4 pounds per capita[3]. This represents a slight increase from previous years, continuing the long-term upward trend in chicken consumption.

Other sources project slightly different figures. The USDA's Livestock, Dairy, and Poultry Outlook indicates broiler meat consumption is projected to be 103.1 pounds per capita in 2025[5]. This is consistent with data reported by Supermarket Perimeter, which also cites a 103.1 pounds per capita forecast for broiler consumption in 2025[2].

## Market Factors Influencing 2025 Consumption

Several factors are contributing to the projected increase in chicken consumption:

1. **Production Increases**: Broiler meat production is forecast to increase by approximately 1 percent to 47.1 billion pounds in 2025, driven by lower feed costs and higher prices for competing proteins[1].

2. **Pricing Dynamics**: Chicken remains a more affordable protein option compared to beef, which has experienced price increases. This price differential is shifting consumer preference toward chicken[4].

3. **Consumption Patterns**: While total meat consumption is projected to slightly decrease (total red meat and poultry per capita consumption in 2025 is projected at 228.5 pounds, down 0.5 pounds from 2024), chicken's share within that total is increasing[2].

4. **Competitive Position**: Broiler meat continues to be the most consumed animal product in the United States, with consumption growth persisting for many years[5].

## Factors That May Impact the Forecast

Several uncertainties could affect the final 2025 consumption figures:

1. **Supply Chain Challenges**: The global poultry industry has reported concerns about production expansion due to shortages of genetic resources, such as fertile eggs and day-old chicks[4]. While this primarily affects global markets, it could influence US production and prices.

2. **Price Fluctuations**: Chicken prices are expected to increase by approximately 5% during the first half of 2025 due to seasonal trends and production challenges[4]. These price changes could impact consumption levels.

3. **Disease Pressure**: The poultry industry has faced challenges from Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI), which has affected egg production[5]. Similar disease pressures could potentially impact chicken production and consumption.

## Conclusion

Based on the most recent available data, US per capita chicken consumption in 2025 is most likely to fall between 103-108 pounds. The National Chicken Council's official forecast of 108 pounds per capita for total chicken consumption[3] represents the high end of this range and is the figure that will be used for resolution according to the specified criteria.

The consistent growth trend in chicken consumption over decades, combined with its price advantage over other proteins, supports the projection of continued growth in 2025. However, potential supply chain challenges, disease pressures, and price increases could moderate this growth.
