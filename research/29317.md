# Forecasting the 2024 US Elections: Democratic Control of White House and House

As of October 2024, polling and analysis provide insights into the potential outcomes of the 2024 US elections, though with significant uncertainties remaining. This analysis examines available data to assess whether Democrats will win both the White House and the House of Representatives.

## Presidential Race Outlook

The presidential contest between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump shows a competitive race with some momentum for the Democratic candidate. According to an August 2024 poll from Florida Atlantic University and Mainstreet Research USA, Harris had taken a lead over Trump nationally, with 47% of voters supporting her compared to Trump's 43%[5]. Among likely voters specifically, Harris led 49% to 45%[5].

This represents a significant shift from earlier in the election cycle. After President Biden withdrew from the race and Harris became the Democratic nominee, Democratic prospects improved considerably. A PBS News/NPR/Marist poll from August 2024 showed that while only 39% of Americans believed Biden could win before he left the race, 48% believed Harris could win, putting her in a statistical tie with Trump (also at 48%)[2].

## Key Voter Demographics and Issues

The polling data reveals important demographic patterns that could influence the election outcome:

- **Gender divide**: Harris held stronger support among women (53%), while Trump maintained an advantage with men (47%)[5]
- **Racial demographics**: Harris showed substantial advantages among Black voters (73%), Hispanic voters (51%), and white college-educated voters (57%)[5]
- **Education gap**: Trump maintained stronger support among white voters without college degrees[5]

According to Gallup polling from October 2024, the economy ranks as the most important issue for voters in the presidential election[1]. This could present a challenge for Democrats, as slim majorities of voters (54%) believed Trump would handle the economy better than Harris[1]. Similarly, Trump held advantages on immigration (54%) and foreign affairs (52%)[1].

However, Harris was favored on several other key issues, with majorities believing she would better handle climate change (61%), abortion (56%), and healthcare (54%)[1]. Voters were evenly divided on which candidate would better address gun policy[1].

## House of Representatives Outlook

The available polling data focuses primarily on the presidential race, with limited specific information about House of Representatives contests. This represents a significant gap in forecasting whether Democrats could win both chambers.

What we do know is that voter enthusiasm had increased following Harris's nomination. The PBS/NPR/Marist poll indicated that Harris's candidacy "unleashed a whole new wave of enthusiasm among Democrats"[2]. This enthusiasm could potentially benefit down-ballot Democrats in competitive House races.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several important limitations affect this forecast:

1. **Polling accuracy concerns**: Recent presidential elections have shown polling limitations. In both recent general elections, "many polls underestimated the strength of Republican candidates, including Donald Trump"[3].

2. **Lack of House-specific polling**: The available data focuses primarily on the presidential race, with minimal information about House contests specifically.

3. **Shifting voter priorities**: While the economy remains the top issue overall, there are significant partisan differences in issue priorities. Republicans and Democrats differ by 29-32 points on the importance of issues like the economy, climate change, and terrorism/national security[1].

4. **Time until election**: With the election scheduled for November 5, 2024, voter preferences could still shift significantly in response to events or campaign developments.

Based on the available data, while Harris showed improved standing in the presidential race compared to earlier in the cycle, there is insufficient information to make a confident prediction about Democrats winning both the White House and House of Representatives.
