To forecast the year-over-year increase in rent in Birmingham, AL for May 2025 according to Zillow's Observed Rent Index (ZORI), I'll analyze the available housing market data and identify relevant trends that could impact rental prices.

## Current Housing Market Conditions

The Birmingham, AL housing market shows varying trends across different areas as of March 31, 2025 (the latest data available):

- The average home value in Birmingham is $135,481, down 3.8% over the past year[1]
- Properties in Birmingham typically go to pending status in around 18 days[1]
- Specific zip codes show different patterns:

  - 35215: Average home value of $152,677, down 1.4% over the past year[5]

## Rental Market Indicators

While specific ZORI data for Birmingham is not provided in the available information, Zillow does track rental market engagement through the Zillow Observed Renter Demand Index (ZORDI)[3]. The search results mention that ZORI "measures changes in asking rents over time, controlling for changes in the quality of the available rental inventory"[1][2][4].

## Key Factors Affecting the Rental Forecast

Several elements from the current housing market could influence the May 2025 rental increases:

1. The overall declining home values in Birmingham (-3.8% year-over-year) may indicate softening demand in the housing market, which could potentially impact rental prices.

2. The varied performance across zip codes suggests neighborhood-specific factors are affecting housing demand, which would likely translate to rental markets as well.

3. The relatively quick pending time (18 days) indicates there's still reasonable demand for purchasing homes, which could either reduce rental demand (as people buy instead of rent) or maintain rental pressure (if buying remains unaffordable for many).

## Limitations in Current Data

To make a more accurate forecast for May 2025 rent increases, we would need:

1. Current ZORI data for Birmingham specifically, which is available through Zillow's Housing Data resource page but not provided in the search results.

2. Historical rental trends for Birmingham to establish patterns and seasonality effects.

3. Information about local economic conditions, job growth, and population changes in Birmingham that would affect housing demand.

4. Data about new rental construction and housing supply changes.

5. Information about short-term rental regulations mentioned in the WBRC News article referenced in the question description, as these could impact rental availability and pricing.

## Conclusion

Based on the limited information available, it's difficult to provide a specific forecast for Birmingham's year-over-year rent increase for May 2025. The overall housing market shows a cooling trend with values declining in most areas, which might suggest moderate rent growth rather than significant increases. However, without direct rental data and considering the varying performance across neighborhoods, additional information from Zillow's ZORI reports would be needed for a more accurate forecast.

To access the actual data when available, one would need to visit Zillow's Housing Data resource page, select the appropriate metrics under ZORI for Birmingham, and calculate the year-over-year percentage change as specified in the resolution criteria.
