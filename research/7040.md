## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- **Wheat allergenicity**, especially from gluten proteins (notably gliadins and glutenins), is a significant barrier for individuals with celiac disease and wheat allergy. As of 2021, efforts to reduce allergenicity in crops used both traditional breeding and genetic engineering (e.g., RNAi, CRISPR), with some success in other major allergens but limited progress for wheat[2].
- By 2025, **UC Davis researchers successfully deleted a cluster of genes encoding alpha-gliadins**—the gluten proteins most responsible for triggering celiac disease—using targeted genetic approaches. This reduced the immunogenicity of wheat but did not render it fully safe for celiac patients, as not all allergenic proteins were eliminated and breadmaking quality depends on these proteins[3].
- **Hybrid wheat technologies** have advanced rapidly, with companies like Corteva enabling faster genetic gains, but these efforts primarily target yield and resilience, not allergenicity[1][4][5].

## 2. Recent Announcements/Policies

- **Regulatory bodies** in the US and elsewhere are increasingly receptive to CRISPR-edited crops, particularly if they do not involve foreign DNA, which could accelerate product development timelines for de-allergenized wheat[2].
- **Breakthroughs in gene editing** (CRISPR/Cas9) have made more precise deletions of allergenic genes possible, and recent studies show the removal of the most immunogenic wheat proteins without sacrificing key agronomic traits[3].
- **Public interest and funding** in allergy-safe foods is rising, adding momentum to ongoing research[2].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Peer-reviewed publications (e.g., Theoretical and Applied Genetics, 2025) describe the partial success in reducing wheat allergenicity[3].
- Industry and academic news sources (Seed World, Corteva media releases) track progress in wheat breeding and gene-editing innovations[1][4][5].
- Metaculus forecasts synthesize expert and crowd predictions on the likelihood of full de-allergenization by 2030, noting optimism due to technological trends but caution due to scientific and regulatory barriers[2].

## 4. Limitations or Uncertainties

- **Technical complexity:** Wheat gluten is encoded by large, redundant gene families; deleting all immunogenic proteins without harming food quality is a major challenge[3].
- **Measurement criteria:** The resolution criteria require wheat to have <10% of normal allergen levels and statistically significant reduction in immune response in humans, verified by peer-reviewed publication or a consumer product—not yet achieved as of 2025[3].
- **Regulatory and consumer acceptance:** Even with technical success, regulatory approval and market adoption could delay or complicate deployment[2].
- **Ongoing research:** Significant progress has been made, but no public evidence indicates that fully de-allergenized, human-safe wheat is available or published in peer-reviewed literature as of May 2025[3].

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given sustained momentum in gene editing and recent successful gene deletions, but considering the scientific and regulatory complexities, there is a **moderate probability** that wheat will be successfully de-allergenized as defined by the resolution criteria by 2030. Progress is notable, but the final steps (full allergen removal, large-scale human trials, and peer-reviewed publication) have not yet been achieved.
