## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The global human population has grown continuously for centuries, with the annual growth rate peaking at 2.1% in 1968 and slowing to 1% by 2019[5].
- As of mid-2022, the world population was projected to reach 8 billion, up from 2.5 billion in 1950[5].
- Population growth has slowed substantially, with longer doubling times and declining fertility rates in many regions[4][5].

## 2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- The United Nations’ 2022 World Population Prospects projected a medium-scenario global population peak of 10.4 billion in 2086[4]. This was the first major UN projection to forecast a 21st-century peak.
- The 2024 revision brought the projected peak forward: global population is now expected to peak at just under 10.3 billion in 2084, with new data showing lower-than-expected fertility rates in several large countries, especially China (now at 1.01 births per woman)[3][4].
- UN projections note that more than half the projected increase between 2022 and 2050 will be concentrated in just eight countries, most in Africa and South Asia[5].
- Policy changes, such as China’s shift away from the one-child policy, have not yet reversed its rapid fertility decline. Globally, there is a trend toward aging populations and shrinking birth rates in many countries[3][5].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The United Nations Population Division and its “World Population Prospects” are the standard reference for global population forecasts[2][4][5].
- Their projections are updated every two to three years, using census and survey data from nearly every country[2][3].

## 4. Limitations or Uncertainties in Measurement

- Projections depend on assumptions about future fertility, mortality, and migration, all of which can change due to economic, technological, epidemiological, or policy factors[4].
- UN projections offer a range of scenarios: the medium scenario is most cited, but low and high fertility variants range from under 9 billion to over 15 billion by 2100[4].
- Measurement of “human” is by contemporary biological standards and does not include populations living primarily off-Earth, which is not expected to be a significant demographic factor before 2100 under current models.

### Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

- The most authoritative and up-to-date (as of 2024) reference case projects the global human population will peak at just under 10.3 billion in 2084, then decline slightly by 2100[3][4].
- The range of credible scenarios places the likely peak between 9 and 11 billion, with the median outcome now below 10.3 billion and the timing in the early-to-mid 2080s[3][4].
- Recent data on sharply declining fertility in populous countries (notably China) have pulled the peak earlier and lower than previous UN forecasts[3][4].
- Major uncertainties include the possibility of unanticipated changes to fertility or mortality due to global crises or breakthroughs, which could shift the peak by hundreds of millions either way, but the central estimate remains robust given current trends.
