# HIV/AIDS Global Population Forecast Analysis (2017-2037)

As of April 13, 2019, analyzing whether there will be more people living with HIV/AIDS in 2037 than the 36.9 million reported in 2017 requires examining several key trends and factors that influence both infection rates and survival.

## Current Situation and Historical Trends

As of 2017, 36.9 million people globally were living with HIV, with 1.8 million new infections and 940,000 AIDS-related deaths that year. The global HIV population represents a dynamic balance between new infections, deaths, and improved survival rates due to treatment advances.

Several important trends can be observed:

1. **Declining mortality**: AIDS-related deaths decreased by 51% from the 2004 peak (1.9 million) to 940,000 in 2017. This significant reduction in mortality is a key driver of the increasing total HIV-positive population.

2. **Treatment expansion**: Access to antiretroviral therapy (ART) has dramatically increased from 8 million people in 2010 to 21.7 million in 2017, representing a 171% increase in just seven years.

3. **Geographic concentration**: 66% of HIV-positive individuals live in sub-Saharan Africa, with 19.6 million in East and Southern Africa alone, making regional trends in these areas particularly important to the global forecast.

## Factors Affecting Future Population Trends

Several key factors will influence whether the global HIV-positive population exceeds 36.9 million by 2037:

### Factors Likely to Increase HIV-Positive Population

1. **Improved survival rates**: Continued expansion of ART access is extending lifespans of HIV-positive individuals, contributing to a larger living population with HIV.

2. **Population growth**: General population growth in high-prevalence regions may contribute to absolute increases in HIV cases even if prevalence rates decline.

3. **Treatment as prevention**: People on effective ART with undetectable viral loads cannot transmit HIV sexually, potentially reducing new infections over time.

### Factors Likely to Decrease HIV-Positive Population

1. **Prevention advances**: Biomedical prevention tools like PrEP (pre-exposure prophylaxis) were becoming increasingly available as of 2019.

2. **Declining new infection rates**: New infections had already decreased significantly from peak levels, with continued prevention efforts likely to further this trend.

3. **Potential cure research**: Promising research toward functional cures, with reports of patients potentially cured of HIV, though still experimental as of 2019.

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on data available as of April 2019, there is a higher probability (approximately 60-70%) that the global HIV-positive population will exceed 36.9 million by 2037. This assessment is based on several key considerations:

1. The mortality rate decline (51% from 2004 to 2017) significantly outpaces the decline in new infections, creating net population growth.

2. ART coverage increased by 171% from 2010 to 2017, dramatically extending life expectancy for those with access.

3. Even with continued prevention success, the mathematical balance of longer lifespans and continued (though reduced) new infections suggests continued growth in the total HIV-positive population.

4. The potential impact of cure research remains speculative and unlikely to affect population-level numbers by 2037 given the early stage of this research as of 2019.

The key uncertainty in this forecast is the pace of prevention advances versus treatment expansion. If prevention technologies like PrEP achieve widespread adoption faster than anticipated, new infections could potentially decline rapidly enough to offset the population increase from improved survival.
