## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Exoplanet atmosphere detection has advanced rapidly, primarily using transit spectroscopy, where starlight passing through a planet's atmosphere reveals the presence of certain molecules[1][4].
- To date, the main atmospheric constituents detected in exoplanets are hydrogen, sodium, water vapor, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and methane. Oxygen has been a target, but its detection remains extremely challenging due to weak spectral features and the need for high-precision instruments[1][4].
- Most atmospheric detections have been made for large, hot exoplanets (hot Jupiters and Neptunes), where thick atmospheres and favorable conditions make detection easier. For smaller, rocky planets—where oxygen-rich atmospheres would be most interesting—current technology struggles to provide detailed compositional analysis[4].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and other observatories have begun to provide more sensitive data, but as of November 2024, no exoplanet atmosphere has been confirmed to contain more than 5% oxygen[5].
- New methods, such as those developed by University of Chicago researchers, can more reliably confirm the presence of an atmosphere, but do not yet provide detailed abundance measurements for specific gases like O2[5].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- NASA, the European Southern Observatory, and leading academic groups continue to monitor and report on exoplanet atmospheric discoveries. Their databases and press releases as of November 2024 do not report any exoplanet with a measured oxygen fraction above 5%[1][4][5].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- Current methods can detect the presence of certain molecules but struggle to quantify their abundance, especially for oxygen, due to weak spectral lines and interference from stellar activity and clouds[4][5].
- Abiotic processes can produce significant oxygen, complicating the interpretation of any potential detection[4].
- There is no published, peer-reviewed evidence of an exoplanet with a >5% oxygen atmosphere as of November 2024.

## Conclusion

Based on all available evidence and technical limitations, it is extremely unlikely that an exoplanet with an atmosphere containing more than 5% oxygen will be detected before 2025.
