# Nuclear Disarmament Forecast Analysis: 2017-2035

As of July 19, 2017, the following analysis presents relevant information to help forecast whether any current nuclear power will disarm by 2035.

## Current Nuclear Weapon States (as of July 2017)

As of mid-2017, nine countries possess nuclear weapons[2][3]:

1. United States (first test: 1945)
2. Russia (successor to Soviet Union, first test: 1949)
3. United Kingdom (first test: 1952)
4. France (first test: 1960)
5. China (first test: 1964)
6. India (first test: 1974)
7. Pakistan (first test: 1998)
8. North Korea (first test: 2006)
9. Israel (undeclared program, date uncertain)

Together, these states possessed approximately 14,935 nuclear weapons in total as of early 2017, with around 4,150 operationally deployed[3].

## Historical Precedents for Nuclear Disarmament

Several historical cases provide context for potential future disarmament:

1. **South Africa**: The only country to have independently developed nuclear weapons and then voluntarily dismantled them. South Africa began dismantling its arsenal in 1989 and joined the NPT as a non-nuclear state.

2. **Former Soviet Republics**: Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine inherited nuclear weapons after the Soviet Union's collapse but agreed in 1992 to either destroy them or transfer them to Russia[5]. This represents the most recent case of countries giving up nuclear weapons.

## Current Positions of Nuclear Powers

A critical factor in this forecast is the stated positions of the nine nuclear powers:

1. **Non-participation in ban treaty**: None of the nine nuclear-armed states participated in the negotiations for the 2017 UN nuclear weapons ban treaty or adopted the document. This signals a clear unwillingness to consider disarmament in the near term.

2. **Long-term intentions**: According to SIPRI's 2017 assessment, "none of the nuclear weapon-possessing states are prepared to give up their nuclear arsenals for the foreseeable future"[3]. This expert assessment directly addresses the forecast question.

3. **Ongoing modernization**: Despite overall reductions in global nuclear stockpiles since the Cold War peak, all nine nuclear states are engaged in modernizing and maintaining their nuclear forces[3].

## Factors That Could Influence Disarmament

Several factors might affect the likelihood of disarmament by 2035:

1. **Security considerations**: Nuclear deterrence remains a core security doctrine for nuclear powers. Major shifts in security environments would likely be necessary for voluntary disarmament.

2. **International pressure**: The 2017 UN ban treaty represents growing international pressure, though its immediate impact on nuclear states appears minimal.

3. **Regional tensions**: Several nuclear powers (India-Pakistan, North Korea) exist in regions with significant security tensions, making unilateral disarmament unlikely without major geopolitical changes.

4. **Technical verification challenges**: The resolution criteria require IAEA certification of complete disarmament, which presents significant verification challenges, especially for countries like North Korea and Israel.

## Assessment Limitations

Important limitations to this forecast include:

1. **Information asymmetry**: Limited public information exists about some nuclear programs, particularly Israel's undeclared arsenal.

2. **Unforeseen geopolitical changes**: Major geopolitical shifts can occur within the 18-year forecast window that could dramatically change security calculations.

3. **Verification challenges**: The technical ability to verify complete disarmament, especially of covert programs, presents challenges for resolution.
