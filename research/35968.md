### Key Factual Information Relevant to Forecasting

**1. Historical Trends and Current Status**
- Israel has maintained a blockade on Gaza since 2007, intensifying it after the October 2023 conflict. While the January 2025 ceasefire deal temporarily increased aid, Israel halted all humanitarian aid on March 2, 2025, to pressure Hamas into a new agreement[1][2][4].
- As of March 13, 2025, the blockade is total, with no humanitarian aid, including food or fuel, allowed into Gaza. This is the longest complete closure in the history of the blockade[4].

**2. Recent Announcements and Policies**
- Israel’s current policy is to maintain the blockade until Hamas agrees to further hostage releases and a new deal, rather than advancing to the next phase of the ceasefire[1][2].
- International actors, including the UN, UK, France, and Germany, have condemned the blockade as a violation of international law and warned of catastrophic humanitarian consequences[3][5].
- Humanitarian organizations report that Gaza’s population is at risk of imminent famine, with essential services like water and food distribution on the verge of collapse if the blockade continues[2][5].

**3. Authoritative Sources for Verification**
- The United Nations, Human Rights Watch, and major humanitarian NGOs are monitoring and reporting on the status of aid entry into Gaza[2][3][5].

**4. Limitations and Uncertainties**
- The blockade’s status is subject to rapid change due to ongoing negotiations, international diplomatic pressure, or shifts in Israeli or Hamas policy.
- While Israel has previously altered its blockade policy under pressure, as of March 13, 2025, there is no indication of an imminent resumption of aid before April 7, 2025[1][2][3][5].

### Summary Table: Status of Humanitarian Aid Blockade (as of March 13, 2025)

| Date           | Status of Aid Entry | Policy/Trigger                  | International Response         |
|----------------|--------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Jan 17, 2025   | Aid allowed        | Ceasefire phase 1               | Monitored, cautious optimism  |
| Mar 2, 2025    | Aid halted         | Pressure for new agreement      | Strong condemnation           |
| Mar 13, 2025   | Blockade ongoing   | No policy change announced      | Warnings of famine, violations|

### Conclusion

As of March 13, 2025, all available factual information indicates that Israel has not lifted the blockade on humanitarian aid into Gaza and is unlikely to do so before April 7, 2025, unless there is a major breakthrough in negotiations or a sudden policy shift. The blockade is being used as leverage in ongoing talks, and international condemnation has not yet resulted in a change of policy.
