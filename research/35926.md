### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of late February and early March 2025, the Department of Education (ED) is ranked #1 in total savings on the Department of Government Efficiency's (DOGE) Agency Efficiency Leaderboard[1][3][5].
- The leaderboard tracks savings from contract terminations, fraud detection, renegotiations, asset sales, grant cancellations, workforce reductions, and regulatory changes, with DOGE reporting $65 billion in total government-wide savings[1][3].
- The next highest agencies in savings are the General Services Administration (GSA) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)[1][3][5].

### Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Metric

- DOGE launched the Agency Efficiency Leaderboard in February 2025, making agency savings data publicly available and competitive[1][3][5].
- Over 2,200 contract terminations have been listed, and DOGE is working to provide more transparent grant termination receipts[1].
- A legal ruling temporarily blocked DOGE from accessing some Education Department data until March 10, 2025, but there is no evidence this affected the leaderboard's published rankings as of early March[1].

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The official DOGE Agency Efficiency Leaderboard is available at doge.gov/savings[2].
- News outlets and DOGE's own communications confirm the Department of Education's leading position as of late February and early March 2025[1][3][5].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- There may be discrepancies between FPDS data and DOGE's posted numbers due to reporting lags and ongoing updates[3].
- The leaderboard is dynamic and subject to change as new savings are recorded or corrections are made[1][4].
- It is possible, though not indicated in current sources, that another agency could surpass the Department of Education in total savings before April 1, 2025.

### Conclusion

Based on all available information as of March 13, 2025, the Department of Education is ranked #1 in Most Total Savings on DOGE's Agency Efficiency Leaderboard, and there are no reported developments likely to change this before April 1, 2025. However, the leaderboard is subject to ongoing updates, and this forecast carries some uncertainty due to the dynamic nature of the data.
