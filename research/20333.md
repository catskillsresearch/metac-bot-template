## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The last time the US experienced daily COVID-19 hospitalizations above 20,000 was during the Omicron wave in late 2021 to early 2022, coinciding with Omicron's designation as a Variant of Concern (VOC)[5].
- Since that period, no SARS-CoV-2 variants have been classified as VOC or Variant of High Consequence (VOHC) by the CDC or other major health authorities. The CDC’s COVID Data Tracker and the WHO’s hospitalizations dashboard show that as of early 2025, national COVID-19 hospitalizations remain far below the 20,000 daily threshold[1][2][3].
- As of January 29, 2025, the overall COVID-19 hospitalization rate in the US was 38.0 per 100,000 people for the 2024–2025 season—a figure that does not approach the reference wave seen with Omicron[5].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- There have been no CDC or Interagency Group announcements of a new VOC or VOHC between December 1, 2023, and May 2025[1][2].
- Ongoing monitoring continues, but no variant has been elevated beyond “Variants Being Monitored” in this interval[1].
- No public health emergency or urgent policy response has been triggered by a new variant during this period.

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- CDC COVID Data Tracker provides real-time hospitalization and variant data[1][2].
- The COVID-19 Forecast Hub and WHO COVID-19 Hospitalizations dashboard confirm hospitalization trends and variant status[3][5].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- Variant classification can lag behind detection, and underreporting of hospitalizations is possible, but both CDC and WHO data are considered authoritative for US trends.
- Changes in testing, reporting, or health-seeking behavior may affect data completeness; however, any surge sufficient to trigger 20,000+ daily hospitalizations would almost certainly be detected and publicly reported.
- The possibility of a sudden, highly transmissible, and immune-evading variant cannot be ruled out, but as of May 2025, no such evidence exists.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the absence of any new VOC or VOHC designation, the much lower current hospitalization rates, and the lack of any unusual variant activity or surge through nearly mid-2025, the probability of a new VOC or worse resulting in at least 20,000 daily COVID-19 hospitalizations in the US before July 1, 2025, is exceedingly low—likely less than 1% barring an unforeseen and unprecedented viral event.
