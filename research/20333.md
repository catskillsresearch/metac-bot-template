# Forecasting Analysis: New COVID-19 Variant Impact on US Hospitalizations

As of May 12, 2025, I'll analyze the likelihood of a new SARS-CoV-2 variant classified as a VOC or worse resulting in at least 20,000 daily incident COVID hospitalizations in the US before July 1, 2025 (approximately 7 weeks from now).

## Current Situation Assessment

The current COVID-19 landscape shows relatively modest levels of transmission and severity:

- The national test positivity rate stands at 3.2% for the week ending May 3, 2025, showing a slight decrease from 3.4% in the previous week[1]
- The current hospitalization rate is 1.4 per 100,000 population[2]
- COVID-19 accounts for only 0.6% of all deaths in the United States[2]

These metrics suggest that as of mid-May 2025, the US is not experiencing a significant COVID-19 surge. However, earlier in the 2024-2025 season (as of January 29, 2025), the hospitalization rate was notably higher at 38.0 per 100,000 people[5].

## Variant Evolution and Impact

The available data references several variant eras (XBB, JN.1, and KP)[4], indicating the continued evolution of SARS-CoV-2. Current variants demonstrate "higher infectivity" which is particularly relevant for:

1. Patients at elevated risk of severe COVID-19 (defined as disease resulting in hospitalization, ICU admission, intubation, mechanical ventilation, or death)[5]
2. Individuals who may develop long COVID, which as of September 2024 had affected approximately 17.9% of all US adults[5]

## Hospitalization Trends and Severity

Among hospitalized COVID-19 patients between October 2023 and April 2024:
- 18.4% required ICU admission
- 8.4% needed mechanical ventilation
- 6.9% died while hospitalized[5]

These figures indicate that while the overall prevalence of severe disease may be lower than in earlier phases of the pandemic, COVID-19 continues to cause significant morbidity and mortality among those who require hospitalization.

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on the available data, I assess the likelihood of a new VOC causing 20,000+ daily hospitalizations before July 1, 2025 as **low to moderate** for the following reasons:

1. **Current trajectory**: The declining test positivity rate (from 3.4% to 3.2%) and relatively low hospitalization rate (1.4 per 100,000) suggest we are not currently on a path toward a major surge[1][2]

2. **Timeframe constraint**: With only about 7 weeks remaining until July 1, 2025, there is limited time for:
   - A new variant to emerge and be classified as a VOC
   - This variant to spread widely enough across the US
   - Hospitalizations to reach the 20,000 daily threshold

3. **Seasonal factors**: Late spring/early summer has typically seen lower COVID-19 transmission in previous years, though this pattern is not guaranteed

4. **Uncertainty factors** that could increase probability:
   - The search results mention "higher infectivity" of current variants[5]
   - The hospitalization rate was significantly higher earlier in the 2024-2025 season (38.0 per 100,000)[5]
   - Variant evolution is unpredictable and a highly transmissible and immune-evasive variant could emerge quickly

## Key Limitations in Assessment

Several important limitations affect this forecast:

1. The search results do not provide absolute numbers of current daily hospitalizations, only rates per 100,000

2. No information is available about any emerging variants currently under monitoring that might soon be classified as VOCs

3. The search results lack specific forecasting models or projections from public health authorities regarding potential summer 2025 scenarios

4. Limited information is available about current population immunity levels from vaccination and prior infection

5. The search results don't mention current mitigation measures or public health policies that might affect transmission

Given the available data and the short timeframe remaining before July 1, 2025, the most likely outcome is that we will not see a new VOC driving 20,000+ daily hospitalizations in the US within the next 7 weeks. However, this assessment carries significant uncertainty due to the unpredictable nature of viral evolution and the gaps in available forecasting data.
