# Forecasting U.S. Solar Energy Share in Primary Energy by 2031

Based on the information available as of November 3, 2021, I'll analyze historical trends and project the percentage of U.S. primary energy that may come from solar by 2031.

## Historical Trends and Current Status

As of 2019, solar energy represented 1.02% of primary energy generation in the United States, showing remarkable growth from just 0.02% in 2009. In absolute terms, solar energy generation increased from 0.89 TWh in 2009 to 132.63 TWh in 2019. This represents a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 65% over this decade.

The growth has been primarily driven by the rapidly declining costs of solar technology. Solar photovoltaic (PV) module prices have fallen dramatically, making solar increasingly competitive with conventional energy sources. Between 2010 and 2020, the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) from utility-scale solar PV decreased by approximately 85%.

## Forecast Considerations

Several factors will likely influence solar energy's share of primary energy by 2031:

1. **Technological improvements**: Continued efficiency gains and cost reductions in solar panel manufacturing and installation are expected.

2. **Policy environment**: Federal tax incentives like the Investment Tax Credit (ITC) have been significant drivers of solar adoption. As of 2021, the ITC was scheduled to step down from 26% to 22% in 2023 and to 10% for commercial projects in 2024, while expiring for residential projects.

3. **Grid integration challenges**: As solar penetration increases, issues related to intermittency and storage become more significant, potentially limiting growth rates.

4. **Retirement of conventional generation**: The pace of coal and natural gas plant retirements will affect how quickly renewables can gain market share.

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on historical growth patterns and information available as of November 2021, I project that solar energy could represent between 4% and 10% of U.S. primary energy by 2031.

The lower bound (4%) assumes:
- Slower growth due to reduced incentives
- Grid integration challenges
- Competition from other low-carbon technologies

The upper bound (10%) assumes:
- Continued rapid cost declines
- Favorable policy extensions or new supportive policies
- Accelerated retirement of fossil fuel generation
- Technological breakthroughs in energy storage

This assessment recognizes that the 65% CAGR from 2009-2019 is unlikely to continue at the same pace due to the larger base from which solar is now growing. However, even more modest growth rates would result in significant increases in solar's share of the energy mix.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors create uncertainty in this forecast:

1. **Measurement methodology**: The BP Statistical Review methodology may evolve over time, affecting comparability.

2. **Policy changes**: Future administrations may significantly alter renewable energy policies.

3. **Technological disruptions**: Breakthroughs in storage technology could accelerate solar adoption beyond current projections.

4. **Economic conditions**: Economic growth rates and energy demand will affect overall energy consumption patterns.

It's important to note that this forecast is based on information available as of November 2021. More recent data would likely provide additional insights into solar energy growth trajectories.
