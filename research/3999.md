## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Antarctica has never had a permanent civilian population. Its human presence is strictly limited to temporary scientific staff, fluctuating seasonally: about 5,000 in the summer and 1,000 in the winter as of 2020[2].
- The Antarctic Treaty (in force since 1961) explicitly prohibits military activity, mineral mining, and permanent settlement, preserving the continent for peaceful scientific research and environmental protection[2].

## 2. Reference Case Comparisons

- Other extreme or isolated regions (e.g., the Arctic, remote islands, research outposts in space) have only seen significant population increases when legal, technological, and economic barriers are overcome. For Antarctica, such changes have not occurred as of 2020.
- The Arctic, despite being more accessible and less restricted legally, supports only small indigenous and transient populations.
- The International Space Station, despite immense investment, has never supported more than a handful of people at a time.

## 3. Recent Announcements and Policies

- As of April 2020, no major policy changes or infrastructure investments have been proposed that would enable mass human settlement in Antarctica.
- The Antarctic Treaty is scheduled for review in 2048, which could, in theory, alter governance or restrictions, but there is no indication as of 2020 that this is likely[2].

## 4. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- United Nations and INED population projections do not track a resident Antarctic population[1][3].
- The UN's long-term global projections estimate a world population peak of 9.2–10.5 billion around 2075, but these projections do not affect Antarctica’s status unless major legal or environmental changes occur[2][4][5].

## 5. Limitations and Uncertainties

- The largest uncertainties are future geopolitical decisions post-2048 and the possibility of drastic climate change making the continent more habitable.
- All projections assume no radical policy shifts or unforeseen technological breakthroughs that would permit large-scale settlement.

## 6. Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given all factual information up to 2020-04-17, the most likely scenario is that Antarctica's peak population by 2075 will remain similar to current levels, with temporary scientific staff peaking at 5,000–10,000 at most. The probability of a population exceeding 10,000 is extremely low barring unforeseen legal, technological, or environmental changes. A central forecast for the peak population by 2075 would thus be:

- **Most likely range:** 1,000–10,000 people (with 5,000 as the likely peak under current regimes)
- **Probability of exceeding 10,000:** Very low (<5%)
- **Probability of exceeding 100,000:** Negligible (<1%)
