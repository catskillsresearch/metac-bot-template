To forecast whether a publicly-available LLM will achieve gold on the International Math Olympiad (IMO) before October 1, 2024, we need to examine the current state of AI performance on mathematical reasoning tasks, particularly in the context of the IMO.

## Current Status of AI on IMO Problems

The 65th International Mathematical Olympiad was held in Bath, United Kingdom from July 11-22, 2024[1]. In this competition, gold medals were awarded to participants scoring 29 points or higher out of a maximum possible 42 points[1]. A total of 58 gold medals were awarded in the 2024 IMO[1].

A significant development in AI mathematical reasoning occurred during the 2024 IMO when a specialized AI system developed by Google DeepMind achieved a silver medal standard, earning 28 out of 42 total points[5]. This score was just one point below the gold medal threshold for 2024[5]. However, this system appears to be a specialized, closed-source AI focused specifically on mathematical problem-solving rather than a general-purpose, publicly-available LLM as specified in the question criteria.

## Challenges for Publicly-Available LLMs

For a publicly-available LLM to achieve gold medal status on the IMO before October 1, 2024, several significant challenges would need to be overcome:

1. **Performance Gap**: Current publicly-available LLMs have not demonstrated the same level of mathematical reasoning capabilities as specialized systems. The DeepMind system that achieved silver medal status was likely optimized specifically for mathematical problem-solving.

2. **Time Constraints**: With the 2024 IMO having concluded in July and the deadline being October 1, 2024, there is limited time for significant advancements in publicly-available LLMs to bridge the gap to gold medal performance.

3. **Domain Generality Requirement**: The question specifically requires a domain-general LLM capable of answering standard queries like those posed to ChatGPT in 2023, while also achieving gold medal performance on IMO problems. This combination of breadth and depth presents a substantial challenge.

## Relevant Benchmarks

The 2024 IMO featured 609 contestants from 108 countries[1], with the gold medal threshold set at 29 points[1]. This threshold represents a high bar for mathematical problem-solving ability, even for specialized human competitors.

The top individual performers at the 2024 IMO included Haojia Shi (China), Ivan Chasovskikh (Russia), and Alexander Wang (USA)[4], demonstrating the exceptional level of human performance that an LLM would need to match or exceed.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors create uncertainty in forecasting this outcome:

1. **Limited Public Information**: Detailed information about the current mathematical reasoning capabilities of the latest publicly-available LLMs specifically on IMO-level problems is not widely available.

2. **Rapid Development Cycle**: AI capabilities have been advancing rapidly, but whether this pace will be sufficient to bridge the gap from current performance to gold medal level within the short timeframe is uncertain.

3. **Evaluation Methodology**: The question specifies that the model must solve problems as presented to human IMO participants and within similar time constraints. How exactly this would be verified and by whom adds another layer of uncertainty.

Based on the available information as of August 7, 2024, while AI has made significant progress in mathematical reasoning as evidenced by the silver medal performance of a specialized system, there remains a gap to be bridged for a publicly-available, domain-general LLM to achieve gold medal status on the IMO before October 1, 2024.
