### 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Between 2006 and 2019, Non-Overseas Contingency Operations (Non-OCO) deaths have consistently accounted for the majority of US military fatalities, comprising about 73% of total deaths, with the remainder being OCO deaths in war zones[5].
- Despite this, the absolute annual number of US military deaths (including both OCO and Non-OCO) in peacetime years has remained far below 3,000.
- From 1980 to 2022, the military recorded about 60,770 deaths, averaging roughly 1,800 per year for all causes, with the majority (83.6%) from accidents, illness, and self-inflicted wounds[5].
- Accidental deaths, once the leading cause, have fallen 83% since 1980. Suicides have increased but remain below 1,000 annually. Deaths from other causes (accidents, illnesses, homicides) have all declined by 65% or more since 1980[5].
- In 2019, the total number of active duty deaths from all causes was well below 3,000[1][5].

### 2. Recent Announcements or Policies Affecting the Metric

- As of 2019, there were no major policy announcements, force expansions, or changes in US military operational posture likely to increase Non-OCO deaths substantially.
- Safety programs and suicide prevention initiatives continue to be priorities, contributing to a downward trend in accidental deaths and a containment of other causes[5].

### 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Department of Defense Casualty Status and Deaths by Year and Manner[1][2]
- Congressional Research Service reports on military fatalities[4]
- USAFacts analysis of military deaths[5]

### 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- Data from the Department of Defense and Congressional Research Service is comprehensive, but future measurement could be affected by changes in reporting practices or classification of deaths.
- Only a highly improbable event—such as a catastrophic training accident, pandemic, or systemic failure—could plausibly push Non-OCO deaths above 3,000 in a single year, none of which are forecasted as of 2019.

### Probabilistic Assessment

Given historical averages, current trends, and the lack of extraordinary risk factors, the probability that US Non-OCO military deaths will exceed 3,000 in any calendar year before 2032 is extremely low—well under 1%.
