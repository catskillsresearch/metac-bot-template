### 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of April 2025, US national average retail gasoline prices are steady between $3.10 and $3.21 per gallon, with a recent but likely temporary spike[2][5].
- Prices are about 35 cents lower than one year ago, indicating a downward trend compared to 2024[5].
- The market is described as being in a "holding pattern," with no clear drivers for sustained increases[2].

### 2. Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Metric

- The US imposed significant new tariffs in 2025, contributing to economic uncertainty and lower oil prices[5].
- OPEC+ has restored oil production faster than expected, increasing supply and putting downward pressure on prices[5].
- Economic indicators (including a stock market drop and increased recession risk) suggest potential for reduced demand, also pressuring prices lower[5].
- Analysts who accurately forecasted 2024 prices expect 2025 prices to remain steady or decline, especially if these trends persist[1][2][5].

### 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Energy Information Administration (EIA): Weekly/monthly national retail gasoline prices (series ID: PET.EMM_EPMR_PTE_NUS_DPG.M)
- Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS): Consumer Price Index (CPIAUCSL) for inflation adjustment

### 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- Gasoline prices are sensitive to geopolitical events, unplanned supply disruptions, and rapid policy changes, all of which could reverse current trends.
- The effect of tariffs and potential recession is uncertain in duration and magnitude.
- Measurement is robust, but real-time data can be volatile due to temporary shocks.

### Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the combination of:
- Lower average nominal gas prices compared to 2024,
- Expected stable or declining trend due to increased supply and economic headwinds,
- Short-lived nature of recent price spikes,
- And no substantial inflationary shocks forecasted,

**It is more likely than not that inflation-adjusted US gas prices will not rise in 2025 compared to 2024.** Absent a major supply disruption or reversal in policy, the forecasted probability of inflation-adjusted gas prices being higher in December 2025 than December 2024 is below 50%[1][2][5].
