# Forecasting Analysis: Starlink Availability in Bangladesh

As of May 16, 2025, I've analyzed the current situation regarding Starlink's potential availability in Bangladesh before July 1, 2025. Here's my assessment:

## Current Status

Starlink is in the final stages of obtaining regulatory approval to operate in Bangladesh. The Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (BTRC) has already approved Starlink's application for a satellite internet license and forwarded it to the Ministry of Posts, Telecommunications and Information Technology for final approval[1]. Once the ministry grants permission, Starlink will be able to commence commercial services after paying the required license fee[1].

The company has already demonstrated its capabilities in Bangladesh, with tests showing download speeds of approximately 230 Mbps during a demonstration event in Dhaka in April 2025[5]. This technical validation suggests that Starlink's infrastructure is ready for deployment.

## Timeline Indicators

Several key timeline indicators suggest Starlink's imminent launch in Bangladesh:

- Lauren Dreyer, VP for Global Engagement at SpaceX, has stated that Starlink expects to be ready to launch services in Bangladesh "sometime next month" (referring to May 2025, as the statement was made in April)[1]
- In February 2025, Bangladesh's Chief Adviser Prof Muhammad Yunus held discussions with Elon Musk specifically about bringing Starlink to Bangladesh by May 2025[1]
- The BTRC has offered Starlink a 10-year NGSO Operator License and Radio Communication Apparatus License, indicating a long-term commitment to operating in the country[5]
- As of April 30, 2025, reports confirmed that Starlink satellite internet service was expected to be available in Bangladesh by May 2025[5]

## Regulatory Progress

The regulatory process appears to be proceeding smoothly:
- Starlink Services Bangladesh Ltd applied for the license on April 7, 2025[1]
- The BTRC reviewed Starlink's documentation and recommended approval[1]
- The application was forwarded to the Ministry for final approval in late April 2025[1]
- Starlink has been pursuing entry into the Bangladesh market since 2021, with significant progress made in 2025[1]

Additionally, Bangladesh Satellite Company Limited (BSCL) has met with Starlink officials to discuss partnership options to fast-track Starlink's entry into the market, including a potential reselling arrangement and hosting Starlink's gateway at BSCL's ground stations[1].

## Forecast Assessment

Based on the available information, I assess that there is a **high probability (approximately 85-90%)** that Starlink's website will show Bangladesh as a country with availability before July 1, 2025. This assessment is based on:

1. The advanced stage of the regulatory approval process, with only ministerial approval remaining
2. Multiple consistent statements from both Starlink officials and Bangladesh authorities indicating a May 2025 launch timeframe
3. The successful technical demonstrations already conducted in the country
4. The current date (May 16, 2025) being well within the projected timeline for launch

The primary uncertainty relates to potential unexpected delays in the final ministerial approval or unforeseen technical issues. However, given the apparent political support for the initiative (including direct discussions between Bangladesh's Chief Adviser and Elon Musk), such delays seem unlikely to push the launch beyond July 1, 2025.

## Limitations

This forecast is based on publicly available information as of May 16, 2025. Potential limitations include:
- Lack of visibility into internal government approval timelines
- Possible undisclosed regulatory or technical hurdles
- Uncertainty about how quickly Starlink updates its availability map after receiving final approval
