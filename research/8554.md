## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The share of bachelor’s degrees awarded to women in the US has steadily increased over the past century. Women earned 34.2% of bachelor’s degrees in 1919-1920, rising to 57.4% by 2018-2019, and 58.6% in the 2021-2022 academic year[5][1].
- Female students have higher college graduation rates (67.6%) than male students (61.1%), contributing to the widening gap[5].
- Women outpace men in college attainment in all major racial and ethnic groups, though the size of the gap varies[3][4].

## 2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- No major policies or interventions have been announced recently that are likely to dramatically accelerate or reverse these trends[2].
- The increase in women’s share of degrees has slowed in recent years, suggesting the trend may be approaching a plateau rather than continuing linearly toward 70%[5].

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) collects and reports the definitive data on degree conferrals.
- Pew Research Center and the Education Data Initiative provide detailed breakdowns of current educational attainment statistics[3][5].

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- The rate of increase in the share of bachelor’s degrees awarded to women has decelerated in recent years, indicating possible saturation.
- Future changes in higher education (e.g., credentialing alternatives, workforce shifts), demographic trends, and gender definitions introduce additional uncertainty.
- Social or economic changes encouraging more men to pursue higher education could reduce or reverse the trend.

## Probabilistic Assessment

Given the historical data, slowing growth rate, and lack of evidence for a major upcoming shift, the probability that women will receive at least 70% of US bachelor’s degrees by 2050 is **low**. The share is likely to remain above parity but below the 70% threshold unless unforeseen, large-scale changes occur.
