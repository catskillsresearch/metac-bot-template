# FATF Grey List Forecast: June 2025 Plenary Meeting Analysis

The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) regularly reviews jurisdictions with strategic deficiencies in their regimes to counter money laundering and terrorist financing. Based on current information available as of May 19, 2025, I'll analyze the likelihood of changes to the FATF "grey list" following the upcoming June 2025 Plenary meeting.

## Current Status of FATF Grey List

As of February 2025, the FATF's "Jurisdictions under Increased Monitoring" list (commonly known as the grey list) includes 25 countries: Algeria, Angola, Bulgaria, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, CÃ´te d'Ivoire, Croatia, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Haiti, Kenya, the Lao People's Democratic Republic, Lebanon, Mali, Monaco, Mozambique, Namibia, Nepal, Nigeria, South Africa, South Sudan, Syria, Tanzania, Venezuela, Vietnam, and Yemen[2].

The FATF has reviewed 139 countries and jurisdictions in total and has publicly identified 114 of them, with 86 having since made the necessary improvements to be removed from monitoring lists[2].

## Recent Changes (February 2025 Plenary)

The most recent FATF Plenary in February 2025 resulted in several changes to the grey list:
- The Philippines was removed from the grey list
- Laos and Nepal were added to the watchlist

This demonstrates the dynamic nature of the list, with countries both entering and exiting based on their progress in addressing deficiencies in their anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing (AML/CFT) frameworks[3].

## Candidate Countries for Removal in June 2025

### South Africa
South Africa has made significant progress in addressing the deficiencies identified in its AML/CFT framework. As of February 2025, South Africa has addressed or largely addressed 20 of the 22 action items in its Action Plan[5]. The country is working on the two remaining items during the reporting period from March 2025 to June 2025[5].

However, the official statement from the South African National Treasury indicates that even if South Africa addresses these remaining items by June 2025, it would "enable South Africa to be considered for delisting from the FATF greylist in October 2025"[5]. This suggests that formal removal would likely happen at the October 2025 Plenary rather than the June 2025 meeting, though an announcement of progress could occur in June.

### Other Potential Removals
While specific information about other countries' progress is not available in the search results, the regular review cycle suggests that jurisdictions that have made substantial progress in addressing their deficiencies could be considered for removal at the June 2025 Plenary.

## Potential Additions to the Grey List

The FATF continuously assesses countries' AML/CFT frameworks. Based on the pattern of previous Plenaries, it's reasonable to expect that some jurisdictions may be added to the grey list in June 2025 if they are found to have strategic deficiencies[3][4].

However, the search results do not provide specific information about countries currently under review that might be added to the list in June 2025.

## Forecast Analysis

Based on the available information, there is a high probability that the FATF will make changes to its grey list following the June 2025 Plenary meeting:

1. **Likelihood of removals**: Moderate. While South Africa appears to be progressing toward removal, the documentation suggests this would happen in October rather than June 2025. However, other countries not specifically mentioned in the search results may have completed their action plans and could be removed.

2. **Likelihood of additions**: Moderate to high. Historical patterns suggest that each Plenary typically results in some additions to the list as the FATF identifies new jurisdictions with strategic deficiencies.

3. **Overall likelihood of changes**: High. Given the FATF's active monitoring process and the February 2025 Plenary's changes, it's highly likely that at least some jurisdictions will either be added to or removed from the grey list following the June 2025 Plenary.

## Key Limitations and Uncertainties

1. Limited information about countries' progress besides South Africa
2. Lack of specific details about jurisdictions currently under review for potential addition to the list
3. Uncertainty about the exact timing of removals, as demonstrated by South Africa's case where completion of action items by June might lead to removal in October

Given the historical pattern of changes at each Plenary meeting and the specific information about South Africa's progress, it is highly probable that the FATF will make at least some changes to its grey list following the June 2025 Plenary meeting.
