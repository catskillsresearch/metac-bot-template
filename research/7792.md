# Forecasting Armed Conflict Between Taiwan and China Before 2026

Based on the available information, I'll assess the likelihood of armed conflicts between Taiwan and China leading to at least 100 deaths before 2026.

## Current Situation (as of May 2025)

The cross-strait relations between China and Taiwan have significantly deteriorated, with increasing military activities and provocations:

- In January 2025, the People's Liberation Army (PLA) carried out the most aggressive incursions into Taiwan's airspace and waters since 2021[2].
- As of February 2025, China has escalated its military activities near Taiwan, with 41 aircraft, 9 naval vessels, and a warship reported near Taiwan's territory. Taiwan's defense forces confirmed that 28 aircraft crossed the median line, breaching its Air Defense Identification Zone[5].
- In April 2025, China continued its military provocations with sustained incursions, showing a shift from politically triggered responses to a sustained military presence[2].
- On May 20, 2025, Taiwan President Lai declared China a foreign hostile force and oversaw the island's first whole-of-society civil defense drill[1].

## Analysis of Military Escalation Patterns

China's approach to Taiwan has evolved from primarily political signaling to a more sustained military presence:

- The PLA has intensified its air and naval operations, setting record highs in median-line crossings and warship activity[2].
- Joint combat readiness patrols have expanded in both frequency and scope, incorporating long-range missions and drone flights encircling Taiwan[2].
- Even during the traditionally subdued Lunar New Year period of 2025, Beijing escalated maneuvers, dispelling the notion that cross-Strait tensions are solely driven by political catalysts[2].
- Following President Lai's National Day speech in October 2024, China launched large-scale naval drills and war games near the Taiwan Strait as a "stern warning" against "separatist acts"[4].

## Key Factors Affecting Conflict Probability

### Chinese Strategic Objectives

China has been employing "gray zone" coercion tactics to pressure Taiwan toward unification:

- Xi Jinping has vowed to reunify Taiwan, potentially by force, with 2027 identified as a key military readiness goal[5].
- China has not ruled out using force to achieve reunification[4].
- The sustained military presence reflects an evolving doctrine that prioritizes operational dominance and training over diplomatic signaling[2].

### Taiwan's Position

Taiwan maintains its separate identity and has taken increasingly assertive positions:

- Taiwan rejects China's claims, asserting its self-determination[5].
- Political discord within Taiwan is creating additional instability in the cross-strait relationship[3].
- President Lai's declaration of China as a "foreign hostile force" marks a significant hardening of Taiwan's official position[1].

### U.S. Involvement

The United States remains a critical factor in the cross-strait equation:

- The U.S. has conducted naval transits near Taiwan, including operations by the USS Ralph Johnson and USNS Bowditch in early 2025[5].
- The U.S. hasn't ruled out defending Taiwan if China attacks[4].
- The Biden-to-Trump transition has created questions about changes in U.S. Taiwan policy[5].

### Strategic Economic Considerations

Taiwan's semiconductor industry represents a significant factor in global calculations:

- Taiwan's TSMC dominates global semiconductor production, making it a critical economic and strategic asset[5].
- Control over Taiwan's semiconductor industry could reshape economic and military power dynamics globally[5].

## Probability Assessment

Based on the escalating pattern of military activities, hardening political positions, and increasing preparations for potential conflict on both sides, the probability of armed conflict resulting in at least 100 deaths before January 1, 2026 (approximately 7 months from the current date) is **moderately high**.

The following factors increase the probability:
- The sustained and escalating pattern of military incursions by China
- Taiwan's increasingly defensive posture and civil defense preparations
- The shift in China's approach from political signaling to operational military presence
- The potential for miscalculation during increasingly complex military maneuvers

Factors that may reduce the probability:
- China's continued preference for "gray zone" tactics below the threshold of armed conflict
- The economic interdependence between China, Taiwan, and the global economy
- International diplomatic pressure to avoid armed conflict
- The deterrent effect of potential U.S. military intervention

Given these considerations, I assess there is approximately a 30-40% chance of armed conflict resulting in at least 100 deaths before January 1, 2026.

## Limitations and Caveats

This assessment is subject to several limitations:

1. The rapidly evolving nature of cross-strait relations means conditions could change quickly
2. The potential for accidental escalation remains high even if deliberate conflict is not intended
3. Internal political developments in either Taiwan or China could significantly alter the trajectory
4. U.S. policy shifts could either increase or decrease tensions
