# Forecasting Arab League-Israel Normalizations by 2027

As of May 2025, six Arab League member states have normalized relations with Israel. To forecast the number by 2027, I'll analyze historical patterns, current diplomatic trajectories, and the factors influencing potential future normalizations.

## Current Status and Historical Context

The normalization landscape has evolved significantly since the 1967 Khartoum Resolution's "Three Nos" policy. As of May 2025, the following Arab League members have normalized relations with Israel:

1. Egypt (1979) - First Arab country to sign a peace treaty with Israel
2. Jordan (1994) - Second Arab country to normalize relations
3. United Arab Emirates (2020) - Part of the Abraham Accords
4. Bahrain (2020) - Part of the Abraham Accords
5. Morocco (2020) - Part of the Abraham Accords
6. Sudan (2020) - Part of the Abraham Accords[1][2]

This represents a significant shift from the pre-2020 period when only Egypt and Jordan had formal diplomatic relations with Israel. The Abraham Accords in 2020 doubled this number in a short timeframe, demonstrating that regional dynamics had fundamentally changed.

## Key Factors Affecting Future Normalizations

### 1. The Saudi Arabia Factor

Saudi Arabia remains the most significant potential normalization candidate. As of early 2025, the kingdom has maintained a firm stance against normalizing relations without progress on Palestinian statehood[1]. The proposed Saudi-Israeli "mega-deal" that was under discussion included:

- A U.S.-Saudi defense treaty with security guarantees
- A Saudi civil nuclear program
- Progress on the Palestinian issue[3]

The momentum toward Saudi normalization was derailed by the Israel-Hamas War following the October 7, 2023 attack[5]. However, discussions continue, and Saudi normalization would likely trigger additional Arab states to follow suit.

### 2. "Warm Peace" vs. "Cold Peace"

The architects of the Abraham Accords aimed to build a "warm peace" through economic integration and cultural engagement, contrasting with the "cold peace" that characterized Israel's relationships with Egypt and Jordan[2]. The success or failure of this approach by 2027 will influence other countries' willingness to normalize.

### 3. Public Opinion in Arab Countries

Despite governmental cooperation, public opinion in many Arab countries remains opposed to normalization. Surveys show that after the Abraham Accords were reached, Jordanians and Egyptians were among the least likely to favor normalization, with only 5% in each country supporting the process[2]. This public sentiment presents a significant obstacle for additional normalizations.

## Forecast for 2027

Based on current trajectories and historical patterns, I estimate the following probability distribution for Arab League members with normalized relations with Israel by October 2027:

- **6 members (status quo)**: 25% probability
- **7-8 members**: 40% probability
- **9-10 members**: 25% probability
- **11+ members**: 10% probability

### Most Likely Additional Normalizations

1. **Saudi Arabia** - Despite current hesitation, diplomatic pressure and strategic interests may lead to normalization by 2027, especially if a formula addressing Palestinian concerns can be negotiated.

2. **Oman** - Has maintained quiet relations with Israel and hosted Israeli leaders. As a moderate Gulf state, it could follow the UAE and Bahrain.

3. **Qatar** - Has had informal commercial ties with Israel and could normalize relations under the right regional conditions.

4. **Kuwait** - Less likely than the above but could be influenced by Saudi normalization.

### Limiting Factors

- The unresolved Israeli-Palestinian conflict continues to be a major obstacle to broader normalization[1][5].
- Regional instability, particularly following the 2023 Israel-Hamas War, has slowed normalization momentum.
- Domestic public opinion in Arab countries largely remains opposed to normalization[2].

## Conclusion

The most likely outcome is 7-8 Arab League members having normalized relations with Israel by October 2027, representing modest but significant progress beyond the current six. Saudi Arabia's decision will be pivotal, potentially triggering a domino effect among other Gulf states. However, the Palestinian issue remains a significant constraint on the pace and breadth of normalization.
