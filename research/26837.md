# Will "Woman's World" by Katy Perry Reach the Billboard Hot 100 Top 15?

## Current Status and Performance

Katy Perry released "Woman's World" on July 11, 2024, as the lead single from her upcoming seventh studio album [1]. As of July 26, 2024, the song was positioned at #63 on the Billboard Hot 100 [2]. This represents a relatively modest debut for an artist of Perry's stature, especially considering her historical chart performance.

The song has faced significant criticism since its release, with many reviewers describing it as dated and reminiscent of "girl boss" feminism from the mid-2010s [3]. The critical reception has been predominantly negative, with publications like Rolling Stone and Pitchfork giving unfavorable reviews, citing simplistic lyrics and production choices [4].

## Historical Context and Chart Patterns

Katy Perry has historically been a chart powerhouse. Between 2008 and 2020, she achieved nine #1 singles on the Billboard Hot 100 and 14 top-10 hits [5]. However, her recent chart performance has shown a decline. Her last top 10 hit was "Never Really Over," which peaked at #15 in 2019 [6].

For context, songs that debut in the 60-70 range on the Billboard Hot 100 rarely climb to the top 15 without significant catalysts such as viral moments, strong radio support, or major promotional pushes [7]. According to Billboard chart analysts, only about 5% of songs that debut outside the top 40 eventually reach the top 15 [8].

## Potential Growth Factors

The song's association with Kamala Harris's presidential campaign could potentially boost its visibility and streaming numbers. "Woman's World" was reportedly used as a walkout song at Harris campaign events in July 2024 [9]. Political associations have historically had mixed effects on song performance - while they increase visibility, they can also polarize audiences [10].

Perry has announced plans for promotional performances of the song on several major television shows in August 2024, including "The Tonight Show" and "Good Morning America" [11]. These high-profile appearances could potentially boost the song's chart position.

Additionally, Perry's label, Capitol Records, has reportedly planned an extensive radio promotion campaign for the song beginning in late July 2024 [12]. Radio airplay remains a significant factor in Billboard Hot 100 rankings.

## Challenges and Limitations

Several factors work against "Woman's World" reaching the top 15:

1. The negative critical reception may limit its cultural impact and word-of-mouth promotion [13].
2. The song faces strong competition from established hits and new releases from major artists scheduled for August 2024 [14].
3. Initial streaming numbers reported by Spotify and Apple Music show the song performing below expectations for a major pop release [15].
4. The political association may limit its appeal among certain demographic groups [16].

## Analysis and Forecast

Based on the available data as of August 2, 2024, "Woman's World" faces significant challenges in reaching the top 15 of the Billboard Hot 100 before October 1, 2024. The song would need to climb approximately 48 positions in about two months, which is uncommon without exceptional circumstances [17].

While Perry's star power and planned promotional activities provide some potential for growth, the combination of negative critical reception, modest initial performance, and the historical difficulty of significant chart climbs suggests that reaching the top 15 is unlikely but not impossible [18].

The political association with the Harris campaign represents a wild card factor that could either significantly boost the song's performance through increased visibility or limit its appeal due to polarization [19].
