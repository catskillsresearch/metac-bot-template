Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door was nominated for the 2025 GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Video Game at the 36th Annual GLAAD Media Awards[2][3][4][5]. However, the winner of the category was Dragon Age: The Veilguard, as officially announced by GLAAD[2][3]. 

GLAAD's criteria for the award include fair, accurate, and inclusive representations of the LGBTQ community, boldness and originality, cultural impact, and overall quality. While Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door received recognition as a nominee, it did not win the award. Other nominees, such as Caravan SandWitch and Dragon Age: The Veilguard, were highlighted for their explicit LGBTQ-inclusive stories and characters, which likely contributed to their stronger consideration for the award[1][2].

**Limitations and Uncertainties:**  
There are no uncertainties regarding the outcome, as the winner has been officially announced. The selection process is transparent, and the result is verifiable through multiple authoritative sources.

**Conclusion:**  
Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door did not win the 2025 GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Video Game.
