Based on the information available before March 17, 2025, I can provide a definitive answer to the question about Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door winning the 2025 GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Video Game.

## Award Status and Results

Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door did **not** win the 2025 GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Video Game. The winner of the Outstanding Video Game category at the 36th Annual GLAAD Media Awards was **Dragon Age: The Veilguard** developed by BioWare and published by Electronic Arts[2][3].

Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door (developed by Intelligent Systems and published by Nintendo) was among the ten nominees for this award[2]. The nominations were announced on January 22, 2025[1].

## Nomination Context

Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door likely secured its nomination due to its handling of the character Vivian. In the original GameCube release from 2000, Vivian was a trans character who was intentionally misgendered by the game's cast. However, this aspect of her identity was censored in many versions at the time, including the English-language release. For the remake released prior to the awards, Nintendo restored Vivian's trans identity, which was seen as a positive step for LGBTQ+ representation[5].

## Award Category Overview

The Outstanding Video Game category at the 36th Annual GLAAD Media Awards featured a diverse range of nominees, with the majority being indie games[5]. The complete list of nominees included:
