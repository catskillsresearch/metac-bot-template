## Taylor Swift's Prospects at the 2024 MTV Video Music Awards

**Key Factual Information as of September 5, 2024:**

- Taylor Swift leads the 2024 MTV VMAs with 10 nominations, including top categories such as Video of the Year ("Fortnight" ft. Post Malone), Song of the Year, Artist of the Year, Best Collaboration, Best Pop, Best Visual Effects, Best Editing, Best Direction, Best Art Direction, and Best Cinematography[1][2].
- Swift has a strong track record at the VMAs, having won Video of the Year in both 2022 and 2023, and is poised to potentially become the first artist to win this category three years in a row if she wins in 2024[2].
- The VMAs are largely fan-voted, with voting open in 15 categories until August 30, 2024. Taylor Swift's fanbase is known for high engagement in such voting processes, which historically has translated into multiple award wins[1][2].
- Other top nominees include Post Malone (9 nominations), Ariana Grande, Eminem, and Sabrina Carpenter (6 each), and Megan Thee Stallion and SZA (5 each), but none match Swift's nomination count[1][2].
- The 2024 MTV VMAs will be held on September 10, 2024, and the results will be available on the official Wikipedia page and other credible sources after the event.

**Limitations and Uncertainties:**

- As of September 5, 2024, the winners have not been announced, so any forecast is based on nomination count, historical performance, and fan engagement, not on confirmed results.
- While a high number of nominations increases the probability of multiple wins, it does not guarantee that Swift will win 5 or more awards, as outcomes depend on both fan votes and competition in each category.

**Authoritative Sources for Verification:**

- The official Wikipedia page for the 2024 MTV Video Music Awards and major entertainment news outlets will provide the final results after the ceremony.
