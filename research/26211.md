## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The Olympic record for men's pole vault is 6.03m, set by Thiago Braz in 2016.
- Since then, Armand Duplantis has raised the world record multiple times, most recently to 6.24m in April 2024[1][5].
- Duplantis has dominated the 2024 outdoor season, winning every major competition and consistently clearing six metres or higher[2][3].
- At the Paris Diamond League on July 7, 2024, Duplantis cleared 6.00m to win, then attempted 6.25m (above his own world record), indicating both his form and ambition to break records at major meets[2][3].
- Other leading vaulters, such as Sam Kendricks (season best 5.95m) and Thibaut Collet (5.85m), have not approached the Olympic record height in 2024[2][4].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- Thiago Braz, the 2016 Olympic champion and record holder, is suspended and will not compete in Paris[2].
- No recent rule changes or equipment modifications have been reported that would affect pole vault results or their measurement.

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Official Olympic and Diamond League results, as well as coverage from the Olympics.com website, provide up-to-date and verified competition data[2][4].
- Video evidence and commentary from major meets, such as the Wanda Diamond League and NBC Sports, confirm Duplantis's performances and record attempts[1][3][5].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- Championship events can be unpredictable due to weather, athlete health, and competition pressure.
- While Duplantis is the overwhelming favorite and has a strong record of clearing heights above the Olympic record, there is always a possibility of an off day or adverse conditions.
- Other competitors have not shown recent form to challenge the Olympic record, making Duplantis the only realistic candidate to break it in Paris.

## Conclusion

Given Duplantis's current dominance, recent world record, and consistent clearances above six metres, the available evidence strongly supports the likelihood that the Olympic record of 6.03m will be broken at the 2024 Paris Olympicsâ€”most likely by Duplantis himself, provided he is healthy and conditions are reasonable[1][2][5].
