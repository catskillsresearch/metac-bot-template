### 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of 2021-05-17, Bitcoin’s price was in the range of $30,000–$60,000, having recently set new all-time highs and attracting significant institutional investment[2][3].
- Historically, Bitcoin has experienced several major crashes (>80% drawdowns), but after each, it eventually recovered to set new highs. After breaking $20,000 in 2017, it fell below $4,000 in 2018, but this was still orders of magnitude above $10[2].
- By 2021, analysts predicted continued volatility but generally forecast prices orders of magnitude above $10, with predictions of $100,000–$450,000 by year-end 2021[3][4].
- The 2021 bull run was seen as structurally different from prior cycles due to greater institutional adoption and more developed markets[2].

### 2. Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting Bitcoin

- As of 2021-05-17, there were no imminent regulatory actions or technological failures that threatened the existence of Bitcoin or suggested a collapse to near-zero prices.
- The environment was characterized by increasing institutional adoption and mainstreaming of Bitcoin, with more asset managers and corporations entering the market[2].
- However, regulatory risks (potential bans, controls, or severe restrictions) remained a persistent concern, as did the potential for technological obsolescence or negative sentiment shifts.

### 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Price data and analysis from CoinMarketCap, CoinTelegraph, and other major crypto news outlets documented historical price movements and forecast models[2][3][4].
- Major financial institutions (e.g., Citibank) had published bullish price forecasts but cautioned on volatility[2].
- Academic and economic commentary (e.g., Paul Krugman’s NYT column) highlighted structural vulnerabilities due to Bitcoin’s lack of intrinsic value.

### 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- The 100-year timescale introduces extreme uncertainty: unforeseen technological advances, regulatory shifts, and changes in public perception could dramatically alter Bitcoin’s value.
- Unlike gold, Bitcoin does not have non-monetary uses as a value “backstop.” Its value is more exposed to shifts in collective confidence, technological change, or regulatory crackdowns[2].
- Bitcoin is dependent on continued network participation, energy inputs, and the absence of existential technical risks (e.g., quantum computing, protocol failure).
- The market has shown resilience, but no digital asset has yet demonstrated 100-year longevity or immunity to obsolescence.
- If the US dollar ceases to exist, the question’s resolution depends on calculating purchasing power parity, adding further uncertainty.

### Key Differences Affecting the Forecast

| Factor              | Bitcoin (2021)           | Reference Case: Gold         |
|---------------------|-------------------------|------------------------------|
| Intrinsic value     | None (purely belief)    | Jewelry, industrial uses     |
| Regulatory risk     | High                    | Low                          |
| Longevity           | ~12 years               | Millennia                    |
| Volatility          | Extreme                 | Moderate                     |
| Technology risk     | High (vulnerable)       | Low                          |

### Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment (as of 2021-05-17)

- **Probability that Bitcoin falls below $10 (2021 USD) before 2121:** Very low, but not zero. While Bitcoin has repeatedly survived major crashes, none have approached this magnitude. However, over a 100-year window, the risk of catastrophic collapse due to obsolescence, regulation, or sentiment cannot be dismissed. Historically, assets driven mainly by belief are vulnerable to regime shifts, but Bitcoin’s resilience thus far and growing adoption argue against a total collapse being “more likely than not.”
- **Best estimate (as of 2021):** Less than 5% chance that Bitcoin falls below $10 before 2121, acknowledging substantial uncertainty due to the unprecedented timeframe and Bitcoin’s unique risk profile.
