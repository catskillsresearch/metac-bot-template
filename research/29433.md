## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- North Dakota voters have rejected recreational marijuana legalization twice in recent years:
  - In 2018, 59.45% voted against legalization (Measure 3)[5].
  - In 2022, 54.94% voted against legalization (Measure 2)[4][5].
- Initiated Measure 5 has qualified for the November 2024 ballot after proponents submitted the required signatures[1][3].
- The measure would allow adults 21 and older to possess up to one ounce of cannabis flower, four grams of concentrate, or 1,500 milligrams of THC, and to grow up to three plants (six per household)[2][5].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- The North Dakota Secretary of State confirmed the measure’s placement on the November 2024 ballot as of August 2024[1].
- The measure’s provisions are similar to previous attempts, with regulated sales, home cultivation, and employer rights protections[2].
- There have been no major policy shifts or announcements indicating a significant change in the state’s political climate regarding cannabis legalization as of October 2024.

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- North Dakota Secretary of State’s official announcement[1].
- Ballotpedia and Cannabis Business Times coverage of the measure and its history[2][3][4][5].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- There is no publicly available polling data as of October 2024 indicating a significant shift in voter sentiment toward legalization.
- North Dakota has a history of rejecting similar measures, though the margin of opposition narrowed slightly from 2018 to 2022[4][5].
- The measure requires a simple majority (50% + 1) to pass[2].
- Social and political dynamics could change before the election, but no evidence suggests a dramatic shift as of the cutoff date.

## Summary

Based on historical voting patterns, the lack of evidence for a significant change in public opinion, and the similarity of Measure 5 to previously rejected initiatives, the available factual information as of October 31, 2024, suggests that North Dakota voters are more likely to reject Initiated Measure 5 in the 2024 general election.
