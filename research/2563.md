I notice that the query asks for information available as of January 17, 2019, to help forecast atmospheric CO2 concentration in 2030. However, all the search results provided contain information from 2025, which is beyond the specified cutoff date. Therefore, I cannot use these search results to directly answer the question as they represent future knowledge relative to the 2019 perspective requested.

To properly forecast atmospheric CO2 concentration in 2030 using only information available as of January 17, 2019, we would need historical CO2 data, emission trends, and climate models that were available at that time.

What I can tell you is that forecasting atmospheric CO2 concentrations typically involves:

1. Analyzing historical CO2 concentration trends (which showed approximately 2 ppm annual increases in the decade prior to 2019)
2. Evaluating emission scenarios from sources like the IPCC
3. Considering carbon cycle feedbacks and sink efficiencies
4. Accounting for policy developments and technological changes affecting emissions

From the information provided in the question itself, we know that as of 2019:
- Pre-industrial CO2 levels were approximately 280 ppm
- CO2 levels had risen to approximately 410 ppm
- The average rate of increase was around 2 ppm annually in the decade prior to 2019

A simple linear extrapolation based solely on the 2 ppm annual increase rate would suggest approximately 432 ppm by 2030 (410 ppm + (11 years Ã— 2 ppm)). However, accurate forecasting would require more sophisticated models that were available in 2019, accounting for potential acceleration or deceleration in the rate of increase.

For a more accurate forecast using 2019 information, I would need access to:
- IPCC emission scenarios available as of 2019
- Carbon cycle models from that time period
- Economic and policy projections made before 2019
- Climate feedback assessments from pre-2019 research

Without access to these specific 2019-era resources, I cannot provide a more detailed forecast that would have been possible at that time.
