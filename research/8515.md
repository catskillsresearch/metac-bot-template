## Historical Trends and Current Status

- **Embryo Screening & Polygenic Selection**: Embryo screening using preimplantation genetic testing (PGD) is widely used to avoid severe genetic diseases. Since at least 2019, researchers have explored using polygenic scores to select embryos for higher IQ or educational attainment. The most extensive GWAS for educational attainment (a proxy for IQ) explained about 11% of its variance as of 2022, up from 3.2% with smaller datasets[4].
  
- **Estimated Gains from Embryo Selection**:  
  - Shulman & Bostrom (2014) estimated an average IQ gain of 11.5 points when selecting the best out of 10 embryos, and 18.8 points out of 100.
  - Gwern’s analysis (2016; updated) found gains of 9 points (using measured SNP heritability) and up to 11 points (with improved measurement and GWAS accuracy).
  - Karavani et al. (2019) produced even lower estimates, suggesting diminishing returns as prediction methods improve[4].

- **Gene Editing Advances**: CRISPR and other gene editing technologies can currently target monogenic diseases but have not demonstrated the ability to safely and reliably edit complex traits such as IQ, which are highly polygenic and environmentally influenced[5].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- No major policy shifts or announcements as of January 2022 have legalized or widely promoted germline editing for cognitive enhancement. The focus remains on preventing disease, not enhancement[5].
- The Effective Altruism Forum and forecasting sites (e.g., Metaculus) highlight ongoing skepticism about the timeline for safe, effective, and socially accepted genetic IQ enhancement[4][2].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Peer-reviewed estimates from Shulman & Bostrom, Gwern, and Karavani et al. are referenced for projected gains.
- Progress in GWAS is tracked in leading genetic journals and large-scale studies[4].
- Policy and ethical reviews are regularly published in journals such as Evolution, Medicine, and Public Health[5].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- **Genetic Complexity**: IQ is influenced by thousands of genetic variants, each with small effects, and by significant environmental factors. Predictive power of polygenic scores remains limited, and gains from embryo selection are subject to diminishing returns as more accurate data accumulates[4].
- **Technical Barriers**: Gene editing for IQ would require precise, safe modification of many loci simultaneously—an ability not demonstrated as of 2022[5].
- **Societal and Regulatory Barriers**: Even if technically possible, broad commercial deployment may be limited by ethical, legal, and societal resistance[4][5].

## Key Differences Affecting the Forecast

- **Scientific Progress**: While polygenic scores for IQ are improving, the projected gains from embryo selection are modest and face diminishing returns.
- **Feasibility of Editing vs. Selection**: Editing is much riskier and less mature than selection, and the latter is constrained by the limited number of embryos typically produced in IVF.
- **Societal Acceptance**: Widespread adoption by 2050 (especially at an affordable price) remains uncertain given current attitudes and regulations.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the state of the science as of January 2022:
- Embryo selection could, in theory, achieve average IQ gains close to 10 points if polygenic predictions improve and enough embryos are available for selection, but this may only be feasible for a subset of the population[4].
- No gene editing technique is close to reliably increasing IQ by 10 points in typical individuals[5].
- Commercial availability and broad public use (as defined by the resolution criteria) face major technical and societal hurdles.

**Forecast**: While there is measurable progress in polygenic prediction and embryo selection, the probability that a commercially available genetic engineering technique will reliably raise IQ by 10 or more points for the general public by 2050 remains low, but not negligible—likely in the range of 10–25%. The field may see incremental improvements, but transformative enhancement as defined here is unlikely before 2050 barring unforeseen breakthroughs.
