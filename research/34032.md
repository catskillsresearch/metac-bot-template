## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) was passed by Congress in 1972 with a seven-year state ratification deadline, later extended to 1982[1][5].
- By 1982, only 35 states had ratified the amendment; three more ratified after the deadline, reaching the required three-fourths (38 states) as of recent years[2][5].
- Several states rescinded their ratifications, and the legitimacy of these rescissions and post-deadline ratifications is legally contested[5].
- On December 17, 2024, the National Archivist publicly stated that the ERA "cannot be certified as part of the Constitution due to established legal, judicial, and procedural decisions"[1][4].
- President Biden, as of January 2025, expressed his belief that the ERA has met the requirements to become the 28th Amendment but explicitly stated he would not order the Archivist to certify it[4].

## Recent Announcements and Policy Developments

- The National Archivist’s refusal is based on Justice Department legal opinions (2020 and 2022) that the congressional deadline is valid, rendering the ERA expired and not pending before the states[4].
- Advocacy groups and some legal authorities continue to pressure for certification, and the American Bar Association has declared the ERA ratified, but these actions lack binding legal effect[1][5].
- New congressional resolutions (e.g., S.J.Res.38) have been introduced to address the status of the ERA but have not been enacted as of January 31, 2025[3].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Official statements from the National Archivist and the White House[1][4].
- Congressional records and proposed legislation[3].
- Legal analyses and bar association positions[1][5].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- The situation is unprecedented: no previous amendment has achieved the required number of state ratifications after an expired congressional deadline[5].
- Ongoing legal disputes could result in future court rulings or legislative actions, but none are imminent or resolved as of this date.
- The Archivist and the current administration have firmly stated their intention not to certify the ERA under current circumstances[1][4].

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given (a) the Archivist’s explicit refusal to certify the ERA as of December 2024, (b) the President’s unwillingness to direct certification, (c) unresolved legal challenges, and (d) no new congressional action as of January 31, 2025, the probability that the National Archivist will certify and publish the ERA by June 30, 2025 is exceedingly low—likely less than 5% barring an unforeseen, rapid legal or legislative change before that date.
