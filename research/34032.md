As of May 2025, the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) stands in a unique constitutional position that makes forecasting its certification by the National Archivist challenging but analyzable based on recent developments.

## Current Status of the ERA

The Equal Rights Amendment has achieved ratification by the requisite three-fourths of U.S. states, meeting the standard in Article V of the Constitution for an amendment to become "valid to all intents and purposes, as part of this Constitution."[5] Most significantly, on May 8, 2025, it was reported that the ERA "is fully ratified and was recognized by a US President as the law of the land," though it "has yet to be officially published."[3]

Prior to leaving office on January 20, 2025, President Biden recognized the ERA as the law of the land[3], though this presidential recognition alone does not complete the constitutional process. The formal certification by the National Archivist remains the final step needed for official incorporation into the Constitution.

## Legal and Institutional Developments

Several key developments suggest momentum toward certification:

1. **American Bar Association Support**: On August 6, 2024, the American Bar Association passed a resolution declaring the ERA ratified as the 28th Amendment to the Constitution[5], providing significant institutional legal backing.

2. **Congressional Recognition**: There appears to be movement in the 119th Congress (2025-2026) regarding the ERA, with Senate Joint Resolution 38 stating that "The article of amendment proposed to the States in that joint resolution is valid to all intents and purposes as part of the Constitution."[2]

3. **Advocacy Pressure**: Various organizations have been calling for the publication and certification of the ERA, including a December 2024 statement urging certification before President Biden left office.[1]

## Unique Constitutional Circumstances

The ERA presents unprecedented constitutional circumstances. It is "the only proposed constitutional amendment to achieve approval by 38 states after the expiration of a ratification deadline set and extended by Congress."[5] This unique situation has created legal uncertainty about the amendment's status.

According to established procedure, "when NARA receives notice of at least 38 state approvals, the U.S. Archivist publishes the amendment, with a certification of the ratification documents and a list of the ratifying states. The Archivist's certification is final and conclusive, and the amendment is part of the Constitution as of the date of the 38th state approval."[5]

## Forecast Assessment

Given these factors, what is the likelihood of certification by June 30, 2025?

**Factors supporting certification within the timeframe:**
- The ERA has achieved the constitutional threshold of state ratifications
- Growing institutional support from legal organizations
- Congressional recognition in the current session
- Presidential recognition (albeit from the previous administration)

**Factors against certification within the timeframe:**
- The ERA has not been certified despite presidential recognition earlier in 2025
- The unprecedented nature of ratification after deadline expiration creates legal uncertainty
- Potential political considerations in the current administration

Based on the available evidence, certification by June 30, 2025 remains possible but uncertain. The most telling indicator is that despite presidential recognition earlier this year, the National Archivist has not yet proceeded with certification as of May 8, 2025[3]. With approximately one month remaining until the June 30 deadline, the certification would need to occur relatively soon.

The probability appears moderately low to medium, given that the political will expressed by the previous administration has not translated into action by the National Archivist in the months since the presidential transition, despite the legal arguments for certification being established.
