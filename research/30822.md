Based on the available information as of May 26, 2025, significant steps have already been taken toward eliminating the Department of Education, though the final outcome remains uncertain.

## Current Status of Department of Education Elimination Efforts

President Trump signed an Executive Order on March 20, 2025, directing the Secretary of Education, Linda McMahon, to "take all necessary steps to facilitate the closure of the Department of Education and return education authority to the States."[1][2] This represents a concrete action toward the goal of eliminating the department, moving beyond campaign promises to actual policy implementation.

Following this Executive Order, the Department of Education initiated a substantial reduction in force (RIF) on March 11, 2025, which impacted nearly 50% of the department's workforce.[3] Prior to this action, the Department employed 4,133 workers; after the reduction, the workforce was reduced to approximately 2,183 employees.[3] This included 259 employees who accepted a Deferred Resignation Program and 313 who accepted Voluntary Separation Incentive Payments.[3]

## Historical Context and Legislative Requirements

Despite these executive actions, it's important to note that completely eliminating the Department of Education requires congressional approval. As stated by Fred L. Pincus, emeritus professor of sociology at UMBC, "The president needs congressional approval to shutter the department."[4] This is because the Department was created through the Department of Education Organization Act of 1979, and its dissolution would typically require legislative action.

The current efforts to eliminate the Department of Education align with longstanding conservative policy goals. The Heritage Foundation has advocated for limiting the federal role in education since 1981, and the current Executive Order reflects many recommendations from their Project 2025 initiative.[4] The political climate in 2025 appears more favorable to these efforts than previous attempts over the past four decades.

## Key Factors Affecting the Forecast

Several factors will influence whether the Department of Education is eliminated before 2026:

**Congressional Support**: The primary determinant will be whether Congress passes legislation to formalize the elimination of the department. This depends on the political composition of Congress and the prioritization of this issue among legislators.

**Administrative Groundwork**: The Trump administration has already laid significant groundwork through the Executive Order and workforce reduction. Secretary McMahon has explicitly stated that they are "going to follow the law and eliminate the bureaucracy responsibly by working through Congress to ensure a lawful and orderly transition."[1]

**Program Continuity Plans**: The administration has emphasized that eliminating the department does not mean eliminating all its functions. According to Secretary McMahon, "Closing the Department does not mean cutting off funds from those who depend on themâ€”we will continue to support K-12 students, students with special needs, college student borrowers, and others who rely on essential programs."[1] This approach of transferring functions rather than eliminating them entirely may reduce opposition.

## Probabilistic Assessment

Based on the available evidence, there is a moderate to high probability that the Department of Education will be eliminated through law or presidential reorganization before 2026. The following factors support this assessment:

1. Concrete executive actions have already been taken, including a major workforce reduction and an Executive Order directing the closure process.

2. The administration has articulated a specific plan for transferring functions while eliminating the bureaucratic structure, which may make the proposal more politically viable.

3. The administration has explicitly acknowledged the need for congressional action and appears to be actively working toward that goal.

However, significant obstacles remain:

1. Congressional approval is required, which depends on political dynamics that could change.

2. The process of transferring all departmental functions to states or other federal entities is complex and time-consuming.

Given the current trajectory and the steps already taken, there appears to be a strong commitment from the administration to achieve this goal within the specified timeframe, but ultimate success will depend on congressional action in the coming months.
