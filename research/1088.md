## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- **Species Longevity:** Homo sapiens have existed for roughly 300,000 years. Other Homo species—like Neanderthals and Homo erectus—typically persisted for 500,000–1,000,000 years before going extinct or evolving into successor species[2][5].
- **Speciation Rate:** Human evolution is slow under natural conditions. Speciation in mammals often takes hundreds of thousands to millions of years. However, hybridization has occurred between Homo sapiens and other hominins (e.g., Neanderthals), showing that the biological species boundary can be fuzzy and that "species" is a complicated concept[3].
- **Extinction Events:** The fossil record shows that species extinction is common. The average lifespan of a mammalian species is about 1 million years, though there is wide variation.

## 2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- **Genetic Engineering:** As of 2018, advancements in genome editing (e.g., CRISPR) have made it plausible that humans could alter their own genome, potentially accelerating divergence or preventing natural speciation.
- **Global Risks:** Increasing awareness of existential risks—such as nuclear war, engineered pandemics, and climate change—has prompted international policy responses, but as of 2018, no global framework robustly guarantees long-term human survival.
- **Population Trends:** Human population as of 2018 was over 7.5 billion, with no immediate threat of extinction from demographic collapse.

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- **Berkeley’s definition:** A species is defined as a group that can interbreed in nature[3].
- **Biological records:** Homo sapiens are the only extant members of genus Homo[2][5].
- **Science News and Scientific American:** Explore the complexity of defining species and possible human evolutionary futures.

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- **Definition of Species:** As noted, the species concept is not clear-cut, especially in the face of potential future genetic manipulation or hybridization[3].
- **Future Uncertainty:** Unknown technological, environmental, or social shocks could drastically shorten or extend human species longevity.
- **Measurement Precision:** Since this is a forecast, it is subject to deep uncertainty and can only be probabilistic.

## 5. Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

- **Reference Case:** If humans follow the median mammalian species lifespan, the last human would be born 700,000 years from the species' origin. Subtracting 300,000 years of current existence suggests ~400,000 more years.
- **Key Differences:** Human technology may extend or shorten this period. Genetic engineering could either preserve Homo sapiens indefinitely or accelerate divergence. Existential risks (climate, nuclear, AI) could truncate the species in centuries or millennia rather than hundreds of thousands of years.
- **Probabilistic Range:** Given these factors, as of late 2018, the last human birth is most likely to occur hundreds of thousands of years in the future, but there is a non-negligible probability (e.g., 5–20%) of extinction or speciation within the next few millennia due to novel risks.

### Summary Table

| Reference Case       | Years from 2018 (approximate) |
|----------------------|-------------------------------|
| Median mammal species| 700,000 (species age) - 300,000 (already elapsed) = 400,000 |
| Upper bound (million years) | 1,000,000 - 300,000 = 700,000 |
| Catastrophic scenario| 100–10,000                    |

**Best estimate:** The most probable window for the last human birth (under current knowledge as of 2018) is between 10,000 and 700,000 years from 2018, with the highest probability density between 100,000 and 500,000 years, but with fat tails on both sides for abrupt extinction or indefinite continuation.
