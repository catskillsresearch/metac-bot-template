### 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- In 2011, only 29.7% of Nigerians had a bank account. This rose to 39.7% in 2017.
- As of 2020, formal financial inclusion (adults with accounts at banks or regulated institutions) reached 56%[4].
- By 2023, formal financial inclusion climbed to 64% and overall financial inclusion (including non-bank digital services) reached 74%[1][3][4][5].
- Despite marked improvement, about 28.8 million adult Nigerians remained financially excluded as of late 2023[5].

### 2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- In July 2019, the Central Bank of Nigeria set a public goal of achieving 95% financial inclusion by 2024[1][5].
- Regulatory support for non-bank-led financial services, fintechs, and digital payments has accelerated inclusion, especially through mobile money agents and payment platforms[1][3].
- However, progress is slowing, and recent reports call for more intentional efforts to reach excluded groups, especially women, youth, rural residents, and the North[1][2][5].

### 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Enhancing Financial Innovation & Access (EFInA) Access to Finance Surveys (2023)[1][5]
- Central Bank of Nigeria reports[1][5]
- The World Bank global financial inclusion datasets

### 4. Limitations or Uncertainties in Measurement

- The 74% overall inclusion figure includes non-bank digital accounts; formal bank (and regulated financial institution) accounts are at 64%[1][4][5].
- The forecast’s resolution depends on whether non-bank digital accounts are included under “accounts at a bank or financial institution”; strict reading may exclude some mobile money accounts.
- Regional, gender, and income disparities persist, limiting the speed of further gains[1][2][5].

### Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the trajectory (56% in 2020, 64% in 2023 for formal accounts), and that the overall inclusion rate (including non-banks) is still only 74%, it is highly unlikely—barring sudden, transformative change—that Nigeria will reach 95% of adults with a bank or regulated financial institution account before 2025. The probability of achieving this target is extremely low, likely below 5%.
