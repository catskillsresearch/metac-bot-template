### 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- In 2017, 39.7% of Nigerian adults had a bank account, rising from 29.7% in 2011.
- By 2023, **formal financial inclusion** (adults with accounts at regulated banks and similar financial institutions) increased to 64%[1][2].
- **Overall financial inclusion**, which includes non-bank financial service providers (e.g., mobile money), reached 74% in 2023[3][5].
- Growth rates: From 2020 to 2023, formal financial inclusion rose from 56% to 64% (about 2.67% per year), and overall inclusion rose from 68% to 74%[2][5].

### 2. Recent Announcements/Policies

- In 2019, the Central Bank of Nigeria set an ambitious goal of 95% financial inclusion by 2024[1].
- Policy focus has included enabling non-bank-led approaches, encouraging fintechs and mobile money agents to expand access, especially in underserved areas[1].
- Despite these efforts, EFInA’s 2023 report concludes that the 95% target is far from being met and that more work is needed to serve excluded populations[1][5].

### 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Enhancing Financial Innovation & Access (EFInA), with support from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the National Bureau of Statistics, provides the leading household survey on financial inclusion in Nigeria[1][5].
- The Central Bank of Nigeria and the World Bank can also offer verification, but EFInA’s 2023 survey is the most up-to-date and widely cited[1][5].

### 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- Survey data may undercount or overcount some forms of financial access, but the gap to 95% is so large that measurement error is immaterial for this forecast.
- The definition of “account” includes non-bank channels in some statistics, but the 95% target was for formal financial inclusion (bank or regulated financial institution accounts)[1].
- Persistent barriers—poverty, low income, rural exclusion, and regional disparities—continue to hamper last-mile progress[1][5].

### Probabilistic Assessment

Given the current growth rates, the gap to 95% is too large to close by 2025. The probability that 95% or more of Nigerians aged 18+ will have a bank account before January 1, 2025, is virtually zero.

> "Despite the improvement in access to finance, EFInA said more work needs to be done to achieve the 95 percent long-term inclusion set by CBN in the Nigeria Financial Inclusion Strategy (NFIS) 3.0...the number of persons excluded financially is unacceptable even though there has been 'encouraging progress'..."[5]

**Conclusion:**  
It is overwhelmingly likely that the answer to the question is "No"—95% or more of Nigerians will not have a bank account before 2025.
