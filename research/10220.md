### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Formal financial inclusion in Nigeria—defined as the share of adults with accounts at banks or formal financial institutions—rose from 56% in 2020 to 64% in 2023[1][2].
- Broader financial inclusion, which may include mobile money and non-bank channels, was reported at 74% in 2023, up from 68% in 2020[3][5].
- Despite this progress, approximately 40 million adult Nigerians remain formally excluded from the financial system as of 2023[1][5].

### Recent Announcements and Policies

- The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) set an ambitious target in 2019 to achieve 95% financial inclusion by 2024, driven by regulatory reforms, expanded agent banking, and encouragement of non-bank service providers[1][5].
- Growth has been attributed to the expansion of fintech and mobile money agents, but formal bank account growth remains slower than needed to meet the target[1][2].

### Key Differences Affecting the Forecast

- **Pace of Growth**: From 2020 to 2023, formal inclusion grew by 8 percentage points, and overall inclusion by 6 percentage points[2][5]. Achieving a further 31 percentage point increase in less than two years would require an unprecedented acceleration.
- **Structural Barriers**: Financial exclusion remains highest among rural populations, women, youth, and especially in the northern regions of Nigeria. Nearly half of excluded adults cite lack of income as a barrier[1][5].
- **Definition of Inclusion**: Even with the inclusion of mobile money and non-bank channels, the 2023 rate of 74% is far short of the 95% target[3][5].

### Probabilistic Assessment

Given the latest available data and the historical pace of progress, it is highly improbable that 95% or more of Nigerians aged 18 or older had a bank or formal financial institution account by the start of 2025. No data or credible projections suggest a sudden surge of more than 20 percentage points within a single year. The most authoritative surveys (EFInA, NBS) and reports published as of late 2023 confirm both the progress and the significant remaining gap[1][5]. 

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- Definitions of "financial inclusion" can vary; some counts include only formal bank accounts, while others include mobile money and fintech accounts[1][3].
- Survey data may lag by a year or more, and coverage in remote areas can be uneven.
- Unofficial or unreported accounts may not be fully captured, but these are unlikely to close the large remaining gap.

### Conclusion

Based on all available information as of early 2025, the probability that 95% or more of Nigerian adults had a bank or formal financial institution account before 2025 is extremely low.
