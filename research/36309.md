# Analysis of Clean Energy Tax Credits Transferability Forecast

As of April 10, 2025, there is insufficient historical context in the available search results to provide a comprehensive forecast regarding the elimination of transferability for clean energy tax credits. All the search results provided are dated May 22-23, 2025, which falls outside the requested timeframe for this analysis.

## Current Situation (as of May 2025)

Based on information that became available after April 10, 2025, the U.S. House of Representatives passed "The One, Big, Beautiful Bill" (H.R. 1) on May 22, 2025, which contains provisions that would significantly impact clean energy tax credits established by the Inflation Reduction Act[3][5].

The bill includes provisions that would:

1. Terminate the transferability of the Clean Energy Production Credit (Section 45Y) after 2028[3]
2. Effectively repeal the Clean Electricity Investment Credit (Section 48E) for projects that are not already shovel ready[5]
3. Terminate transferability of the Zero-Emission Nuclear Power Production Credit (Section 45U) after 2031[3]

The legislation passed the House by a narrow, party-line vote and is now being considered by the U.S. Senate, where it could change substantially during the reconciliation process[3].

## Key Differences from Reference Cases

Without historical context prior to April 10, 2025, it's not possible to compare the current situation to reference cases or identify key differences affecting the forecast.

## Probabilistic Assessment Limitations

A proper probabilistic assessment cannot be made based solely on information from May 2025, as this falls outside the requested analysis timeframe of "factual information available as of 2025-04-10."

## Important Considerations

If this legislation or similar provisions were to be enacted before January 1, 2026:

1. The Clean Electricity Investment Credit (Section 48E) and Clean Energy Production Credit (Section 45Y) would be significantly restricted, with transferability terminated after 2028[3][5]

2. The Clean Hydrogen Production Tax Credit under IRC 45V would be terminated for facilities that begin construction after December 31, 2025[5]

3. The 45X credit would not apply to wind energy components sold after December 31, 2027, and all other eligible components would be affected after December 31, 2031[5]

## Conclusion

Based on the limited information available within the requested timeframe (as of April 10, 2025), it is not possible to provide a reliable forecast on whether legislation enacted before January 1, 2026, will eliminate the transferability of the specified clean energy tax credits. The information provided in the search results is from May 2025, which falls outside the requested analysis period.

For a more accurate forecast, additional information from before April 10, 2025, would be needed, including any earlier legislative proposals, statements from key lawmakers, or policy analyses regarding potential changes to the transferability provisions of these tax credits.
