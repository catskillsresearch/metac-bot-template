# Spain vs. Eurozone Economic Growth Forecast (Q3 2024-Q3 2025)

Based on the latest economic data and forecasts available as of May 2025, Spain is positioned to continue outpacing Eurozone growth through Q3 2025. The Spanish economy has demonstrated remarkable resilience and momentum compared to its European counterparts.

## Current Economic Status

Spain's economy expanded by 0.6% in Q1 2025, slightly below market expectations of 0.7% but still representing solid growth despite being the weakest in seven quarters[4]. On a year-on-year basis, Spain's GDP rose by 2.8% in Q1 2025[4]. This follows strong performance in 2024, with the economy growing by approximately 3.2%[2].

The International Monetary Fund recently upgraded Spain's 2025 growth forecast to 2.5%, confirming its position as one of the Eurozone's strongest performers[4]. Similarly, the Spanish government has increased its growth projections for 2025 to 2.4%, up 0.2 percentage points from previous estimates[5].

## Growth Comparison with Eurozone

Multiple economic analyses consistently indicate that Spain will continue to grow above the Eurozone average throughout 2025:

- The European Commission projects Spain's economy to expand by 3.0% in 2024 before gradually decelerating to 2.3% in 2025[1]
- BBVA Research forecasts 2.8% growth for Spain in 2025, noting that Spain's GDP is close to regaining its pre-pandemic growth trend, "something that remains out of reach for the eurozone"[3]
- CaixaBank Research states that after growing by 3.2% in 2024, Spain's economy "is expected to continue to grow above the euro area average" in 2025[2]

## Key Growth Drivers

Spain's economic outperformance is supported by several factors:

**Domestic Factors:**
- Strong private consumption and investment, which the Spanish government identifies as the primary drivers of growth in 2025[5]
- Continued job creation, with unemployment expected to gradually decrease to 9.7% by 2026, down from 12.2% in 2023[5]
- Resilient service exports and household consumption[3]

**External Factors:**
- Greater competitiveness relative to Eurozone peers
- Lower oil prices benefiting Spain's energy-dependent economy
- Investment in renewable energy
- Euro depreciation supporting exports
- Lower inflation and interest rates stimulating economic activity[3]

## Potential Risks and Uncertainties

Despite the positive outlook, several factors could impact Spain's relative performance:

- A widespread blackout in early 2025 may weigh on second-quarter growth, potentially shaving up to 0.5 percentage points from GDP, though economists expect much of this impact to be recovered[4]
- Increasing economic policy uncertainty due to lack of consensus at both national and European levels[3]
- Global growth slowdown amid rising uncertainty and protectionism, particularly concerning U.S. trade policy[3]
- An unusually high household savings rate in Spain, which could limit consumer spending[3]
- Investment that has yet to respond fully in line with the pace of growth[3]

## Conclusion

Based on current forecasts and recent economic performance, Spain is highly likely to outgrow the Eurozone between Q3 2024 and Q3 2025. All major economic institutions and the Spanish government project growth rates for Spain that significantly exceed Eurozone averages. The Spanish Economy Minister explicitly stated that "Spain's economy is performing better than those of its eurozone counterparts"[5].

While uncertainties exist, particularly regarding global trade tensions and domestic policy implementation, Spain's economic fundamentals appear strong enough to maintain its growth advantage over the broader Eurozone through Q3 2025.
