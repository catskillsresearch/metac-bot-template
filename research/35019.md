**Key Historical Trends and Current Status**

- Between Q3 2023 and Q3 2024, Spain's real GDP grew by 3.5%, significantly outpacing the Eurozone average of 0.9%[1][2].
- For 2025, Spain's GDP growth is forecast to remain strong, with estimates ranging from 2.6% to 2.8%[1][5]. In contrast, the Eurozone is projected to grow much more modestly, at around 0.9%[2].
- Spain's quarterly GDP growth remains robust (around 0.7% in early 2025), and the country is regaining its pre-pandemic growth trend faster than the Eurozone[5].
- The Eurozone continues to exhibit subdued growth, with the first quarter of 2025 showing a 0.3% increase[3].

**Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric**

- Spain's growth is boosted by increased competitiveness, higher household consumption, resilient service exports, and external tailwinds such as lower oil prices and euro depreciation[5].
- The Eurozone outlook is less optimistic, with growth hampered by broader European uncertainties, weaker investment, and muted fiscal and monetary policy responses[2][4].
- Rising global trade and policy uncertainties could affect both regions, but Spain's domestic momentum currently appears stronger[5].

**Authoritative Sources for Verification**

- Eurostat: Official quarterly GDP data for Spain and the Eurozone.
- European Commission: Spring 2025 Economic Forecast[1][2].
- BBVA Research and CaixaBank Research: In-depth regional analyses[4][5].

**Limitations or Uncertainties in Measurement**

- Eurostat's quarterly GDP releases are the standard for measurement, but provisional figures may be revised.
- If Q3 2025 data is delayed past January 7, 2026, the question is void.
- External shocks (e.g., geopolitical tensions, abrupt policy changes) remain a risk and could affect final outcomes.
- A high household savings rate in Spain and uncertainties in investment responses could modulate Spain's outperformance[5].

**Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment**

Given the historical outperformance, consistent forecast differentials, and Spain's favorable underlying trends, the probability that Spain's GDP growth will exceed the Eurozone's between Q3 2024 and Q3 2025 is high—likely above 80%—barring unforeseen external shocks.
