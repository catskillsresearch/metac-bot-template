# Will China Launch an Antitrust Investigation into Intel Before April 2025?

As of early February 2025, multiple reports indicate that China is considering launching an antitrust investigation into Intel, the US semiconductor giant. This potential probe appears to be part of China's broader response to recently announced US tariffs on Chinese goods. To assess the likelihood of such an investigation being launched before April 2025, we need to examine the current situation, recent precedents, and relevant factors.

## Current Status of Potential Intel Investigation

According to reporting from early February 2025, China's State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) is weighing whether to formally initiate an antitrust investigation into Intel[1][2]. While the consideration of such a probe has been reported by credible sources including the Financial Times, the exact nature and scope of the potential investigation remain unclear[2]. One source indicated that the decision to proceed may depend on the state of US-China relations in the coming weeks[2].

## Recent Precedents: Google and Nvidia Investigations

China has already taken similar actions against other US technology companies:

- In December 2024, Chinese regulators reopened a long-dormant antitrust probe into Google, shortly before former US President Donald Trump took office[1][4]
- On February 4, 2025, Chinese regulators officially revived their antitrust investigation into Google[4]
- In December 2024, China launched an antitrust investigation into Nvidia, examining potential violations related to its 2019 acquisition of Mellanox Technologies[2][4]

These precedents suggest that China is actively using antitrust investigations as a tool in its response to US trade policies.

## Intel's Exposure to the Chinese Market

Intel is particularly vulnerable to Chinese regulatory action due to its significant presence in the country:

- China is Intel's largest market[1]
- Intel has testing and assembly facilities in China[1]
- The company generated 29% of its global revenue in China last year, amounting to approximately $15.5 billion[1]

This substantial market exposure creates significant leverage for Chinese regulators and increases the potential impact of any antitrust action.

## Broader Context: US-China Trade Tensions

The potential Intel investigation is occurring within a context of escalating trade tensions:

- The US recently imposed new tariffs on Chinese goods[1][2]
- China has announced retaliatory tariffs against the US[1]
- Chinese President Xi Jinping is expected to engage in discussions with US officials regarding trade and economic policies[2]

## Factors That May Influence China's Decision

Several factors may influence whether China proceeds with a formal investigation before April 2025:

1. **Diplomatic developments**: The trajectory of US-China relations in February and March 2025 will likely influence the decision[2]
2. **Strategic considerations**: China may be strategically timing its regulatory actions for maximum impact
3. **Precedent of other investigations**: The fact that China has already launched or reopened investigations into Google and Nvidia suggests a pattern that could extend to Intel[1][2][4]

## Assessment

Based on the available information as of February 14, 2025, there are strong indicators that China may launch an antitrust investigation into Intel before April 2025:

- China has already taken similar actions against Google and Nvidia[1][2][4]
- The potential investigation is reportedly being actively considered by Chinese regulators[1][2]
- Intel's significant exposure to the Chinese market makes it a logical target for regulatory action[1]
- The investigation would align with China's broader pattern of retaliatory measures against US trade policies[1][2]

However, the final decision may depend on diplomatic developments and strategic considerations in the coming weeks.
