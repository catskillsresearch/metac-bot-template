## 1. Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of 2018, global economic output (GDP, inflation-adjusted) had doubled roughly every 15–20 years over the previous decades. For example, the world GDP increased more than fivefold between 1960 and 2017, corresponding to an average annual growth rate of 3–4%[1][2].
- In recent years up to 2018, world GDP growth rates were stable, generally between 2% and 4% annually. This level of growth implies a doubling time (using the rule of 70) of about 18–35 years, far longer than 4 years, and vastly longer than 1 year[5].

## 2. Key Differences Affecting the Forecast

- **Historical Precedent:** No period in modern economic history has seen world output double in as little as four years, let alone one. Even the fastest-growing economies or periods (e.g., post-war recoveries, China’s boom years) did not approach these rates at the global level[1][2].
- **Potential for Discontinuity:** The main potential driver for such a shift is transformative technology—most notably, advanced artificial intelligence (AI). As of 2018, there was significant speculation among experts about the possibility of AI triggering very rapid economic growth ("takeoff"), but no consensus or empirical precedent[3].
- **Takeoff Models:** Paul Christiano and others have operationalized "takeoff" speed as whether a 4-year doubling occurs before a 1-year doubling. A "slow takeoff" allows for a 4-year interval before the 1-year interval, while a "fast takeoff" does not (i.e., the 1-year doubling arrives first or simultaneously).
- **Recent Announcements/Policies:** As of 2018, there were no government policies, international agreements, or economic shocks on the horizon that would plausibly propel global GDP growth to the required levels in the immediate term. The only plausible candidate was the speculative possibility of an AI-driven discontinuity.

## 3. Probabilistic Assessment (as of 2018)

- **Base Rate:** Given a base rate of 2–4% growth, the chance of a 4-year doubling (let alone a 1-year doubling) without unprecedented technological change is negligible.
- **Conditional on Transformative AI:** If advanced AI creates a rapid takeoff, theoretical arguments diverge. Some suggest the transition would be abrupt (supporting a "fast takeoff" and thus a 1-year doubling before a 4-year doubling), while others expect a more gradual acceleration ("slow takeoff" with a 4-year doubling first).
- **Best Estimate:** Barring unforeseen breakthroughs, it is extremely unlikely (<<1%) that a 1-year doubling would occur before a 4-year doubling, simply because growth would need to accelerate through intermediate intervals. However, if a discontinuous AI takeoff happens, the probability increases significantly, but still, most models argue the world would experience a 4-year doubling before the first 1-year doubling.

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties

- **GDP Measurement:** Rapid technological change could make GDP measurement less reliable, especially as digital or non-market outputs rise in importance[3].
- **Resolution Ambiguity:** If no 4-year or 1-year doubling occurs by 2050, the question remains ambiguous.
- **Transformative Risks:** Plausible but highly speculative events (major AI breakthroughs, global catastrophes) could dominate the forecast, but their probability is highly uncertain and debated.
