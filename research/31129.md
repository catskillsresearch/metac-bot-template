## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Since the detection of HPAI H5N1 in US commercial poultry in February 2022, the United States has culled over 120 million birds in commercial and backyard flocks, following a strict USDA policy of depopulating all affected and exposed birds to control the spread[2][5].
- Annual depopulation figures since 2022 have each exceeded 50 million birds, as seen in USDA and CDC tracking data, with major cull events continuing into late 2024[2].
- As of May 2025, HPAI remains present in US commercial poultry, wild birds, and has recently spread to other species (notably dairy cows and, in isolated cases, alpacas and cats), but the USDA's primary response for poultry remains rapid depopulation[2][5].

## Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Metric

- In May 2025, the US federal government announced nearly $200 million in new funding to help contain the ongoing H5N1 outbreak, with about $98 million specifically from the USDA aimed at agricultural response[5].
- The USDA continues to mandate depopulation of affected flocks, using established methods such as water-based foam and carbon dioxide gas, with ventilation shutdown as a contingency, and there have been no announced changes to this protocol for 2025[5].
- While H5N1 has spread to dairy cattle, leading to additional biosecurity concerns, the culling policy for poultry remains unchanged, and there is no indication of a shift toward vaccination or a reduction in depopulation intensity[5].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- USDA's Confirmed HPAI Detections table, which logs every confirmed outbreak and the number of birds killed, is the primary source for resolving the 2025 total[2].
- CDC's summary and poultry detection pages, which aggregate USDA data and provide additional situational context[1][2].
- Wikipedia's ongoing summary of the global H5N1 outbreak, including US-specific developments and policy responses[5].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- The main uncertainty is whether the spillover of H5N1 to dairy cows and other non-avian species will increase the frequency or scale of poultry outbreaks, potentially leading to higher culls.
- There is also minor risk of policy change, such as adoption of poultry vaccination or modified depopulation protocols, but as of May 2025, no such changes have been announced[5].
- The final number depends on outbreak frequency and flock size at each outbreak during 2025; large commercial flocks can drive major spikes if affected, as seen in past years[2].
- Data reporting is robust but may lag slightly; final figures are assessed after data reconciliation in early 2026 as per the question's resolution criteria.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

- Given the current epidemiological and policy environment, and referencing depopulation numbers from 2022 through early 2025, it is likely that the number of farmed birds killed in the US due to bird flu in 2025 will fall within the 20 to 60 million range, with a central estimate near recent annual figures (~40–50 million).
- There is a moderate probability of higher numbers (above 50 million) if the spillover into mammals increases poultry outbreak frequency, but there is no current evidence of a dramatic upward shift.
