# Forecasting a US Public Health Emergency Declaration for Marburg Virus Disease

The question of whether the US Department of Health and Human Services will declare a public health emergency for Marburg virus disease before April 1, 2025, requires analysis of current outbreaks, US response patterns, and risk assessment factors.

## Current Marburg Virus Disease Situation

### Rwanda Outbreak (September-December 2024)

Rwanda experienced its first Marburg virus disease outbreak from September to December 2024, which has now concluded:

- The outbreak was officially declared on September 27, 2024[1]
- Final tally: 66 confirmed cases with 15 deaths (23% case fatality rate)[2]
- Most confirmed cases were among healthcare workers from two facilities in Kigali[1]
- The last confirmed case tested negative on November 8, 2024[2]
- The outbreak was officially declared over on December 20, 2024, after the required 42-day monitoring period (twice the maximum incubation period)[2]

During this outbreak, the CDC provided technical assistance and funding to Rwanda's Ministry of Health, including training on case investigation, contact tracing, and infection prevention measures. The CDC also assessed travelers returning from Rwanda for signs of Marburg and provided guidance to US health departments and healthcare providers[1].

### Tanzania Outbreak (January 2025 - Ongoing)

A new Marburg outbreak has been confirmed in Tanzania:

- On January 20, 2025, Tanzania confirmed a Marburg virus disease outbreak in the northwestern Kagera region (Biharamulo district)[4][5]
- One patient has tested positive, with 25 suspected cases under close monitoring[5]
- Eight MVD-related fatalities had been reported as of early January 2025[5]
- The US CDC has issued a Level 1 Travel Health Advisory ("Practice Usual Precautions") for this outbreak[5]

## Vaccine and Treatment Status

- No approved Marburg vaccines exist, though candidates are in clinical trials[5]
- During the Rwanda outbreak, Sabin delivered 700 vaccines (likely experimental) on October 5, 2024, nine days after confirmation of the outbreak[3]

## International Response

The World Health Organization has:
- Provided technical advice to Rwanda and at-risk countries[2]
- Published interim guidance on border health measures for filovirus outbreaks[2]
- Advised against travel or trade restrictions with Rwanda[2]
- Published guidance on risk communication for Marburg outbreaks on December 10, 2024[2]
- Supported surrounding countries in assessing healthcare facility readiness[2]

## Factors Relevant to a US Public Health Emergency Declaration

Several factors may influence whether the US declares a public health emergency:

1. **Geographic spread**: The Tanzania outbreak is new and its containment status remains uncertain, while the Rwanda outbreak has been successfully contained.

2. **US risk assessment**: During the Rwanda outbreak, the CDC implemented monitoring of travelers returning from affected areas but did not escalate to a public health emergency declaration.

3. **Precedent**: The US response to the Rwanda outbreak (technical assistance and travel monitoring) suggests that the threshold for declaring a public health emergency for Marburg may be higher than what was observed in that outbreak.

4. **Current containment efforts**: Tanzania's president has expressed confidence in containing the outbreak, stating: "We have demonstrated our ability to contain similar (MVD) outbreaks and are determined to do the same this time."[5]

5. **Case numbers and spread**: The Tanzania outbreak currently has only one confirmed case, though with 25 suspected cases under monitoring and eight reported fatalities.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- The Tanzania outbreak is in its early stages, and the situation could evolve rapidly
- Limited information is available about potential spread beyond the initially reported region
- The effectiveness of containment measures in Tanzania remains to be seen
- The search results do not indicate any current discussions within HHS about a potential emergency declaration

Based on the available information, while the Tanzania outbreak bears watching, the current US response appears to be focused on monitoring rather than emergency declaration. However, significant expansion of cases, evidence of spread to additional countries, or cases detected in the US could change this assessment.
