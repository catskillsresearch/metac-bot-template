## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Since Russia’s 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the risk of a Russian attack on NATO has been taken more seriously by Western analysts and policymakers. However, as of May 2025, there has been no Russian attack or incursion involving 1,000+ Russian troops into any NATO member state[1][5].
- Russia’s military has suffered substantial losses in Ukraine. By June 2024, over 700,000 Russian soldiers were reported deployed to Ukraine, straining Russia’s capacity for large-scale new offensives elsewhere[1].
- Russia continues to frame NATO’s eastern expansion as a security threat, but concrete steps toward Ukrainian NATO membership have been limited, with even Russian admissions that the U.S. offered to delay Ukraine’s accession for at least a decade[1].
- NATO has increased its military presence along its eastern flank since 2022, with 34,200 troops deployed from Finland to Turkey as a deterrent, and a notable focus on modernizing forces and permanent stationing of units[1][5].
- NATO’s official doctrine as of 2022 classifies Russia as the “most significant and direct threat” to Alliance security, prompting further defensive and deterrence investments[5].

## Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- Russia and Belarus scaled back their Zapad-2025 military exercises, possibly reflecting logistical or operational constraints[1].
- Russian government rhetoric remains aggressive, but there have been no formal threats or mobilizations against NATO members beyond increased border activity and information operations[1][5].
- NATO’s response since 2022 has included permanent deployments and substantial increases in defense budgets, especially by frontline states[5].
- As of May 2025, Russian defense spending is consuming about 40% of the federal budget, reflecting war priorities but also long-term sustainability concerns[4].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Institute for the Study of War (ISW) provides regular Russian campaign assessments[1].
- Atlantic Council and NATO official publications outline alliance strategy and posture[5].
- Major news outlets (New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Washington Post) would serve as adjudicators for bet resolution per Caplan’s criteria.

## Key Differences Affecting the Forecast

- Compared to 2015 (when the bet was made), NATO has greatly increased force presence and readiness on its eastern flank, specifically to deter Russia[1][5].
- Russia’s military is far more committed and attrited by the Ukraine war than in 2015, reducing its available capacity for a new, large-scale NATO confrontation[1][4].
- NATO is more unified in its messaging and has better military posture than during earlier crises, such as the 2008 Georgia or 2014 Crimea incidents[5].
- Escalation risks remain through hybrid or unconventional means, but the bet’s resolution criteria require a large and unambiguous conventional incursion, not just subversion or cyber attacks.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- Leadership changes in Russia or NATO countries could alter risk calculations.
- Prolonged war in Ukraine or sudden Russian collapse could produce unpredictable outcomes.
- Russian doctrine has become more aggressive rhetorically, but actual use of force against NATO remains a very high-risk option for Moscow due to near-certain alliance retaliation[1][5].
- The probability of miscalculation or accidental escalation, while nonzero, is not favored by current policy or military trends.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

Given the above, the probability that Bryan Caplan will win his bet—that is, Russia will NOT invade a NATO member with at least 1,000 troops by June 10, 2040—remains high. The reference case since 1949 is zero Russian/Soviet invasions of NATO state territory, and current deterrence and Russian constraints make the next 15 years still unlikely to break this pattern.

A reasonable forecast as of May 2025 would assign a probability of 85–95% that Caplan wins, with the main risks stemming from unforeseeable political shocks rather than current trend lines.
