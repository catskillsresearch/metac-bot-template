## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- In the past four years, franchise films have topped the global box office three times, demonstrating a strong trend toward established series outperforming standalone films[5].
- As of May 2025, the highest-grossing film worldwide is Ne Zha 2, with a gross of over $1.8 billion[1][2][5]. Ne Zha 2 is a direct sequel to the 2019 animated film Ne Zha, making it part of a franchise.
- Other leading films in 2025, such as A Minecraft Movie and Captain America: Brave New World, are also franchise entries[1][2][3].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- No major industry announcements or policy changes have been reported that would alter the dominance of franchise films at the box office in 2025.
- The release calendar for the remainder of 2025 includes several high-profile franchise films, but none have been announced that are likely to surpass Ne Zha 2’s current gross[2].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Box Office Mojo and The Numbers provide real-time, authoritative box office data for 2025[1][3].
- Wikipedia’s 2025 in film page aggregates box office rankings and franchise status[2].
- Industry analyses, such as those from The Indian Express, confirm the ongoing dominance of franchise films globally[5].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- There is always a possibility that a late-year release could outperform current leaders, but the significant revenue lead of Ne Zha 2 makes this unlikely.
- Box office data may be updated as films continue their theatrical runs, but the trend strongly favors franchise films.

## Conclusion

Based on current data and historical trends, the highest-grossing film of 2025 is almost certain to be part of a franchise, with Ne Zha 2 currently holding a commanding lead. Unless an unexpected non-franchise film emerges and surpasses it by year’s end, the answer is **Yes**.
