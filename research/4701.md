**Key Historical Trends and Current Status**

- In 2018, there were just over 1 million fully electric vehicles (EVs) on US roads out of 273.6 million registered vehicles, equating to an EV fleet share of about 0.36%[5].
- Early projections (e.g., Edison Electric Institute, 2018) anticipated rapid growth, with expectations for the EV stock to reach 18.7 million by 2030, or about 7% of the total vehicle fleet if the total size remains similar[5].
- The average age of vehicles in the US is high (~12 years), so it takes many years for new vehicle sales trends to shift the overall fleet composition.

**Recent Announcements and Policy Changes Affecting the Metric**

- Since 2020, federal and state governments have significantly increased EV incentives, introduced stricter emissions regulations, and invested in charging infrastructure, all boosting the long-term outlook for EV adoption.
- Recent forecasts from EEI (2024) now project annual EV sales to reach 7.7 million in 2030 (46% of new light-duty vehicle sales), and a total EV stock of 78.5 million by 2035, or about 26% of the fleet[5].
- J.D. Power and other analysts project that EVs will account for 36% of new vehicle sales by 2030, but due to the slow turnover of the fleet, the overall fleet percentage will be much lower[2].

**Authoritative Sources for Verification**

- The Edison Electric Institute (EEI) provides detailed forecasts for EV sales and fleet composition[5].
- Statista and similar industry data sources track historical and projected vehicle registrations and fleet sizes[4].
- J.D. Power and BloombergNEF provide independent market forecasts[2][1].

**Limitations and Uncertainties**

- The primary limitation is the slow rate of fleet turnover; even high annual sales shares translate to modest growth in fleet share.
- Projections are sensitive to supply chain stability, consumer acceptance, charging infrastructure deployment, and future policy changes.
- The COVID-19 pandemic caused a temporary disruption in battery supply chains in 2020, but this appears to have been largely overcome in subsequent years.

**Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment for 2030**

Combining historical trends, updated forecasts, and current policy and market context, the most authoritative sources as of 2024 project that fully electric vehicles will comprise approximately 7–10% of all vehicles on US roads in 2030, with a central estimate around 7–8%[5][2].

> The best-supported forecast is that fully electric vehicles will make up about 7–8% of the US vehicle fleet in 2030, barring major unforeseen policy or technological changes.
