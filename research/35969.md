## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Since the escalation in February 2022, peace negotiations between Russia and Ukraine have repeatedly failed due to fundamental disagreements over territorial control, NATO membership, and security guarantees[3].
- Early talks in Belarus and Turkey in 2022 produced no lasting results. A near-agreement in Turkey was derailed by disputes over security guarantees and the aftermath of the Bucha massacre[3].
- In 2025, renewed negotiations began after Donald Trump became U.S. president. Trump has taken a direct role, proposing a 30-day unconditional ceasefire and threatening additional sanctions to pressure both sides[1][5].
- Recent talks in Saudi Arabia (March 2025) resulted in Ukraine agreeing to a U.S.-proposed 30-day ceasefire, with Russia expressing conditional support but citing unresolved issues[3][1].
- Despite these developments, Russia is reportedly preparing for a major summer offensive, indicating that large-scale hostilities may continue in the near term[2].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- President Trump publicly proposed a 30-day unconditional ceasefire in early May 2025 and is pressuring both sides to accept, with the White House suggesting a deal is in its final stages[1][5].
- Ukraine has signaled willingness to accept the U.S. proposal, but Russia’s formal agreement is still pending, with President Putin stating that “outstanding questions” remain[1][3].
- Some limited local truces have been agreed upon since March 2025, but no comprehensive bilateral ceasefire covering all official and disputed territories has yet gone into effect[3].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Major international news outlets (e.g., Politico, Foreign Policy, Atlantic Council) and official government statements are tracking the status of negotiations and any formal ceasefire announcements[1][2][3][5].
- The resolution of this metric will depend on credible international reporting confirming the date a bilateral ceasefire or peace agreement officially enters into effect.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- The main uncertainty is whether Russia will formally agree to the proposed ceasefire terms and whether both sides will implement a comprehensive halt to offensive operations before the end of 2025.
- Russia’s preparations for a summer offensive suggest that hostilities may escalate before any ceasefire is implemented[2].
- Even if a ceasefire is agreed upon, its durability and legal standing are in question, with some analysts warning that any deal reached under current conditions may be “null and void” or quickly violated[5].
- The question will resolve as “Not before 2026” if no bilateral ceasefire goes into effect before January 1, 2026.

## Summary Forecast

As of early May 2025, a bilateral ceasefire or peace agreement in the Russo-Ukraine conflict has not yet gone into effect. Negotiations are at an advanced stage, with the U.S. and Ukraine supporting a 30-day ceasefire proposal and Russia expressing conditional support. However, significant obstacles remain, and the risk of renewed large-scale fighting persists. The most likely forecast is that a bilateral ceasefire could go into effect in the second half of 2025, but there is a substantial possibility that no such agreement will be implemented before 2026[1][2][3][5].
