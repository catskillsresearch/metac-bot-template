## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- As of mid-September 2024, the US national average retail price of regular gasoline has dropped sharply, falling about 13% from its 2024 peak in Aprilâ€”a decline of nearly 50 cents per gallon according to AAA data[5].
- In recent weeks, the national average has hovered around $3.50 per gallon[4][5].
- Over Labor Day weekend (late August/early September), the national average was $3.50, down from $3.81 the previous year[4].
- In April 2024, the national average was $3.62, with AAA anticipating at that time that prices would continue to rise, but subsequent data shows a reversal and decline[1][5].

## Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Metric

- AAA has noted that gas prices have remained steady or declined due to lower demand post-pandemic and no major supply disruptions so far in 2024[4].
- Experts attribute the recent price drop to a "confluence of economic factors" rather than direct government intervention, with the market achieving a better balance after disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war[5].
- AAA warns that hurricanes hitting the Gulf Coast and affecting regional refineries could still cause prices to rise as the peak of hurricane season approaches in September[4].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The AAA National Average Gas Prices page is the official source for the metric in question and will provide the "Yesterday Avg." for regular gas on October 1, 2024, which will be used for resolution.
- Additional data and analysis are available from the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) and major financial news outlets[2][1].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- Gas prices are historically volatile in September due to hurricane risks and potential refinery disruptions, which can cause sudden spikes[4].
- While the trend is downward, a late-September supply shock could push prices above $3.40.
- Demand remains lower than pre-pandemic levels, which has helped keep prices from spiking, but this could change if economic activity increases or supply is disrupted[4][5].

## Summary Forecast

As of September 17, 2024, the national average is around $3.50 and trending downward, with no major supply shocks reported. If current trends continue, the price is likely to be near or slightly below $3.40 by September 30, 2024. However, the risk of late-season hurricanes or refinery issues could push the price above $3.40. The outcome will depend on whether such disruptions occur in the final weeks of September.
