## Key Factual Information for Forecasting

**1. Historical Trends and Current Status**
- Tadej Pogačar and Jonas Vingegaard have dominated the Tour de France in recent years. Pogačar won in 2020 and 2021, while Vingegaard claimed victory in 2022 and 2023[5].
- Both riders entered the 2024 Tour as the clear favorites, with bookmakers and analysts placing them at the top of the odds[5].
- Vingegaard suffered a serious crash in April 2024 and did not race again until the Tour, raising questions about his form. However, by Stage 11, he had made a "major statement" and was seen as a strong contender despite being behind Pogačar in the standings[3].
- Pogačar is in exceptional form, having won the 2024 Giro d’Italia and aiming for a rare Giro-Tour double, a feat last achieved in 1998[4].

**2. Strength of Rivals**
- The 2024 Tour features an unusually strong field, with all four of the world’s top general classification (GC) riders present: Pogačar, Vingegaard, Primož Roglič, and Remco Evenepoel[2][5].
- Primož Roglič, a former Grand Tour winner, recently won the Critérium du Dauphiné, indicating strong form and positioning him as a serious contender[4].
- Remco Evenepoel, making his Tour debut, is a world-class time trialist and has recovered from injury setbacks. The 2024 route includes a decisive time trial, which could play to his strengths[4].
- Experts note that while Pogačar and Vingegaard are the favorites, Roglič and Evenepoel are considered the main threats who could potentially win if circumstances align[5].

**3. Team Support and Course Factors**
- Both Pogačar and Vingegaard have strong team support, but the 2024 route is unique, featuring gravel stages and a time-trial finish, which could introduce unpredictability[2].
- The presence of multiple top-tier rivals and the challenging course design increase the likelihood of surprises, especially if the favorites encounter difficulties[2].

**4. Limitations and Uncertainties**
- Cycling is inherently unpredictable. Crashes, illness, tactical errors, or other unforeseen events can dramatically alter the outcome, as seen in previous editions[2][5].
- Vingegaard’s recovery from injury and Pogačar’s attempt at the Giro-Tour double introduce additional variables regarding their endurance and resilience over three weeks[4][5].

## Conclusion

As of July 10, 2024, all available evidence indicates that Tadej Pogačar and Jonas Vingegaard are the overwhelming favorites to win the Tour de France 2024. However, Primož Roglič and Remco Evenepoel are credible challengers, and the unique course and unpredictable nature of the race mean an upset cannot be ruled out. The probability of "Other" winning is low but not zero, especially given the strength of the field and the uncertainties inherent in Grand Tour racing.
