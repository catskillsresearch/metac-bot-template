### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- In 2021, Próspera had only three buildings, no permanent residents, about 30 people living there temporarily, 20 soft commitments, and roughly 600 interested parties[3][5].
- By 2024, Próspera's population was reported at approximately 2,000 people, indicating significant but not explosive growth in its first few years[1].
- The project is built on ZEDE legal status, allowing for substantial autonomy, potential land expansion, and a business-friendly environment[1][4].
- Próspera is financed by major venture capital sources and has attracted tech investment, luxury tourism facilities, and crypto-oriented infrastructure[4].

### Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- Próspera faces mounting local opposition, legal challenges, and political uncertainty regarding the ZEDE law’s future in Honduras[2][4].
- The legal battle with the Honduran state, if it results in repeal or curtailment of ZEDE status, could threaten Próspera’s existence or limit its growth[2][4].
- The project continues to promote itself to both local Hondurans and international professionals, aiming to increase population via pro-market, low-regulation policies[4].

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Official population data will be from Próspera itself as per the resolution criteria. As of 2024, Wikipedia cites 2,000 residents[1]; other sources confirm ongoing rapid expansion[4].
- Metaculus and major news outlets continue to monitor the project's legal and demographic situation[3][5].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- Próspera’s population in 2035 is highly sensitive to political and legal developments. If ZEDE laws are repealed or Próspera is dissolved, the population will be 0 by definition.
- If Próspera continues on its current trajectory, moderate growth rates (e.g., 15-20% per year) from 2024’s base could yield a population between 7,000 and 15,000 by 2035.
- Significant downside risk remains due to legal and local opposition, as well as the possibility of data ambiguity if citizenship numbers are not transparently published.

### Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

- Probability Próspera exists and population is published in 2035: ~70%
- Probability population is 0 due to dissolution: ~20%
- Probability data is ambiguous/unavailable: ~10%
- If Próspera exists and growth continues: Median forecast for 2035 population = ~10,000 (80% confidence interval: 4,500–20,000).
