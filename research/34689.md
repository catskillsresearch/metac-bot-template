### Key Factual Information for Forecasting the January 2025 US BLS Coffee Price

**1. Historical Trends and Current Status**
- The US BLS reported the price of coffee (100%, ground roast, all sizes, per lb) as 6.776 for December 2024.
- Over the past year, coffee prices have shown volatility but generally stabilized, with some recent months showing negative or modest growth rates. For example, in late 2023 and early 2024, monthly changes ranged from -2.8% to +1.8%, indicating a period of relative price stability or slight decline[1].
- Over the longer term, coffee prices in April 2024 were 26.5% higher than in April 2010, but the recent trend is not strongly upward[1].

**2. Recent Announcements and Policies**
- Global coffee prices are experiencing a significant drop entering 2025, driven by:
  - Overproduction in major exporting countries (notably Brazil and Vietnam) due to favorable weather and improved agricultural techniques.
  - Economic slowdowns in key importing economies, reducing demand.
  - Shifts in consumer preferences toward alternatives like tea and plant-based beverages.
  - Technological advancements lowering production costs[3].
- These factors suggest continued or increased downward pressure on coffee prices in early 2025.

**3. Authoritative Sources for Verification**
- The US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) is the official source for the reported price, specifically at their "Average Price Data" page for coffee[1][2].

**4. Limitations and Uncertainties**
- The BLS price reflects US retail market conditions, which may not immediately mirror global commodity price changes.
- The January 2025 value is not available as of the knowledge cutoff; the forecast must rely on recent trends and global market signals.
- Future revisions to BLS data are possible, but the question resolves based on the initial reported figure.

**Summary of Forecasting Factors**
- The December 2024 price was 6.776.
- Recent months have shown stabilization or slight declines in price.
- Global oversupply and weakening demand are likely to continue exerting downward pressure.
- It is reasonable to expect the January 2025 price to be at or slightly below the December 2024 value, within the range of recent monthly changes.
