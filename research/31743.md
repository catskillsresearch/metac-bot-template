## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- **February is typically one of the rainiest months in Brasília.** Long-term climatological data show average rainfall for February ranging from about 121 mm to 217 mm:
  - Weather Atlas reports a recent February average of 121–145 mm[2].
  - Weatherspark and Avionero list averages around 178–197 mm, with 17–19 rainy days per month.
  - Weather2Travel, using data from the University of East Anglia, Met Office, and Netherlands Meteorological Institute, reports an average of 217 mm and 23 days with some rain in February for Brasília[5].

- **Recent anomalies:** Brasília experienced a record-breaking drought in 2024, with 167 consecutive days without rain, and September 2024 was the hottest on record for the region. These conditions led to increased wildfires and are part of a broader trend of extreme weather, with 2024 expected to be among the top five hottest years on record.

## Recent Announcements or Policies Affecting the Metric

- There are no reported new policies or interventions that would directly affect rainfall amounts in early 2025. The primary drivers remain natural climate variability and broader climate change trends.

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The official measurement for this question is the cumulative rainfall (*Chuva*, in mm) recorded at the INMET weather station [83377] BRASILIA - DF. This data can be accessed via the INMET weather station map and is the definitive source for February 2025 precipitation totals.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- **Year-to-year variability:** While climatological averages provide a baseline, actual rainfall in any given February can deviate significantly due to weather patterns, including the potential influence of El Niño or La Niña events.
- **Recent drought and heat:** The extreme drought and heat of 2024 may influence soil moisture and atmospheric conditions, but there is no direct evidence or forecast indicating whether this will suppress or enhance rainfall in February 2025.
- **Forecast uncertainty:** No specific, authoritative forecast for February 2025 rainfall in Brasília is available as of January 21, 2025. All estimates are based on historical averages and recent trends.

## Conclusion

Based on historical data, Brasília typically receives between 121 mm and 217 mm of rain in February, with most sources clustering around 178–217 mm and 17–23 rainy days. However, the recent record drought and heat in 2024 introduce some uncertainty, and actual rainfall in February 2025 could deviate from these averages. The definitive measurement will be the cumulative rainfall recorded at the INMET [83377] BRASILIA - DF station.
