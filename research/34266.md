## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The first Scottish independence referendum was held in 2014, with 55% voting "No" to independence and 45% voting "Yes"[1][4].
- Since then, the Scottish National Party (SNP) has maintained a commitment to pursuing a second referendum, especially after the UK’s exit from the European Union (Brexit)[3].
- The legal authority to hold a referendum is disputed: the UK government asserts that it is a reserved matter requiring Westminster approval (via a Section 30 order), while the Scottish government argues for its own competence or political legitimacy to call a vote[2][3].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- As of June 2022, then-First Minister Nicola Sturgeon outlined a "route map" to a second referendum, including seeking a Section 30 order and, failing that, considering a general election as a "de facto" referendum[2].
- The UK government has consistently refused to grant a Section 30 order for a second referendum, maintaining that the 2014 vote was a "once in a generation" event[2][3].
- There is no evidence from authoritative sources up to January 29, 2025, that the Scottish government has officially announced a date for a second independence referendum.
- Public opinion has remained relatively stable, with support for independence fluctuating but not leading to a decisive political breakthrough[4].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The UK Parliament’s Commons Library and academic legal analysis confirm the ongoing legal and political impasse, with no official scheduling of a referendum as of the latest available updates[2][3].
- Wikipedia and YouGov polling data corroborate that, despite ongoing debate and political maneuvering, no official date has been set for a second referendum[1][4].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- The Scottish government could, in theory, announce a referendum date without UK approval, but as of January 29, 2025, no such announcement has been made public in authoritative sources.
- Political developments can occur rapidly, but there is no evidence of an official scheduling before the specified cutoff.

## Conclusion

Based on all available factual information as of January 29, 2025, the government of Scotland has not officially announced a date for an independence referendum before April 1, 2025. Therefore, the answer to the question is **No**[1][2][3][4].
