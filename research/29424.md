## Key Facts Relevant to Forecasting Missouri Amendment 7

**Historical Trends and Current Status**
- Missouri does not use ranked-choice voting (RCV) in statewide elections, though St. Louis has experimented with alternative voting methods[1][3].
- Amendment 7 would make Missouri the 11th state to ban RCV, reflecting a broader trend among conservative states to preemptively prohibit the system[3][4].
- The measure also includes a provision to restrict voting to U.S. citizens, a policy that typically garners strong support among voters[3][5].

**Recent Announcements and Political Context**
- The ballot language for Amendment 7 is explicit: it would prohibit RCV and limit voting to citizens[3][5].
- Supporters, including Republican lawmakers and election officials, argue that RCV is confusing and undermines the principle of "one person, one vote"[2][4].
- Opponents, such as advocates for Better Ballot KC, argue that RCV is intuitive and can increase voter satisfaction, but there is limited evidence of a strong, organized campaign against the amendment[4].
- The measure is being promoted as a way to "protect fair and free elections," resonating with conservative voters[2][4].

**Authoritative Sources for Verification**
- Ballotpedia provides comprehensive information on the amendment and its ballot language.
- Missouri Secretary of State and local news outlets (KSMU, KSHB) offer detailed reporting on the measure and its implications[3][4][5].

**Limitations and Uncertainties**
- As of October 31, 2024, there is no publicly available polling data specifically forecasting the outcome of Amendment 7.
- The measure's bundling of a citizenship requirement with the RCV ban could increase its chances of passage, as citizenship requirements are generally popular.
- The lack of a strong pro-RCV movement and the state's conservative political climate suggest the measure is likely to pass, but the absence of polling introduces uncertainty.
