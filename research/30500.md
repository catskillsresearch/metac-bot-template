### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The average daily high temperature in Denver during December typically ranges from 45°F to 49°F[1][3].
- December highs above 70°F are extremely rare. In December 2022, the highest high was 64°F, while December 2023 saw an unusual spike to 71°F.
- Over the past 54 years, Denver's average winter temperature has increased by about 1.4°F, reflecting a gradual warming trend[5].

### Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- There are no specific policy changes directly affecting daily high temperatures. However, the broader trend of climate change is contributing to warmer winters in Denver and across Colorado[5].

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The Iowa Environmental Mesonet (IEM) data calendar for the Denver International Airport weather station is the official source for daily high temperature records, as specified in the resolution criteria.

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- While historical data suggests it is unlikely for Denver to exceed 70°F in December, the occurrence in December 2023 demonstrates that anomalous warm days are possible.
- The forecast cannot account for all potential weather anomalies, and the resolution depends on the completeness and accuracy of the IEM data.
- Missing data coded as "MM" will not be considered in the resolution.

### Summary Table: December High Temperatures in Denver

| Year | Highest December High (°F) |
|------|---------------------------|
| 2022 | 64                        |
| 2023 | 71                        |
| Typical Avg | 45–49              |

Given the historical averages and recent trends, it is unlikely but not impossible for Denver to see a December day above 70°F. The official outcome will depend on the daily high temperatures recorded at Denver International Airport and reported by the IEM.
