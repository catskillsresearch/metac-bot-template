### Key Factual Information for Forecasting India's February 2025 CFPI YoY Inflation Rate

**1. Recent Historical Data and Trends**
- The provisional year-over-year inflation rate for India's Consumer Food Price Index (CFPI) was 8.39% in December 2024, according to the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI)[1].
- Food inflation has remained elevated, fluctuating around 8% since mid-2023, due to persistent supply-side pressures from drought and a severe heatwave in 2024[1].

**2. Policy Actions and Announcements**
- The Indian government has imposed export bans on wheat and non-basmati white rice in an effort to contain domestic food inflation, but these measures have not yet resulted in a significant decline in food prices[1].
- Forecasts for 2025 indicate that food inflation could moderate if the rabi crop output is robust and the monsoon is favorable; however, these outcomes are uncertain and subject to weather risks[5].

**3. Authoritative Sources for Verification**
- The Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI) is the official source for CFPI data. The latest available provisional figure is for December 2024 (8.39%), with the January 2025 data scheduled for release on February 12, 2025[1].
- Additional context and projections are available from economic research and financial news outlets, but MoSPI's provisional release will be the contest's resolution source.

**4. Limitations and Uncertainties**
- The CFPI is highly sensitive to short-term supply disruptions, especially for perishable goods.
- Weather events, such as unseasonal rains or heatwaves, and international commodity price movements (e.g., edible oils) can cause volatility in food inflation[5].
- Only the first provisional figure released by MoSPI will be used for contest resolution, regardless of later revisions.

**Summary Table: Key Data Points**

| Month           | CFPI YoY Inflation Rate (Provisional) |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------|
| December 2024   | 8.39%                                 |

**Conclusion**:  
As of February 6, 2025, the most recent data and ongoing supply-side risks suggest that India's CFPI year-over-year inflation rate for February 2025 is likely to remain elevated, close to the recent 8%+ levels, unless there is a significant and rapid improvement in food supply or a major policy intervention.
