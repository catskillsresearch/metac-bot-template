## Key Factual Information for Forecasting

**1. Historical Trends and Current Status**
- The Billboard Artist 100 ranks the most popular artists each week based on sales, streaming, and airplay. The top 10 is generally stable, with most artists remaining in the top 10 for multiple weeks. Historically, 0–2 new artists enter the top 10 in a typical week, unless there are significant album releases or viral events[1].
- As of January 22, 2025, Taylor Swift was ranked number one, and Teddy Swims was a recent new entrant to the top 10, indicating that while new entries occur, they are not frequent[1].

**2. Recent Announcements or Policies**
- There have been no recent changes to Billboard's chart methodology or reporting schedule that would affect the Artist 100 rankings as of February 24, 2025[1].
- Billboard charts update weekly, typically each Tuesday morning, and the Artist 100 is based on data provided by Luminate[1].

**3. Authoritative Sources for Verification**
- The official Billboard Artist 100 chart archive is the definitive source for verifying weekly rankings and identifying new entrants to the top 10[1].
- Billboard's official social media and news updates provide timely information about chart changes[1].

**4. Limitations and Uncertainties**
- The exact number of new artists in the top 10 for the week of March 29, 2025, cannot be predicted with certainty. Factors such as surprise album releases, viral trends, or major music events could cause more turnover than usual.
- The Hot 100 and Global 200 charts, while related, do not directly reflect the Artist 100, so recent top 10s on those charts provide only indirect insight[1][3].
- The question will resolve based on the "Last Week" column in the Billboard Artist 100 for March 29, 2025, with any artist whose previous rank was 11 or greater (or unranked) counted as new.
