# Will NYC Temperatures Drop Below 25°F in December 2024?

To forecast whether New York City will experience temperatures below 25°F in December 2024, we need to examine historical temperature patterns, recent trends, and current climate conditions.

## Historical December Temperature Patterns

Historically, December in New York City sees a progressive cooling throughout the month. Average daily high temperatures typically decrease from 49°F at the beginning of the month to 42°F by the end[2]. While these are daytime highs, overnight lows can drop significantly lower.

The coldest day recorded in December 2023 was December 22, when temperatures fell to exactly 25°F[4]. This is particularly notable because December 2023 was unusually warm overall, ranking as the second warmest December for NYC in 154 years of record-keeping, with an average temperature of 44.6°F[4].

## Recent Winter Warming Trends

Recent years have shown a clear warming trend in New York City winters:

- The winter of 2023-2024 finished as the fourth warmest winter on record[3]
- The winter of 2022-2023 was even warmer, ranking as the second warmest[3]
- Seven of the top ten warmest Decembers on record have occurred since 1990[4]
- The last December to rank among the top ten coldest was back in 1976[4]

Climate analysis shows that New York City now experiences approximately 15 more days above average during winter compared to 1970, and cold snaps have shortened by about seven days[3]. Perhaps most significantly, the city's coldest temperatures measure nearly five degrees warmer than they did five decades ago[3].

## Factors Affecting December 2024 Temperatures

Traditional December weather patterns in New York suggest that while the beginning of the month can be fairly mild, by the end of December, temperatures typically struggle to rise much above freezing[5]. This indicates that historically, sub-25°F temperatures would not be unusual for late December.

However, the winter of 2023-2024 showed a significant reduction in freezing days. There were only 36 days with temperatures at or below freezing, compared to a historical average of 71 days[3]. The lowest temperature observed during that winter was 17°F[3].

## Forecast Assessment

Based on the available data, there are competing factors to consider:

1. **Historical patterns** suggest that December in New York typically includes periods cold enough to drop below 25°F, especially in the latter half of the month.

2. **Recent warming trends** show that winters have become significantly warmer, with fewer freezing days and less extreme cold.

The question of whether temperatures will drop below 25°F in December 2024 remains uncertain, but the data suggests that while still possible, such cold temperatures are becoming less common in New York City Decembers due to the ongoing warming trend. The fact that December 2023 only reached 25°F at its coldest (not below) despite being the second-warmest December on record suggests that even in a warming climate, temperatures near this threshold remain possible[4].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

It's important to note that while long-term warming trends are clear, year-to-year variability remains significant. Weather patterns can still bring occasional cold snaps even within an overall warming climate. Additionally, urban heat island effects in New York City may result in temperature differences between official measurement stations and various locations throughout the city.
