# Will Democrats Have a Brokered Convention in 2024?

As of mid-2024, the question of whether Democrats will have a brokered convention has gained attention following President Biden's debate performance against Donald Trump. Based on available information, I'll analyze the likelihood of this scenario.

## Historical Context and Definition

A brokered convention occurs when no candidate secures a majority of delegates in the first round of voting at a party's nominating convention. While common in the 19th century, brokered conventions have become increasingly rare in modern American politics. The Democratic Party has experienced only 5 brokered conventions since 1900, with the most recent occurring in 1952 when Adlai Stevenson secured the nomination after three ballots.

## Current Delegate Situation

President Biden has secured approximately 99% of the pledged delegates from the Democratic primaries and caucuses[3]. This overwhelming delegate advantage makes a brokered convention extremely unlikely under normal circumstances. For any meaningful opposition to emerge at the convention, thousands of delegates who are currently pledged to Biden would need to revolt simultaneously[3].

## Convention Process for 2024

The Democratic Party has implemented a process that further reduces the likelihood of a brokered convention:

1. The party plans to hold its presidential roll call vote virtually, before the in-person convention begins on August 19, 2024[3].
2. This early, virtual roll call was designed in part to meet Ohio's August 7th ballot deadline.
3. The virtual format likely diminishes the possibility of delegate rebellion or floor fights that might occur in an in-person setting[3].

Election law expert Derek Muller notes: "To the extent they're doing that even earlier and continue to adhere to that process, I think it's just deeply unlikely that it would result in anyone except Biden. Again, I think it really would take him voluntarily stepping down, for most â€” for any of these serious scenarios to play out realistically."[3]

## Scenarios That Could Lead to a Brokered Convention

While highly improbable, there are a few scenarios that could potentially lead to a brokered convention:

### 1. Biden Voluntarily Withdraws

If President Biden were to withdraw from the race before the nomination process is complete, many delegates who were assigned to him would likely enter the convention uncommitted[3]. This could potentially lead to multiple rounds of voting as delegates realign behind different candidates.

### 2. Mass Delegate Rebellion

Theoretically, delegates pledged to Biden could break from their commitment and vote for another candidate. However, this would require thousands of delegates to coordinate such an action[3], which is unprecedented in modern political history.

### 3. Rule Changes

The Democratic National Committee could adopt new rules for the convention that might allow for a more open field of competitors[1]. The convention can adopt whatever process it chooses, including ranked-choice voting, to select a nominee[1]. However, there's no indication that such rule changes are being seriously considered.

## Political Implications

The potential consequences of a brokered convention are significant:

- It could lead to divisiveness and chaos reminiscent of the 1968 Chicago convention[1].
- Alternatively, it might inject excitement into the political process by presenting voters with fresh, younger faces[1].
- The process would likely generate extensive media coverage focused on "chaos, conflict, and controversy" rather than substantive policy discussions[2].
- A late nominee selection would leave Democrats with limited time to organize a general election campaign, putting them at a disadvantage against the Republican nominee who would have had months to prepare[2].

## Assessment

Based on the current delegate count, planned convention procedures, and historical precedent, a brokered Democratic convention in 2024 is highly unlikely. President Biden has secured virtually all pledged delegates, and the party has structured its nomination process to minimize the possibility of floor fights or extended balloting.

The most plausible path to a brokered convention would be if Biden voluntarily withdrew from the race before the nomination is finalized. Barring such a dramatic development, the Democratic nomination process is likely to conclude with a single ballot confirming Biden as the nominee.
