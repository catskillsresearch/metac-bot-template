## Forecasting New Tariffs on Colombia

### Key Historical Trends and Current Status
- **Recent Tensions**: In January 2025, President Donald Trump announced a 25% tariff on Colombian imports, which was set to increase to 50% within a week, in response to Colombia's refusal to accept flights carrying deported migrants[2][4]. However, these measures were put on hold following an agreement between the U.S. and Colombia[1].
- **Current Status**: As of late January 2025, both countries have agreed to pause the implementation of tariffs and other measures, contingent upon Colombia honoring its commitments regarding deported individuals[1].

### Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric
- **Agreement and Pause**: The U.S. and Colombia have reached an agreement that pauses efforts to impose tariffs, with the understanding that these measures could be reinstated if Colombia fails to comply with its obligations[1].
- **Tariff Threats**: While President Trump has demonstrated a willingness to use tariffs as a policy tool, the current agreement suggests a temporary reprieve from new tariff announcements[2][4].

### Authoritative Sources for Verification
- **White House Announcements**: Official statements from the White House provide critical insights into U.S. policy intentions regarding tariffs and international agreements[1].
- **Trade News and Analysis**: Sources like Baker McKenzie's sanctions news and Politico offer detailed analysis of trade developments and policy changes[2][4].

### Limitations or Uncertainties in Measurement
- **Political Uncertainty**: The situation remains volatile, and any failure by Colombia to comply with the agreement could lead to renewed tariff threats or implementations[1].
- **Economic Factors**: Economic conditions and trade dynamics can influence policy decisions, making it challenging to predict future tariff actions with certainty[5].

## Conclusion
Given the current agreement and the conditional nature of the paused tariffs, it is uncertain whether new tariffs will be imposed before April 1, 2025. However, any failure by Colombia to honor its commitments could lead to renewed tariff actions.
