**Key Historical Trends and Current Status**
- The East African Federation proposal has existed since the 1960s, with the idea periodically revived but never reaching legal ratification by member states.
- The East African Community (EAC) is the current regional bloc, comprising Burundi, DRC, Kenya, Rwanda, South Sudan, Tanzania, and Uganda, with DRC joining officially on July 11, 2022[5].
- As of July 2022, significant steps have been taken toward deeper integration, including the formation of committees to draft a regional constitution. However, deadlines for producing and implementing a foundational legal document (initially by 2023) were already likely to be missed[1].
- The process was described as “being fast tracked”, but in practice, progress has been slow, especially regarding constitution drafting and formal legal ratification[1].

**Recent Announcements and Policies**
- The accession of DRC increased the number of member states, introducing new logistical and political complexities[5].
- In 2021–2022, EAC leadership continued to signal support for a federation, but concrete legal steps (constitution drafting, ratification agreements) lagged well behind political rhetoric[1].
- There were no reports as of July 2022 of any of the seven countries having ratified a binding agreement to form a federation.

**Key Differences Affecting the Forecast**
- The EAC has expanded, increasing diversity and making consensus more difficult[5].
- While political will at the leadership level remains, actual institutional and legislative progress (especially on constitutional matters) is slower than public statements suggest[1].
- Previous integration efforts in Africa and elsewhere show that ratification and implementation often lag well behind initial agreements, with technical details and domestic politics causing protracted delays.

**Limitations and Uncertainties**
- Domestic political changes, regional security issues, and technical barriers could further delay or derail the ratification process.
- The measure of “ratification” requires formal, legal action by at least three states, not just agreement in principle.
- There is some uncertainty in how quickly domestic political processes can adapt to regional agreements, especially given recent expansions in membership.

**Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment**
Given the above, as of July 2022, the probability that at least three EAC countries will formally ratify an agreement to merge into a single state (meeting the question’s criteria) before 2030 is assessed as moderate but more likely to fall short of a majority chance—estimated in the 30–45% range.

> The EAC is “fast tracking” efforts toward federation, but persistent delays, increased complexity with new members, and slow legal progress suggest ratification by three or more states before 2030 is plausible but not probable[1][5].
