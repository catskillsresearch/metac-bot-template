### Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The CBOE S&P 500 3-Month Volatility Index (VXVCLS) stood at 20.80 on October 30, 2023[1].
- As of early May 2025, the index was reported at 25.49, with late April 2025 values also above 25[1]. This indicates a substantial increase in implied volatility over the past year.
- Throughout mid-2024, market volatility rose sharply. In July 2024, the VIX (1-month volatility index) increased by more than 30%, and the 3-month index (VIX3M/VXVCLS) also reflected this heightened volatility[3][5].

### Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Metric

- The spike in volatility during July and August 2024 was attributed to new economic data releases and speculation about central bank policy changes, which led to increased uncertainty and higher implied volatility in equity markets[3][5].
- The S&P 500 experienced both price appreciation and increased volatility, with a notable shift in market dynamics, including higher dispersion and lower correlation among index constituents[3][5].

### Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis (FRED) provides daily closing values for the VXVCLS, which will be used to resolve the question[1].
- Cboe Global Markets offers background and methodology for the calculation of volatility indices, including the VIX and VIX3M/VXVCLS[2][3][5].

### Limitations and Uncertainties

- Volatility indices like VXVCLS are highly sensitive to market events and can change rapidly in response to news or shifts in investor sentiment.
- The index reflects market expectations for volatility over the next three months, not realized volatility, and is influenced by option pricing models and market liquidity[5].
- Forecasts are inherently uncertain, especially for short-term market measures like volatility indices.

### Conclusion

Based on the available data as of October 21, 2024, the VXVCLS has been trending significantly higher than its value on October 30, 2023. Barring an abrupt and sustained decline in volatility before October 30, 2024, it is likely that the VXVCLS will be higher year-over-year on that date[1][3][5].
