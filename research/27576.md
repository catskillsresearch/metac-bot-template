## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- The United States, United Kingdom, Germany, Canada, France, and Australia have historically maintained strong diplomatic relations with Israel, often providing political, military, and economic support[2][5].
- In the wake of the October 7, 2023 Hamas attack and Israel’s subsequent military campaign in Gaza, these countries initially reaffirmed their support for Israel’s right to self-defense, though public criticism of Israel’s conduct increased as civilian casualties mounted[2][5].
- Despite mounting international pressure and criticism, these six countries have not, as of August 23, 2024, taken steps to recall ambassadors, downgrade diplomatic relations, sever ties, or formally recognize Palestine in protest of Israel’s actions in Gaza[2][5].

## Recent Announcements and Policies

- Some Western countries, including Canada, Italy, and the Netherlands, halted arms sales to Israel in early 2024, but this does not meet the threshold for a full arms embargo or a diplomatic downgrade as defined in the resolution criteria[2].
- The US abstained (rather than voted in favor) on a UN Security Council resolution demanding a ceasefire in March 2024, which does not satisfy the specific US criteria outlined in the question[2].
- No public announcements have been made by the US, UK, Germany, Canada, France, or Australia regarding the formal recognition of Palestine, ambassador recalls, or downgrading/severing of diplomatic ties with Israel as of the cutoff date[2][5].
- Some European countries outside this group (e.g., Ireland, Spain, Norway) have recognized Palestine or taken steps to downgrade relations, but these actions have not been mirrored by the six countries in question[1].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- Official government statements, reputable news agencies, and international organizations (e.g., UN, OCHA) confirm that none of the six countries have taken qualifying actions as of August 23, 2024[2][5].
- Lists tracking diplomatic actions and funding suspensions (e.g., UNRWA funding) show that while some aid was suspended and later reinstated, this does not equate to a diplomatic downgrade or recognition of Palestine[3].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- Diplomatic stances can shift rapidly in response to major events; however, as of August 23, 2024, there is no evidence that any of the six countries have met the resolution criteria.
- Public and political pressure within these countries is increasing, but official policy changes have not yet occurred.

## Conclusion

As of August 23, 2024, there is no factual basis to forecast that any two countries out of the US, UK, Germany, Canada, France, or Australia will curtail diplomatic ties with Israel before 2025, citing Israel’s military actions in Gaza, according to the specific resolution criteria outlined.
