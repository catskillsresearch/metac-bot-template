## Current Status and Historical Context

SpongeBob SquarePants has won the 2025 Kids' Choice Award for Favorite Cartoon[5]. This victory continues SpongeBob's remarkable dominance in this category, as the show has historically accumulated 21 overall wins, including a streak of 16 consecutive victories[1].

The 2025 nominees for Favorite Cartoon were:

## Event Details

While the official 2025 Kids' Choice Awards ceremony is scheduled for Saturday, June 21, 2025, at 8:00 p.m. (ET/PT) on Nickelodeon[5], the winners have been announced in advance. The event is being marketed as the "Slime summer, summerslime" and "the party of the summer"[5].

## Analysis of the Result

SpongeBob's victory is consistent with its historical performance in this category. No other show has managed to break SpongeBob's winning streak in recent years, though Avatar: The Last Airbender has previously ended one of its runs[1].
