## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Since the end of World War II in 1945, no two countries that are now or have been EU member states have fought each other in an armed conflict[1]. This is an unprecedented period of peace in European history, matching or exceeding long peaceful eras such as the *Pax Romana*.
- Prior to WWII, Europe was frequently wracked by conflict between neighboring states, with numerous wars, revolutions, and uprisings throughout the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries[2].
- The creation and expansion of the European Union (EU) has been explicitly aimed at making war between European states "not merely unthinkable, but materially impossible" by fostering economic interdependence and political integration[1][4].
- As of 2022, the EU consisted of 27 member states with deep economic, political, and legal integration, including shared decision-making structures and collective security guarantees through NATO for most members[4].
- While Europe has witnessed wars on its borders (e.g., Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022), these conflicts have not involved EU states fighting each other[3].

## 2. Recent Announcements/Policies Affecting the Metric

- The EU and its member states have repeatedly reaffirmed their commitment to peaceful resolution of disputes, collective security, and upholding democratic values[1][4].
- The presence of ongoing security challenges at the EU’s borders, especially Russia’s aggression against Ukraine, has led to increased defense cooperation within the EU and with NATO partners[3].
- No major EU member state has announced policies or signaled intentions that would suggest a move toward armed conflict with another EU state up to the end of 2022.

## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification

- European Union official history and documentation[1][4]
- Academic analysis on why war has become obsolete in Europe, citing Cold War structures, democratization, and economic integration[5]
- Chronological lists of conflicts in Europe (for historical contrast)[2]
- European External Action Service reporting on contemporary security threats[3]

## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties in Measurement

- The forecast covers an unusually long time horizon (131 years from 2022 to 2153), which introduces significant uncertainty due to potential unforeseen political, technological, or environmental changes.
- The definition of "EU state" is clear, but potential future dissolutions, accessions, or transformations of the EU could complicate interpretation.
- While the EU’s integration and shared norms are strong deterrents to war, factors such as rising nationalism, institutional crises, or external shocks could alter the risk profile.
- Measurement is binary and requires clear, legally recognized thresholds to be met (formal declaration, international consensus, or specified casualty figures), reducing ambiguity but possibly missing lower-level hostilities.

## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment

- Given 78 years of unprecedented peace among EU states, deepening institutional integration, and robust conflict-resolution mechanisms, the probability of a full-scale war between EU states before 2153 appears very low, barring major systemic shocks[1][4][5].
- However, the long time frame increases structural uncertainty. While the risk is not zero, the current evidence supports a highly negative forecast—most expert and academic analysis suggests such a conflict is highly unlikely under present trajectories[5].
- The most plausible sources of increased risk would be EU fragmentation, democratic backsliding, or major external destabilization, none of which appeared imminent as of late 2022.

> **Summary**: As of November 24, 2022, all factual indicators point to an extremely low probability of war between any two EU states before 2153, given persistent post-1945 peace, institutional strength, and absence of significant escalation drivers[1][4][5].
