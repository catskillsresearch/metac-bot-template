## Key Historical Trends and Current Status

- Recent presidents have increasingly used executive orders in their first months. In Q1 of their first terms: Clinton signed 9, George W. Bush 8, Obama 18, Trump 23, and Biden 37 executive orders.
- Donald Trump, in his second term, has dramatically accelerated this trend. As of February 6, 2025, he had already signed 58 executive orders, surpassing all previous records for this stage of a presidency[1].

## Recent Announcements and Policy Initiatives

- Trump launched a "10-to-1 deregulation initiative" via executive order, requiring agencies to repeal ten regulations for every new one issued. This aggressive regulatory rollback is being implemented through multiple executive orders and signals a continued high volume of such actions[2].
- Early executive orders have targeted key campaign issues, including immigration, trade, energy, and federal workforce policies[1].

## Authoritative Sources for Verification

- The official count of executive orders is maintained by the Federal Register, which numbers and publishes each order[3].
- The White House Presidential Actions archive also provides up-to-date listings of executive orders and related documents[3].
- Legal and policy analysis sites, such as Holland & Knight and DLA Piper, are tracking and summarizing Trump's 2025 executive orders[1][4].

## Limitations and Uncertainties

- Only executive orders with official numbers are counted; memoranda and proclamations are excluded.
- There can be a delay between signing and publication in the Federal Register, which may affect real-time tracking.
- The initial surge in executive orders may slow after the first weeks, but the unprecedented pace as of early February 2025 suggests continued high output through March.
- The exact number for February and March 2025 cannot be known as of February 17, 2025, but the current trajectory indicates a total well above previous first-quarter records.

## Summary Table: Executive Orders in Early Presidencies

| President      | Q1 Executive Orders | Notable Trends                  |
| -------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| Clinton        | 9                  | Moderate pace                   |
| G.W. Bush      | 8                  | Moderate pace                   |
| Obama          | 18                 | Increased use                   |
| Trump (2017)   | 23                 | Aggressive reversal of policies |
| Biden (2021)   | 37                 | Record-setting pace             |
| Trump (2025)*  | 58 (as of Feb 6)   | Unprecedented surge             |

*Trump's 2025 figure is for the period up to February 6, 2025.

## Conclusion

Based on historical trends, the current unprecedented pace, and ongoing policy initiatives, all available evidence as of February 17, 2025, indicates that Donald Trump is likely to sign a historically high number of executive orders in February and March 2025, potentially exceeding 40â€“60 additional orders in those two months alone. The exact number will be verifiable via the Federal Register and the White House Presidential Actions archive after the period closes[1][2][3][4].
