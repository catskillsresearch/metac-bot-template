As of September 12, 2024, **no specific data on major hurricanes in September 2024 is available in the provided sources**. Key insights:  

### 1. **Forecast Context**  
- **Seasonal predictions**:  
  - **NOAA**: 17–25 named storms, 8–13 hurricanes (no major hurricane count specified)[1].  
  - **TSR**: 20 named storms, 9 hurricanes, **4 major hurricanes** (season total)[3].  
  - **AccuWeather** (September 3): Reduced to **3–6 major hurricanes** for the season, citing disruptive factors like Saharan dust and wind shear[5].  
- **September-specific**: No forecasts quantify major hurricanes for individual months.  

### 2. **Operational Data Limitations**  
- **NHC reports** (as referenced in [4]) are the definitive source but are not included in the provided materials.  
- **AccuWeather’s September 3 update** confirms no named storms during Labor Day weekend but does not report any September 2024 major hurricanes[5].  

### 3. **Uncertainties**  
- **Forecast accuracy**: Seasonal models cannot reliably predict monthly storm counts.  
- **Late-season variability**: September activity often depends on rapid changes in atmospheric conditions (e.g., La Niña onset timing)[3][5].  

### 4. **Verification Protocol**  
- **NHC Tropical Cyclone Advisory Archive** ([nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2024](https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2024/)) and **Monthly Summaries** ([MIATWSAT](https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/text/MIATWSAT.shtml)) must be consulted post-September 2024 for resolution.  

**Conclusion**: Insufficient data exists as of September 12, 2024, to confirm whether exactly two major hurricanes occurred in September 2024.
