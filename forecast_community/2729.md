# SOO Green Renewable Rail Project Completion Outlook Through 2035

The SOO Green HVDC Link represents a pioneering approach to transmission infrastructure in the United States, with several unique characteristics that position it favorably for completion before 2035 despite the challenges inherent to large-scale energy projects.

## Current Project Status and Timeline

As of June 2025, the SOO Green project has made significant regulatory progress. The Iowa Utilities Board granted a franchise permit in September 2023, and the project expects to receive interconnection service agreements from PJM in Q3 2025, with efforts underway to align MISO's interconnection study timeline to match this schedule. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approved the project's request to negotiate rates for capacity in 2020.

The project timeline has evolved considerably:
- In 2018, commercial operation was initially targeted for Q1 2025
- By late 2023, the timeline shifted to mid-2029 for commercial operations
- Recent projections indicate full operational status expected in the early 2030s

With a targeted operation date of mid-2029, the project has approximately 5-6 years of buffer before the 2035 deadline, which provides reasonable margin for potential delays while still meeting the success criteria.

## Advantages Increasing Likelihood of Success

Several factors distinguish SOO Green from traditional transmission projects and increase its probability of successful completion:

**Innovative Siting Approach**: By burying the transmission line along existing railroad rights-of-way, primarily the Canadian Pacific corridor, the project significantly reduces landowner opposition and NIMBY issues that typically cause major delays for overhead transmission lines. This approach has been likened to the successful model used to build America's fiber optic network.

**Regulatory Progress and Support**: The project has secured critical approvals, including the Iowa Utilities Board franchise permit. The board noted the project "will alleviate grid congestion and provide a path for renewable energy generated in Iowa to reach new markets", indicating strong regulatory backing.

**Reduced Permitting Risk**: The project's underground routing through existing transportation corridors minimizes environmental impacts and disruption to agricultural land, addressing common sources of opposition to transmission projects.

**Success Criteria Flexibility**: The minimum threshold for success (buried HVDC cable of at least 150 miles transmitting at least 1000MW) is significantly less than the full project scope of 349-350 miles and 2,100MW capacity. This means even partial completion could satisfy the criteria.

## Risk Factors and Challenges

Despite these advantages, several factors could delay or impede the project's completion:

**Historical Timeline Slippage**: The project has already experienced a timeline extension of approximately 4 years (from Q1 2025 to mid-2029) over a 5-year period, suggesting potential for further delays.

**Interconnection Complexity**: Coordination between two different regional transmission organizations (MISO and PJM) adds regulatory complexity that could cause delays beyond the expected Q3 2025 interconnection agreements.

**Supply Chain and Commercial Considerations**: The developer has explicitly mentioned supply chain constraints and the need to secure commercial offtake contracts as factors that could affect the timeline.

**Technical Challenges**: As the longest underground HVDC line in the country when completed, the project involves technical complexity that could present unforeseen challenges during construction.

## Comparative Context

Large infrastructure projects in the United States frequently experience significant delays beyond initial projections. However, transmission projects with innovative siting approaches like SOO Green's use of rail corridors tend to face fewer permitting delays than conventional overhead lines.

The project's use of established HVDC technology, combined with its innovative siting strategy, provides advantages over traditional transmission approaches. The underground installation along railroad rights-of-way addresses many of the common causes of delay for transmission projects, particularly landowner opposition and permitting challenges.

## Conclusion

The SOO Green Renewable Rail project demonstrates substantial progress through regulatory processes and employs an innovative approach that mitigates many common risks for transmission projects. While infrastructure projects of this scale typically face delays, the current mid-2029 target provides a comfortable buffer before the 2035 deadline. The project's reduced siting challenges, strong business case connecting renewable-rich MISO with constrained PJM markets, and flexibility in the success criteria all increase its likelihood of completion before 2035.

Given these considerations, the SOO Green project appears well-positioned to successfully complete at least 150 miles of buried HVDC cable transmitting 1000MW or more before 2035, despite the inherent challenges and potential for further timeline extensions.
