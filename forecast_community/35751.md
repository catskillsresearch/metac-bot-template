## Rationale

Overturning the certified result of a U.S. House, Senate, or top statewide election by court order is an exceedingly rare event in American politics. The overwhelming historical pattern is that courts—both state and federal—are highly reluctant to change certified winners of major offices, upholding the principle of electoral finality and requiring extraordinary, outcome-determinative evidence to intervene. Notable exceptions, such as the 2018 North Carolina 9th District and 2008 Minnesota Senate cases, involved blatant, well-documented irregularities or fraud that met this high bar.

Despite a dramatic increase in election-related litigation in recent cycles, particularly post-2020, nearly all challenges have failed to change outcomes for major offices. Courts consistently reject attempts to overturn results absent clear proof that legal violations were sufficient to alter the outcome. The 2020 presidential elections saw an unprecedented wave of lawsuits—over 190—yet none succeeded in reversing any U.S. House, Senate, or top statewide office result, underscoring how rarely the legal standards for intervention are met.

Looking ahead to the 2026 cycle, the environment is marked by:
- Intensifying partisan polarization and rising willingness among both parties to litigate close outcomes;
- Increased judicial and federal scrutiny of state election procedures, including ongoing Department of Justice litigation over the Help America Vote Act (HAVA) in North Carolina;
- Legal battles over redistricting and election administration, especially in battleground states with competitive races and shifting court compositions.

These factors raise the likelihood of post-election litigation, particularly in closely contested races. Scenarios that could plausibly lead to a court changing the winner include:
- Documented ballot tampering or fraud sufficient to change the result;
- Systemic and outcome-changing errors in vote tallying or administration;
- Court-ordered new elections or recounts that ultimately flip the winner, provided there is clear, decisive evidence of wrongdoing or mistake.

Nonetheless, the structural inertia of judicial precedent and the tradition of restraint remain powerful forces against judicial reversals. Courts impose a high evidentiary threshold, and most disputes—even in highly litigious or contentious environments—are resolved without changing certified winners. For a court-ordered change to occur, several rare conditions would need to converge: an extraordinarily close race, egregious and well-documented irregularities, and a judiciary willing to take the extraordinary step of overturning the will of voters.

While the present era’s increased polarization, legal activism, and federal oversight marginally heighten the probability relative to historical averages, the risk remains low. The vast majority of post-election litigation does not lead to outcome-altering judicial intervention, and the tradition of judicial restraint is likely to persist in 2026. Thus, the baseline scenario is a continuation of historical precedent, with only a modestly elevated risk that a court could change the winner of a major race by January 2028.
