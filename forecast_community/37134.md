# Current Flight Destination Analysis for Beirut Airport

As of May 2025, Beirutâ€“Rafic Hariri International Airport (BEY) consistently shows between 52-56 direct flight destinations across multiple tracking sources. The most authoritative source, FlightsFrom.com, lists 54 non-stop destinations served by 32 airlines. Other major trackers like FlightConnections show 52 direct destinations, while AirportInformation.com also confirms 54 destinations in 27 countries.

## Recent Airline Activity

The trend for summer 2025 appears to be expansion rather than contraction of routes:

- SAS is resuming flights to Beirut with up to five weekly departures from Copenhagen and Stockholm starting June 6
- Emirates resumed daily service to Beirut on February 1, 2025, and added a second daily service in April 2025
- Air France resumed flights to Beirut in February 2025
- Multiple European carriers are either resuming or expanding their services

This pattern of route resumptions suggests growing airline confidence in Beirut as a destination, particularly heading into the peak summer season.

## Seasonal Factors

Summer represents a peak travel period for Lebanon, which typically maintains or increases scheduled routes:

- The Lebanese government is actively preparing for increased summer tourism with significant airport renovations
- Airport authorities expect to handle over 16,000 passengers daily during summer 2025
- Seasonal additions like SAS's summer routes from Scandinavia will temporarily boost destination counts
- Current flight schedules show a diverse range of connections spanning Europe, the Middle East, and Africa

The airport currently offers extensive regional connectivity with flight times ranging from just 1h 25m to Cairo to 3h 55m to Dubai, making it an important hub in the Eastern Mediterranean.

## Risk Assessment

While the destination count currently exceeds the threshold of 51, several factors could potentially impact this number:

**Security Concerns:**
- Regional tensions, particularly along the Israel-Lebanon border, represent the most significant threat to airline operations
- Any dramatic escalation could prompt rapid route suspensions

**Economic Pressures:**
- Lebanon's hospitality sector faces challenges due to rising costs
- Airlines might adjust routes if tourism falls below expectations

**Operational Factors:**
- Regulatory changes or infrastructure issues could force temporary route suspensions
- Major airline withdrawals would significantly impact the destination count

However, no large-scale suspensions have been announced as of late May 2025, and the airport is actively preparing for increased summer traffic rather than contraction.

## Forward-Looking Assessment

The current destination count provides a buffer above the 51-destination threshold. Even if a few marginal routes were suspended, the count would likely remain above this level. For the number to fall below 52, we would need to see the suspension of at least 3-4 routes within the next six weeks.

Given the current trajectory of route resumptions, seasonal summer demand, and absence of imminent large-scale suspensions, the most likely scenario is that Beirut will maintain more than 51 direct flight destinations on July 1, 2025. While regional volatility presents real risks, the evidence strongly suggests stability or minor growth in destinations through early summer.
