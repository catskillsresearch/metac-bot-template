The time frame for assessing the potential for offensive nuclear detonations extends approximately 24.5 years, until January 1, 2050. Historically, there have been no offensive nuclear detonations since 1945, establishing a status quo of zero. If current trends persist, this pattern of non-use would likely continue. However, given the condition that at least one offensive detonation occurs by 2050, the minimum outcome would be one detonation.

Experts and market forecasts generally suggest a low number of offensive detonations, with a strong central tendency between 1 and 5. The probability of a large-scale nuclear exchange is considered low but not negligible, with the distribution of potential outcomes heavily skewed towards the lower end, yet possessing a long tail for escalation scenarios.

In a scenario resulting in a low number of detonations, diplomatic breakthroughs and renewed arms control agreements could lead to significant de-escalation of nuclear tensions. This might result in a single, isolated incident, possibly due to a regional conflict, a rogue state, or a non-state actor, which does not escalate further due to successful diplomatic interventions.

Conversely, a high outcome scenario could arise from a major geopolitical crisis that leads to a breakdown in communication and control. This could result in a large-scale nuclear exchange between major powers, potentially involving dozens to hundreds of detonations. Such a scenario underscores the importance of maintaining robust communication channels and diplomatic efforts to prevent escalation.
