Jerome Powell’s current term as Chair of the Federal Reserve is set to run until May 15, 2026, well beyond the January 1, 2026 cutoff in question. The prevailing expectation is continuity: Powell has consistently reiterated his commitment to serve his full term, remaining actively engaged and publicly visible in his leadership role as of May 2025. There are no credible indications of resignation or health concerns; Powell has repeatedly affirmed that he would not step down if asked and that, legally, the President cannot remove the Fed Chair over policy disagreements, as removal is only permitted "for cause"—a standard historically applied in a very narrow fashion. 

Despite past tensions and Trump’s critical rhetoric, President Trump has now publicly and emphatically committed not to seek Powell’s removal before his term expires, stating he prefers to await the natural end of the term, a position motivated by the short remaining tenure and the desire to avoid market upheaval. This stance is reinforced by institutional norms protecting central bank independence, with both market actors and other Federal Reserve officials stressing the significant economic risks of undermining the Fed’s autonomy. Financial markets value the stability and predictability Powell’s continued leadership signals, especially amid challenging economic conditions and ongoing policy debates.

The only plausible scenarios that could alter this trajectory are extraordinary and, at present, highly unlikely: a sudden and severe health crisis, a personal decision to resign, or an unprecedented legal move that overcomes substantial statutory and political barriers. No public evidence currently points toward any of these developments.

Given Powell’s firm stance, clear legal and institutional protections, explicit presidential commitments, and the historically strong bias toward incumbency in the Federal Reserve Chairmanship, the dominant probability is that Jerome Powell will remain Chair through at least January 1, 2026.
