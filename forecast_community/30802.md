(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
As of May 13, 2025, there are approximately 7.5 months until January 1, 2026, when the question will be resolved.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
Jerome Powell remains Chair of the Federal Reserve until May 15, 2026, serving out his full term as scheduled[5].

(c) **Scenario that results in a No outcome:**  
Powell continues as Fed Chair without interruption through the end of 2025, facing criticism and political pressure but neither resigning nor being removed, consistent with historical precedent and current public statements[5][2].

(d) **Scenario that results in a Yes outcome:**  
Powell steps down or ceases to hold the office of Chair before January 1, 2026, due to voluntary resignation (personal/health reasons), an extraordinary legal or political event resulting in removal, or another unforeseen contingency.

## Rationale

**Legal and Institutional Protections:**  
The law grants significant independence to the Federal Reserve Chair. Powell has publicly stated he intends to serve his full term, and legal scholars, as well as policymakers from both parties, have affirmed that the President does not have unilateral authority to remove a sitting Fed Chair without cause[5]. Recent news confirms that President Trump, despite frequent and harsh criticism, has stated he will not remove Powell before his term ends in 2026, and there are no ongoing efforts to change this arrangement[5].

**Political Dynamics and Public Statements:**  
While tension is high between Powell and President Trump, with repeated public demand for rate cuts and personal invective, there is no evidence that this has shifted to concrete moves for an early removal. Powell has responded by emphasizing the Fed’s independence and reiterating commitment to his mandate, and financial markets have reacted positively to this stability[4].

**Historical Precedent:**  
No Fed Chair has ever been removed before their term expired. The Fed’s independence is widely regarded as key to economic and financial stability, making an early departure extremely unlikely barring truly exceptional circumstances.

**Recent Developments:**  
As recently as May 2025, Powell continues to lead FOMC meetings and conduct press conferences, emphasizing stability and successful progress on inflation and employment[2]. Trump’s most recent statements reject the notion of removal before Powell’s term is up, despite ongoing policy disagreements.

**Key Risks to Forecast:**  
The primary risks that could lead to Powell leaving office early are:
- Health or personal issues resulting in voluntary resignation (no such indications exist at present).
- An unprecedented legal or political move to challenge the Fed’s independence, which would almost certainly be met with significant institutional and legal resistance.
- Major unforeseen crises that might change standard calculus.

Given all current evidence, the most probable scenario is Powell completing his term as Chair through at least the end of 2025.
