Based on the current date of May 12, 2025, I'll analyze whether the US will pass a federal AI regulation bill before January 1, 2026.

(a) Time left until outcome is known: Approximately 7 months and 19 days (until January 1, 2026)

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: No comprehensive federal AI regulation bill passed

(c) Scenario resulting in a No outcome: Congress remains focused on narrower AI legislation addressing specific issues (like cybersecurity or employment) rather than comprehensive regulation. The current administration's deregulatory approach continues to impede broader regulatory efforts. States continue developing their own patchwork of AI laws.

(d) Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome: A major AI-related incident creates urgent bipartisan pressure for federal action. Congressional leadership prioritizes comprehensive AI legislation, fast-tracking it through committees. The administration shifts position to support regulation in response to public concern, allowing passage before year-end.

In analyzing the likelihood of federal AI regulation by January 1, 2026, I need to consider the current regulatory landscape and political environment.

## Current Regulatory Status

The United States currently lacks comprehensive federal AI regulation, operating instead under a patchwork system of state laws, executive actions, and sector-specific regulations. As of early 2025, this fragmented approach continues despite increasing AI development and adoption across sectors[5].

In January 2025, the current administration issued an executive order specifically designed to remove "barriers to American leadership in Artificial Intelligence," revoking previous AI policies that had established more regulatory guardrails[4]. This represents a significant shift toward deregulation at the federal executive level.

## Legislative Activity and Momentum

The legislative picture shows mixed signals:

Early 2025 has seen an acceleration in AI-related legislative proposals at both federal and state levels. Just in the opening days of 2025, more than 40 AI-related proposals were introduced across different jurisdictions, building on the momentum from 2024 when lawmakers introduced over 700 AI-related bills nationwide[5].

However, the 119th Congress appears more focused on other technology issues like online speech and child safety rather than comprehensive AI consumer protection regulation[5]. This prioritization suggests that while interest exists, AI regulation may not be at the top of the legislative agenda.

States are actively filling the regulatory void. Colorado enacted its AI Act in 2024, while other states like California and Texas have pursued different regulatory approaches, with California focusing on frontier model risks and Texas proposing more expansive consumer protection measures[5].

## Political Environment

The current political configuration presents both opportunities and challenges:

With one party controlling both the White House and Congress after the recent election, there is potential for coordinated action[5]. However, the administration's January 2025 executive order signals a clear preference for minimal regulatory intervention in AI development[4].

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has included AI in its 2025 examination priorities, indicating that regulatory attention is occurring at the agency level even without comprehensive legislation[2]. This pattern of agency-level action could potentially reduce pressure for comprehensive legislative solutions.

## Timing Considerations

With less than eight months remaining before the January 1, 2026 deadline, the timeline for passing comprehensive legislation is tight:

For a bill to pass, it would need to be introduced, make it through committee review in both chambers, pass both the House and Senate (potentially with reconciliation if versions differ), and receive presidential signature â€“ all before year's end. The legislative process typically moves slowly, especially for complex regulatory frameworks.

The first quarter of 2025 has already seen legislative and regulatory developments related to AI[3], but these appear to be narrower in scope rather than the comprehensive regulation required to satisfy the question criteria.

## Probabilistic Assessment

The status quo strongly suggests that comprehensive federal AI regulation is not imminent. Several factors support this view:

1. The current administration's explicit deregulatory approach creates significant headwinds for comprehensive regulation
2. Congress appears more focused on other technology priorities
3. The limited timeframe makes passage of complex legislation challenging
4. The continuing development of state-level approaches and agency-specific guidance reduces urgency for federal action

While interest in AI regulation exists and legislative activity continues, the specific criteria for this question require a general AI regulation bill (not domain-specific) to be passed and signed into law before January 1, 2026. Based on current trends and the political environment, this outcome appears unlikely.

Probability: 20%
