The likelihood of a global conflict escalating to the level of World War III by 2050 is influenced by several key factors. Historically, the world has managed to avoid large-scale wars since World War II, largely due to the presence of nuclear deterrence, which acts as a significant barrier against major powers engaging in direct conflict. Economic interdependence among nations further discourages large-scale wars, as the global economy is intricately linked, making the cost of war exceedingly high for all involved parties. International institutions and diplomatic channels provide additional mechanisms for managing and de-escalating regional tensions.

Despite these deterrents, the potential for a conflict meeting the criteria for World War III is not negligible. Numerous geopolitical tensions and flashpoints exist, such as the South China Sea, NATO-Russia relations, and the nuclear ambitions of countries like North Korea and Iran. These situations could potentially escalate due to miscalculations or provocations, drawing in major powers and their allies. Such a conflict would need to involve countries representing at least 30% of world GDP or 50% of the world population and result in at least 10 million deaths to meet the specified criteria for World War III.

While the probability of such an escalation is not zero, the status quo suggests a "No" outcome, as the world has consistently managed regional conflicts without them escalating to a global scale. The interconnectedness of global economies, the deterrent effect of nuclear weapons, and the role of international institutions collectively reduce the likelihood of a conflict meeting the criteria for World War III. However, the potential for unforeseen events and miscalculations means that the possibility, while lower than the status quo, cannot be entirely dismissed.
