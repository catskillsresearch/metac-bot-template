# Gas Price Outlook: Will Inflation-Adjusted Gas Prices Rise in the US in 2025?

## Current Gas Price Trends

As of May 2025, US gasoline prices are at their lowest levels in several years. The national average price is approximately $3.08-$3.20 per gallon, which represents a significant decline of nearly 10% compared to the same period in 2024. When adjusted for inflation, Memorial Day 2025 gas prices are the lowest since 2003 (excluding the pandemic-affected 2020). This remarkable drop places current prices at their most affordable levels in over two decades on an inflation-adjusted basis.

GasBuddy forecasts that prices will average around $3.02 per gallon throughout the summer months from Memorial Day to Labor Day, with potential dips below $3.00 per gallon during the latter half of the season. Meanwhile, overall inflation has cooled to approximately 2.4-3.0% annually as of March 2025, representing a substantial improvement from the 9%+ inflation rates experienced in 2022.

## Factors Driving Current Price Trends

### Supply-Side Factors
Several key supply-side factors are contributing to the downward pressure on gas prices:

- **Increased OPEC+ Production**: OPEC+ has significantly increased oil output beyond expectations, creating abundant global supply and helping to stabilize or reduce crude oil prices.
- **Potential Iranian Supply**: The potential for a nuclear deal with Iran could introduce additional oil supply to global markets.
- **Robust US Production**: Domestic energy production has remained strong, helped by policies aimed at increasing output.
- **Natural Gas Trends**: The Energy Information Administration (EIA) forecasts inflation-adjusted natural gas prices to drop to $12.00 per Mcf in 2025, a 22% decline, indicating broader energy price moderation.

### Demand-Side Factors
Demand conditions also support the current price environment:

- **Economic Uncertainty**: Some economic indicators suggest continued uncertainty or moderate growth, which typically constrains gasoline demand.
- **Seasonal Patterns**: While summer typically brings higher demand, the forecast suggests prices will trend even lower in the latter half of the summer.

### Inflation Context
The broader inflation picture shows:
- **Declining Energy Costs**: Gasoline prices have dropped nearly 10% year-over-year, with total energy prices falling 3.3%.
- **Mixed Inflation Picture**: While energy prices are declining, other essentials like food (up 2.4-3.8%) and shelter (up 4.0%) continue to experience price increases.
- **Overall Moderation**: The headline inflation rate of 2.4% represents significant cooling from previous years.

## Scenarios Through December 2025

### Scenario for Continued Price Stability or Decreases
If current trends persist:
- OPEC+ maintains or increases production levels through year-end
- US domestic production remains robust
- Economic growth continues at a moderate pace
- No major geopolitical disruptions or supply chain issues materialize
- Seasonal patterns follow typical trends with prices declining post-summer
- Inflation remains in the 2-3% range

Under these conditions, December 2025 inflation-adjusted gas prices would likely remain below December 2024 levels, continuing the favorable trend for consumers.

### Scenario for Price Increases
Several factors could potentially reverse the current trend:
- **Supply Disruptions**: Unexpected events such as Middle East conflicts, hurricanes affecting Gulf Coast refineries, or major refinery outages could significantly restrict supply.
- **OPEC+ Policy Shifts**: A sudden decision to cut production would tighten global oil markets.
- **Economic Rebound**: A stronger-than-expected economic recovery in late 2025 could boost demand.
- **Tariff Impacts**: New or existing tariffs could potentially affect energy production equipment costs or broader inflation.
- **Currency Fluctuations**: A substantially weaker dollar would raise the cost of imported oil.

## Risk Assessment

The baseline outlook suggests continued price stability or further declines through the end of 2025. The fundamentals currently in place—ample supply, moderate demand, and cooling inflation—create a strong foundation for this projection.

However, gasoline markets are inherently volatile and can react quickly to unexpected events. While risks exist, they remain relatively low-probability scenarios given the current market dynamics. Most industry analysts and forecasters expect the favorable price environment to persist through year-end barring significant disruptions.

The weight of evidence strongly indicates that inflation-adjusted gas prices in December 2025 will likely be similar to or lower than December 2024 levels, continuing to provide relief for American consumers at the pump.
