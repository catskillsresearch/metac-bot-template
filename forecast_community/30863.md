(a) Time left until outcome: 7 months and 19 days (until December 31, 2025)

(b) Status quo outcome: Elon Musk remains the world's richest person, as he currently holds this position with a significant lead over the second-richest person.

(c) No outcome scenario: Tesla stock experiences a major crash (beyond the current correction), potentially dropping by 50% or more from current levels. Simultaneously, another billionaire (like Bezos or Zuckerberg) sees significant appreciation in their primary assets, closing the current wealth gap.

(d) Yes outcome scenario: Tesla stock stabilizes or recovers, and SpaceX continues to increase in value through successful missions and contracts. The diversification of Musk's assets (Tesla, SpaceX, xAI, etc.) provides sufficient buffer against market volatility to maintain his top position.

To predict whether Elon Musk will remain the world's richest person on December 31, 2025, I need to analyze the current trends in his wealth and potential challenges to his position.

## Current Wealth Status and Trends

As of May 2025, Elon Musk is still the world's richest person, though his net worth has fluctuated significantly in recent months. Tesla's stock, which represents a substantial portion of his wealth, has experienced a major correction, losing over 41% of its value since hitting a six-month high in December 2024[1][2]. Despite this correction, Musk maintains a significant lead over other billionaires.

The primary components of Musk's wealth include:

- Tesla (20.5% ownership stake)
- SpaceX (42% ownership stake)
- xAI (54% ownership)
- Smaller holdings in Neuralink, The Boring Company, and X (formerly Twitter)

## Tesla Stock Outlook

Tesla's stock performance is crucial to Musk's wealth position. Current analyst projections for Tesla stock show mixed sentiment:

- The consensus median one-year price target for Tesla shares is $284.23, implying a modest 3.90% upside potential from current levels[1][2]
- 24/7 Wall St. has a more bearish outlook with a 12-month price target of $268.01, representing a 2.02% downside[1][2]
- More optimistic forecasts from StockScan.io project Tesla stock could reach an average price of $590.95 by the end of 2025, with a high prediction of $800.70 and a low estimate of $381.20[3]
- Some analysts, like those at Fundstrat Global Advisors, are predicting Tesla could reach $614 by early 2026[5]

Tesla's 2025 deliveries are forecasted at 1.95 million units by Barclays, below the Bloomberg consensus of 2.08 million and Tesla's earlier estimates[2]. This suggests some headwinds for the company's growth.

## Other Wealth Factors

SpaceX continues to be a strong performer in Musk's portfolio, with its private market valuation continuing to rise. This diversification helps offset Tesla's volatility. Additionally, xAI's $50 billion valuation adds another significant asset to Musk's wealth.

## Probability Assessment

Looking at the status quo, Musk maintains a substantial lead over other billionaires, which would take a significant reversal to overcome in just 7 months. While Tesla has experienced volatility, analyst forecasts suggest the stock is more likely to stabilize or see modest growth rather than collapse completely.

The main risk factors include:
- Further significant decline in Tesla stock
- Rapid appreciation of assets held by competitors like Bezos or Zuckerberg
- Regulatory actions or legal issues affecting Musk's companies

Given these considerations, and placing appropriate weight on the status quo advantage Musk currently enjoys, I believe it's more likely than not that Musk will remain the world's richest person at the end of 2025.

Probability: 75%
