A stable in-space population near the end of June 2025 is primarily shaped by the overlapping schedules of crew rotations on the International Space Station (ISS) and China's Tiangong space station, as well as the occasional introduction of private spaceflight missions. Recently, the number of people in space increased from the baseline of 10 to 13 due to such overlapping crew handovers, a cyclical event that typically persists for days to a few weeks. These temporal elevations in population generally resolve after the completion of crew rotations, returning to a baseline dictated by the standard operational capacity of each station.

Heading into late June, the population is expected to remain elevated, bolstered by the scheduled launch of Axiom Mission-4 (Ax-4) on June 8, 2025, which will add additional crew members to the ISS. Private missions like Ax-4 often extend for 1â€“2 weeks or more, and with no major crew returns or departures announced around this timeframe, the in-space population is likely to remain above ten through June 27. China's Tiangong station, operating with typical expedition durations, is also expected to maintain its crew on orbit during this period.

Historical trends show that, outside periods of crew handover, the ISS and Tiangong combined usually support about ten people in space. Elevations above this level almost always arise from overlapping crew rotations or concurrent private missions. While the patterns are generally predictable, small probabilities remain for unexpected outcomes, such as technical issues, medical emergencies, or last-minute mission delays or cancellations, which could prompt an early crew return or alter the timing of arrivals and departures. Such events could reduce the population to ten or potentially below, but these scenarios are uncommon.

Overall, the evidence strongly supports a forecast where the number of people in space as reported by whoisinspace.com on June 27, 2025, is sustained at a level greater than ten, due to overlapping crew rotations and the addition of private mission personnel, with smaller chances for reversion to ten or fewer in the event of a routine or unexpected change in mission timing.
