## Rationale for PSLF Termination Status on Project 2025 Tracker

The Public Service Loan Forgiveness program continues to operate as of mid-May 2025, with no official announcement or evidence of imminent termination. The most significant recent action affecting PSLF was President Trump's March 7, 2025 Executive Order titled "Restoring Public Service Loan Forgiveness," which directed the Department of Education to propose revisions to the program's eligibility criteria. This order focused on excluding organizations with "substantial illegal purpose" from PSLF eligibility, particularly targeting organizations involved in illegal activities like immigration law violations or supporting terrorism.

Importantly, this executive order did not terminate the program but instead instructed regulatory agencies to propose restrictions on qualifying employers. Implementing these changes requires a lengthy negotiated rulemaking process that has only just begun:

- The Department of Education is forming a Negotiated Rulemaking Committee to develop proposed regulations for federal student aid programs, including PSLF
- The Department plans to hold a rulemaking session from June 30 to July 2, 2025, with proposed and final rules expected later in 2025
- Nominations for negotiators are due by June 1, 2025, indicating the process is still in early stages

This timeline makes it extremely unlikely that full termination of PSLF could be executed and recognized as "complete" by the Project 2025 Tracker before July 1, 2025.

## Current Legislative and Administrative Developments

Several legislative efforts could impact PSLF, though none appears positioned to terminate the program before July 1:

- Rep. Courtney [D-CT] introduced legislation on April 10, 2025, that would actually strengthen PSLF by reducing the required number of qualifying payments from 120 to 96 and expanding qualifying repayment plans
- Sen. Cotton [R-AR] introduced a bill on March 11, 2025, that would make individuals convicted of offenses during protests at higher education institutions ineligible for federal student loan forgiveness, but this does not terminate the program itself
- A recent agreement between the American Federation of Teachers and the Education Department paused litigation while ED commits to publishing monthly reports on PSLF applications, with the first report due May 15, 2025

The administrative machinery continues to process PSLF applications, as evidenced by the recent agreement to publish status reports on IDR applications and PSLF buyback applications. This ongoing administrative activity further suggests the program remains operational.

## Procedural Requirements and Timeline Constraints

Historical precedent shows that major revisions or terminations of federal programs take months or even years, especially those requiring both regulatory overhaul and widespread notification. Federal regulations typically require a notice-and-comment period, which takes months to complete. With only 47 days remaining until July 1, 2025, there simply isn't enough time to complete all the necessary legal, regulatory, and administrative steps required for full termination.

Furthermore, the Project 2025 Tracker is a community-maintained resource that relies on clear, public documentation to mark an objective as completeâ€”introducing additional lag even if a termination announcement were made. The tracker currently marks the PSLF termination objective as "in progress," reflecting the March 7 executive order and subsequent regulatory process.

Given the procedural requirements, current status of regulatory efforts, and the limited time remaining before July 1, 2025, it is highly unlikely that PSLF will be terminated and marked as "complete" on the Project 2025 Tracker before the deadline.
