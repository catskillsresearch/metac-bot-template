The current trajectory of small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs) suggests that while there is significant interest and investment in their development, the likelihood of them supplying at least 1% of any nation's electricity by 2030 remains uncertain. The status quo indicates a low probability of achieving this threshold, primarily due to the anticipated timeline for large-scale deployment and integration into national grids, which extends beyond 2030. Currently, only a few SMRs are operational, and most large-scale deployments are expected after this date.

Several factors could contribute to a "No" outcome, including continued delays in SMR deployment due to regulatory hurdles, technical challenges, and financial constraints. In countries like the US and UK, significant projects are underway but may not be operational before 2030. Additionally, larger countries such as Russia and China may not prioritize SMR deployment in smaller, isolated grids, limiting their impact on national electricity consumption.

However, a "Yes" outcome is not entirely out of reach. This could occur if there is an accelerated deployment of SMRs in smaller or isolated grids, where a single SMR could significantly impact the local electricity supply. For instance, if a smaller nation with lower overall electricity consumption successfully deploys SMRs, it could more easily reach the 1% threshold. Similarly, if countries like China or Russia deploy multiple SMRs in regions with lower electricity consumption, they could achieve this target.

Overall, while the technology is still maturing and regulatory challenges remain significant, the potential for SMRs to supply 1% of a nation's electricity by 2030 exists, particularly in smaller or isolated grids. However, achieving this would require significant advancements and prioritization in the coming years.
