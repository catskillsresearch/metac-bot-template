# Renewable Energy's Share in Global Electricity Production by 2030

Current trends show remarkable momentum in renewable energy deployment, with renewables already accounting for approximately 32% of global electricity generation in 2024, up from 22.7% in 2016 and 30% in 2023. This represents a consistent growth of roughly 1.2-2 percentage points annually over recent years. When including nuclear energy, clean power exceeded 40% of global electricity generation in 2024.

## Current Growth Trajectory

The renewable energy sector is experiencing unprecedented expansion:

- Solar has been a primary driver, growing 29% in 2024 compared to 2023 and now accounting for approximately 6.9% of global electricity production
- Wind energy has reached 8.1% of global electricity production
- Hydroelectric power remains stable at about 14.3% of the mix

The International Energy Agency (IEA) projects that more than 5,500 GW of new renewable capacity will be added globally between 2024 and 2030, almost tripling the additions seen in the previous equivalent period. This massive expansion is expected to propel renewables to approximately 46% of global electricity generation by 2030, up from the current 32%.

## Key Factors Affecting the 2030 Outcome

Several critical factors will influence whether renewables remain within the 25-48% range by 2030:

**Enabling Factors:**
- **Economic Competitiveness**: Renewables now offer the cheapest option for new power generation in most countries worldwide, driving adoption regardless of climate policies
- **Policy Momentum**: The COP28 target of tripling renewable capacity by 2030 has accelerated policy action globally, though implementation varies significantly by region
- **Technological Improvements**: Continued efficiency gains and cost reductions in solar, wind, and storage technologies

**Constraining Factors:**
- **Integration Challenges**: Curtailment rates (where renewable electricity generation isn't used) have reached around 10% in several countries, potentially slowing effective deployment
- **Grid Infrastructure Limitations**: Meeting higher renewable targets requires building and modernizing approximately 25 million kilometers of electricity grids and reaching 1,500 GW of storage capacity by 2030
- **Regional Disparities**: Growth remains uneven globally, with China accounting for nearly 64% of recently added renewable capacity while other regions lag

## 2030 Outlook Assessment

Based on current trajectories and authoritative forecasts:

- **Below 25% scenario**: This is virtually impossible given that renewables already exceeded this threshold in 2024 at 32%. Only an unprecedented global collapse in renewable deployment could produce this outcome.

- **25-48% scenario**: This range captures the most likely outcome based on current growth patterns. The IEA projects renewables will meet "almost half" of global electricity demand by 2030, with wind and solar alone doubling their share to approximately 30%. The IPCC's "middle-of-the-road" P3 pathway is consistent with a share up to 48%.

- **Above 48% scenario**: Exceeding 48% would require accelerating beyond even current record growth rates. While possible with exceptionally rapid deployment, grid integration, and supportive policies, most authoritative forecasts predict renewables will approach but not clearly exceed 48% by 2030.

Most credible projections cluster near the upper end of the 25-48% range. The IEA's language of renewables meeting "almost half" of global electricity generation by 2030 suggests a figure approaching but likely remaining just below 48%.

Grid bottlenecks, integration challenges, and the time required to build supporting infrastructure will moderate growth enough to keep the renewable share within the specified range, despite the strong economic and policy drivers pushing toward rapid expansion.

Given these factors, renewable energy's contribution to global electricity production in 2030 is highly likely to fall between 25% and 48%, with the most probable outcome being in the 44-48% range.
