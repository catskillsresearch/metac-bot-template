The prospect of 20 million people following a new, AI-created religion by the end of 2035 is highly improbable given several key factors. Historically, new religions have required decades or even centuries to amass large followings, and there is currently no evidence of an AI independently creating a religion with such a scale of adherence. The status quo heavily favors a negative outcome, as AI is predominantly used as a tool or supplement in existing religious contexts rather than as an independent creator of new religious movements.

For a new AI-created religion to gain 20 million followers, significant breakthroughs in AI technology would be necessary, enabling the creation of a compelling and distinct religious doctrine that resonates globally. This would require not only technological advancements but also substantial social and cultural shifts to overcome existing barriers. The criteria for verification are stringent, demanding independent creation by AI and confirmation by reputable sources, which further complicates the likelihood of such a development.

Moreover, current trends indicate a decline in religiosity with increased AI exposure, suggesting that the integration of AI into religious contexts may not lead to the formation of new, widely-followed religions. The world tends to evolve gradually, and the emergence of a new religion with a massive following in a relatively short timeframe is unprecedented. Given these considerations, the probability of a new, AI-created religion achieving such a following by 2035 remains extremely low.
