(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
As of May 14, 2025, there are 45 days until June 28, 2025.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
The Joe Rogan Experience (JRE) is currently ranked #1 on Spotify’s US podcast charts and has held this position for five consecutive years. Betting markets currently assign an implied probability of about 85.7% that Rogan will continue to top Spotify’s charts throughout 2025. Industry overviews, aggregators, and research data all reflect ongoing dominance by JRE, with no disruptive shifts reported in the latest months[1][3][5].

(c) **Scenario resulting in an unexpected outcome:**  
Spotify’s podcast charts can fluctuate due to viral trends, sudden surges in competing shows, or controversies that might prompt a listener backlash. There are specific notable recent events: Mel Robbins’ self-help podcast, and Amy Poehler’s "Good Hang," have both demonstrated potential to briefly surpass JRE, each topping the Spotify US chart for several days or weeks earlier in 2025. If a high-profile guest or incident were to drive a viral spike in another show’s popularity near June 28, or if Spotify’s algorithms or promotional priorities suddenly shifted, JRE could temporarily drop to second, third, or even lower. Further, as chart measurement is point-in-time, even a single-day surge by a rival podcast could alter the ranking snapshot on the verification date.

Good forecasters recognize that while the world typically changes slowly (and past performance is the best guide), podcast rankings do occasionally swing due to such viral or platform-driven effects. Therefore, some moderate probability should be assigned to "Second" and small probabilities to "Third or Fourth" or "Fifth or beyond," to capture these tail risks.

## Final Probabilities

- **First**: 83  
  JRE has an entrenched audience, ongoing high-profile guests, and industry/market expectation to retain #1 unless a rare surge by a competitor occurs[1][3][5].
- **Second**: 13  
  Mel Robbins, Amy Poehler, or another breakout podcast could temporarily overtake JRE due to a viral episode or platform push, as happened for brief periods in early 2025.
- **Third or Fourth**: 3  
  It would likely take an extraordinary convergence of multiple competitors surging, sustained negative publicity, or technical/algorithmic issues for JRE to drop this far.
- **Fifth or beyond**: 1  
  Only plausible in an extreme scenario such as a major controversy, removal from the platform, or technical issue.
