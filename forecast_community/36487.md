(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  
There are just under 8 months remaining until January 1, 2026, when this question will be resolved.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
Domestic content requirements for the Inflation Reduction Act’s Section 45Y Production Tax Credit (PTC) remain optional—projects can claim a 10% bonus if they meet the domestic content thresholds, but it is not mandatory to meet these requirements to receive the base PTC[1][2][3]. IRS and Treasury guidance continues to treat the domestic content provision as a bonus, not a baseline eligibility criterion[1][3][5].

(c) **Scenario leading to a No outcome:**  
No federal legislation is enacted before January 1, 2026, modifying Section 45Y to make domestic content requirements mandatory for PTC eligibility. The IRS and Treasury continue with the current structure, offering a bonus credit for projects that meet the requirements, but not denying base PTCs to projects that do not[1][2][3]. This reflects all current guidance and the absence of significant congressional momentum to increase these requirements.

(d) **Scenario leading to a Yes outcome:**  
Congress passes and the President signs a federal bill before January 1, 2026, that amends the law so that projects must meet domestic content requirements to receive any Section 45Y PTC. Alternatively, new administrative guidance or regulation is issued that has the force of law and effectively makes these requirements mandatory for all PTC claims, but this would almost certainly require legislative change given the statutory basis for PTCs[2][3]. No such federal legislative action has been taken or is clearly imminent as of May 2025.

## Rationale

- **Status quo bias:** The domestic content requirement has, since its inception, been structured purely as an optional bonus for the PTC, not a universal mandate[1][2][3]. The Internal Revenue Service’s most recent guidance and updates (including Notice 2025-08) maintain this bonus structure and offer no suggestion of a coming shift to a mandatory requirement[1][3][5].
- **Political climate:** While the new Republican majority and President Trump have expressed intent to scale back or phase out various Inflation Reduction Act provisions, there is no evidence of a push to make domestic content mandatory for PTCs. Instead, most discussion is about reducing or phasing out clean energy incentives entirely, not restructuring them to prioritize domestic content as a baseline[1][3].
- **Legislative and procedural likelihood:** With a slim majority in the House and evident internal divisions (with some Republicans advocating for a “thoughtful phaseout” rather than outright repeal), and historical precedent showing reconciliation bills often fail or are heavily modified, the probability of passing new, more stringent PTC requirements in a complicated, divided political context is low within the next eight months.
- **Regulatory landscape:** IRS and Treasury updates since the law’s passage have focused on clarifying and administering the bonus—not shifting it to a general eligibility requirement for the PTC[1][3][5].
