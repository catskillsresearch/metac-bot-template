The question of whether a cryonically frozen individual will be resuscitated before 2100 hinges on several complex factors. As of 2023, no individual has been successfully resuscitated, and the challenges are both significant and multifaceted. The primary obstacles include reversing cellular and neural damage caused by cryopreservation, overcoming cryoprotectant toxicity, and restoring full biological functions. These technical challenges are compounded by ethical and legal barriers that currently hinder resuscitation efforts.

The status quo strongly suggests a "No" outcome, as the scientific consensus remains skeptical about the feasibility of cryonic resuscitation. The cryonics industry is niche, with limited investment and interest, and there is no clear roadmap for overcoming the substantial technical hurdles. While advancements in related fields such as regenerative medicine, nanotechnology, and neuroscience are ongoing, they have not yet translated into practical applications for cryonic resuscitation.

However, a "Yes" outcome is conceivable if significant breakthroughs occur in these related fields, leading to the development of reliable methods for repairing cellular and neural damage. Such advancements would need to be accompanied by changes in legal and ethical frameworks to support resuscitation efforts. A successful case of resuscitation would require verification by credible sources, meeting all specified criteria, including restored vital functions and legal recognition of being brought back to life.

Overall, while there is potential for future advancements, the speculative nature of these developments and the historical trend of slow progress in this area suggest that a successful cryonic resuscitation before 2100 is extremely unlikely. The status quo outcome remains heavily weighted towards "No" due to the immense scale of the challenges and the lack of a clear path forward.
