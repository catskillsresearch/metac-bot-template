To detect and robustly quantify an exoplanet atmosphere with more than 5% oxygen before 2030, several intersecting scientific, technological, and observational challenges must be overcome—though the field is advancing rapidly, the leap required remains formidable.

Recent years have seen significant progress in exoplanet atmospheric characterization, particularly with the deployment of advanced space- and ground-based observatories. Instruments like the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) now routinely detect atmospheric features such as water vapor, methane, carbon monoxide, and traces of oxygen in massive exoplanets, primarily hot Jupiters and sub-Neptunes. However, these detections rarely extend to robust quantification of molecular abundances—especially the >5% threshold required for oxygen—and are virtually non-existent for small, rocky, potentially Earth-like exoplanets.

The main technical barriers lie in the faintness of the O₂ signal, compounded by interfering spectral features, the limited number of suitably aligned targets, and ongoing challenges with noise from both instrumental and astrophysical sources. Present methods focus predominantly on presence detection rather than precise abundance measurements, and even high-resolution spectroscopy (HRS), while powerful for gas giants, has not yet demonstrated the capability to robustly determine O₂ content at or above 5% in rocky planets. New techniques, including those utilizing collisional absorption features to reveal high concentrations of oxygen, have been developed and may accelerate the search but remain to be validated in practice for this specific requirement.

Instrumental advancements are on the horizon. The Extremely Large Telescope (ELT), set for first light in 2028, offers the promise of transformational sensitivity and spatial resolution. Simulations suggest that, under exceptionally favorable circumstances—such as the discovery of an ideal, nearby transiting terrestrial planet with a clear, oxygen-rich atmosphere—the ELT could detect and measure O₂ at the necessary levels within the narrow two-year window before 2030. However, this scenario relies on not only flawless operations and a fortuitous target but also rapid turnaround from discovery to verification and publication.

Contributing further uncertainty is the limited inventory of accessible rocky exoplanets orbiting bright, quiet nearby stars. Most known candidates cluster around M-dwarfs, where atmospheric oxygen can arise through abiotic processes, muddying the interpretation of positive signals. Additionally, each new detection must be rigorously validated to distinguish genuine planetary atmospheric oxygen from confounding features or telluric contamination.

In summary, while the coming years promise enhanced detection techniques and a growing catalogue of exoplanet targets, the combined hurdles of instrumental sensitivity, sample size, signal interpretation, and the stringent requirement for robust, quantitative measurement of oxygen fraction render the detection of an exoplanet atmosphere with >5% O₂ before 2030 possible, but improbable. It would require both a dramatic technological breakthrough—likely centered around the ELT—and the timely discovery of an exceptionally favorable planetary system. The field's historical pace suggests such a result is unlikely within the given timeframe, though continued progress ensures the outlook will improve in the early 2030s.
