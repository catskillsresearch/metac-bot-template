Rationale:

The integration of AI tools in clinical psychology is rapidly advancing, with notable improvements in diagnostic accuracy and efficiency. Current trends show increasing adoption and acceptance among clinicians and patients, with some implementations, like the UK NHS's use of Limbic Access, demonstrating significant success. AI tools have shown high accuracy rates (up to 90% in some studies) for diagnosing certain disorders, and they have the potential to address the growing demand for mental health services and the shortage of mental health professionals.

However, several barriers remain before AI can be considered best practice in the diagnostic process:

1. Regulatory caution: Professional bodies typically require robust evidence and extensive validation before endorsing new practices, especially in healthcare.

2. Ethical and privacy concerns: There are ongoing debates about the ethical implications of AI in diagnosis and the protection of sensitive patient data.

3. Complexity of human emotions: AI may struggle to fully capture the nuances of complex psychological scenarios, potentially missing important contextual factors.

4. Importance of human expertise: The empathy and judgment of human clinicians remain crucial in psychological diagnosis and treatment.

5. Implementation challenges: High costs, uneven access, and the need for clinician training could slow widespread adoption.

Despite these challenges, the momentum towards AI integration is strong. The projected growth of the AI in diagnostics market and increasing institutional support indicate a shift towards greater AI involvement in clinical psychology. The pressing need for more efficient and accurate diagnostic tools in mental health could accelerate the formal recognition of AI as best practice.

Given the rapid pace of AI development and the potential for overwhelming evidence of improved diagnostic outcomes, there's a significant chance that at least one major organization could endorse AI-assisted diagnosis as best practice by the end of 2028. However, the conservative nature of medical best practices and the emphasis on human expertise in psychology suggest that a complete shift to AI as "best practice" within this timeframe is not certain. The current status of AI as a supportive tool rather than a central diagnostic method may persist in many contexts, even as its use becomes more widespread and integral to the field.
