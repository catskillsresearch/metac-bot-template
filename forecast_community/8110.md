The likelihood of Saudi Arabia normalizing relations with Israel by 2031 is shaped by a complex interplay of regional politics, domestic considerations, and international relations. The current status quo suggests that normalization is unlikely without significant changes, primarily due to the unresolved Palestinian issue, domestic and regional sensitivities, and the intricate geopolitical landscape involving Iran and the US.

A key factor that could alter this trajectory is Iran's acquisition of a nuclear weapon, which would significantly heighten regional security concerns. This development could prompt Saudi Arabia to consider closer ties with Israel as a strategic counterbalance. However, the acquisition of a nuclear weapon by Iran alone is not sufficient to overcome the substantial barriers to normalization. The Palestinian issue remains a significant obstacle, and domestic and regional opinion in Saudi Arabia is sensitive to this matter.

The role of the US is crucial in this scenario. Substantial security guarantees, support for Saudi Arabia's nuclear ambitions, and credible progress toward resolving the Palestinian issue could make normalization more politically viable for Saudi Arabia. Additionally, changes in the geopolitical landscape, such as a shift in US policy or a significant regional realignment, could influence Saudi Arabia's decision-making process.

Despite these potential catalysts, the probability of normalization remains moderate due to the slow pace of change in international relations and the complexity of the factors involved. The political and social constraints within Saudi Arabia, coupled with the need for substantial US concessions and progress on the Palestinian front, continue to pose significant challenges to normalization.
