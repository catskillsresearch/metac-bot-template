The foundational driver of Iran’s refusal to recognize Israel is a deeply entrenched ideological opposition established after the 1979 Islamic Revolution. The Islamic Republic ties its legitimacy, both domestically and internationally, to an identity that positions opposition to Israel as a core pillar. This anti-Israel stance is not simply a matter of policy, but a central narrative used for internal mobilization and regional influence, most notably through support for proxy groups engaged in conflict with Israel.

Since 1979, Iran’s leaders—from conservatives to most prominent reformists—have maintained this posture, expressing little public deviation from the core dogma that Israel is illegitimate. Engagement in regional proxy conflicts and confrontational rhetoric reinforce the regime’s anti-Israel credentials. Current events, including nuclear negotiations and escalating tensions with Israel, offer no indication of movement toward normalization. Unlike the peace processes undertaken by Egypt, Jordan, and the recent Abraham Accords states—which were motivated by pragmatic interests and the absence of ideological hostility—Iran’s antagonism is far more deeply woven into the fabric of the regime’s identity.

Despite this, the regime has demonstrated pragmatic flexibility when existential threats or strategic necessity are at stake. Historical records show that, even after the revolution, Iran engaged in clandestine cooperation with Israel during the Iran–Iraq War, highlighting that regime preservation can occasionally override rigid ideological imperatives. Nevertheless, such pragmatism has remained covert and has never extended to open recognition, indicating strong structural barriers to public normalization.

Given the nearly 45-year horizon until 2070, there is substantial scope for unforeseen political, generational, and geopolitical shifts. The most plausible path to recognition would involve a dramatic transformation within Iran—such as a regime change, peaceful revolution, or generational turnover yielding a government less ideologically tied to anti-Zionism. External shocks, economic crises, or a sweeping regional realignment could also serve as catalysts for reorientation. However, even a successor regime could inherit and continue anti-Israel sentiment due to its deep roots in Iranian society and political culture.

The momentum of the status quo, historical inertia, and the regime’s reliance on anti-Israel rhetoric as a tool of legitimacy render recognition highly unlikely absent transformative change. The precedent of pre-1979 Iran, which had relations with Israel, does illustrate that ideological barriers are not immutable, but most previous regime changes in Iran have been rare and unpredictable, making their timing and direction uncertain.

In sum, while regime survival, generational change, or extraordinary external pressures could potentially create incentives for normalization and eventual recognition, the best-supported expectation is for continued non-recognition, barring extraordinary shifts in Iranian governance or regional order.
