Bluesky has demonstrated rapid and sustained growth in recent months, cementing its status as one of the fastest-growing social media platforms in 2025. By early June 2025, the platform had accumulated an estimated 41–43 million users, with growth driven both by organic word-of-mouth and waves of migration sparked by high-profile changes and controversies at competitor platforms, especially X (formerly Twitter). Analysts universally agree that only a fraction of these users contribute posts on any given day, with industry-standard engagement rates for posting activity on social networks typically in the 3–5% range of total users. This ratio, supported by recent data, puts the current and near-future daily unique poster count in the ballpark of 1.3–2.1 million.

Trend projections, based on Bluesky’s steady influx of about 2.5–3 million new users per month, suggest the platform will likely reach approximately 42–43 million users by late June 2025. Applying the prevailing posting rate yields an expected daily unique poster count between 1.6 and 2.1 million on June 28, 2025. While user growth is robust, Bluesky’s active poster base—particularly among news influencers and key demographics—remains smaller relative to its total registration count, reflecting ongoing market competition with X, which still claims the majority of influencer activity. Nonetheless, Bluesky is showing signs of increasing engagement, with features like custom feeds and a decentralized model attracting users seeking more control and transparency.

Scenarios that could lead to substantially lower poster counts include unforeseen technical outages, data breaches, or a sudden drop in user engagement due to external factors, including seasonal lulls in social media activity during summer. In such cases, the number of unique posters might fall toward or below 1 million on the specific date in question. Conversely, viral events or high-profile controversies—especially involving X—or the introduction of engaging new Bluesky features (such as long-form video posts or innovative customizations) could prompt bursts of migration and spikes in posting behavior, potentially driving unique posters above 2.3 million, or even beyond 3 million if compounded by global news events or coordinated migrations.

Ultimately, while Bluesky’s unique poster count is closely tied to its headline user growth, actual daily posting is shaped by platform features, the competitive landscape, and the volatility of online trends. Short-term fluctuations remain possible, but the consensus based on current trends and expert analysis is a mid-range outcome (1.6–2.1 million unique posters) for June 28, 2025, with a credible range extending from as low as 1 million to as high as 3 million, depending on the interplay of predictable growth and unforeseen events.
