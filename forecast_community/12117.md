(a) Time left until the outcome is known:  
As of May 13, 2025, the resolution period ends December 31, 2025, so about 7.5 months remain until it is known whether Virgin Galactic files for bankruptcy protection before 2026.

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed:  
Virgin Galactic continues to operate at a substantial loss, with revenue far below what is needed to break even, and a history of heavy cash burn. The company is currently building its next-generation Delta spaceplane, aiming for commercial flights starting mid-2026. Financial reports from late 2024 and early 2025 show ongoing net losses (~$76 million per quarter), but the company retains several hundred million dollars in cash and recently raised some financing (~$28 million in Q1 2025). The stock price remains depressed but with some rebounds. No bankruptcy filings have surfaced so far. Without a sudden financial shock or loss of investor support, Virgin Galactic might continue operating under cash burn and hope for successful deployment of its Delta-class spaceplanes.

(c) Scenario resulting in a No outcome (no bankruptcy filing before 2026):  
Virgin Galactic manages to raise additional capital before the end of 2025, possibly through equity, debt, or strategic partnerships. The company carefully manages expenses and cash flow, possibly accelerating commercial operations or securing contracts for research payload flights to generate incremental revenue. Their Delta spaceplane program proceeds on schedule for mid-2026 flights, helping boost confidence. This prevents immediate liquidity crises and bankruptcy becomes unnecessary as investors continue to support the company until its operational ramp-up.

(d) Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome (bankruptcy filing before 2026):  
Virgin Galactic fails to secure significant new funding or generate substantial new revenues during 2025. Its existing cash reserves dwindle due to high operating expenses and capital expenditures on Delta-class spacecraft. Investor sentiment sours amid prolonged losses and uncertainty about commercial viability. The company’s credit position deteriorates, triggering creditor pressure or forcing management to seek bankruptcy protection as a last resort by end of 2025 to restructure debts or liquidate assets.

**Rationale**:

Virgin Galactic’s financial trajectory has been characterized by persistent losses, minimal revenues (under $2 million in 2025), and ongoing heavy cash burn exceeding $100 million per quarter. Although the company has about $657 million in cash as of early 2025 to fund its Delta spaceplane program, no major new funding rounds have been publicly announced recently, and market conditions for speculative space startups have cooled since their 2021 peak valuation.

The company is strategically focused on launching the Delta spacecraft in summer 2026 with commercial operations to follow in fall 2026. This represents a pivotal technological and commercial milestone. Achieving this could improve revenue prospects and possibly stabilize finances beyond 2025. However, the journey to this point involves substantial cash outlays and continued losses reported in Q4 2024 and Q1 2025.

Management has taken steps to reduce costs through workforce cuts but ongoing losses and weak revenue suggest financial strain. The lack of large recent capital injections implies that Virgin Galactic’s runway is limited unless new funding or revenue sources materialize soon.

Considering historical analogs, aerospace startups with similar profiles often face bankruptcy unless they rapidly improve revenue or secure investor backing. The risk is heightened because the question resolves on any bankruptcy filing by the end of 2025, regardless of final court outcomes.

While the company’s technological progress and positive statements might tilt sentiment towards survival, the fundamental cash burn and weak financial results indicate a more than 60% probability that the company could file for bankruptcy protection if substantial new financing or revenue growth does not occur before 2026.

**Final probabilistic forecast**:  
**Probability: 65%** that Virgin Galactic Holdings, Inc. will file for bankruptcy protection before January 1, 2026.
