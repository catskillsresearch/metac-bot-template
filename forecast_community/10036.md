The prospect of the United States and China aligning on the same side in a hypothetical World War 3 before 2060 is rendered highly unlikely by the prevailing geopolitical and strategic realities of the mid-2020s and foreseeable future.

The bilateral relationship has transformed from earlier cooperation—such as during World Wars I and II—into an acute, multidimensional rivalry. The U.S. now officially designates China as its principal strategic competitor, while China’s foreign and security policy is focused on challenging U.S. global leadership and reshaping the international order to better suit its interests. Both countries are thus investing heavily in military modernization and alliance-building aimed primarily at countering each other.

Key indicators of this adversarial trend include:

- **Systematic Bloc Formation**: The world increasingly appears split between a U.S.-led bloc—comprising NATO members, key Asia-Pacific partners (notably Japan, South Korea, Australia, and the Philippines)—and a China-aligned bloc, potentially including Russia and other nations opposed to U.S. dominance. Nearly half of experts surveyed in recent strategic foresight studies anticipate the globe being predominantly divided into China-aligned and U.S.-aligned spheres by the mid-2030s.
  
- **Direct Military Preparation and Flashpoints**: Both militaries are intensifying preparations for potential direct confrontation, with Taiwan widely cited as the most likely catalyst for a globalized conflict. U.S. military planners regularly war-game scenarios involving a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, and both sides are enacting strategies that assume the other is a principal adversary. The likelihood of conflict is further heightened by growing Chinese assertiveness in the South China Sea, sustained defense build-ups, and mutual trade restrictions.

- **Escalation Risk and Nuclear Deterrence**: The scale of strategic mistrust is such that both the U.S. and China are modernizing and expanding their nuclear forces, with significant risks of miscalculation or catastrophic escalation in any war scenario. This arms posture does not support the foundation of trust required for alliance formation.

- **Historical and Structural Obstacles**: While history shows that great powers may realign in the face of existential threats, China's current global ambitions, capacity, and ideological stance differ radically from those during previous alliances with the U.S. There is no precedent or clear mechanism for a realignment of interests between today's powers, given the depth of strategic competition across military, economic, technological, and ideological domains.

- **Potential for Cooperation—Highly Conditional**: The only plausible pathway toward U.S.-China alignment in a Third World War would require the emergence of a third, overwhelming existential threat that imperils both powers more than they threaten each other. Candidates for such alignment include a radical non-state actor armed with weapons of mass destruction, a technological singularity, or a global environmental catastrophe. However, there is currently no evidence that such a unifying threat is emerging or that it could override the entrenched adversarial dynamics now in place.

The ongoing reduction in economic interdependence, deepening security dilemma, and concerted efforts of each country to corral partners into rival blocs further reduce the likelihood of unexpected rapprochement. Although black-swan events—unforeseen, transformative shocks—cannot be entirely ruled out, the burden of historical precedent, current alliance patterns, explicit military planning, and strategic intent weigh overwhelmingly against the scenario of U.S.-China alignment in a global conflict before 2060.

In conclusion, absent a dramatic, global realignment driven by an unprecedented external threat, the structural forces and observable trajectories of the present era strongly favor the U.S. and China finding themselves as principal antagonists—rather than allies—in the event of a Third World War before 2060.
