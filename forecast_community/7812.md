The current strategic landscape suggests that Taiwan is unlikely to receive direct military support from allied nations in the form of military strikes against Chinese forces. This is primarily due to the strategic ambiguity maintained by the U.S. and other potential allies, which reflects the significant risks and costs associated with direct military confrontation with China. Historical precedents also indicate a preference for non-military responses in similar regional conflicts.

A scenario where Taiwan does not receive direct military support could involve China engaging in limited military actions that result in over 100 deaths but do not escalate to a full-scale invasion or significant conflict. In such cases, allied nations might opt for diplomatic condemnation, economic sanctions, and increased arms sales to Taiwan, avoiding direct military intervention due to the high risks and potential for broader conflict.

Conversely, a scenario that could lead to direct military support involves a large-scale and aggressive military action by China, perceived as clear aggression by the international community. This could include a significant escalation of hostilities, such as a large-scale invasion of Taiwan or attacks on critical infrastructure, threatening regional stability and global economic interests. In such a scenario, the strategic and moral imperatives to defend Taiwan might outweigh the risks, prompting the U.S. and other allies to engage in direct military intervention.

While the status quo outcome of no direct military intervention is more likely given the current geopolitical landscape, the situation is dynamic. Changes in the international political climate, military capabilities, and strategic calculations could alter this assessment over the next 25 years. However, the world tends to change slowly, and the deeply entrenched policies and strategic considerations suggest that the status quo should be given extra weight in the forecast.
