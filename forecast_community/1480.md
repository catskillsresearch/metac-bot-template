The probability of any intelligent being ever listening to Blind Willie Johnson's "Dark Was the Night" on Voyager 1's Golden Record is extremely low due to several significant challenges. The vastness of space and the small size of the spacecraft make detection highly improbable, especially given that Voyager 1 is no longer transmitting actively after its power supply depletion. As it continues its journey through interstellar space, the spacecraft is likely to remain undetected and undisturbed, potentially becoming a relic of humanity's past without ever being discovered or retrieved.

Despite these challenges, there remains a non-zero chance of discovery. Future human civilizations with advanced technology might decide to locate and retrieve Voyager 1 as an artifact of historical significance. Additionally, the possibility exists that an advanced extraterrestrial civilization could detect the spacecraft, recognize the Golden Record as an information storage device, and successfully decode and play its contents, including the song "Dark Was the Night." The potential for future technological advancements by humans or the existence of advanced alien civilizations provides a glimmer of hope for eventual discovery, even though the status quo outcome remains the most likely scenario given the current information and the slow pace of change.
