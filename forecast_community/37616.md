# Will Sudan Ratify AfCFTA Before July 1, 2025?

With only about 25 days remaining until the July 1, 2025 deadline, Sudan faces significant challenges that make AfCFTA ratification highly improbable. A thorough examination of the current situation reveals multiple barriers to ratification within this timeframe.

## Political Crisis and Governance Collapse

Sudan is approaching the second anniversary of a devastating civil conflict that has created a governance vacuum. The country is experiencing:

- Intense military confrontation between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and Rapid Support Forces (RSF)
- Competing claims to governance, with the SAF establishing a new government while the RSF declares intentions to form a separate government in areas under its control
- Fragmentation of civilian alliances and armed groups that further complicates any political resolution
- Risk of following "worst-case scenarios" similar to Libya (fragmentation) or Somalia (complete collapse)

This level of political disintegration has effectively eliminated the unified governmental authority necessary to undertake international treaty ratification.

## AfCFTA Ratification Requirements and Status

For a country to successfully ratify the AfCFTA, it must complete specific procedural steps:

- Conduct domestic procedures for ratification through a functioning legislative body
- Deposit its instrument of ratification with the African Union Commission (AUC) Chairperson

As of August 2024, 48 out of 54 signatories (88.9%) had deposited their instruments of AfCFTA ratification with the AUC Chairperson. Sudan remains among the six countries that have signed but not yet ratified the agreement. While Sudan had previously developed a draft National AfCFTA Implementation Strategy, this preliminary step falls far short of actual ratification.

## Comparative Analysis

Countries that have successfully ratified the AfCFTA typically operated from positions of:
- Relative political stability
- Functioning transitional authorities with broad recognition
- Active parliamentary processes

Sudan currently lacks all of these prerequisites. Unlike Liberia, which recently became the 48th state party to ratify, Sudan has no unified government capable of completing the domestic ratification procedures.

## Practical Timeframe Constraints

With less than a month remaining before the deadline:
- No evidence exists of any ratification process being initiated
- No unified government exists to undertake the necessary legislative steps
- The international diplomatic focus on Sudan centers primarily on humanitarian concerns and conflict resolution rather than trade integration
- The practical aspects of completing ratification would be extremely challenging even if a political breakthrough occurred immediately

## Probability of Ratification

The probability of Sudan ratifying AfCFTA before July 1, 2025, is extremely low. The entrenched nature of the conflict shows no signs of immediate resolution. Both the SAF and RSF remain committed to military approaches, governmental functions are severely compromised, and the timeframe is exceptionally short. While unexpected diplomatic breakthroughs are theoretically possible, they are highly unlikely given the deteriorating situation on the ground.

The weight of evidence overwhelmingly suggests that Sudan will not ratify the AfCFTA before July 1, 2025. The political and institutional paralysis caused by the ongoing conflict effectively prevents the country from undertaking the formal procedures required for ratification within the remaining timeframe.
