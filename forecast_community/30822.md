# Rationale for Eliminating the Department of Education Before 2026

The question of whether the US Department of Education will be eliminated through law or presidential reorganization before 2026 requires careful analysis of current actions, legal frameworks, and political realities.

## Current Status and Recent Actions

The Department of Education is currently in a precarious position. On March 20, 2025, President Trump signed an Executive Order directing the Secretary of Education to "take all necessary steps to facilitate the closure of the Department of Education". Prior to this, on March 11, 2025, the Department had already initiated a significant reduction in force (RIF) impacting nearly 50% of its workforce, reducing staff from approximately 4,100 to about 2,200 employees.

These actions demonstrate a clear commitment from the administration to follow through on campaign promises to eliminate the department. The White House has explicitly stated that "The Federal education bureaucracy is not working" and that "Closure of the Department of Education would drastically improve program implementation in higher education".

However, these efforts have faced substantial legal challenges. On May 22, 2025, Federal Judge Myong Joun in Boston suspended Trump's executive order and blocked the mass layoffs, ordering the reinstatement of fired employees. The judge ruled that the administration's actions would effectively prevent the Department from fulfilling its congressionally mandated functions.

## Legal Requirements and Constitutional Constraints

The complete elimination of the Department of Education requires congressional approval since it was established by the Department of Education Organization Act of 1979. The administration has acknowledged this legal requirement, with Secretary McMahon stating they will "follow the law and eliminate the bureaucracy responsibly by working through Congress."

The courts have reinforced this principle, with multiple rulings emphasizing that shutting down the Department requires an act of Congress. This underscores the separation of powers doctrine that prevents the executive branch from unilaterally dismantling statutorily created departments.

## Congressional Landscape and Political Realities

For the Department to be eliminated before 2026, Congress must either:
1. Pass legislation to abolish the department, or
2. Grant presidential reorganization authority that could be used to eliminate the department

Currently, Republicans hold 53 seats in the Senate, which falls short of the 60 votes typically needed to overcome a filibuster and pass major legislation without Democratic support. This presents a significant hurdle to achieving elimination through the legislative route.

There is a bill in the House calling for the elimination of the department by the end of 2026, introduced just last week. However, historical precedent suggests that eliminating cabinet-level departments is extraordinarily difficult. No cabinet-level department has been eliminated since the Department of War and Department of the Navy were merged into the Department of Defense in 1947.

## Potential Pathways and Timeline Constraints

With only about 7 months remaining until January 1, 2026, the window for action is narrow. Several possible pathways exist:

1. **Congressional Legislation**: Congress could pass a law explicitly abolishing or merging the Department of Education. However, the current political math makes this challenging within the timeframe.

2. **Presidential Reorganization Authority**: Congress could grant the president reorganization authority, which would allow restructuring of federal agencies subject to congressional oversight. However, such authority has not been granted since 1984, and there is no indication that the current Congress is moving to grant it.

3. **Continued Administrative Actions**: The administration may continue reducing the department's functions through budget cuts and reorganization, though recent court rulings suggest these efforts will face significant legal challenges.

## Impact and Opposition

Project 2025, which appears to be informing many of the administration's education policies, proposes eliminating Title I funding entirely, replacing it with no-strings-attached block grants to states. Analysis from the Center for American Progress suggests that removing Title I funding would potentially eliminate up to 180,000 teaching positions and negatively affect the academic outcomes of 2.8 million vulnerable students.

Opposition to eliminating the Department has been substantial. At least 20 states, teacher unions, and school districts have filed lawsuits challenging the administration's actions. The NEA President has stated that eliminating the department would be equivalent to "giving up on our future".

## Assessment Factors

Several key factors will determine whether the Department of Education is eliminated before 2026:

1. **Legal Framework**: Congressional action is required, and executive actions alone have been deemed insufficient by the courts.

2. **Congressional Support**: The 60-vote threshold in the Senate presents a significant obstacle, especially with the current 53 Republican seats.

3. **Timeframe**: With only 7 months remaining, the window for legislative action is narrowing rapidly.

4. **Judicial Resistance**: Court rulings have already blocked initial steps toward elimination.

5. **Institutional Inertia**: Major structural changes to the federal government face numerous institutional and political obstacles.

The most likely scenario is that while the administration will continue efforts to reduce the Department's size and influence, complete elimination through either legislative action or presidential reorganization authority appears challenging within the specified timeframe. The combination of legal barriers, congressional math, and the short remaining timeframe presents substantial obstacles to achieving full elimination before 2026.
