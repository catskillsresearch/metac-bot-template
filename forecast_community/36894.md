(a) **Time Left Until Outcome Is Known**  
As of May 10, 2025, there are approximately 4.5 months remaining until the end of Fiscal Year 2025 (September 30, 2025), after which it will be known if a reconciliation bill has been enacted and the final CBO cost estimate published.

(b) **Status Quo Outcome if Nothing Changed**  
If no reconciliation bill is enacted before the end of FY 2025, the outcome will be “annulled”—that is, there will be **no increase** in the deficit attributable to a 2025 reconciliation bill.

(c) **Outcome if Current Trend Continued**  
President Trump and Senate leaders are backing the Senate budget resolution, which allows for up to a $5.8 trillion increase in primary deficits from FY 2025 to FY 2034[1][4]. If a reconciliation bill is passed consistent with the Senate instructions, the CBO cost estimate is likely to show an increase in the deficit between **$5.7 trillion and $5.8 trillion**. If instead the House prevails, the outcome would be capped around **$2.8 trillion to $3.3 trillion**[1][2][4]. The trend (as of May 2025) favors the higher Senate-endorsed number.

(d) **Expectations of Experts and Markets**  
Expert budget groups (Bipartisan Policy Center, Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, Penn Wharton Budget Model) interpret current legislative signals as making a multi-trillion dollar deficit increase via reconciliation highly probable, with expectations centering around the $5.7 trillion Senate figure[1][4]. However, there is acknowledged risk of intraparty disagreement, potential Senate filibuster threats (if reconciliation rules are skirted), and last-minute negotiations that could reduce the final number.

(e) **Unexpected Scenario: Low Outcome**  
If intra-GOP divisions intensify—especially if deficit hawks in the House demand much deeper offsets or spending cuts as a precondition for passage—negotiations could stall. Alternatively, political or economic shocks (such as a debt crisis or recession) might force Congress to scale back the reconciliation bill, or prevent passage altogether, so the outcome would be $0 (annulled) or only a modest deficit increase below $2 trillion.

(f) **Unexpected Scenario: High Outcome**  
Should reconciliation instructions be maximally exploited, or if baseline/scorekeeping disputes tip in favor of the most generous interpretation, the final bill could reach the Senate maximum increase of $5.7–$5.8 trillion. Enforcement mechanisms might be weak, or projected offsets could fail to materialize, letting the ultimate score climb close to the allowed ceiling. However, exceeding the $5.8 trillion limit is extremely unlikely under current rules and CBO scoring.
