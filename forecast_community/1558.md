The Cavendish banana currently dominates the global banana export market, accounting for more than 50% of worldwide exports. This dominance is supported by its entrenched position in supply chains, projected market growth, and the lack of widespread adoption of alternative cultivars. However, significant risks could alter this status quo before 2035.

One major threat is the spread of Fusarium wilt TR4, a disease that could devastate Cavendish plantations worldwide. If containment measures fail and the disease spreads rapidly, it could lead to a significant decline in Cavendish production. In such a scenario, efforts to develop and adopt TR4-resistant cultivars, including genetically modified ones, would become crucial. However, these efforts face regulatory and consumer resistance, which could slow down the adoption of alternative cultivars.

Climate change also poses a risk by exacerbating the vulnerability of Cavendish plantations. This could further impact production and market share. Despite these threats, the development of resistant cultivars and improvements in agricultural practices could mitigate some of these challenges. The potential for increased regulatory and consumer acceptance of genetically modified bananas could also play a role in maintaining the Cavendish's market position.

The slow pace of change in agricultural markets and the challenges associated with replacing a dominant cultivar like the Cavendish suggest that a swift shift in market dynamics is unlikely. While there is a possibility of a significant change due to the combined impact of TR4, climate change, and evolving consumer preferences, the entrenched position of the Cavendish and the resilience of the status quo make it more likely that it will continue to account for more than 50% of global banana exports in the near term.
