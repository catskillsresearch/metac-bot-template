Based on the search results and the current date (May 13, 2025), I'll provide a professional forecasting assessment regarding formal negotiations between the United States and Denmark over Greenland's sovereignty.

(a) Time left until outcome is known: approximately 7.5 months (until January 1, 2026)

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: No formal negotiations announced between the US and Denmark regarding transfer of Greenland's sovereignty

(c) Scenario resulting in No outcome: Denmark and Greenland continue to firmly reject US overtures; US pursues alternative approaches like military repositioning or free association agreements without formal sovereignty negotiations; tensions remain but diplomatic channels focus on Arctic cooperation rather than territorial transfer

(d) Scenario resulting in Yes outcome: Economic or geopolitical pressure from the US becomes overwhelming; Denmark agrees to formal talks to defuse tensions; Greenland's independence movement gains momentum and pushes for formal three-way negotiations as a path to sovereignty that includes US recognition

## Current Situation Assessment

The evidence indicates strong opposition from both Denmark and Greenland to any sovereignty transfer to the United States. Recent developments from January through May 2025 show escalating tensions rather than movement toward formal negotiations:

- Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen has consistently emphasized that "Greenland is not for sale" and has characterized US approaches as "unacceptable pressure" and "not respectful"[3]

- Greenland's leaders across all political parties issued a joint statement after their March 2025 election describing US annexation statements as "unacceptable"[3]

- Public sentiment in Greenland remains firmly against US control, with 85% of Greenlanders opposing becoming part of the United States according to a January 2025 poll[3]

- European Union leaders, including European Council President Ant√≥nio Costa, have expressed support for preserving Denmark's territorial integrity[3]

## Recent US Approaches

The Trump administration has pursued several strategies regarding Greenland, but none have led to formal negotiation announcements:

1. Economic pressure: Trump has threatened to impose "very high" tariffs on Denmark if it blocks US efforts to take control of Greenland[3]

2. Military considerations: The US is reportedly considering transferring Greenland from European Command to Northern Command's jurisdiction, which Danish officials view with concern

3. Free association proposals: The US has explored a "Compact of Free Association" (COFA) model as an alternative to direct sovereignty transfer, but this would still require Greenland's independence from Denmark first

4. Intelligence activities: Reports indicate increased US intelligence operations in Greenland, causing diplomatic friction with Denmark

## Key Factors Affecting Probability

1. **Fundamental opposition**: Both Danish and Greenlandic governments remain firmly opposed to sovereignty transfer, with no signs of softening their stance[3][2]

2. **Greenlandic independence movement**: While there is support for eventual independence from Denmark, Greenlandic leaders have explicitly rejected becoming part of the United States[3]

3. **International pressure**: The European Union has backed Denmark's position, complicating any US attempt to isolate Denmark in negotiations[3]

4. **Alternative US strategies**: The US appears to be exploring approaches that don't require formal sovereignty negotiations, such as military repositioning and association agreements

## Probability Assessment

The status quo strongly suggests that formal negotiations are highly unlikely. For negotiations to be announced:

1. Denmark would need to dramatically reverse its clear and consistent position
2. Greenland would need to overcome overwhelming public opposition to US control
3. The US would need to offer concessions attractive enough to overcome fundamental sovereignty concerns

While the US continues to apply pressure through various means, there is no evidence that either Denmark or Greenland is moving toward accepting formal negotiations over sovereignty transfer. The evidence instead points to Denmark and Greenland strengthening their resistance, with Denmark increasing defense spending in Greenland and both parties receiving international support for their position.

The most probable outcome remains that no formal negotiations will be announced before January 1, 2026. Alternative US approaches (military repositioning, economic pressure, free association proposals) may continue or intensify, but these do not meet the criteria for a "Yes" outcome as defined in the question.

Probability: 5%
