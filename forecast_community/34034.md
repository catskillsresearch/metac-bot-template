## Rationale for the Likelihood of US-Denmark Formal Negotiations on Greenland Sovereignty Before 2026

The prospect of the United States and Denmark announcing formal negotiations over the possible transfer of sovereignty of Greenland to the United States before 2026 remains highly improbable, owing to a convergence of political, diplomatic, and societal constraints.

**Entrenched Opposition in Greenland and Denmark**

Greenland’s public sentiment is overwhelmingly hostile to the idea of US sovereignty; recent polling indicates that about 85% of Greenlanders oppose joining the United States. All five main parties in Greenland’s parliament, following the March 2025 election, issued a joint statement denouncing US overtures as incompatible with the values expected among close allies. Greenland’s Prime Minister has repeatedly and unequivocally stated that “Greenland is not for sale.” This unified domestic stance means that any move toward sovereignty negotiations would be politically untenable for both Greenlandic and Danish leaders.

Denmark, for its part, continues to emphasize that questions of sovereignty are solely for Greenlanders to determine, consistently rejecting the notion of entering formal negotiations. Danish authorities, supported firmly by the European Union, maintain that Denmark’s territorial integrity is non-negotiable and that any US pressure—even in the form of high-profile political visits, economic threats, or military posturing—only serves to strengthen Scandinavian and European resistance to such talks.

**International and Diplomatic Constraints**

The international context strongly favors the status quo. The EU and broader Western alliance have explicitly backed Denmark, with senior European leaders reaffirming support for Danish sovereignty over Greenland. Formal negotiations over a sovereignty transfer would represent a major breach of norms among Western democracies, where such territorial changes are exceedingly rare, especially in the absence of strong local support. The diplomatic and reputational costs to the US of forcing negotiations would likely outweigh any perceived strategic gain.

**US Strategy and Alternative Approaches**

Although President Trump’s administration has signaled an unusually high level of interest and willingness to use economic or diplomatic leverage—including exploring sanctions, tariffs, and high-profile outreach—these efforts have not produced any sign of movement toward formal negotiations. In fact, the Trump administration appears to be increasingly considering alternative arrangements, such as a Compact of Free Association (COFA) or enhanced security cooperation, rather than outright sovereignty transfer. These avenues could allow for closer US-Greenland ties—possibly increasing US influence over resources and security arrangements—without requiring the formal transfer of title that would trigger widespread opposition and complex legal procedures.

Discussions have also included direct US support for Greenland’s economic diversification and reducing dependence on Denmark, indicating a preference for indirect influence rather than headline-grabbing sovereignty shifts.

**Unlikely but Not Impossible Scenarios**

A Yes outcome—formal announcement of negotiations—would require an unforeseen shock: a dramatic political realignment in Greenlandic politics, a surge in pro-US sentiment, a crisis that shifts Denmark’s calculations, or extraordinary US concessions. There is no public evidence that any such shift is underway or imminent.

**Conclusion**

Given the entrenched opposition in Greenland and Denmark, reinforced by international norms and alliances, coupled with the absence of any substantial movement toward a change in sovereignty, the prevailing trajectory makes formal negotiations before 2026 highly unlikely. The US is pursuing alternative strategies that stop well short of sovereignty talks, and the political, diplomatic, and legal barriers remain formidable. Any significant shift would require an unprecedented and rapid change in attitudes among Greenlandic and Danish leaders and the public, for which there is currently no signal.
