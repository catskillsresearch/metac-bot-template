The decision over the next several years rests on the balance between longstanding policy inertia and potential shifts in the global security landscape. Currently, the United States adheres to a decades-long moratorium on nuclear explosive testing. This commitment is reinforced by robust investments in advanced computer simulations, subcritical experiments, and other non-explosive methods for ensuring the reliability of its nuclear stockpile. As long as technological advances continue to validate stockpile stewardship and diplomatic as well as arms control norms remain intact, the reliance on these alternatives is expected to persist.

However, there is recognition that a significant change in the international environment could alter this calculus. For instance, should there be confirmed low-yield nuclear tests by other major powers or other adversaries, such actions could create an escalating security dilemma. Coupled with emerging technical concerns about the aging arsenal that cannot be sufficiently addressed through simulations alone, intense geopolitical pressure might push U.S. policymakers to reconsider the efficacy of current methods. In such a scenario, a renewed full-scale nuclear test could be seen as necessary to demonstrate deterrence and signal a shift in nuclear strategy.

Overall, while the status quo strongly favors maintaining the moratorium, the possibility of a rapid escalation in international tensions or technical challenges leaves open a non-negligible risk that the policy might pivot toward resuming nuclear explosive testing before 2030.
