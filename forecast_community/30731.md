(a) Time left until the outcome is known: ~7.5 months (from May 13, 2025 until January 1, 2026)

(b) Status quo outcome: No PHE declaration for H5N1 avian influenza has been made by HHS as of May 13, 2025

(c) No outcome scenario: H5N1 continues to cause sporadic human infections primarily among those with occupational exposure, but no sustained human-to-human transmission emerges. The CDC maintains its "low risk" public health assessment, and case numbers remain manageable within existing healthcare frameworks.

(d) Yes outcome scenario: A significant mutation in the H5N1 virus enables more efficient human-to-human transmission, or the number of severe human cases increases substantially. The CDC elevates its risk assessment, and the HHS declares a public health emergency to mobilize resources and implement emergency measures.

As a professional forecaster, my analysis of whether the US Department of Health and Human Services will declare a public health emergency for H5 avian influenza before January 1, 2026, requires examining several key factors.

## Current Situation Assessment

As of May 2025, approximately 70 human cases of H5N1 avian influenza have been reported in the United States since 2024, including one reported death in early 2025. The vast majority of these cases are linked to occupational exposure from infected birds or dairy cattle. Most importantly, there has been no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission, which is a critical factor in PHE declarations for infectious diseases.

The CDC continues to assess the public health risk from H5N1 as "low" for the general population, though they acknowledge the ongoing spread among wild birds, poultry, and dairy cows across the country.

## Historical Context for PHE Declarations

Looking at past PHE declarations by HHS provides important context. Under Section 319 of the Public Health Service Act, the Secretary of HHS can declare a public health emergency if a disease presents a public health emergency or if a public health emergency otherwise exists[4]. Previous disease-related PHE declarations include:

| Outbreak | Human-to-Human Transmission | PHE Declaration | Key Factors |
|----------|----------------------------|-----------------|------------|
| H1N1 (2009) | Yes - Sustained | Yes | Rapid global spread, person-to-person transmission |
| Zika (2016) | Limited | Yes | Severe outcomes (birth defects), international concern |
| COVID-19 | Yes - Sustained | Yes | Widespread transmission, high severity |
| Mpox (2022) | Yes | Yes | Unusual outbreak pattern, person-to-person spread |

In all these cases, either sustained human-to-human transmission was occurring or there were significant, widespread health impacts. The current H5N1 situation lacks these characteristics.

## Key Factors Affecting Probability

1. **Transmission Pattern**: The most critical factor is the absence of sustained human-to-human transmission. For a PHE declaration to be likely, we would need to see evidence of the virus adapting to spread efficiently between humans[2][5].

2. **Case Severity and Numbers**: While there has been one reported death, the current case count remains relatively low compared to previous PHE declarations. The cases are primarily occupational exposures rather than community spread.

3. **Preparedness Activities**: There are signs of preparedness without emergency declaration. HHS has awarded $590 million to Moderna for developing mRNA vaccines against avian influenza viruses, indicating awareness of the potential threat but not immediate emergency status.

4. **Expert Assessment**: Public health experts express concern but not immediate alarm. As infectious disease specialist Jacob Lemieux described it: "We are living next to a volcano, and it may erupt or it may not, but we need to prepare for the possibility of a pandemic."

## Weighing the Status Quo

As a forecaster, I recognize the importance of giving weight to the status quo. The virus has been circulating in birds for years and in U.S. cattle since early 2024, yet no PHE has been declared despite ongoing cases. The threshold for declaration appears to be higher than current conditions.

Furthermore, a recent report found more than half of states unprepared for the next public health emergency, suggesting a system that may be reluctant to declare emergencies without clear evidence of significant and imminent threat.

## Time Horizon Considerations

With approximately 7.5 months until the January 1, 2026 deadline, there is time for the situation to evolve. However, for a PHE declaration to occur, we would likely need to see one of these developments:

- Evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission
- A significant increase in human cases or severity
- A major mutation that increases transmissibility

None of these factors is present as of May 2025, and there's no clear indication they will emerge in the coming months.

## Conclusion

Based on the current status of H5N1 avian influenza in the United States, historical precedents for PHE declarations, and expert assessments, the probability of HHS declaring a public health emergency for H5 avian influenza before January 1, 2026, remains relatively low. While the virus continues to circulate and cause sporadic human infections, the absence of sustained human-to-human transmission and the CDC's continued "low risk" assessment suggest that the conditions that have typically triggered PHE declarations are not present.

The status quo of monitoring without emergency declaration is likely to continue unless there is a significant change in the virus's behavior or transmission patterns. Given the information available as of May 13, 2025, and weighing the importance of the status quo in forecasting, I assess that a PHE declaration is unlikely but not impossible.
