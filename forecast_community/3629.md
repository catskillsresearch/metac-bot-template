The National Popular Vote Interstate Compact (NPVIC) currently stands at 209 electoral votes, representing 77% of the 270 needed for activation. Progress toward this threshold has slowed in recent years, with only 13 electoral votes added between 2020 and early 2025. No state has enacted the compact in the past year, and there are signs of potential setbacks, such as Maine’s active movement toward withdrawal, which could set a precedent for further defections.

Efforts to push the compact over the finish line now face steeper challenges. The states most likely to join—where NPVIC bills have passed at least one legislative chamber—represent a combined 74 electoral votes as of early 2025. However, these remaining states are predominantly Republican-controlled or politically divided swing states, which have historically shown little legislative appetite for joining the compact. All member states to date are reliably Democratic or left-leaning, highlighting a strong partisan divide that persists across the country.

Political polarization has hardened opposition in Republican-led states, and the aftermath of recent elections—such as Trump’s 2024 victory in both the national popular vote and the Electoral College—has lessened momentum among Democrats, further dampening prospects for near-term adoption. Even where public support for the NPVIC is strong, translating majority sentiment into legislative action remains difficult, with state-level inertia and party politics posing substantial barriers.

Moreover, the risk of reversals complicates the outlook. Active withdrawal efforts like those in Maine could reduce the current tally below 209, lengthening the distance to the 270-vote mark and potentially triggering similar reconsiderations in other states. The compact also faces legal uncertainties; while these would not affect whether the 270 threshold is reached, the possibility of lawsuits or constitutional questions may deter states from finalizing their participation.

Historical precedent suggests that major nationwide reforms requiring coordinated legislative action across numerous politically diverse states tend to be slow and uneven. The limited remaining pool of plausible target states includes some—like Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Arizona—where successful enactment would require a sweeping shift in political control or a dramatic realignment of bipartisan support, both of which appear unlikely in the near term given current trends. Scenario modeling underscores that even a wave of Democratic trifectas in key states would still leave the NPVIC just shy of the required 270 electoral votes unless nearly every target state fully enacts the compact.

In summary, while the NPVIC has achieved substantial progress since its inception, the remaining path to activation is beset by significant structural, partisan, and legal hurdles. Legislative interest persists in some quarters, and unexpected political realignments or a major national event could conceivably unlock further gains. However, recent momentum has stalled, risks of reversal have materialized, and the path forward relies on breakthroughs in some of the most resistant political environments in the country. Without a dramatic change in these underlying dynamics, reaching the 270-vote threshold before 2030 remains highly improbable.
