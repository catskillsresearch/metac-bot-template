(a) Time left until outcome: Approximately 7 months and 21 days (from May 10, 2025 until January 1, 2026)

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: "Neither repealed nor reduced" - the adders to tax credits established by the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act would remain in place.

(c) An unexpected scenario: Despite the Trump administration's executive order pausing IRA fund disbursement, bipartisan support emerges for clean energy incentives due to significant job creation and economic benefits in key states, leading to preservation of most adders with only minor modifications to qualification requirements.

The question asks about the future of tax credit adders established by the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) before 2026. These adders increase the value of the Investment Tax Credit (ITC) and Production Tax Credit (PTC) for clean energy projects when certain conditions are met.

## Current Political Context

The political landscape has shifted significantly with the Trump administration returning to power and implementing an executive order to pause the disbursement of funds appropriated through the IRA. This executive order explicitly targets the IRA as part of a "Terminating the Green New Deal" section, signaling strong opposition to the legislation's clean energy provisions[5].

Additionally, with Republican control of Congress, there is a clear pathway for legislative action to modify or repeal aspects of the IRA. The GOP leadership has consistently opposed the IRA since its passage, characterizing it as excessive government spending on climate initiatives.

## Economic and Industry Factors

Despite political opposition, several economic factors might influence the decision-making process:

1. **Established Business Investments**: Many companies have already made significant investments based on the IRA tax credit structure, creating momentum in the clean energy sector.

2. **Job Creation**: The clean energy provisions have generated jobs in multiple states, including Republican-leaning ones, potentially creating constituencies that would oppose full repeal.

3. **Budgetary Considerations**: Complete repeal could have budgetary implications that might complicate passage through Congress.

## Probability Assessment

The Trump administration has clearly signaled its intention to dismantle the IRA's clean energy provisions, as evidenced by the day-one executive order. While executive action alone cannot repeal the tax credits established by legislation, it demonstrates the administration's priorities. With Republican control of Congress, there is a clear path for legislative action.

However, complete repeal might face challenges from industry stakeholders who have made investments based on these incentives. A more politically expedient approach might be to reduce or modify the adders rather than eliminate them entirely. This would allow the administration to claim a victory in rolling back "Green New Deal" policies while minimizing disruption to businesses that have already committed resources.

The status quo remaining unchanged seems least likely given the explicit targeting of IRA funds in executive orders and Republican control of Congress. The timeline until January 2026 provides ample opportunity for legislative action, especially considering that tax legislation is likely to be a priority for the new administration.

While I acknowledge that the status quo typically has inertia, in this case, there are strong signals of imminent change. The executive order has already paused fund disbursement, and legislative action is likely to follow. The question is more about the extent of changes rather than whether changes will occur.

Repealed fully: 55%
Reduced incentives: 35%
Neither repealed nor reduced: 10%
