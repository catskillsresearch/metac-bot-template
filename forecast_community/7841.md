The BJP's loss of a single-party majority in the 2024 elections marks a significant shift towards coalition politics in India, a landscape historically characterized by less stability. This shift inherently increases the probability of a non-BJP Prime Minister before 2030 compared to the previous decade. Despite this, the BJP continues to lead a stable coalition, demonstrating resilience and maintaining power since 2014. The NDA coalition holds a comfortable majority, and the BJP's historical dominance and strategic coalition management have reinforced its position.

However, the potential for significant political realignments cannot be ignored. Scenarios that could lead to a non-BJP Prime Minister include the opposition alliance (INDIA) strengthening its unity and successfully challenging the BJP in the 2029 general elections, or significant defections and internal strife within the NDA leading to a loss of majority support. Such developments could result in a successful no-confidence motion against the BJP-led government, paving the way for the opposition to form a new government.

The opposition's ability to capitalize on any instability within the NDA or to secure a victory in the 2029 elections remains uncertain. Their capacity to form a stable government is yet to be proven, and significant political shifts would be required for a non-BJP Prime Minister to take office. Given the historical tendency for political continuity and the current coalition's stability, the status quo outcome of a BJP Prime Minister remains more likely. Nonetheless, the probability of a change in leadership is non-negligible, contingent on the opposition's strategic maneuvers and potential shifts within the NDA coalition.
