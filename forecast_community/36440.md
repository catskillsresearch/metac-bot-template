(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  
As of May 10, 2025, there are nearly 3 months (approximately 80 days) before the Tour de France finishes on July 27, 2025, and the official winner is determined.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
Tadej Pogačar is the overwhelming favorite to win the 2025 Tour de France. He is the defending champion with three prior Tour victories (2020, 2021, 2024) and dominated the 2024 season, including a rare "Triple Crown"—winning the Giro d'Italia, Tour de France, and World Championships[1][2][4]. He is considered to be at the peak of his powers and remains the leading contender according to all recent previews and betting markets[1][2][4]. If current trends and rider health persist, Pogačar is the expected winner.

(c) **Scenario resulting in an unexpected outcome:**  
A plausible path to an upset in the Tour de France often involves the sudden withdrawal or significant loss of time by a top favorite due to a crash, illness, heatwave, or team mishaps. For example, if Tadej Pogačar crashes or falls ill, Jonas Vingegaard—assuming he has fully recovered from injury—would immediately become the likely winner. Alternatively, if both top favorites face adversity, riders like Remco Evenepoel or Primož Roglič (who have Grand Tour victories but lack Pogačar’s Tour dominance), or emerging young stars such as João Almeida or Juan Ayuso could seize the opportunity. The Tour is notorious for such unpredictability, and even an outsider (“Other”) could emerge if chaos strikes the favorites[4][5].

## Rationale

- **Status Quo Weight:** Good forecasting practice favors the status quo—in this case, another Pogačar victory—because in elite men's cycling, especially at the Tour, the best riders win unless something goes wrong, and changes at the very top of the GC hierarchy are rare[1][2][4].
- **Moderate Probability for Alternatives:** However, due to the Tour’s dangers and the extreme unpredictability of a three-week Grand Tour, a nontrivial chance should be reserved for rivals like Vingegaard (the only man to beat Pogačar since 2020), Evenepoel (a podium finisher with time trial strengths), and experienced outsiders like Roglič. Young challengers and true outsiders also merit a small probability share due to both potential (Ayuso, Almeida) and the Tour’s history of surprise results[4][5].

Jonas Vingegaard: 22  
Remco Evenepoel: 9
