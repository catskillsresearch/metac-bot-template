The historical rarity of hurricanes with sustained winds of at least 33 meters per second directly impacting New York City suggests a low baseline probability for such an event. Historically, while New York City has experienced impactful storms, direct landfalls with hurricane-force winds are uncommon. However, the dynamics of climate change, including warmer ocean temperatures and rising sea levels, have increased the frequency and intensity of hurricanes in the Atlantic. This shift suggests a higher probability of a significant hurricane event occurring before 2030 than historical averages would indicate.

The potential for a "No" outcome remains significant, as storms may weaken before reaching New York City or track in such a way that they do not bring sustained hurricane-force winds to the city limits. Improved infrastructure and emergency response could also mitigate the impact of approaching storms. Nonetheless, the possibility of a "Yes" outcome is bolstered by the potential for particularly intense hurricane seasons driven by climate change, where a storm could track directly toward New York City and maintain its strength upon landfall.

Given these factors, while the status quo outcome leans towards "No," the increased risk due to climate change and recent forecasts of above-normal hurricane activity justify a higher probability than historical trends alone would suggest. The expert consensus and community estimates reflect this heightened risk, acknowledging the new climate realities and the potential for a significant hurricane event impacting New York City before 2030.
