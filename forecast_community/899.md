The likelihood of the richest person in the world in 2033 having a net worth equivalent to or greater than 2% of the United States' GDP is influenced by several factors. Historically, while the net worth of billionaires has been on the rise, it has not kept pace with the growth of the US GDP to reach such a high percentage. The current economic trends suggest that both billionaire net worths and US GDP are growing, but not at a rate that would allow a single individual's wealth to reach 2% of GDP. 

Several factors contribute to this outlook. The US GDP is expected to continue its steady growth, driven by economic expansion and inflation. Meanwhile, the wealth of the richest individuals is likely to grow at a similar or slower pace due to market saturation, regulatory pressures, and wealth diversification. Increased taxation on the ultra-wealthy and antitrust actions further limit the concentration of wealth in a single individual.

However, there is a possibility, albeit low, of a scenario where a technological breakthrough or economic disruption creates a new industry or market. This could lead to the rapid accumulation of wealth by a single individual, whose company experiences exponential growth, similar to the rise of major tech companies in the past. Such a scenario would require a unique market position, favorable regulatory environments, and tax policies that enable this concentration of wealth.

Overall, while unforeseen technological or economic changes could alter this trajectory, they are inherently unpredictable and thus carry a lower probability. The status quo and historical trends suggest that the probability of the richest person in 2033 having a net worth equivalent to or greater than 2% of US GDP remains low.
