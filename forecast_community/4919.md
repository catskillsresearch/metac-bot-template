# Will GiveWell Still Have Deworming as a Top Charity by End of 2025?

GiveWell has historically supported mass deworming as a highly cost-effective intervention, with organizations like Evidence Action's Deworm the World Initiative featured prominently among its top charities. As of early 2025, deworming charities remain on GiveWell's list of recommended giving opportunities, with significant ongoing funding commitments extending through the end of 2025.

## Current Status and Recent Developments

Evidence Action's Deworm the World Initiative has delivered over 1.5 billion deworming treatments since 2014, demonstrating a substantial long-term commitment to this intervention. Recent activity confirms continued implementation of large-scale deworming programs in 2025, including a campaign to deworm over 912,000 children across 14 Local Government Areas in Nigeria's Cross River State.

In January 2023, GiveWell made a $2.5 million grant to Evidence Action's Deworm the World specifically for technical assistance to deworming programs in eight states in India for 2023-2025. This funding commitment extending through the end of 2025 suggests continued expectation of support for deworming as a priority intervention.

## GiveWell's Evaluation Approach

GiveWell's position on deworming acknowledges the nuances in the evidence base. While they express high confidence that deworming reduces worm loads, they have less confidence in the causal relationship between reduced worm loads and improved life outcomes. However, GiveWell maintains that because the potential impact of deworming is massive if realized, the expected value remains very high despite uncertainty.

This expected value framework has been a consistent element of GiveWell's approach to evaluating deworming programs. The intervention's extremely low cost (less than $0.50 per child) strengthens the cost-effectiveness case even with uncertainty about the magnitude of long-term benefits.

## Evolving Funding Structure

GiveWell has been evolving its funding approach, increasingly making grants through its All Grants Fund alongside its more traditional Top Charities Fund. As of February 2025, the All Grants Fund continues to provide grants to both top charities and newer programs, including deworming initiatives.

This diversification represents an expansion rather than replacement of existing priorities. Even as GiveWell broadens its funding mechanisms, there is no indication of a fundamental shift away from supporting deworming programs that have been core to their recommendations for years.

## Key Factors Supporting Continued Deworming Support

Several factors suggest deworming will remain among GiveWell's top charities through the end of 2025:

1. **Institutional continuity**: GiveWell is generally conservative with rapid changes to charity recommendations, and deworming has been a core intervention for many years.

2. **Ongoing implementation**: Evidence Action and other partners continue to actively implement large-scale deworming programs in 2025 with GiveWell funding.

3. **Multi-year commitments**: The 2023 grant for India deworming programs specifically covers activities through 2025, indicating planned support through the period relevant to this forecast.

4. **Consistent evaluation framework**: GiveWell continues to value deworming's high expected value despite uncertainties, with no indication of a fundamental reassessment.

## Potential Disruption Scenarios

While the status quo strongly favors continued support for deworming charities, some factors could potentially disrupt this:

1. **New research**: A major study conclusively showing minimal long-term benefits could prompt GiveWell to reassess deworming's cost-effectiveness. However, there is no indication in current information that such research is forthcoming.

2. **Structural reorganization**: GiveWell might further evolve its funding model away from designated top charities. However, even in this scenario, the resolution criteria account for the possibility of deworming receiving at least 10% of discretionary grants.

Given the absence of signals pointing to either of these scenarios, they appear unlikely to materialize within the next seven months.

## Conclusion

The evidence strongly suggests that GiveWell will continue to include at least one deworming charity among its top recommended giving opportunities through the end of 2025. The organization's long-standing support for deworming, recent funding commitments extending through 2025, and ongoing implementation of large-scale deworming programs all point toward maintaining the status quo.

While GiveWell has evolved its funding approach and acknowledges uncertainties in the evidence base, the fundamental assessment of deworming as a high expected value intervention appears stable. The burden would be on showing why GiveWell would change its established position in the absence of significant new evidence or structural changes, neither of which appears imminent based on available information.
