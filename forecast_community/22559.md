(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  
There are just over 7.5 months until December 31, 2025. Given ongoing executive orders, legal maneuvers, and the possibility of a sale or shutdown, the final resolution could occur at any point, but by the end of the year, the outcome per the criteria will be clear.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
Currently, TikTok operates under successive extensions ordered by President Trump, after the Supreme Court upheld the divestment-or-ban law and ByteDance (TikTok’s Chinese parent company) has publicly refused to sell, citing political and Chinese regulatory restrictions. If nothing changes and ByteDance continues to refuse a sale and no new legal or executive action further delays enforcement, TikTok will be removed and remain unavailable for new downloads or updates from U.S. app stores after the deadline[2][3]. Users with the app already installed may still access it for some time, but it will increasingly fall out of compliance with the “available” criteria, as loss of over-the-air updates and access to content will diminish its reach and utility.

(c) **Scenario resulting in an unexpected outcome:**  
A less likely scenario would see either:  
- The Chinese government softens its position and allows ByteDance to sell TikTok’s U.S. business to a qualified non-adversary entity, possibly under significant U.S. and international pressure, preserving TikTok’s availability with a new owner.  
- U.S. political winds shift again (e.g., a dramatic change in Congress, new executive order, or regulatory reinterpretation) and the law’s enforcement is suspended, overturned, or technologically circumvented, allowing ByteDance to retain control and the app to remain available, contrary to current legal precedent and ByteDance’s stated public posture.
- Another variant: ByteDance finds a creative legal or structural workaround (e.g., separating TikTok's U.S. operations with no explicit 20%+ link to Chinese interests), satisfying the letter, if not the spirit, of the law.

## Rationale and Probabilities

**Weighting the status quo:**  
The best available evidence suggests that, as of May 2025, TikTok is available sporadically in the U.S. following Trump’s deadline extensions, but remains off the U.S. Apple and Google app stores due to compliance with the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act[3]. ByteDance’s refusal to sell and Chinese export barriers make a qualifying sale difficult, while U.S. enforcement will likely ramp up after the final extension[2][3]. Historic precedent in tech bans and divestments shows that, while political and legal delays are possible, ultimate enforcement typically prevails once the Supreme Court rules and bipartisan support is strong.

**Probability for “Yes, still owned by foreign adversary”:**  
Legal and political obstacles to this outcome are very high. The Supreme Court has upheld the law, and bipartisan U.S. will to enforce it remains strong[2][3]. ByteDance has stated it will shut down rather than sell, and current extensions are temporary and driven by executive action, not a permanent legal settlement[3]. Thus, the probability that TikTok remains *legally available* in the U.S. and still owned by a “foreign adversary” per the law is low: enforcement is likely, not least because U.S. companies and gatekeepers (Apple, Google) are directly threatened with penalties for compliance failure.

**Probability for “Yes, non-adversary owner”:**  
Despite political and regulatory complexity, there is a real chance that a sale will go through, likely at the last minute, if all sides feel the costs of a total shutdown outweigh the political or financial obstacles (e.g., if China acquiesces for economic/political reasons or ByteDance finds a workaround). Several U.S. tech giants have expressed interest, and in technology takeovers, last-minute deals are historically common—but the sale still faces formidable barriers from both ByteDance and the Chinese government[3]. Thus, the probability here is moderate.

**Probability for “No (TikTok unavailable in the U.S. by definition on Dec 31, 2025)”:**  
Given ByteDance’s stated preference for a shutdown over a sale, ongoing Chinese government resistance to a sale, and the current legal environment, there is a substantial risk that TikTok will not be “available” per the specific criteria at the resolution date. Even with deadline extensions, permanent availability would require either a successful sale or an extraordinary further delay or reversal, both of which are possible but not guaranteed. Delays and partial workarounds can’t indefinitely satisfy the “available” criterion if app store access and content library are disrupted for months.

## Final Probabilities

Option_A: Yes, still owned by foreign adversary: **10**  
Option_B: Yes, non-adversary owner: **45**  
Option_C: No: **45**

- "Yes, still owned by foreign adversary": 10%
- "Yes, non-adversary owner": 45%
- "No": 45%
