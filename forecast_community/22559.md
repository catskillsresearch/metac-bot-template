(a) Time until outcome known: 7 months, 19 days (from May 12, 2025 to December 31, 2025)

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: TikTok will be banned in the United States unless ByteDance sells to a non-foreign adversary entity by June 19, 2025 (the current deadline after President Trump's second extension).

(c) Unexpected outcome scenario: The Biden administration declined to enforce the ban initially, and President Trump has already extended the deadline twice. An unexpected scenario could involve Trump granting indefinite extensions through executive orders, effectively nullifying the law without formally overturning it. This could allow ByteDance to maintain ownership while challenging the constitutionality of the law through new legal avenues.

Based on the current information, I'll provide my probabilistic assessment of TikTok's availability in the United States by December 31, 2025:

The key facts guiding my forecast are:

The Supreme Court upheld the ban on January 17, 2025, rejecting TikTok's First Amendment challenge[2][4]. This eliminated ByteDance's primary legal avenue for retaining ownership. Under the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, TikTok was required to cease US operations by January 19, 2025, unless sold to an approved owner[1][2].

Despite this ruling, TikTok remains operational in the US due to President Trump's executive orders. After briefly suspending services on January 18, TikTok restored operations when Trump signaled he would grant an extension[3]. Trump then issued two executive orders delaying enforcement - first to April 5, and then to June 19, 2025[3].

ByteDance has indicated it would prefer to shut down TikTok in the US rather than sell, according to the background information. However, with the current deadline still over a month away, the situation remains fluid.

Looking at historical precedent, the status quo tends to have strong inertia. However, in this case, the status quo itself is temporary - the law has been upheld, and only executive action is delaying its enforcement. Without additional intervention, TikTok will be banned unless sold.

The June 19 deadline is approaching, and ByteDance must either:
1. Find a buyer acceptable to US authorities
2. Secure additional extensions
3. Face a shutdown in the US

Given the Supreme Court's decision, ByteDance has exhausted its main legal options. While President Trump has shown willingness to delay enforcement, indefinitely extending would effectively nullify a law upheld by the Supreme Court - a politically sensitive move.

For TikTok to remain available under ByteDance ownership, Trump would need to continue issuing extensions through December, or Congress would need to amend the law - both scenarios face significant hurdles.

A sale to a non-foreign adversary entity remains possible but faces significant challenges including ByteDance's resistance, the complexity of separating US operations, and finding a buyer with sufficient resources.

Therefore, my forecast is:

Yes, still owned by foreign adversary: 10%
Yes, non-adversary owner: 25% 
No: 65%
