(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  
The approval ratings to determine the outcome will be checked on or after June 28, 2025. As of May 14, 2025, there are approximately 6 weeks (about 45 days) until resolution.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
At present, Javier Milei holds a narrow lead over Claudia Sheinbaum in approval, with 61% to 60% according to Morning Consult as reported in April and early May[3]. If these numbers remained exactly the same through June 28 and were recorded by Morning Consult, the answer would be **Yes**—Milei would have a higher approval rating.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
A scenario where Claudia Sheinbaum’s approval rises or Milei’s falls, so that Sheinbaum either ties or leads Milei in Morning Consult’s rating at the reference date. This could occur if Sheinbaum maintains momentum from her early presidency and recent high marks in the Mexican media for economic and social policies, while Milei’s “wear and tear” as reported, or further local dissatisfaction, drags his rating below Sheinbaum’s[5].

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
Milei maintains or increases his slim lead, either by stabilizing his approval or by Sheinbaum experiencing erosion in hers—perhaps via policy missteps, negative shocks, or a reversion from a post-inaugural honeymoon period. If Milei’s approval holds at or above current levels and Sheinbaum remains flat or declines, the result will be Yes.

## Rationale

- **Status quo weighs heavily:** The best predictor for near-term approval is the current number, especially over a time horizon of just six weeks. While both leaders have experienced recent highs (with Sheinbaum even recording higher ratings than Milei in some earlier 2025 polls[3]), the Morning Consult numbers as of May 2025 give Milei a nominal 1-point lead—a margin easily within the error of typical polling, but still a lead.
- **Recent trends:** Sheinbaum’s early presidency has been marked by strong approval and media coverage for economic and anti-violence measures, with record-high approval figures in domestic Mexican polls (as high as 76–82%, but note these are not Morning Consult figures)[infobae][contrareplica.mx]. Her Morning Consult rating, however, lags behind some domestic measures, at 60%[3].  
  Milei, meanwhile, is showing signs of “wear and tear” in Argentina, with other polls suggesting a declining image, but Morning Consult still has him at the top of global leader approval, just ahead of Sheinbaum[3][5]. The situation is dynamic, and a plateau in popularity or slight decline for either is possible.
- **Volatility and polling error:** A 1-point gap is well inside the typical margin of error. Approval ratings can fluctuate weekly, especially for new leaders like Sheinbaum, who may still lose some “honeymoon” support. Milei’s rating could drop, especially if economic conditions worsen or new controversies arise.

- **External shocks and recent news:** Nothing in the provided context indicates an imminent major political or economic shock for either country. However, Argentine public opinion shows more polarization and dissatisfaction, while Mexican media for now remains strongly positive about Sheinbaum[El Cronista][infobae].

- **Recent comparison and trajectory:** While Sheinbaum’s non-Morning Consult polling is extremely positive, the key metric for this question is Morning Consult’s numbers. She has previously matched or briefly led Milei in Morning Consult’s rankings, suggesting some volatility in the gap[3][5]. Thus, the current lead for Milei is not “locked in.”

- **Forecast approach:** Given how close the standings are and the inherent volatility, probabilistic reasoning favors a small edge to Milei maintaining his lead, but not by much. This edge is primarily due to the status quo, as polling typically changes slowly unless driven by a major catalyst—which is not apparent for the next six weeks.

## Final Probability

**Probability: 55%**

This reflects a modest but real status quo advantage for Milei, with substantial risk of reversal given the closeness of the polling and the volatility noted in recent months. A virtually coin-flip scenario, but the current leader gets a slight bump.
