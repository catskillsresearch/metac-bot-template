A Canadian federal election was held in spring 2025, resulting in Mark Carney and the Liberal Party securing a majority government, while Pierre Poilievre and the Conservatives fell short of forming government. Critically, Poilievre lost his own seat in Parliament, leaving him ineligible for the office of Prime Minister under Canadian constitutional convention, which requires the Prime Minister to be a sitting Member of Parliament. As of late May 2025, he remains the Conservative Party leader but is not a Member of Parliament.

For Poilievre to become Prime Minister before 2026, an extraordinary and rapid chain of events would be required: he would first need to secure a seat through a by-electionâ€”a process that has not been initiated or scheduled and would require the coordination and cooperation of his party and a vacancy in a safe Conservative riding. If successful, the next hurdle would be an abrupt loss of confidence in the Liberal government, such as a failed confidence vote or a major parliamentary crisis, prompting either a snap federal election or an invitation for the Conservatives to attempt to form government. In this scenario, Poilievre, now an MP, would have to lead the Conservatives to an election victory or otherwise command the confidence of the House. All of this would need to occur within the narrow window remaining before January 1, 2026.

Canadian political systems are known for their stability, especially in the months following a clear electoral result, and majority governments rarely face immediate threats to their hold on power. In this context, there is no credible evidence or precedent for a party leader ousted from Parliament to re-enter via a by-election and become Prime Minister within such a short period. There are also no signs of imminent crisis or willingness on the part of the current governing party or Canadian political institutions to trigger such a dramatic change.

Although reports in some non-authoritative or foreign-language sources have suggested otherwise, all major Canadian and international outlets confirm that Mark Carney is Prime Minister and the Liberals are firmly in power. As such, the immense procedural and political obstacles standing in Poilievre's way render his path to the office of Prime Minister before 2026 virtually nonexistent, barring truly unprecedented and extraordinary developments.
