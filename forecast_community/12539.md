(a) Time left until outcome: 7 months and 18 days (until January 1, 2026)
(b) Status quo outcome: Mark Carney is currently the Prime Minister of Canada after winning the April 2025 election.
(c) No outcome scenario: Mark Carney's Liberal government maintains stability through 2025 with their recently secured majority, while Pierre Poilievre remains as Opposition Leader after losing his own parliamentary seat.
(d) Yes outcome scenario: Mark Carney's government collapses through a no-confidence vote, forcing another election before the end of 2025, which Poilievre's Conservatives win. Alternatively, some unprecedented constitutional crisis forces Carney to resign, and the Governor General invites Poilievre to form a government.

Based on the search results and current political situation in Canada, I'll provide a comprehensive forecast analysis regarding Pierre Poilievre's chances of becoming Prime Minister before 2026.

## Current Political Landscape

The Canadian federal election took place in April 2025, resulting in Liberal Party victory under Mark Carney's leadership. According to the election results, the Liberals secured a majority government with approximately 40.5% of the vote nationwide, while the Conservatives under Pierre Poilievre received 37.5%[3]. 

Critically, Pierre Poilievre not only failed to lead his party to victory, but he also lost his own seat in Parliament[2]. This is a significant setback that severely complicates his path to becoming Prime Minister before 2026.

## Key Factors Affecting the Forecast

### 1. Liberal Majority Government

The Liberals under Mark Carney have secured a majority government[4], which means they control enough seats to pass legislation without requiring support from other parties. Majority governments in Canada typically serve their full four-year terms barring extraordinary circumstances. With the election having just occurred in April 2025, Carney's government is barely two months into its mandate.

### 2. Poilievre's Parliamentary Status

Pierre Poilievre currently does not hold a seat in Parliament after losing his own riding in the election[2]. While he remains the Conservative Party leader, this lack of parliamentary presence presents a significant obstacle. To become Prime Minister, he would typically need to win a seat in Parliament, likely through a by-election.

### 3. Liberal Party Stability

There are no indications in the search results of any serious instability within the Liberal Party or the Carney government that would trigger another election before 2026. The government is newly formed and enjoys a "high probability" of maintaining a majority[4].

### 4. Constitutional Requirements

In Canada's parliamentary system, the Prime Minister must typically command the confidence of the House of Commons. With Carney's Liberals holding a majority, there is virtually no path for Poilievre to achieve this without another election.

## Probability Assessment

Given these factors, the probability of Pierre Poilievre becoming Prime Minister before January 1, 2026 is extremely low. For this to occur, we would need to see:

1. The collapse of Carney's majority government through some unprecedented crisis
2. The Governor General choosing to call an election rather than exploring other options within the current Parliament
3. Poilievre winning a seat in Parliament through a by-election
4. The Conservative Party winning that hypothetical election
5. All of this occurring within the next 7.5 months

The status quo strongly favors Carney remaining Prime Minister through 2026. Newly elected majority governments in Canada historically serve their full terms except in the most extraordinary circumstances. The fact that Poilievre is currently seatless makes his path even more difficult.

Some search results mention Poilievre planning to run in a by-election in Alberta, which could restore his parliamentary presence, but this alone would not make him Prime Minister while the Liberals hold a majority.

Looking at Canadian political history, there has never been a case where a newly elected majority government has fallen within months of taking office, making the scenario required for Poilievre to become PM before 2026 unprecedented.

## Conclusion

Status quo bias is particularly strong in this forecast given the recency of the election and the stability of majority governments in Canada's parliamentary system. The results clearly indicate Mark Carney's Liberals won a majority government in April 2025, while Pierre Poilievre not only failed to lead his party to victory but also lost his own seat. The constitutional and political obstacles to Poilievre becoming Prime Minister before 2026 are overwhelming.

Probability: 1%
