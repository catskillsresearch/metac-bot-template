(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  
There are about 7.5 months remaining until the deadline at midnight, January 1st, 2026.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
As of May 13, 2025, while many countries have *supported* or *called for* restrictive measures on solar geoengineering, there is **no evidence that at least ten countries have entered into a legally binding, treaty-level diplomatic agreement that restricts or discourages solar geoengineering**. Thus, if current trends persist without new, formalized commitments, the outcome is **No**.

(c) **Scenario for a "No" outcome:**  
Despite the growing momentum—public calls for non-use agreements from major international groups, regional bodies, and high-level political forums—the process stalls at expressions of support, resolutions, or calls-to-action. Countries do not formalize these stances into treaty-level obligations or binding diplomatic agreements before the deadline. As a result, by January 1, 2026, fewer than ten countries are party to a binding diplomatic agreement restricting solar geoengineering.

(d) **Scenario for a "Yes" outcome:**  
The current political momentum coalesces into formal, treaty-level agreements. For example, regional blocs such as the African Union or Pacific Island nations collectively sign a binding pact, and several European or Latin American countries join. This could push the total number of signatories to ten or more, with these commitments meeting the criteria of being legally binding treaty obligations that restrict, discourage, or bar solar geoengineering.

## Rationale

**The world generally changes slowly, especially in the realm of international treaties.** As of now, there is significant *political* and *civil society* momentum for an International Non-Use Agreement on Solar Geoengineering. Over 500 academics from more than 50 countries and nearly 2000 civil society organizations have called for such a pact, and the initiative enjoys vocal support from key regional and international actors, including:

- The African Ministerial Conference on the Environment
- The European Parliament
- Pacific Island states such as Vanuatu and Fiji
- Germany signaling willingness for dialogue
- Support echoed across Africa, Latin America, and the Pacific[2][5]

However, the **key limiting factor remains formalization**:

- To resolve as "Yes," at least ten countries must *commit as a matter of treaty obligation*—not just express support, pass parliamentary resolutions, or endorse non-binding statements.
- There is **no direct evidence that such a binding agreement covering ten or more countries has yet been established**[2][5].

International environmental diplomacy often proceeds cautiously. The moratorium under the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) does act as a restraint, but it is not a solar geoengineering-specific treaty, and enforcement or additional commitment levels vary widely between countries[5]. Political will is **high but fragmented**, and the translation from consensus statements and resolutions (African Ministerial Conference, EU Parliament) to binding, multi-party treaties often requires years, not months.

**Status quo bias is strong:**
- If momentum does not rapidly convert from resolutions and support statements into hard law, the threshold of ten countries will not be crossed before January 2026.

**However, there are signals for optimism:**
- Multiple regional bodies and blocs have come close to coordinating language and action, and this could accelerate the shift from political support to legal agreement—especially if a bloc (like African Union or Pacific Islands Forum) chooses to sign a single treaty or protocol[2][5].
- Ongoing concern over commercial solar geoengineering experiments (e.g., Stardust) may catalyze faster action if public or diplomatic pressure intensifies[5].

**Conclusion:**  
While momentum is building and the possibility of a "Yes" outcome is higher now than in recent years, the absence of evidence that at least ten countries have already made binding commitments means the status quo remains "No." The world often moves slower than activists and civil society hope, especially on controversial new technologies. Unless multiple countries act very quickly to formalize obligations in the remaining months, the question is more likely than not to resolve "No"—but a late surge in treaty ratifications remains plausible.

**Probability: 60%**
