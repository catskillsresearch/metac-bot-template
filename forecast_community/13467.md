A substantial and growing coalition of political leaders, academics, and civil society organizations is advocating for international restrictions on solar geoengineering. Over 500 academics from more than 50 countries, joined by nearly 2,000 civil society groups including Fridays For Future, are calling for an International Non-Use Agreement on Solar Geoengineering, emphasizing that such technologies are nearly impossible to govern fairly and could lead to significant risks, including the exacerbation of global inequalities and potential conflict. Political momentum for restrictive measures is especially prominent among African nations, Pacific Island states, and European countries. For example, the African Ministerial Conference on the Environment, the European Parliament, and governments such as Germany have all voiced support for a non-use approach, while the EU has backed Africa-led positions at the United Nations Environment Assembly.

Despite this mounting pressure, progress remains largely at the level of non-binding declarations, parliamentary resolutions, and national policies, rather than legally binding multilateral treaty commitments. Existing governance mechanisms, such as the Convention on Biological Diversity’s (CBD) de facto moratorium on geoengineering and regulatory frameworks like the London Convention/London Protocol, provide some institutional groundwork but fall short of establishing formal treaty obligations specifically targeting solar geoengineering. The process of transforming widespread political support into a binding international treaty is typically slow, often requiring years for negotiation, signature, and domestic ratification—particularly for controversial and technically complex topics like solar geoengineering.

Several significant obstacles persist. First, the limited time remaining before the 2026 deadline—around seven months—makes the prospect of negotiating, adopting, and ratifying a new treaty by at least ten countries highly challenging. Second, there is continued opposition or lack of support from major powers such as the United States, China, and Saudi Arabia, which not only slows progress but may also discourage broader global alignment. Third, while there are strong regional blocs in favor, there is currently no evidence that a formal treaty text is being circulated or that negotiations are sufficiently advanced to expect imminent success. The inertia of international environmental diplomacy, combined with geopolitical tensions and competing priorities at major global negotiations, further diminishes the likelihood of rapid progress.

Nevertheless, the strong advocacy from civil society, academic leadership, and a core group of proactive countries means that a diplomatic breakthrough remains possible—especially if catalyzed by an external event or a unified push at an upcoming international forum. The current trajectory, however, suggests continued non-binding agreements and national actions, with the threshold of ten or more countries entering into a binding diplomatic agreement to restrict solar geoengineering before 2026 remaining an ambitious, but unlikely, outcome given the prevailing circumstances.
