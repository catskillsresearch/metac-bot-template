The atmospheric CO2 concentration by 2030 is influenced by several key factors. Currently, there are approximately 5 years and 6 months until the end of 2030, providing a timeframe for potential changes in CO2 levels. If the CO2 concentration were to remain constant at the 2024 level of approximately 430 ppm, the outcome would be 430 ppm. However, the recent trend suggests an increase of about 2 ppm per year, which would result in a concentration of approximately 442 ppm by 2030.

Experts generally anticipate that CO2 concentrations will continue to rise due to ongoing emissions. This expectation is subject to variability based on policy changes, technological advancements, and natural carbon cycle feedbacks. There is a consensus that the increase could potentially accelerate if emissions are not effectively curbed, with projections suggesting concentrations could be in the range of 440-450 ppm by 2030.

Unexpected scenarios could significantly alter these projections. A significant global economic downturn or a major breakthrough in carbon capture technology could lead to a substantial reduction in emissions, resulting in a slower increase or even stabilization of CO2 levels. Conversely, increased industrial activity, reduced effectiveness of natural carbon sinks, or geopolitical events leading to higher emissions could accelerate the rise in CO2 concentrations beyond current trends. Additionally, a rollback of climate policies or a failure to implement effective measures could further exacerbate the increase, potentially pushing concentrations above 450 ppm by 2030.
