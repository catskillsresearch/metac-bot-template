## Rationale for Which Artemis Moon Mission Landing System Will First Land a Person on the Moon

NASA’s Artemis program is aiming for the first crewed lunar landing since Apollo through its Artemis III mission, now projected for no earlier than 2027 due to a series of technical, logistical, and funding challenges. The three primary contenders for the Human Landing System (HLS) are SpaceX, Blue Origin, and Dynetics, with SpaceX’s Starship currently contracted as the designated lander for Artemis III.

**Current Status and Trends**

SpaceX, as of mid-2025, remains the only company with a contract for the earliest crewed Artemis lunar landing attempt. Starship continues an intense test campaign with rapid hardware iteration, and NASA is deeply integrated into these development efforts. Despite encountering setbacks, such as technical anomalies on recent Starship flights, the pace of progress outstrips that of its competitors. Blue Origin, although selected as a second provider, is scheduled for subsequent Artemis missions and has not demonstrated a development or testing cadence that would allow it to overtake SpaceX in the near term. Dynetics’ involvement has further diminished compared to earlier Artemis planning cycles.

The expert and market consensus, reinforced by NASA’s own selection process and contract allocations, consistently positions SpaceX as the leading candidate. The design, integration, and schedule risks are significant, particularly regarding Starship’s required refueling infrastructure and the inherent complexity of developing a safe human lunar lander on an accelerated timeline. However, barring a dramatic programmatic or technical setback, SpaceX is expected to make the first crewed landing attempt for Artemis.

**Risks and Scenarios**

While SpaceX is the clear frontrunner, numerous risks could disrupt the expected outcome:
- **Technical Risks:** Major failures during Starship’s lunar demonstration, launch, or landing attempts could delay or prevent SpaceX from delivering on the Artemis timeline. Such events could result in NASA accelerating Blue Origin’s schedule or reopening competition.
- **Political and Funding Risks:** Shifts in US political priorities, budget constraints, or a significant Artemis program policy change could reshape or indefinitely postpone Artemis crewed landing plans.
- **Alternative Outcomes:** In rare but plausible scenarios, if Blue Origin achieves a technological breakthrough or NASA reprioritizes its choices due to external pressures or SpaceX setbacks, Blue Origin could become the first to land humans. Dynetics is not currently positioned for the initial landing.

**Unexpected Outcomes**

- **No Landing by 2030:** If technical, political, or financial disruptions stall Artemis entirely, none of the providers may achieve a crewed lunar landing before the 2030 deadline.
- **Early or Accelerated Success:** If SpaceX overcomes technical hurdles with exceptional speed and NASA expedites hardware qualification and crew readiness, a successful Artemis III landing could occur ahead of the latest schedules, potentially before 2027—though this is considered optimistic.

**Summary**

SpaceX’s Starship is the planned lander for Artemis III and remains the favorite to make the first crewed Artemis lunar landing, most likely in 2027 or later given current pace and challenges. Blue Origin is positioned as the secondary contender for later missions, and Dynetics has no timeline for a primary Artemis landing role. While technical, funding, or policy disruptions could alter the trajectory, all available technical progress, NASA selections, and expert assessments converge on SpaceX as the most probable provider to first land a person on the Moon under Artemis. There remains a nonzero risk of extended delays or alternate outcomes if unforeseen setbacks occur.
