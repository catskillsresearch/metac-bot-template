Rationale:

The Democratic National Committee's decision to remove Iowa's first-in-the-nation status for the 2024 election cycle has set a new precedent that significantly impacts the likelihood of Iowa regaining this position before 2029. This change was prompted by the problematic 2020 Iowa caucuses and longstanding concerns about the state's lack of diversity, which continue to be significant factors in the DNC's decision-making process.

However, the situation remains fluid, with ongoing debates about the primary calendar for 2028. Several factors could potentially influence a reversal of the DNC's decision:

1. Historical precedent: Iowa held its first-in-the-nation status for nearly five decades, demonstrating significant institutional inertia that could work in its favor.

2. Iowa's persistence: Some Iowa Democrats, including former Rep. Dave Nagle, have expressed determination to maintain their first-in-the-nation status, even if it means defying the DNC.

3. Potential reforms: Iowa could implement changes to address criticisms of its caucus system, making it more inclusive, efficient, and appealing to the DNC.

4. Political considerations: The DNC may reconsider Iowa's position to maintain support in a swing state, appeal to rural voters, and potentially help win back Midwestern voters in future elections.

5. New leadership: The appointment of a new DNC chair, Ken Martin, who has pledged a "fair and transparent" calendar selection process for 2028, opens the door for potential changes.

Despite these factors, significant obstacles remain. The DNC's recent actions, ongoing criticisms of the caucus system, and the push for more diverse early voting states all suggest that Iowa is unlikely to regain its first-in-the-nation status. The party's experience with the 2024 calendar will heavily influence their choice for 2028.

The long time horizon until 2028 adds uncertainty to the prediction, as political circumstances can change. However, the weight of evidence and the importance of the current status quo in forecasting suggest that it is more likely than not that Iowa will not host another "first in the nation" Democratic caucus before 2029.
