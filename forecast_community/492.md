# Comprehensive Rationale on Nuclear Disarmament by 2035

## Current Nuclear Landscape

As of July 1, 2017, nine countries possessed nuclear weapons:

1. United States (first test: 1945)
2. Russia (successor to Soviet Union, first test: 1949)
3. United Kingdom (first test: 1952) 
4. France (first test: 1960)
5. China (first test: 1964)
6. India (first test: 1974)
7. Pakistan (first test: 1998)
8. North Korea (first test: 2006)
9. Israel (undeclared program, date uncertain)

All nine states continue to value nuclear deterrence as a cornerstone of their security strategies, with none showing willingness to disarm or sign the 2017 UN Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.

## Trends Against Disarmament

The weight of evidence strongly suggests nuclear disarmament by any of these states is highly unlikely by 2035 for several compelling reasons:

### Modernization and Expansion

Rather than moving toward disarmament, all nine nuclear states are actively maintaining or expanding their nuclear forces:

- **United Kingdom** is making major investments in its nuclear program (approximately £15 billion), building new nuclear-powered submarines, expanding its nuclear deterrent, purchasing nuclear-capable fighter jets, and increasing nuclear-related defense spending to new highs.

- **France** is investing approximately €1.5 billion to upgrade military bases for nuclear weapons deployment and developing new warheads and hypersonic nuclear-capable missiles with plans extending well into the 2030s.

- **China** is rapidly expanding its arsenal, with projections suggesting it will reach 1,000 warheads by 2030 and potentially 1,500 by 2035.

- **United States** and **Russia** (which together possess the majority of the world's nuclear weapons) are both modernizing their arsenals, with arms control progress stalled or regressing.

- **India**, **Pakistan**, **North Korea**, and **Israel** all maintain or are expanding their nuclear forces.

### Deteriorating Security Environment

The international security climate shows increasing rather than decreasing tensions:

- Geopolitical conflicts (NATO-Russia, US-China, India-Pakistan, Korean Peninsula) have intensified since 2022, reinforcing perceived needs for nuclear deterrence.

- Many nuclear states explicitly cite external threats as justification for expanding nuclear capabilities. The UK, for example, references "Russian threats" as rationale for nuclear modernization.

- The Hiroshima Report 2025 indicates that "nuclear disarmament progress has been minimal, and a practical nuclear arms race is underway," while also noting that "the risk of nuclear weapon use is increasing."

### Doctrinal Entrenchment

Nuclear deterrence remains deeply embedded in military and security doctrines:

- All nuclear powers continue to publicly reaffirm nuclear deterrence as a central element of national security.

- Recent policy announcements by the UK, France, and US explicitly cite "delivering peace through strength" and being "prepared to secure peace through strength" as justifications for continued or increased nuclear arms spending.

- None of the nine states participated in the negotiations for the 2017 UN nuclear weapons ban treaty or have shown any intention to sign it, demonstrating their fundamental rejection of its principles.

### Verification Challenges

The verification requirements for complete disarmament present significant obstacles:

- IAEA certification of complete dismantlement would be particularly challenging for states with opaque nuclear programs (e.g., Israel, North Korea).

- The absence of trust and verification mechanisms between nuclear powers further complicates any potential disarmament process.

## Historical Context

The historical record offers little encouragement for disarmament:

- Only one independent state (South Africa) has ever developed nuclear weapons and then voluntarily dismantled them.

- Three former Soviet republics (Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine) gave up inherited nuclear weapons under specific post-Cold War circumstances that differ markedly from current conditions.

- These rare historical cases occurred under very particular circumstances absent from all current nuclear states.

## Possible Disarmament Pathways

While highly unlikely, there are theoretical pathways to disarmament by 2035:

### Dramatic Political Transformation

A complete regime change or revolutionary political shift within a nuclear state could potentially lead to a reversal of nuclear policy. Such transformation would need to fundamentally alter the state's security perceptions and doctrines.

### Comprehensive International Security Deal

A breakthrough international security agreement providing robust guarantees could theoretically make nuclear deterrence unnecessary for a smaller nuclear state. This would require unprecedented diplomatic achievement and trust-building.

### Economic and Sanctions Pressure

Severe economic pressure combined with sanctions relief conditioned on disarmament could potentially influence smaller nuclear states like North Korea, though such an approach has thus far proven ineffective.

### Regional Peace Agreements

A comprehensive peace agreement in regions with nuclear tensions (Korean Peninsula, South Asia) could create conditions favoring disarmament, though current trends show increasing rather than decreasing regional tensions.

## Expert Assessments

Independent expert analyses uniformly support the conclusion that disarmament is unlikely:

- The International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN) reports that while the total number of nuclear warheads has decreased slightly since 2017, the number of operationally usable warheads has actually increased.

- The Hiroshima Report 2025 explicitly states that "nuclear disarmament progress has been minimal" and expresses concern that "the risk of nuclear weapon use is increasing."

- The Atlantic Council survey indicates that experts anticipate nuclear proliferation rather than disarmament, with additional countries potentially seeking nuclear weapons in the next decade.

## Conclusion

The overwhelming evidence points to continued nuclear arsenals among all nine states that possessed nuclear weapons as of July 1, 2017. All observable trends, ongoing security dynamics, stated policies, modernization programs, and historical precedent suggest that disarmament by any of these states before 2035 is exceedingly unlikely.

While a dramatic and unforeseen geopolitical shift could theoretically lead to disarmament by one state (most plausibly a smaller nuclear power like North Korea), such a development would require a fundamental transformation of the current international security environment that shows no signs of materializing.
