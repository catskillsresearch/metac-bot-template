Avian influenza, particularly H5N1, continues to present a complex and evolving risk landscape for global public health. Since 2024, the situation has been notably dynamic, marked by a substantial rise in outbreaks among birds and, more unusually, in a range of mammalian species—including cattle—across dozens of countries. Despite this escalation in animal cases and sporadic zoonotic infections, human cases have remained rare, typically confined to those with direct animal contact, and there is still no evidence of efficient, sustained human-to-human transmission.

The World Health Organization’s (WHO) criteria for declaring a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) are stringent: the event must be serious, sudden, unusual or unexpected; carry implications for public health beyond the affected national border; and potentially require a coordinated international response. In the case of avian influenza, a declaration would likely hinge on substantial human outbreaks, a clear signal of increased transmission efficiency, or strong evidence of imminent international spread.

Current scientific concerns focus on the virus’s adaptability. The surge in mammalian infections has increased the opportunities for genetic reassortment, and multiple mutations that could theoretically enable the virus to transmit more easily among humans have been identified in recent surveillance. Experts warn that the adaptation of H5N1 to mammals—especially livestock—could accelerate this process, thus increasing the baseline risk of a consequential evolutionary leap.

Institutionally, global health authorities are operating with heightened vigilance post-COVID-19. Surveillance, preparedness, and response systems have been expanded, and there is a greater willingness to convene emergency committees and even consider preemptive action in the face of unusual events. This increased sensitivity could lower the threshold for a PHEIC declaration if the epidemiological situation were to shift rapidly toward more severe or widespread human cases.

Nevertheless, formidable barriers remain. Decades of avian influenza circulation have yet to produce the constellation of mutations needed for efficient human-to-human spread. Most human infections continue to trace back to direct contact with infected animals, not community transmission. The official risk assessment by the WHO as of mid-2025 is that the global public health threat remains low, and interventions have focused primarily on surveillance and containment, not emergency international coordination.

In summary, the risk of a PHEIC declaration for avian influenza in humans before 2030 is meaningfully elevated compared to past decades due to the increased mutation opportunity, expanding host range, and institutional risk aversion. However, the status quo—a pattern of animal outbreaks with only rare, non-sustained zoonotic spillover—still predominates. Unless a significant shift occurs in the virus’s ability to transmit between humans, or an unusual and severe cluster of human cases with international implications emerges, the established pattern is likely to persist. The global community remains alert and prepared, but a PHEIC declaration would require a notable escalation in human risk that has not yet materialized.
