# Will the National UFO Reporting Center report a cube-shaped UFO in June 2025?

## NUFORC's Reporting System and Historical Context

The National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC) has been collecting and documenting UFO/UAP sighting reports since its founding in 1974, creating what is now the largest independently collected database of UFO sightings available online. The organization maintains a comprehensive reporting system that categorizes sightings by various characteristics including date, location, and shape of the reported object.

NUFORC grades reports according to a four-tier classification system based on credibility and characteristics:
- Tier 1: Most dramatic sightings - strange structured craft or highly anomalous phenomena seen at close distance
- Tier 2: Objects exhibiting unusual characteristics like incredible speed or non-inertial turns
- Tier 3: Other reports that cannot be easily explained
- Tier 4: Reports potentially explainable by human or natural phenomena

This systematic approach to categorization ensures thorough processing of incoming reports, including proper classification by shape.

## Cube-Shaped UFO Reports: Historical Precedent

Cube-shaped UFO reports, while not the most common shape category in NUFORC's database, do occur with some regularity. A notable precedent exists in the six cube-shaped UFO sightings documented in December 2024. This recent historical data point establishes that:

1. Cube-shaped UFOs are recognized within NUFORC's classification taxonomy
2. Multiple such reports can occur within a single month
3. The phenomenon has been observed in the relatively recent past

## Reporting Infrastructure and Accessibility

NUFORC maintains multiple channels for reporting UFO sightings, making it easy for witnesses to submit their experiences:

1. An online reporting form on their website that collects detailed information about sightings, including shape descriptions
2. A 24/7 telephone hotline (206-722-3000) for direct reporting, particularly for recent sightings

This robust reporting infrastructure increases the likelihood that any cube-shaped UFO sightings occurring in June 2025 would be reported to NUFORC.

## Public Awareness and Institutional Recognition

NUFORC enjoys widespread recognition among official channels that might receive UFO reports. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) specifically instructs pilots to refer UFO encounters to NUFORC. Additionally, law enforcement agencies, military installations, NASA, and 911 dispatch centers often direct UFO-related calls to the Center. This institutional recognition enhances the probability that cube-shaped UFO sightings would be channeled to NUFORC.

## Factors Affecting the June 2025 Forecast

Several factors influence the likelihood of a cube-shaped UFO report in June 2025:

**Supporting Factors:**
1. The established precedent of six cube-shaped sightings in December 2024 demonstrates these reports occur with some frequency
2. NUFORC's comprehensive reporting system continues to operate effectively in 2025
3. The organization's multiple reporting channels make it easy for witnesses to submit sightings
4. Widespread institutional recognition directs potential reporters to NUFORC

**Limiting Factors:**
1. Cube shapes appear to be relatively uncommon compared to other UFO shapes
2. NUFORC filters out "obvious hoaxes," potentially reducing the number of published cube-shaped reports
3. Without data on monthly patterns, it's unclear if there are seasonal trends that might affect June specifically
4. NUFORC processes reports "periodically," which could cause delays between submission and publication

## Analysis of Reporting Patterns

NUFORC has processed over 180,000 reports throughout its history, indicating a substantial volume of incoming sightings. The organization continues to actively collect and publish reports in 2025, maintaining their long-standing practice of categorizing sightings by characteristics including shape.

Given the status quo of NUFORC's operations and the historical precedent of multiple cube-shaped sightings in a single month, it seems more likely than not that at least one cube-shaped UFO will be reported in June 2025. The established reporting infrastructure, combined with NUFORC's continued prominence as the primary independent UFO reporting center, provides a reliable pathway for such reports to be submitted and documented.
