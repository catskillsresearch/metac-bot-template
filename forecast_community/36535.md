Rationale:

The US Dollar Index (DXY) currently stands at around 99-100, providing a significant buffer above the 88 threshold. Historical data shows that while the DXY has experienced volatility, it has rarely dropped below 90 in recent years, let alone 88. The most likely scenario is that the DXY will remain above this threshold, given current economic conditions and policy stances.

However, several factors could potentially weaken the dollar over the next 3.5 years:

1. Political uncertainty: Tariff policies and potential conflicts with the Federal Reserve could create instability.
2. Economic challenges: Recent data shows some signs of economic weakening, which could pressure the dollar if it intensifies.
3. Global shifts: Changes in other major economies, particularly the Eurozone, could affect the DXY's composition and strength relative to other currencies.
4. Trade tensions: Escalating conflicts, especially with China and the EU, could have unexpected economic consequences.
5. Fiscal concerns: Long-term issues related to US government spending, tax cuts, and debt levels may erode confidence in the dollar.

Despite these risks, a scenario where the DXY drops below 88 for a sustained 90-day period would require a perfect storm of negative factors. This might include a severe US recession, loss of global confidence in US fiscal policy, aggressive Federal Reserve rate cuts, and significant strengthening of other major currencies.

The extended time frame until 2029 increases uncertainty and the possibility of unforeseen events that could dramatically impact the dollar's value. However, the dollar's status as a global reserve currency and safe-haven asset provides significant support.

While a drop below 88 is possible, it remains unlikely given current conditions and the historical resilience of the US dollar. Such a scenario would require a combination of severe negative factors to push the index that low for a sustained period. The Federal Reserve's cautious approach and the relative strength of the US economy compared to other major economies further reinforce the low probability of this outcome.
