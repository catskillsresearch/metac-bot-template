(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**
The inflation rate for the full year 2025 will be confirmed in early 2026, typically in January when the official IPCA data are released. As of May 12, 2025, about 7–8 months remain until the final annual outcome is known.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**
If current trends persist, Brazil’s inflation in 2025 will be higher than in 2024. The latest available inflation rate is 5.53% year-over-year in April 2025, versus 4.37% for all of 2024[1]. Projections for the rest of 2025 remain above 5%, and there is no current evidence of a sharp downward turn.

(c) **A scenario that results in a No outcome (inflation in 2025 is NOT lower than in 2024):**
- Inflation remains elevated or continues rising through 2025.
- Persistent pressures: Depreciated currency, fiscal challenges, and external shocks keep prices high.
- Monetary tightening fails to quickly reduce inflation, or lagged effects mean relief only appears in 2026[1][4][5].
- The annual average for 2025 ends above 4.37%.

(d) **A scenario that results in a Yes outcome (inflation in 2025 IS lower than in 2024):**
- Inflation falls sharply in the second half of 2025 due to unexpected positive shocks (e.g., stronger currency, rapid drop in commodity/import prices, effective fiscal adjustment).
- Tight monetary policy has rapid effect, driving significant monthly declines.
- However, given the current trajectory (5.53% YoY as of April), inflation would have to fall well below 4% for the remainder of 2025 to bring the annual average below 4.37%, which is unlikely absent extraordinary developments[1][4][5].

**Rationale and Probability Estimate:**

Recent data indicate inflation is running notably above last year’s pace: April 2025 inflation is 5.53% YoY compared to the 4.37% realized for 2024[1]. Most forecasts for 2025 from analysts and institutions remain above 5%, even factoring in possible moderation later in the year[1][2][3][4][5]. Monetary tightening is expected to continue, but any reduction in inflation will likely materialize fully only in 2026[5].

Historically, inflation trends are slow to reverse unless there is a dramatic policy or external shift. With almost half the year already showing inflation well above 2024 levels, the probability that the full-year 2025 inflation rate will end below 4.37% is very low—this would require average monthly deflation or very low inflation for the rest of the year, which no mainstream forecast suggests.

**Probability: 95%**
