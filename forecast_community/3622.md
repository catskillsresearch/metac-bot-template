A range of demographic, institutional, and market factors are shaping expectations for Harvard’s undergraduate admit rate for the Class of 2029.

The official admit rate will be released in fall 2025, with only a few months remaining until the outcome is known. In previous years, Harvard’s admit rate has hovered at historic lows: 4.6% for the Class of 2023, 4.9% for the Class of 2024, and 3.43% for the Class of 2025, the latter reflecting a spike in pandemic-era applications.

Historically, Harvard’s admit rate has followed a steady downward trajectory due to rising application numbers coupled with a stable class size, creating record competition. However, the admissions landscape for the Class of 2029 is characterized by several countervailing forces. Notably, peer Ivy League institutions have reported *increases* in acceptance rates for the Class of 2029, breaking the long-standing trend of year-over-year declines. Yale’s admit rate climbed to 4.59% (up from 3.7%), with similar increases at Columbia, Brown, and Dartmouth. These shifts align with reports of falling application numbers across the Ivy League, spurred in part by a shrinking pool of college-age applicants and changing perceptions of elite higher education, both in the United States and abroad.

Several external factors are influencing application behavior. Demographically, the U.S. faces an approaching "enrollment cliff" due to declining birth rates post-2007, which is projected to sharply reduce the number of high school graduates and, in turn, college applicants beginning around 2025. This broader context suggests that, barring disruptive events, elite universities like Harvard will see at least a modest increase in admit rates, as fewer applicants contend for a similar number of seats.

Harvard itself has also introduced major policy changes, most notably a significant expansion of financial aid announced in early 2025, making tuition free for families earning up to $200,000. While such a move could attract increased interest from middle- and upper-middle-income students who previously viewed Harvard as financially out of reach, this effect may be mitigated by the larger demographic downturn. Additionally, shifting public attitudes—skepticism toward the value of elite degrees, ongoing debates over admissions fairness, and legal or regulatory changes—could further suppress application growth.

Unexpected events remain possible. A sudden surge in applications, perhaps driven by a dramatic global event, viral news, or an influx of international interest, could still push the admit rate to new lows. Conversely, an abrupt drop in applications—owing to scandal, policy change, or further negative sentiment about elite institutions—could drive the admit rate higher than at any time in the past decade.

Synthesizing these trends, the most consistent signals point to a modest rebound in Harvard’s admit rate for the Class of 2029 compared to the pandemic-era lows, in line with increases observed at peer institutions. However, unprecedented policy and market shocks could still swing the outcome in either direction.
