Based on the search results and the current date of May 13, 2025, I'll provide a forecast for Harvard's admission rate for the Class of 2029.

(a) Time left until the outcome is known: Approximately 6-8 months. Harvard typically releases final admissions statistics in late 2025 or early 2026, as indicated by their statement that they will "release admissions data, including final numbers of enrolled students consistent with our mandatory reporting to the U.S. Department of Education"[1].

(b) The outcome if nothing changed: 3.43%, which was Harvard's admit rate for the Class of 2025[4][5].

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued: Based on recent trends, the admit rate would be around 3.4-3.7%. Harvard's admit rates have stabilized in the very low 3% range after the significant drop from 4.9% (Class of 2024) to 3.43% (Class of 2025)[2][4][5].

(d) The expectations of experts and markets: According to the most recent data, Ivy League universities have seen a slight increase in acceptance rates for the Class of 2029 while application numbers have generally fallen. Yale's acceptance rate increased from 3.7% to 4.59%, Columbia's from 3.86% to 4.29%, Brown's from 5.4% to 5.65%, and Dartmouth's from 5.3% to 6%[5]. This suggests a potential slight easing of selectivity across elite institutions.

(e) Unexpected scenario - low outcome (more selective): Harvard implements a new strategic initiative to attract more international applicants or introduces a new financial aid program (like their recently announced free tuition for families making under $200,000), leading to a surge in applications while maintaining the same number of admits (around 1,970). This could push the admit rate down to 3.0% or lower.

(f) Unexpected scenario - high outcome (less selective): A combination of demographic shifts, changes in student preferences away from elite universities, and policy changes could lead to a substantial decrease in applications to Harvard. If applications dropped significantly while Harvard maintained its class size, the admit rate could rise to 4.5% or higher.

Given that Harvard has maintained remarkable consistency in the absolute number of students admitted (around 1,970)[5] and considering the recent trend of slight increases in admission rates across Ivy League schools for the Class of 2029, I forecast the following distribution for Harvard's Class of 2029 admit rate:

Percentile 10: 3.1
Percentile 20: 3.25
Percentile 40: 3.4
Percentile 60: 3.6
Percentile 80: 3.9
Percentile 90: 4.2
