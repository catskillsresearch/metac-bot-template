The global fertility rate is projected to experience a decline over the next 25 years, with the current trend suggesting a decrease from approximately 2.25 children per woman in 2024 to around 1.8 children per woman by 2050. This projection is supported by recent modeling and expert analysis from authoritative sources such as the United Nations and the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, which estimate a range of 1.8 to 2.1 children per woman by mid-century.

Several factors could influence this trajectory. On the one hand, a significant global economic downturn or the widespread adoption of technology that delays family formation could push the fertility rate below 1.8. Additionally, policies that enhance women's education and workforce participation might further accelerate the decline in fertility rates.

Conversely, a global cultural shift towards larger families, driven by effective pro-natal policies or a major religious revival, could counteract the declining trend. Technological advancements in fertility treatments and a societal emphasis on family values might also contribute to stabilizing or even slightly increasing the fertility rate, potentially keeping it closer to 2.1 children per woman.

Overall, while the central estimate points towards a continued decline, the interplay of economic, cultural, and policy factors will be crucial in determining the actual global fertility rate by 2050.
