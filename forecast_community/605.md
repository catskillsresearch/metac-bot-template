## Rationale for Projected Global Warming by 2100

By 2100, the amount of global warming will depend critically on the trajectory of greenhouse gas emissions, the effectiveness and ambition of policy responses, the pace of technological innovation, and the responsiveness of the climate system itself.

Under current global policies and the present emissions trajectory, the central estimate is that global average temperature will rise by approximately 2.7°C to 2.9°C above pre-industrial levels by the end of the century. This reflects a continuation of current mitigation efforts and international commitments that are already in place, but not the full implementation of all announced or aspirational targets. Leading climate models and major scientific assessments converge on this warming range as the most probable outcome if policy remains relatively static and existing emission trends continue.

Expert analyses and market expectations reinforce this assessment, with the majority of climate scientists and relevant organizations expressing skepticism that warming can be limited to below 2°C—let alone the more ambitious 1.5°C target—without a significant and rapid intensification of mitigation efforts. If all current net-zero pledges, national targets, and technological roadmaps were fully realized, there is potential to limit warming to about 1.9°C; however, this scenario is increasingly viewed as optimistic given the challenges in policy implementation, political coordination, and technological scale-up required.

A major source of uncertainty remains the possibility of climate system feedbacks—such as accelerated methane release from thawing permafrost or reductions in the Earth’s albedo from melting ice—which could drive much higher warming than models currently project. If policy backslides, fossil fuel use surges, or climate sensitivity turns out to be on the high end of scientific estimates, there is a substantial probability that warming could exceed 3.1°C, with a roughly 10% chance of reaching or surpassing 3.4°C. In the most extreme and adverse scenarios—where feedbacks compound, political cooperation collapses, and emissions continue to rise sharply—warming could approach or exceed 4°C, with significant regional variations and severe impacts on ecosystems and human societies.

Conversely, an unexpectedly low warming outcome would require transformative and rapid global change: breakthroughs in negative emissions technologies (such as direct air capture and storage), global adoption of clean energy at massive scale, large-scale carbon removal, robust international cooperation, and perhaps favorable natural events (such as large volcanic eruptions or successful solar geoengineering). Such a scenario could, in principle, limit warming to around or slightly below 1.5°C, but would demand levels of innovation, investment, and coordination currently unforeseen.

In summary, the best-supported scientific evidence points to a most likely range of 2.7°C to 2.9°C warming by 2100 if current trends persist, with downward and upward deviations possible depending on the resolution of policy, innovation, and climate system uncertainties. Risks of much higher warming remain due to feedbacks and policy failures, while scenarios limiting warming well below 2°C would necessitate extraordinary and rapid progress on all mitigation fronts.
