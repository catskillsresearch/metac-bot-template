# IBEX 35 Year-End Outlook: Will 2025 Close Higher Than It Started?

The IBEX 35 has demonstrated remarkable performance in 2025, increasing by approximately 23.38% or 2,711 points since the beginning of the year, with the index trading around 14,300 points as of late May. This represents a substantial buffer of over 2,700 points above the starting value of 11,595.00.

## Economic Fundamentals Supporting the IBEX 35

Spain's economic outlook remains distinctly positive compared to its European counterparts. The country is projected to grow 2.3% in 2025, which, while slower than the 3.0% forecast for 2024, still significantly outpaces projections for Germany (0.7%), France (0.8%), and Italy (1.0%). This economic outperformance provides a solid foundation for continued strength in Spanish equities.

The banking sector, which carries substantial weight in the index, has been a key driver of the IBEX 35's gains in 2025. Major Spanish banks have posted impressive year-to-date performance, with Banco Sabadell, Banco Santander, and BBVA all showing gains above 20%. This sector's strength has been instrumental in propelling the index to levels not seen since 2008.

## Recent Market Performance and Momentum

The IBEX 35 has shown impressive resilience and momentum through most of 2025. By mid-May, it reached a new five-year high, trading around 13,660 points, shaking off earlier concerns about potential US tariffs. The index has demonstrated the ability to recover from temporary setbacks, as evidenced by its 16.2% gain in just over a month following a brief dip in early April due to trade tension concerns.

This performance has made the IBEX 35 one of the best-performing equity indices in Europe year-to-date, opening the largest annual return gap against Wall Street since 1996. The index has accumulated multiple sessions of gains, highlighting strong underlying momentum and investor confidence.

## Key Risk Factors

Despite the positive outlook, several significant risks could potentially threaten the IBEX 35's year-to-date gains:

1. **Trade Tensions**: The most immediate threat comes from potential US tariffs on EU products. US President Donald Trump temporarily paused these measures in mid-April under a truce with Brussels and recently announced a preliminary trade agreement with China. However, a resurrection and implementation of significant tariffs could impact Spanish exporters and the broader economy.

2. **Global Economic Uncertainty**: Concerns about the US debt position and the potential for broader trade wars could trigger market selloffs affecting all indices, including the IBEX 35.

3. **Technical Factors**: The index has faced resistance at around 14,500-14,600 points, representing the upper boundary of its bullish trend channel since 2022. Some technical analysts have noted signs of overbuying at these levels, suggesting the potential for a correction.

## Market Resilience

Despite these risks, the market has already demonstrated significant resilience in 2025. When faced with negative shocks such as trade tension headlines, the index experienced temporary drops but quickly recovered. In early April, the index fell approximately 12% from around 13,336 to 11,750, but subsequently rebounded 16.2% to 13,660 by mid-May. This resilience suggests the market has some capacity to absorb negative developments.

For the index to close below its starting value, it would need to decline by approximately 19-23% from current levels. Such a significant drop would typically require a major economic shock or persistent severe negative factors â€“ a scenario that seems unlikely given the current economic fundamentals and the index's demonstrated resilience.

## Forward Outlook

Looking ahead, the IBEX 35 is expected to trade at 13,871.81 points by the end of the current quarter, according to Trading Economics models and analyst expectations. While this represents a slight pullback from current levels, it would still maintain a substantial buffer above the starting value.

Given the substantial cushion established year-to-date, the continued strong economic fundamentals in Spain relative to other European economies, and the proven ability of the market to recover from temporary setbacks, the IBEX 35 appears well-positioned to maintain at least some of its gains through the remainder of 2025.

Even accounting for potential market volatility, trade tensions, or technical corrections, the probability of a complete reversal of the year's gains appears low absent a major, unforeseen negative shock to the Spanish or global economy.
