# Assessing Palestinian Displacement from Gaza Before December 31st, 2025

The humanitarian situation in Gaza has reached catastrophic proportions, with approximately 90% of Gaza's population (about 1.9 million people) internally displaced, often multiple times. Despite this devastating internal displacement, there has been no significant evidence of large-scale cross-border movement of Palestinians out of Gaza.

## Current Displacement Patterns

The scale of internal displacement within Gaza is unprecedented. Recent data indicates that over 160,000 Palestinians were displaced within Gaza in just one week in May 2025, and many families report being displaced up to 10-11 times. The physical destruction is staggering - approximately 69% of structures in Gaza have been damaged or destroyed to varying degrees.

The humanitarian impact has been severe:
- At least 45,059 Palestinians had been killed as of December 2024, with an estimated 10,000 remaining under the rubble
- About 4 children were being killed daily in Gaza as of late 2024
- Critical infrastructure has been decimated, with large areas "bombed to the ground"

Despite these horrific conditions, a critical distinction must be made between internal displacement (within Gaza) and external displacement (leaving Gaza entirely).

## Barriers to External Displacement

Several significant factors currently prevent mass cross-border displacement from Gaza:

**Border control policies** remain extremely strict. Gaza's borders are tightly controlled by both Israel and Egypt, with very limited crossings permitted. The Rafah crossing, while partially operating during the ceasefire beginning in January 2025, primarily facilitated medical evacuations (averaging 45 patients daily, far below pre-conflict levels).

**Egyptian resistance** to accepting large numbers of Palestinians has been consistent. Egypt has explicitly rejected "the complete settlement of the Palestinian issue or the displacement of Palestinians from their land," reflecting regional opposition to any scenario that could be perceived as forced population transfer.

**International opposition** to displacement remains strong. The UN and humanitarian organizations consistently advocate for protecting Palestinians' right to remain in Gaza while receiving adequate humanitarian assistance. The framing of humanitarian appeals focuses on protecting rights within Gaza rather than facilitating exodus.

**Logistical and physical barriers** are substantial. Moving 500,000 people across heavily militarized borders would require coordinated infrastructure and processing capabilities that do not currently exist. The mechanisms to facilitate such movement would require coordination between multiple parties currently at odds with each other.

## Potential Catalysts for Mass Exodus

For 500,000 Palestinians to leave Gaza before December 31st, 2025, several significant changes would need to occur:

1. **Policy shift by Egypt or other countries**: A dramatic reversal of current border policies would be necessary, potentially in response to international pressure or catastrophic developments within Gaza.

2. **Complete humanitarian collapse**: Further deterioration beyond the current catastrophic conditions could trigger international intervention to evacuate civilians. The entirety of Gaza's population is already facing "crisis" or worse acute food insecurity.

3. **Coordinated evacuation plan**: Implementation of an internationally-sanctioned evacuation rather than ad hoc border crossings would be needed to facilitate movement at such scale.

4. **Israeli policy implementation**: Israel would need to either facilitate movement across its borders or through its territory, or implement a policy that forces such movement.

## Timeframe Considerations

With approximately 7 months remaining until December 31st, 2025, the logistics of moving 500,000+ people across borders would be extraordinarily challenging. This compressed timeframe reduces the likelihood of such a major policy and operational shift occurring and being implemented at scale.

The ceasefire that began in January 2025 offers some hope for stabilization, but the risk of renewed hostilities remains significant. Since the ceasefire began, new population movements have been reported, with people trying to return to whatever remains of their homes, indicating a desire to stay within Gaza when security conditions permit.

Based on historical patterns, policy constraints, logistical challenges, and the relatively short timeframe, while acknowledging the extreme uncertainty in this volatile situation, large-scale cross-border displacement of 500,000 Palestinians from Gaza before the end of 2025 appears unlikely under current conditions.
