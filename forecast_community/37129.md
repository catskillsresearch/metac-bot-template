The USDA’s "What Can SNAP Buy?" page currently lists "snack foods" as an explicitly eligible category for SNAP purchases, in line with the Food and Nutrition Act’s broad definition of food for home consumption. Historically, this listing has been stable, and changes to SNAP-eligible items—especially at a national level—have required significant procedural steps, including public notice, comment periods, and administrative review.

Recent policy activity has focused on restricting certain items within SNAP, such as soda and energy drinks. For example, Nebraska has received a federal waiver to exclude those items, but this change will not take effect until January 2026. Other states like Idaho and Arkansas have submitted waiver requests targeting soft drinks and candy, but these are state-specific and also set for future implementation dates. Notably, these waivers and proposals have targeted narrow product categories rather than the broader "snack foods" category.

To remove "snack foods" from the nationally published list would require a rapid and unprecedented shift in federal policy, a formal rulemaking process, or Congressional intervention. None of these are underway or imminent as of May 2025. Furthermore, the administrative and legal challenges inherent in redefining or removing such a broad category would be considerable, particularly within the short time frame remaining before July 1, 2025.

The pattern of change in SNAP policy has been gradual and incremental, addressing specific subcategories (like soda and candy) and often proceeding through state waivers rather than sweeping federal revisions. There is no credible evidence of a pending nationwide move to delist "snack foods" from the USDA’s eligibility page. Given these factors, it is highly likely that "snack foods" will continue to be explicitly listed as an eligible item on the USDA’s "What Can SNAP Buy?" page as of July 1, 2025.
