(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
The 2025 Canadian federal election has already been held (May 12, 2025). The outcome is known as of now.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
The current, observed outcome is that Pierre Poilievre has **not** been elected Prime Minister of Canada. The Liberal Party, led by Mark Carney, has won more seats than the Conservative Party, and Poilievre has notably lost his own parliamentary seat[2].

(c) **Scenario that results in a No outcome:**  
This scenario has materialized: the Liberals formed government after winning the most seats, and Mark Carney became Prime Minister. Additionally, Pierre Poilievre lost his own Ottawa seat, making it impossible for him to serve as Prime Minister under current circumstances[2][5].

(d) **Scenario that results in a Yes outcome:**  
To reverse the current result and see Pierre Poilievre become Prime Minister in 2025, an extraordinarily unlikely sequence would be required: the results of the May 2025 election would need to be annulled or invalidated, and a new election or parliamentary shift would have to occur, resulting in Poilievre being officially appointed as Prime Minister before January 1, 2026. There is no indication of this scenario developing.

## Rationale

Canadian voters have rendered their decision in the 2025 federal election. Against strong early polling for the Conservatives, a sharp shift occurred in the closing weeks of the campaign, driven largely by U.S. foreign policy shocks and a nationalist backlash against American threats. This development fueled a Liberal surge led by Mark Carney, resulting in a Liberal victory and a fourth consecutive term in power for the party[2][3][4].

Pierre Poilievre, once seen as the frontrunner, not only failed to win the Prime Ministership but also lost his individual seat in Parliamentâ€”an outcome that all but precludes his appointment as Prime Minister under the Canadian system[2].

The only conceivable path to a "Yes" now would be some unprecedented constitutional or political crisis leading to a new election or a dramatic parliamentary realignment within the next several months. No such scenario is currently in play or supported by any public information[2][5].

Good forecasters emphasize that status quo outcomes are overwhelmingly likely unless there is direct evidence for a forthcoming change. All available information confirms the result is settled: Mark Carney is Prime Minister, and Pierre Poilievre is not.
