# COVID-19 Variant of Concern Designation Analysis

Looking at the likelihood of WHO designating a new COVID-19 Variant of Concern before July 1, 2025, involves examining historical context, current variant landscape, designation criteria, and time constraints.

## Historical Context

The World Health Organization has not designated any new SARS-CoV-2 Variant of Concern since Omicron in November 2021, which is over 3.5 years ago. All previously designated VOCs (Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, Omicron) have been de-escalated over time, with none currently maintaining VOC status.

In March 2023, the WHO updated its tracking system and working definitions for variants, establishing clearer criteria for variant classifications. This update created a more stringent standard for VOC designation than previously used, requiring stronger evidence before escalation.

## Current Variant Landscape

Several variants are currently circulating globally, with two receiving particular attention:

1. **LP.8.1**: Currently the dominant variant in the US (70% of cases) and UK (60%). The WHO has designated LP.8.1 as a "variant under monitoring" and explicitly assessed its additional public health risk as "low" globally.

2. **NB.1.8.1**: Recently detected in the US, Asia, and Europe, with some reports suggesting increased transmissibility and hospitalizations in China and Taiwan. This variant has been detected in international travelers arriving at US airports between April and May 2025.

According to the California Department of Public Health (as of April 3, 2025), LP.8.1 is predicted to be the variant with the highest and fastest growing proportion based on their modeling estimates.

## VOC Designation Criteria

For a variant to be classified as a VOC, it must meet the definition of a Variant of Interest plus demonstrate at least one of these characteristics:

- Detrimental change in clinical disease severity
- Significant impact on healthcare systems' ability to provide care
- Significant decrease in vaccine effectiveness against severe disease

Based on available information, neither LP.8.1 nor NB.1.8.1 has demonstrated these characteristics to a degree that would warrant VOC designation. The WHO has explicitly stated that LP.8.1's risk is considered "low" globally despite its high transmissibility and some immune evasion properties.

## Time and Procedural Constraints

With approximately one month remaining until the July 1 deadline, there are important temporal factors to consider:

1. Limited time exists for a variant to demonstrate the required characteristics for VOC designation
2. The WHO's Technical Advisory Group on Virus Evolution (TAG-VE) requires sufficient data to make determinations, which typically takes time to accumulate and analyze
3. The formal assessment and designation process itself requires time to complete

Even if a variant begins showing concerning characteristics now, there would be limited time for sufficient global data to accumulate and for WHO to complete its formal assessment process.

## Population Immunity Considerations

The global immunity landscape has changed significantly since the last VOC designation:

- Widespread vaccination has created broader population protection
- Multiple waves of infection have contributed to natural immunity
- This enhanced immunity may be limiting the emergence of variants capable of causing severe disease on a scale warranting VOC status

Current vaccines are still expected to provide protection against severe outcomes for emerging variants, though they may not prevent infection as effectively.

## Surveillance and Detection Factors

A concerning factor is the reduction in global surveillance capacity. As mentioned by the California Department of Public Health, new COVID-19 sequencing data has become less available in some regions, with variant reporting being paused in some areas. This reduced surveillance could potentially mask emerging variants until they become widespread.

## Conclusion

While SARS-CoV-2 continues to evolve with new variants emerging and spreading globally, the probability of a new VOC designation before July 1, 2025, appears low based on several factors:

1. The absence of VOC designations for over 3.5 years despite numerous variant emergences
2. The WHO's specific assessment of current variants like LP.8.1 as posing "low" additional global risk
3. The short timeframe remaining for evidence collection, analysis, and formal designation
4. Enhanced population immunity limiting the impact of new variants
5. The higher threshold established in the WHO's 2023 updated criteria

The status quo strongly favors continuing without a new VOC designation. While variants will continue to emerge and circulate, the combined factors of population immunity, the high threshold for VOC designation, and limited time make it unlikely that a new VOC will be designated within the next month.
