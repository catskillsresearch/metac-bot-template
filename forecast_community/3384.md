(a) **Time left until outcome known:**  
Approximately 7.5 months remain until December 31, 2025.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
The current record for the most digits of π computed is 105,000,000,000,000 digits (one hundred five trillion), set by a US computer storage company and announced in March 2024[3].

(c) **Outcome if the current trend continued:**  
Given the historical pace—major new records roughly every 1–3 years and recent jumps (62.8 trillion in 2021[5], 100 trillion in 2022, and 105 trillion in 2024[3])—it is plausible the record could rise again before the end of 2025, but typically only by a few trillion digits. Unless a major breakthrough is announced, a total near 105–110 trillion is likely.

(d) **Expectations of experts and markets:**  
Experts expect continued but incremental increases in the number of computed digits as hardware, algorithms, and cloud computing resources improve. Barring a leap in computational capability or an organized "pi race" by another tech company, most would expect the record by December 31, 2025, to stand somewhere between 105 trillion and 110 trillion digits, perhaps slightly higher if a motivated institution or individual pursues the record late in 2025.

(e) **Unexpected low outcome scenario:**  
A scenario in which no new records are set due to lack of interest, hardware failures, or energy costs could mean the record remains at 105 trillion digits set in early 2024[3].

(f) **Unexpected high outcome scenario:**  
A surprising technological advance (e.g., revolutionary new algorithms or a concerted global "pi computation challenge" by a consortium of cloud providers) could push the record significantly higher, perhaps above 120 trillion or even to 150 trillion digits. Large, sudden jumps are rare but possible, especially if a record attempt coincides with a major Pi Day celebration.

**Summary:**  
The best available evidence suggests the most probable outcome is that by December 31, 2025, the largest number of digits of π ever computed will be between 105 trillion and 115 trillion digits, with an outside chance of a higher number if an unexpected effort occurs[3][5].
