(a) **Time Left Until Outcome:**  
There are approximately 7.5 months remaining until the resolution of whether Bitcoin closes 2025 above its opening price of $93,429.20—this will be decided based on the December 31, 2025, closing price on CoinMarketCap.

(b) **Status Quo Outcome if Nothing Changed:**  
As of mid-May 2025, Bitcoin is trading well above $100,000 and consistently holding support at or above this level[2]. If current conditions persist, Bitcoin would close 2025 higher than it started.

(c) **Scenario Resulting in a No Outcome:**  
A scenario that would result in Bitcoin closing 2025 at or below $93,429.20 would likely require a significant and sustained negative event. Potential drivers could include:
- A global financial crisis leading to a sharp sell-off across risk assets.
- Severe, unexpected regulatory crackdowns from major non-US markets.
- A sudden reversal in institutional sentiment, triggered by ETF outflows or loss of public trust in exchanges.
- A critical technical failure or large-scale security incident involving Bitcoin.

These would need to drive the price below the $93,429.20 threshold at year-end despite the current positive momentum and support near $100,000[2].

(d) **Scenario Resulting in a Yes Outcome:**  
A Yes outcome would occur if Bitcoin maintains or builds on its current price strength. This could be supported by:
- Continued pro-crypto US policy boosting legitimacy and institutional flows.
- Ongoing accumulation by companies and governments, as seen in Q2 2025.
- Favorable macroeconomic or risk-off events driving capital into digital assets.
- No major adverse regulatory, technical, or sentiment shocks.

The maintenance of current momentum, even if accompanied by some corrections, makes a year-end close above $93,429.20 the status quo outcome[2].

## Rationale

- **Current Price and Trend:** Bitcoin is consolidating above $100,000 with strong technical support and bullish momentum[2].
- **Analyst & Model Forecasts:** The majority of year-end 2025 price targets from analysts and models (including Ark Invest, Changelly, and others) cluster well above the $93,429.20 mark, even in more conservative scenarios[3][4][5].
- **Macro & Policy Support:** The Trump administration’s pro-crypto stance and ongoing ETF/fund inflows improve baseline confidence.
- **Risks Remain:** The most plausible threats are global economic crises or coordinated regulatory crackdowns, particularly from large economies outside the US. While such events are possible, there’s no imminent indication as of May 2025 that these risks are materializing.
- **Volatility Factor:** While Bitcoin is volatile and could see large corrections, historical precedent and the current market structure suggest these would need to be severe, sustained, and well-timed at year-end to flip the outcome to “No.”

## Final Answer

Probability: **80%**  
There is a strong likelihood—estimated at 80%—that Bitcoin will close 2025 above its starting price of $93,429.20, barring a major unforeseen negative event that significantly impacts the broader market or crypto sector in the months ahead[2].
