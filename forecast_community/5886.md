The Democratic Party has historically been more progressive in nominating women for high-profile political positions, as evidenced by Hillary Clinton's presidential nomination and Kamala Harris's vice presidency. This trend is supported by a more established pipeline of female candidates within the party, which currently includes prominent figures like Kamala Harris and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. The Democratic Party's demographic and ideological landscape has been more conducive to female leadership, making it more likely for a Democratic woman to become the first female president.

Conversely, the Republican Party, while having potential female candidates such as Nikki Haley, faces significant structural and ideological barriers that have historically limited the nomination of women for top executive roles. The party would need to undergo substantial changes in its demographics and ideology to increase support for female candidates. Despite these challenges, political landscapes are not static, and shifts in party dynamics or the emergence of a strong Republican female candidate could alter the current trajectory.

Overall, while the status quo and historical trends favor a Democratic woman breaking the presidential gender barrier first, the long time horizon until 2100 introduces uncertainty, allowing for the possibility of significant political shifts that could enable a Republican woman to become the first female president.
