Over the past several months, Bangladesh has completed all critical regulatory steps for Starlink’s entry, moving at an unusually rapid pace for such a process. The Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (BTRC) reviewed and approved Starlink’s application in early April 2025 and promptly forwarded it for final endorsement. On April 29, 2025, Bangladesh’s transitional government, led by Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus, granted final approval for Starlink to operate, making Bangladesh the second country in South Asia to officially license Starlink’s satellite internet service.

Starlink has demonstrated technical readiness and operational intent to launch promptly. SpaceX’s Vice President for Global Engagement, Lauren Dreyer, publicly confirmed a May 2025 timeline for technical launch in direct discussions with Bangladesh’s leadership, signaling that deployment was imminent and preparations were well underway. The Bangladesh Satellite Company Limited (BSCL) has partnered with Starlink to provide ground infrastructure support, including hosting Starlink’s gateway at existing ground stations in Gazipur and Betbunia, which facilitates swift technical deployment.

Political support is robust, with Chief Adviser Yunus actively championing the project. His office has set clear directives and shown a strong sense of urgency to ensure rollout within a 90-day window from late March, reinforcing the expectation of imminent activation. Additionally, Starlink has already participated in high-profile events in the country, including powering the livestream of the Bangladesh Investment Summit in April, demonstrating preliminary technical capability on Bangladeshi soil.

While minor risks remain—including potential technical setbacks, a lag between operational launch and website update, or unforeseen administrative holdups—the overwhelming evidence indicates all stakeholders are aligned and motivated to achieve public launch quickly. Historical patterns suggest Starlink typically updates its availability map soon after regulatory and technical milestones are met, especially when both government and company leadership have made explicit public commitments to timelines. The combination of political momentum, advanced regulatory progress, strong technical readiness, and high-profile international collaboration makes a near-term availability listing on Starlink’s website very likely. The primary uncertainty is only the precise timing of the public map update, but with committed May 2025 deployment and a 45-day buffer to July 1, the window for completion is comfortably wide.
