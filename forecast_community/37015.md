# Examining the Artemis Accords Membership Status

As of May 15, 2025, Norway became the 55th nation to sign the Artemis Accords, meeting the threshold of 55 signatories well before the July 1, 2025 target date. With only about 45 days remaining until July 1, the key question is whether this number will remain at or above 55.

## Historical Growth Pattern

The Artemis Accords have demonstrated consistent growth since their establishment in 2020. The expansion has been particularly notable in recent periods:

- By January 2025, the Accords had reached 53 signatories
- Finland joined as the 53rd signatory on January 21, 2025
- Bangladesh became the 54th signatory on April 8, 2025
- Norway joined as the 55th signatory on May 15, 2025

In 2024 alone, 15 countries joined the Accords, including Belgium, Greece, Uruguay, Switzerland, Sweden, Slovenia, Lithuania, Peru, Slovakia, Armenia, Dominican Republic, Estonia, Cyprus, Chile, and Denmark. This represents substantial diplomatic momentum.

## Stability of Membership

A critical factor in this forecast is the remarkable stability of Artemis Accords membership. Since the Accords' inception in 2020, there has been:

- No precedent of any nation withdrawing its signature
- No public reporting of any country considering withdrawal
- No established formal mechanism that countries frequently use for rapid withdrawals
- No evidence of political instability or controversy that would plausibly trigger a withdrawal

The Accords represent principles of peaceful, transparent, and responsible space exploration that align with the space policies of most participating nations. This alignment of values creates a strong foundation for continued participation.

## Potential Scenarios

For the number to fall below 55 by July 1, 2025, at least one current signatory would need to formally withdraw from the Artemis Accords. Given the absence of historical withdrawals and no indications of diplomatic tensions among signatories, this scenario appears highly improbable.

Conversely, the status quo already satisfies the threshold of 55 signatories. The continuous pattern of new countries joining (with Norway being the most recent addition) suggests that additional nations might join before July 1, further solidifying the position above 55 signatories.

## Diplomatic Context

The Artemis Accords are positioned as a high-profile multilateral framework for space exploration. The signing ceremonies, such as Norway's recent accession, typically involve ministerial-level officials and public statements emphasizing commitment to the principles outlined in the Accords. This level of formal diplomatic engagement creates additional barriers to withdrawal, as such actions would require equally formal and public reversals that could damage international relations.

The timeframe of 45 days until the target date is particularly significant, as diplomatic processes, especially withdrawals from international agreements, typically operate on longer timescales.
