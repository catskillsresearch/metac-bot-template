(a) Time until outcome: The NATO summit in The Hague is scheduled for June 24-26, 2025, which is about 6 weeks from today (May 10, 2025).

(b) Status quo outcome: The current NATO defense spending target is 2% of GDP, which has been in place since 2006 and was reaffirmed after Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014.

(c) Unexpected outcome scenario: An escalation in the Russia-Ukraine conflict or a new security crisis in Europe could push NATO to adopt the full 5% target demanded by President Trump, despite current European resistance. Alternatively, economic recession across multiple NATO members could make even a 3% target politically unfeasible, resulting in a compromise figure of 2.5% or maintaining the current 2% target.

Based on the available information, I'll provide my forecast for the NATO defense spending target that will be agreed upon at the June 2025 summit:

NATO appears to be moving decisively toward increasing its defense spending target beyond the current 2% of GDP. Several key factors shape this forecast:

## Current Trajectory

NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte has clearly signaled that the alliance needs to substantially increase defense spending. In February 2025, he stated that NATO members would need to boost spending by "considerably more than 3 percent" of GDP[4]. This statement from the alliance's top official carries significant weight in predicting the summit outcome.

The obsolescence of the 2% target is widely acknowledged within NATO leadership. Rutte himself has stated that "2% is not nearly enough to stay safe in the years to come"[5], indicating a firm commitment to raising the target.

## Competing Proposals and Positions

A specific plan appears to be taking shape. According to Reuters reporting, Rutte has proposed boosting traditional defense spending to 3.5% of GDP, with an additional 1.5% target for broader security-related spending, totaling 5%[1]. This suggests a compromise approach that partially accommodates President Trump's 5% demand while providing flexibility in how it's calculated.

Most recently (May 9, 2025), reporting indicates that "NATO chief Mark Rutte wants member countries to agree at a summit in June to reach 5% of GDP on defense-related spending by 2032"[3]. This long-term target with a seven-year implementation timeline makes a higher figure more politically palatable.

Spain's announcement that it will reach the current 2% target by 2025 (accelerated from 2029)[2] demonstrates increased willingness among previously reluctant members to boost defense spending, creating momentum for a higher alliance-wide target.

## Likely Outcome

The most probable outcome is a formal agreement on a 3.5% target for traditional defense spending at the June summit. This represents a substantial increase from 2% while remaining politically feasible for most members. The additional 1.5% for broader security spending would satisfy U.S. pressure for a 5% total commitment while giving European members flexibility in implementation.

The 7-year timeline (by 2032) makes this target more achievable by spreading the increases over time. This approach addresses both the urgent security concerns driving the increase while acknowledging the fiscal and political constraints faced by many NATO members.

## Final Probabilities

Option_A (2% or lower): 5%
Option_B (2.5%): 10% 
Option_C (3%): 25%
Option_D (3.5%): 40%
Option_E (4%): 15%
Option_F (5%): 5%
