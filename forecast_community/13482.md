# Historical and Institutional Analysis of European Peace and Conflict Risk

The European Union was explicitly designed to make war between member states "not merely unthinkable, but materially impossible" through economic integration and political cooperation. The unprecedented peace among EU states since World War II—now spanning 80 years—has exceeded any previous era of peace in European history apart from the Pax Romana.

## Foundations of European Peace

Several structural factors have contributed to this remarkable period of stability:

**Economic Interdependence**: The EU's single market and deeply intertwined economies make war economically catastrophic for all members. This interdependence was deliberately constructed, beginning with the European Coal and Steel Community in 1951, to ensure that the materials necessary for waging war would be under shared control.

**Institutional Framework**: The EU has developed robust mechanisms for peaceful conflict resolution through legal, diplomatic, and political channels. These institutions provide alternatives to military confrontation when disputes arise.

**Democratic Norms**: All member states are required to maintain democracies and rule of law, creating domestic institutional checks against war and promoting shared values across the continent.

**Collective Security**: Most EU states are also NATO members, providing an additional layer of security guarantees and external deterrence.

**Cultural and Social Integration**: Decades of free movement, educational exchanges, and cultural integration have fostered strong cross-border connections and European identity alongside national identities.

## Current Trends and Recent Resilience

Despite major external threats (notably Russia's invasion of Ukraine), there is no evidence of movement toward conflict among EU states. In fact, recent years have seen reinforcement of European defense and crisis management capacity, though always with the explicit aim of deterring external threats, not each other. 

Public opinion remains overwhelmingly against war or military escalation, with surveys showing that most EU citizens oppose direct military interventions—even outside the EU—and are wary of increased armament. A YouGov survey indicates that 41-55% of Europeans in major EU countries believe another world war is likely within 5-10 years, but these concerns focus on external threats (primarily Russia, viewed as a major or moderate threat by up to 82% of respondents), not on conflicts between EU members.

The EU has already demonstrated remarkable resilience through significant historical challenges including:
- The Cold War
- The fall of communism
- Multiple economic crises
- Brexit
- Migration pressures
- The COVID-19 pandemic
- Rising populism and Euroskepticism

## Potential Risk Factors Over the Long Term

Forecasting over a 127-year horizon introduces enormous uncertainty. Several factors could theoretically increase conflict risk over this extended timeframe:

**EU Fragmentation**: Some commentators and politicians warn of potential EU collapse or a "Yugoslavia scenario." A Polish journalist cited believes "the European Union will simply collapse" within the next few decades. Such fragmentation could remove institutional barriers to conflict.

**Institutional Failure**: Major systemic shocks could undermine the EU's capacity for peaceful conflict resolution, particularly if accompanied by democratic backsliding or the erosion of rule of law.

**Resource Competition**: Climate change and environmental degradation over the coming century could create new tensions between states over water, arable land, energy resources, or climate refugees.

**Rising Nationalism**: A dramatic resurgence of extreme nationalism could weaken European solidarity and potentially revive historical grievances or territorial disputes.

**External Destabilization**: The loss of the US security umbrella, manipulation by external powers, or spillover from regional conflicts could strain inter-EU relationships.

**Economic Collapse**: Sustained economic depression or catastrophic financial crises could undermine the economic foundations of peace.

## Historical Perspective and Uncertainty

European history prior to 1945 was marked by frequent conflicts between neighboring states. The current peace has already outlasted many historical precedents, suggesting a fundamental transformation in interstate relations. However, no political order is truly permanent, and the very long time horizon introduces significant structural uncertainty.

Even if the EU were to fragment or evolve into different structures, the historical precedent of peaceful separation (as with Brexit) suggests that violent conflict is not inevitable. The EU's complex legal and institutional frameworks provide mechanisms for orderly change rather than violent rupture.

It's worth noting that the threshold for what constitutes "war" between EU states is strict: only a formal declaration of war, clear international legal consensus about a state of war, or a major armed conflict with significant casualties (at least 1,000 deaths in a year with at least 100 from any one state) would qualify.

## Balancing Continuity and Change

The best predictor of the future, absent clear signals of change, is typically the present. The deep, durable integration and long-lasting peace among EU states strongly favor continued peace, especially as war between advanced democracies has become exceedingly rare worldwide.

However, over a timespan exceeding a century, the potential for transformative events—technological revolutions, environmental catastrophes, or geopolitical realignments—cannot be dismissed. The long time horizon is the greatest source of uncertainty in this assessment.

While good forecasting practice suggests overweighting the continuation of present trends over unprecedented historical breaks, particularly given the robustness of peace among EU states, a time horizon of 127 years introduces genuine deep uncertainty that cannot be eliminated.

The European Union has already succeeded in its primary mission of preventing war between member states for an unprecedented period. Whether this achievement can extend to 2153 depends on the continued resilience and adaptability of European institutions in the face of unforeseen challenges.
