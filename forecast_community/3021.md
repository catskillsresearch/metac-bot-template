There is roughly four and a half years remaining until 2030, and the current state of affairs shows that independent measurements of the Hubble parameter persistently differ by around 4–5 sigma. While advances from instruments such as JWST, gravitational-wave standard sirens, and extensive surveys (e.g., DESI and LSST) are beginning to offer more refined insights, historical evidence suggests that cosmological tensions like this one tend to be remarkably stubborn. Past experiences indicate that improved measurements and reanalyses can sometimes reconcile discrepancies, but in the case of the Hubble tension the disagreement has withstood even significant methodological advancements. 

A resolution within the pure ΛCDM framework would require new data to uncover previously unrecognized systematic errors or for multiple independent techniques to converge convincingly on a single value of H₀ with a reduced discrepancy—ideally falling to below 2 sigma. Conversely, if the new observations continue to verify a strong multi-sigma tension despite enhanced precision and systematic checks, then it would imply that the discrepancy is intrinsic to the measurements under ΛCDM, potentially signalling a need for new physics or an extension of the standard model.

Given the modest pace at which cosmological consensus has shifted historically and the gradual nature of observational improvements, the current weight of evidence leans toward the persistence of the tension. Nonetheless, promising early data indicate that there remains a meaningful possibility that refined techniques might gradually bridge the gap. In summary, while there is genuine optimism among parts of the scientific community, the inertia of the long-standing discrepancy within the standard ΛCDM paradigm poses a significant challenge to fully reconciling the Hubble parameter determinations by 2030.
