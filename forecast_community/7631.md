Rationale:

The question of Israeli recognition of Palestine by 2070 is complex and influenced by numerous factors that could evolve significantly over the next four and a half decades. The current status quo, where Israel does not recognize Palestine as a sovereign state, has persisted for decades and shows strong inertia against change. This is evidenced by recent Israeli threats of unilateral action in response to potential international recognition of Palestine, indicating a hardening of Israel's position rather than movement towards recognition.

However, the long time horizon until 2070 introduces substantial uncertainty and the potential for major shifts in geopolitics, leadership, and public opinion. Growing international support for Palestinian recognition, including from traditional Israeli allies like France and potentially the UK, could gradually build pressure on Israel to reconsider its stance. The proposed conference in New York and the increasing number of countries recognizing Palestine suggest a trend towards broader acceptance of Palestinian statehood on the global stage.

Despite this mounting pressure, Israel's security concerns and the deep-rooted nature of the conflict make rapid change unlikely. The ongoing expansion of settlements in the West Bank further complicates the possibility of a two-state solution. The United States' continued support for Israel and its absence from pro-recognition initiatives provides Israel with significant diplomatic cover, at least in the near term.

For recognition to occur by 2070, it would likely require a significant shift in Israeli politics, possibly driven by generational change or external pressures. A breakthrough in peace negotiations, potentially facilitated by widespread international recognition of Palestine, could lead to a comprehensive agreement addressing core issues such as borders, security, and the status of Jerusalem. Such an agreement might include mutual recognition between Israel and Palestine, with Israel formally recognizing Palestinian statehood in exchange for security guarantees and normalized relations with Arab states.

While the possibility of such changes occurring over a 44-year period cannot be dismissed, the current trajectory and the sticky nature of the status quo in long-standing conflicts suggest that non-recognition remains more likely than recognition. However, the long time frame and the potential for unforeseen events or dramatic shifts in regional dynamics mean that the probability of recognition, while low, is not negligible.
