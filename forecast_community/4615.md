# S&P 500 Real Return Forecast: 2022-2031

The annual real return of the S&P 500 for the 2022-2031 period will be influenced by several critical factors including current market valuations, economic trends, technological innovation, inflation dynamics, and geopolitical considerations.

## Historical Context and Current Indicators

The S&P 500 has delivered strong performance in recent years, with the index showing significant growth since 2022. From January 2022 (opening around 4,800) to mid-2025, the index has risen to approximately 5,900, representing substantial gains over this period. This translates to roughly 20% total nominal return over the first 3.4 years of our forecast period.

Professional forecasters have progressively increased their expectations for S&P 500 returns. The Philadelphia Fed's Survey of Professional Forecasters estimated an annual-average return of 5.00% in Q1 2021, which increased to 6.73% in Q1 2022, and further to 7.50% in Q1 2023. These upward revisions reflect growing optimism about market performance, though these figures represent nominal rather than real returns.

## Economic and Inflation Outlook

The real return forecast must account for expected inflation over the coming years. Recent inflation has averaged around 3%, reducing nominal returns accordingly. The Philadelphia Fed's survey also provides relevant inflation projections, with forecasters expecting inflation to moderate but remain above the historical 2% target through much of the forecast period.

Current market valuations present a significant consideration. The S&P 500's price-to-earnings ratio remains elevated compared to historical averages, with P/E ratios in the high 20s as of 2025. This suggests potential pressure on future returns, as sustained high valuations typically correlate with lower forward returns over extended periods.

## Potential Scenarios

### Base Case Scenario

If economic conditions progress as most experts anticipate, with moderate GDP growth, gradually normalizing inflation, and continued but slowing corporate earnings growth, real annual returns would likely fall in the 4-5% range. This aligns with the Philadelphia Fed's projections when adjusted for inflation expectations.

### Low Return Scenario 

A prolonged period of stagflation represents a significant risk to real returns. If inflation remains persistently above target (5%+) while economic growth stagnates, corporate earnings would suffer while purchasing power erodes. This combination could compress real returns to near zero or even negative territory over the decade.

Geopolitical tensions, trade disputes, or a major financial crisis could exacerbate this scenario, potentially triggering extended market downturns. A significant valuation contraction—with P/E ratios reverting below historical means—would further depress returns, especially if occurring late in the decade.

### High Return Scenario

Technological innovation, particularly in artificial intelligence, could drive exceptional productivity gains and corporate earnings growth. Some analysts estimate AI alone could add $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030. If U.S. companies capture a significant portion of this value creation while inflation remains controlled, real returns could exceed expectations.

In this scenario, strong earnings growth coupled with sustained investor confidence could maintain or even expand current valuations, potentially pushing annual real returns to the 7-9% range.

## Market Dynamics and Investment Implications

The 10-year Treasury yield serves as an important benchmark for evaluating equity returns. Forecasters project the 10-year Treasury averaging 3.35% over the next decade, up from previous estimates of 3.07%. This increase in the risk-free rate impacts equity risk premiums and required returns for stocks.

Current forward earnings yields for the S&P 500 and FTSE 350 stand at 5.49% and 5.67% respectively, suggesting moderate expected returns when combined with earnings growth prospects.

The phenomenon described as "TINA" (There Is No Alternative) which has driven investors toward equities in recent years appears to be weakening as interest rates have normalized. This shifting dynamic could impact market sentiment and flows through the latter part of the decade.
