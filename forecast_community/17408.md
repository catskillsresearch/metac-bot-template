(a) **Time Left Until Resolution:**  
There are approximately 7.5 months remaining until the outcome is known; the question closes on December 31, 2025.

(b) **Status Quo Outcome if Nothing Changes:**  
As of May 2025, no US court has imposed a fine or ordered any company to pay ≥$100 million specifically for the use of data to train large AI models. The most prominent ongoing US case (GitHub Copilot litigation) is still unresolved and is not expected to reach a trial or judgment before late 2025 or early 2026[1][2][3][4][5].

(c) **Scenario Resulting in a NO Outcome:**  
No US court completes a trial, judgment, or settlement explicitly concerning AI training data use with a penalty or damages at or above $100 million by December 31, 2025. Ongoing cases, such as those involving GitHub Copilot, continue beyond the deadline, are dismissed, or settle for lower amounts[1][2][3][4][5].

(d) **Scenario Resulting in a YES Outcome:**  
At least one US court issues a final order or settlement before the end of 2025, specifically requiring a company to pay ≥$100 million in fines or damages due to how they used data to train a large AI model. This might occur through an accelerated trial or substantial early settlement in the Copilot or a similar lawsuit. However, as of now, no such judgment or settlement has been reported or is scheduled to occur within the remaining timeframe[1][2][3][4][5].

## Rationale

- **Status quo conditions dominate:** All credible indicators show that the timeline and legal hurdles in relevant litigation, especially the GitHub Copilot case, make it unlikely that a court-ordered fine or damages exceeding $100 million related to AI model training data use will be imposed before December 31, 2025[1][2][3][4][5].
- **Current pace of litigation:** As of July 2024, most claims in the Copilot case were dismissed, with only breach of license remaining. The plaintiffs are seeking $1 billion, but the claim's legal basis and the need for class certification mean that damages—if any—are unlikely to be finalized before the deadline[4][5].
- **No precedent:** There is no public record of any US case reaching or awarding such a large penalty specifically for AI training data use as of May 2025; high-profile fines against tech companies have been for privacy violations, not AI model training data per se[4][5].
- **Settlement possibility:** While a large settlement could, in theory, occur at any stage, it would have to be unusually large, and none reported so far have met the ≥$100 million threshold for this particular cause[1][2][3][4][5].

## Summary Table: Copilot Litigation Status

| Case                       | Status (as of May 2025)           | Surviving Claims                | Damages Sought | Trial Timeline             |
|----------------------------|------------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------|----------------------------|
| GitHub Copilot Litigation  | Survived partial dismissal         | Breach of open-source license    | $1B            | Proposed late 2025–early 2026[4][5] |

**Final Assessment:**  
Given that the status quo shows no major decision expected before the end of 2025, and the slow pace of AI copyright/class-action litigation, a YES outcome is possible only if there is a major acceleration or unforeseen settlement—which is not supported by any current filings or timelines.
