Based on the search results and current information, I'll provide a comprehensive forecast for how old the oldest living person will be in 2100.

(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known: 74 years and 7 months (from May 2025 to January 1, 2100).

(b) The outcome if nothing changed: 122 years old. This is based on the current record for the oldest documented human, Jeanne Calment, who lived to 122 years and 164 days[3].

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued: 125-130 years old. The maximum documented human age has shown minimal increases over the past century despite significant improvements in average life expectancy.

(d) The expectations of experts and markets: Most gerontologists expect the maximum human lifespan to remain below 130 years without revolutionary medical breakthroughs. Research suggests the body's ability to recover is exhausted between 120 and 150 years.

(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome: A global pandemic specifically targeting the elderly, or environmental catastrophes could reduce maximum lifespan to below current records, perhaps to 115-118 years.

(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome: Revolutionary breakthroughs in genetic engineering, cellular rejuvenation, or nanotechnology could dramatically extend the maximum human lifespan to 150+ years by effectively addressing the fundamental causes of aging.

## Current State of Human Longevity

The current oldest living person as of May 2025 is Ethel Caterham of the United Kingdom, born August 21, 1909, making her 115 years old[1]. She became the world's oldest person following the death of Brazilian nun Inah Canabarro Lucas, who passed away on April 30, 2025, at the age of 116[3].

The historical context is important. Jeanne Louise Calment still holds the record for the oldest verified human, having lived to 122 years and 164 days[3]. This record has stood since her death in 1997, suggesting there may be biological limits to human longevity that are difficult to overcome.

## Historical Trends in Maximum Lifespan

The maximum documented human lifespan has shown remarkable stability over the past century. While average life expectancy has nearly doubled since 1900, the maximum age has increased by only a few years. This pattern suggests that while medical advances have successfully reduced early mortality, they have had minimal impact on extending the upper limits of human lifespan.

Currently, there are an estimated 300-450 supercentenarians (people aged 110+) worldwide, according to the Gerontology Research Group. These individuals remain extremely rare despite growing global population and improved healthcare.

## Factors Affecting Maximum Lifespan

Several factors will influence the maximum human lifespan by 2100:

**Medical Advances:** Ongoing research in geroscience, biotechnology, and regenerative medicine may eventually impact maximum lifespan, though no concrete breakthroughs with proven effects had been achieved by 2025.

**Lifestyle Factors:** Current supercentenarians often attribute their longevity to various lifestyle factors. Ethel Caterham credits "never arguing with anyone" and maintaining a positive attitude[1]. Others mention diet, physical activity, and social connections.

**Genetic Factors:** Some individuals appear genetically predisposed to exceptional longevity, with research suggesting this trait may run in families.

**Environmental Considerations:** Climate change and pollution could potentially impact longevity negatively, while improved living conditions could have positive effects.

## Scientific Understanding of Longevity Limits

Scientific research suggests biological constraints on human lifespan. Some studies indicate the body's ability to recover is exhausted between 120 and 150 years. Without addressing fundamental cellular aging processes, surpassing these limits may be challenging.

Cardiologist and therapist Andrei Kondrakhin has noted, "It is possible to live up to 120 years and more; however, it is essential to maintain a healthy lifestyle and prevent age-related diseases."

## Projecting Forward to 2100

Given the stability of maximum human lifespan over the past century, a conservative projection would place the oldest living person in 2100 at 125-130 years old. This represents a modest increase from the current record, acknowledging the possibility of incremental medical advances and larger population size increasing the chances of statistical outliers.

However, the potential for transformative medical breakthroughs cannot be ignored. Revolutionary advances in genetic engineering, cellular reprogramming, or nanotechnology could significantly extend maximum lifespan beyond current limitations.
