## Rationale for Forecasting the Age of the Oldest Living Person in 2100

Historical data demonstrates that while average life expectancy has increased significantly over the past century, the verified maximum human lifespan has shown only modest growth, plateauing near Jeanne Calment’s record of 122 years, set in 1997. This stability persists despite advances in medicine and public health, as well as marked increases in the number of people reaching advanced ages.

### Biological and Statistical Constraints

Research indicates that there are strong biological limits to human longevity, dictated by processes such as cellular senescence, telomere attrition, and the body’s declining physiological resilience with age. These factors combine to create a practical ceiling for human lifespan, typically estimated between 120 and 150 years, with most verified maximum ages remaining close to 115–122 years for decades. While there is ongoing debate among scientists regarding the existence and rigidity of an absolute upper bound, the observed plateau suggests a species-specific limit enforced by intrinsic biological properties.

### Trends and Population Effects

The growth in the global population and the increasing number of supercentenarians marginally increase the likelihood of new longevity records through statistical outliers. However, even with more individuals reaching extreme old age, the actual maximum age at death has not significantly risen since the late 20th century. This pattern highlights the distinction between extending average life expectancy—which mainly reflects reductions in early and mid-life mortality—and the far more resistant barrier of maximum achievable lifespan.

### Prospects for Medical and Technological Advances

While gradual improvements in healthcare and geriatric medicine are likely to help more individuals approach existing longevity records, meaningful increases in the maximum verified age would likely require breakthroughs in the fundamental biology of aging. Potential future interventions might include genetic modifications, regenerative therapies, nanomedicine, or targeted treatments to slow or reverse cellular aging. Though some researchers anticipate that such technologies could emerge within the 21st century, their practical impact on verified lifespans remains speculative and uncertain, and most expert forecasts remain conservative barring radical breakthroughs.

### Risks and Downward Scenarios

Unexpected global catastrophes—such as pandemics or environmental crises—could negatively impact human longevity, potentially reducing the maximum age temporarily below current records, though such outcomes are less probable in the context of modern global health infrastructure.

### Probabilistic Perspective

Statistical modeling suggests it is highly likely Jeanne Calment’s record will be exceeded during the 21st century, with an estimated 89% probability that someone will reach at least age 126 by 2100, yet the chances of individuals living to 135 or beyond remain extremely low. This supports the notion of a practical, though not absolute, upper boundary to human life, with the maximum attainable age constrained by both biology and chance.

### Synthesis

In summary, barring extraordinary scientific breakthroughs, the maximum human lifespan observed by 2100 is expected to increase only modestly, likely remaining below 130 years. However, advances in aging research hold the potential for more dramatic extensions, and the growing population increases the probability of rare outliers. The interplay between biological constraints, statistical probability, and future innovation will ultimately determine the age of the oldest living person at the turn of the next century.
