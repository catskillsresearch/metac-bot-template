Based on the information provided, I'll approach this forecasting question about the age of the oldest living person in 2100 systematically.

(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known: 
Approximately 74.5 years (from May 2025 to January 2100)

(b) The outcome if nothing changed:
The current oldest living person is Ethel Caterham, who is 115 years old, born on August 21, 1909[1]. If the maximum age remained at this level, the oldest person in 2100 would be approximately 115 years old.

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued:
The verified maximum human lifespan record is 122 years and 164 days, held by Jeanne Calment who died in 1997[3]. In the nearly three decades since then, this record hasn't been broken. If this slow historical growth pattern continues, we might expect only a modest increase, perhaps to 125-128 years by 2100.

(d) The expectations of experts and markets:
Experts generally suggest that without unprecedented medical breakthroughs, the maximum human lifespan is unlikely to dramatically increase. Scientific research indicates that the body's ability to recover is exhausted between 120 and 150 years, suggesting a biological ceiling that current medical technology cannot easily overcome.

(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome:
Global catastrophes like pandemics, climate disasters, or resource shortages could reduce healthcare quality and accessibility worldwide, potentially lowering maximum lifespans. In such scenarios, the oldest person might be only 110-115 years old in 2100.

(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome:
Breakthrough technologies in genetic engineering, cellular regeneration, or nanotechnology could dramatically extend human lifespans. Treatments that effectively address the fundamental causes of aging could potentially allow people to reach 150+ years by 2100, particularly if these advances become available in the next few decades.

My forecast takes into account several factors:
- The historically slow growth in maximum human lifespan
- The biological limitations currently understood in aging science
- The possibility of technological breakthroughs over a 75-year timeframe
- The increasing global population, which increases the statistical likelihood of outliers
- The uncertainty inherent in long-term forecasting

Given these considerations, I believe there's approximately a 50% chance the oldest person in 2100 will be between 125-135 years old, with wider tails to account for both conservative outcomes and breakthrough scenarios.
