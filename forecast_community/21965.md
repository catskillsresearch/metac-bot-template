The time remaining until the outcome of Bryan Caplan's bet is approximately 4.5 years, as the bet period concludes in 2029. Current data and trends strongly indicate that the global temperature increase from 2015 to 2029 is likely to exceed 0.05°C compared to the 2000-2014 average. This status quo suggests that Caplan is likely to lose his bet.

A scenario in which Caplan could win would require a significant and sustained reduction in global greenhouse gas emissions, leading to a stabilization or even a decrease in global temperatures. This could be driven by rapid advancements in clean energy technologies, widespread adoption of carbon capture and storage, and major international policy shifts enforcing strict emissions reductions. Additionally, natural climate variability, such as a prolonged period of volcanic activity or a series of strong La Niña events, could temporarily cool the planet.

Conversely, the continuation of current warming trends, driven by ongoing increases in greenhouse gas emissions and the absence of effective global climate policies, would result in continued record-breaking temperatures. Natural climate variability, such as El Niño events, could further exacerbate the warming trend, leading to a significant increase in global temperatures well above the 0.05°C threshold.

Given the prevailing data and trends, the evidence strongly suggests that the global temperature increase from 2015 to 2029 will exceed the 0.05°C threshold, making the status quo outcome, where Caplan loses the bet, the most likely scenario.
