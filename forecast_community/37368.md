Rail freight intermodal traffic in the U.S. for April 2025 is influenced by several converging trends and factors. Recent data through late April indicates that intermodal volumes continue to grow year-over-year, but at a clearly decelerating pace compared to the strong growth rates seen in early 2025. Specifically, weekly intermodal volumes have risen by approximately 2.6% year-over-year by the end of April, a marked slowdown from double-digit or high single-digit growth experienced in the first quarter. Cumulatively, year-to-date intermodal traffic through about 17 weeks in 2025 is roughly 8% higher than the same period in 2024, reflecting ongoing economic momentum and sustained demand for freight transportation by rail.

Seasonal patterns typically show April volumes slightly below or roughly flat compared to March, which had a reported figure of approximately 1.21 million containers and trailers. Weekly data for April's three complete weeks range from about 268,700 to 274,300 containers per week, and this suggests a plausible total volume for April in the range of roughly 1.15 to 1.20 million containers and trailers, depending on the exact weekly distribution.

Market and expert expectations align on a moderation trend: while the rail intermodal sector remains well above the prior year’s volumes, growth is expected to slow during the second and third quarters of 2025 as inventory pull-forward effects and tariff-driven import surges wane. The broader freight market shows constrained month-on-month growth in April shipments, consistent with a softening pace.

Key uncertainties could push the actual April figure outside these central expectations. On the downside, a sudden and sharper-than-anticipated drop in import traffic—particularly trans-Pacific imports from China—due to escalating trade tensions or accelerated inventory depletion could depress intermodal volumes significantly, potentially lowering April totals to near 1.07 to 1.17 million containers and trailers. Additionally, adverse weather or major rail service disruptions could also suppress throughput.

Conversely, unexpected factors such as a late surge in consumer spending, shippers rushing to clear backlog ahead of tariff changes, or accelerated modal shifts from trucking to rail driven by capacity constraints or cost considerations could stabilize or even elevate April volumes. In such scenarios, volumes might hold near or exceed March’s level, potentially reaching or surpassing 1.21 million containers.

In sum, the strongest rationale integrates the following points:

- April 2025 U.S. rail intermodal traffic is likely to show continued year-over-year gains but at a tempered growth rate of around 2-3%, down from the faster pace seen earlier in the year.
- Weekly volume data and seasonal trends support an April total somewhat below March's 1.21 million figure, plausibly in the 1.15 to 1.20 million container range.
- The first quarter’s momentum and persistent economic demand underpin a baseline of growth, while expert consensus and market signals expect moderation ahead.
- Significant downside risks center on import traffic declines linked to China trade issues and inventory drawdowns.
- Upside potential exists from tariff-driven import surges and modal shift dynamics.
- Operational and environmental factors such as weather or rail service disruptions remain wildcard influences.

This integrated rationale positions April 2025’s U.S. rail freight intermodal traffic as a complex interplay between moderating but positive underlying growth trends, seasonal effects, and notable uncertainty from external economic and operational shocks.
