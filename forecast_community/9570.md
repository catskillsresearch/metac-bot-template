# Comprehensive Rationale on Global Temperature Reaching 2.0°C by 2037

The question of whether the annual average temperature anomaly above the 1850-1899 baseline will reach 2.0°C or higher by 2037 requires careful analysis of current warming trends, climate model projections, and factors that could accelerate or delay warming.

## Current Temperature Trends

Global warming has been accelerating at an alarming rate. The year 2024 was the first to surpass 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, with a global average temperature of approximately 1.55°C above the 1850-1900 mean. This represents a critical threshold that was previously not expected to be reached for several more years, indicating that warming is occurring faster than many earlier projections anticipated.

## Model Projections for 2.0°C

Under current emissions trajectories (close to the SSP2-4.5 scenario, where emissions remain relatively flat), most climate models project that the 2.0°C threshold will be reached after 2037:

- Carbon Brief's analysis of CMIP6 model results indicates that temperatures are expected to pass 2.0°C in the SSP2-4.5 scenario between 2038 and 2072, with a median estimate around 2048.
- More recent data from May 2025 suggests this timeline might be accelerating, with some projections indicating the 2°C mark could be reached around 2037, and some datasets (ERA5) predicting an earlier breach by 2034.
- The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) currently indicates only about a 1% chance of exceeding 2.0°C in any single year within the next five years.

## Factors That Could Accelerate Warming

Several factors could potentially lead to earlier exceedance of the 2.0°C threshold:

1. **Higher Emissions Trajectory**: If global emissions rise significantly or shift to higher emission pathways (SSP3-7.0 or SSP5-8.5), warming would accelerate substantially.

2. **Climate Feedbacks**: Underestimated or unexpected climate feedbacks, such as rapid Arctic ice loss, permafrost methane release, or decreased carbon sink efficiency, could amplify warming beyond current projections.

3. **Persistent El Niño Events**: Strong, back-to-back El Niño events could temporarily boost global temperatures and potentially contribute to a faster approach to the 2.0°C threshold.

4. **Reduced Aerosol Cooling**: Decreasing aerosol pollution (which currently masks some warming) could reveal more of the greenhouse effect, accelerating observed warming rates.

5. **Higher Climate Sensitivity**: If the Earth's climate system proves more sensitive to greenhouse gas concentrations than the median estimates used in most models, warming could progress more rapidly.

## Factors That Could Delay Warming

Conversely, several factors could delay reaching the 2.0°C threshold:

1. **Accelerated Climate Action**: More aggressive emission reductions than currently anticipated could slow the warming trend.

2. **Natural Variability**: Short-term cooling cycles or La Niña events could temporarily offset some warming.

3. **Increased Aerosol Emissions**: Volcanic eruptions or other sources of aerosols could provide temporary cooling effects.

4. **Carbon Removal Technologies**: Successful deployment of carbon dioxide removal technologies at scale could begin to reduce atmospheric CO₂ concentrations.

## Recent Warming Signals

Recent observations indicate warming may be accelerating beyond previous projections:

- The current warming rate appears to be around 0.2-0.3°C per decade, but some analyses suggest it could be accelerating to ~0.43°C per decade in the short term.
- The Arctic is warming at a rate several times faster than the global average, which could trigger additional feedback loops.
- Scientists warn that the recent temperature anomalies could be an "early warning sign" that long-term limits are being breached faster than expected.

## Synthesizing the Evidence

Looking at all available evidence, there's a clear trend of accelerating warming beyond previous model predictions. However, most projections still place the breach of the 2.0°C threshold after 2037 under current policy and emission trajectories.

While the latest data from May 2025 suggests the 2°C threshold might be reached around 2037 (with some datasets predicting 2034), the majority of scientific consensus and model projections indicate that under business-as-usual scenarios, we're more likely to see global temperatures reach approximately 1.7-1.9°C by 2037, falling just short of the 2.0°C threshold until the 2040s.

The probability of crossing 2.0°C before 2037 is non-trivial and has grown in recent years due to accelerating warming trends, but it would still require either a shift to higher emission scenarios, significant climate feedbacks, or persistent extreme natural variability to occur.
