## Rationale for the Probability That Donald Trump or Elon Musk Will Tweet (X Post) Using the Exact Phrase "Diversity Visa" Before July 1, 2025

Both Donald Trump and Elon Musk have well-documented histories of active engagement on U.S. immigration policy. However, their public commentary—across policy statements, interviews, and social media—has been almost exclusively focused on employment-based visas, particularly the H-1B and the newer "gold card" program. Trump has publicly praised the H-1B visa, calling it a "great program," and Musk has vigorously defended skilled immigration to the U.S., often referencing the need for greater access to technical talent. There is no evidence that either has ever directly addressed the Diversity Visa program by name in their public statements or on X/Twitter.

Recent developments underscore this trend. In 2025, Trump and Musk’s political relationship has cooled, with Musk reducing his involvement in government advisory roles and both figures stepping back from coordinated public messaging. Musk has announced a withdrawal from daily political engagement, redirecting his focus to private business ventures, while Trump has shifted attention to legislative packages and international priorities. This mutual distancing further reduces the likelihood of either using their platform to spotlight the Diversity Visa program, especially in a coordinated or reactive fashion.

The current U.S. immigration debate remains centered on border security, deportation policies, high-skilled migration, and practical concerns, such as preparing for the 2026 World Cup. The Diversity Visa program has not emerged as a subject of legislative action, administrative controversy, or major public debate, and there are no policy shifts, court cases, or viral stories in the current news cycle that might prompt a sudden pivot in their messaging.

Both Trump and Musk are known for unpredictable social media behavior, but in practice, their posts are usually driven by trending topics or high-visibility controversies. Given that the resolution of the forecast hinges on the use of the **exact phrase** "diversity visa"—rather than a broader or tangential discussion—this makes a qualifying post even less likely. While unforeseen news events could technically spark such a comment, there is currently no catalyst on the horizon.

In summary, the historical absence of attention to the Diversity Visa program by either figure, their strong focus on employment-based visas, the lack of imminent trigger events, the strictly defined resolution criteria, and their current disengagement from each other collectively make the probability of either Trump or Musk tweeting the exact words "diversity visa" before July 1, 2025, very low.
