The possibility of a global catastrophe due to naturally occurring pandemics by 2100 is low but not negligible. Historical evidence shows that only the Black Death in the 14th century has caused a population decline meeting the criteria of a 10% reduction within 5 years. Modern advancements in medical technology, global health surveillance, and pandemic preparedness have significantly enhanced our ability to respond to and mitigate the impacts of naturally occurring pandemics.

However, several factors could potentially increase the risk of a catastrophic pandemic. These include increasing global population density, climate change, ecosystem disruption, urbanization, and increased global travel. These factors could lead to the emergence of new pathogens or the resurgence of known ones with increased virulence. The destruction of natural habitats may also contribute to the risk of new zoonotic diseases.

The COVID-19 pandemic, while severe, resulted in far fewer deaths than would be required to meet the catastrophic threshold defined in this question. This demonstrates the effectiveness of modern response capabilities, even in challenging scenarios. The rapid development of vaccines and treatments during COVID-19 suggests that even if a severe pandemic were to occur, the global response would likely prevent it from reaching truly catastrophic levels.

It's important to note that other potential causes of global catastrophes, such as those from artificial intelligence, climate change, or engineered biological threats, are considered more likely sources of a potential global catastrophe than naturally occurring pandemics.

Given the long time horizon until 2100, there is significant uncertainty. While we should give extra weight to the status quo outcome, we must also consider the potential for unforeseen developments or "black swan" events. The requirement that the pandemic must be naturally occurring, excluding engineered or enhanced pathogens, further reduces the likelihood of a catastrophic outcome.

Considering all these factors, the probability of a global catastrophe due to naturally occurring pandemics remains low, but it is a risk that cannot be completely discounted given the potential consequences and the long timeframe involved.
