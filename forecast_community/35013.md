Based on the search results provided, I'll analyze the likelihood of an AI achieving >85% performance on the FrontierMath benchmark before 2026.

(a) Time left until outcome: Approximately 7.5 months (from May 13, 2025 until January 1, 2026)

(b) Status quo outcome: If nothing changes, no AI will achieve >85% on FrontierMath before 2026, as current top performers are scoring only around 10-19%.

(c) No outcome scenario: AI development continues at its current pace, with incremental improvements in mathematical reasoning capabilities, but the fundamental challenges of FrontierMath remain too difficult to overcome within the short timeframe. The gap between current performance (~10-19%) and the target (85%) proves too large to bridge by January 2026.

(d) Yes outcome scenario: A breakthrough in AI mathematical reasoning occurs, perhaps through a novel architecture specifically designed for advanced mathematical problem-solving. A major AI lab dedicates extraordinary resources to solving this specific benchmark, achieving a dramatic leap in performance before the deadline.

## Current Performance Assessment

The FrontierMath benchmark represents an extraordinarily difficult challenge for today's AI systems. According to the search results, the current performance levels are:

- Top language models including Claude 3.5 Sonnet, o1-preview, GPT-4o, and Gemini 1.5 Pro achieved less than 2% accuracy on FrontierMath problems despite extensive support frameworks[2].

- OpenAI initially claimed its o3 model achieved 25.2% on FrontierMath in December 2024, but independent testing by Epoch AI in April 2025 showed the actual performance was closer to 10%[4][5].

- The most recent results indicate that OpenAI's o4 with reasoning is performing best, scoring between 15% and 19%[4].

This represents a significant gap from the 85% threshold required for a "Yes" outcome.

## Technical Challenges

FrontierMath is intentionally designed to test the limits of AI mathematical reasoning capabilities:

- The benchmark consists of competition-level mathematics problems from sources like the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) and Putnam Competition[5].

- These problems require advanced problem-solving skills, creativity, and mathematical intuition that current AI architectures fundamentally struggle with[2].

- Even with extensive support frameworks including Python environments to test hypotheses and verify intermediate results, performance remains extremely low[2].

- For context, this performance gap is particularly striking when compared to other mathematical benchmarks such as GSM-8K and MATH, where top models now achieve over 90% accuracy[2].

## Historical Progress Rate

The rate of improvement on FrontierMath has been modest:

- From late 2024 to April 2025, the highest confirmed score has increased from approximately 2% to around 15-19% (for OpenAI's o4 with reasoning)[4].

- To reach 85% by January 2026, we would need to see an improvement of approximately 66-70 percentage points in just 7.5 months.

- This would require a rate of improvement roughly 5-6 times faster than what we've observed over the past 6 months.

## Industry Developments

While AI development continues at a rapid pace, there are no clear indicators of an imminent breakthrough in mathematical reasoning capabilities:

- According to BofA analysts, AI model sizes are doubling approximately every six months, with significant continued investment in AI infrastructure expected through 2026[4].

- However, scaling alone has not proven sufficient to solve the fundamental challenges presented by FrontierMath, as evidenced by the still-low performance of even the largest models.

- The Stanford AI Index 2025 report notes that FrontierMath is among the most challenging benchmarks, where even top systems struggle significantly[3].

## Forecasting Analysis

Given the current state of AI development and the specific challenges of FrontierMath, several factors suggest a low probability of achieving >85% performance by January 2026:

1. **Current Performance Gap**: The gap between current performance (~19% at best) and the target (85%) is extremely large.

2. **Rate of Progress**: While AI capabilities are advancing rapidly in many domains, the rate of improvement on FrontierMath specifically has been modest, with top models still solving less than 20% of problems.

3. **Benchmark Difficulty**: FrontierMath is specifically designed to evaluate research-level mathematical reasoning capabilities that current AI architectures fundamentally struggle with.

4. **Time Constraint**: With only 7.5 months remaining, there is limited time for the multiple breakthroughs that would likely be required to achieve such a dramatic performance improvement.

5. **Status Quo Bias**: As a good forecaster, I recognize that dramatic changes to the status quo are relatively rare, and incremental progress is more likely than revolutionary breakthroughs, especially in the short term.

While there is always the possibility of an unexpected breakthrough, the weight of evidence suggests that achieving >85% on FrontierMath before January 2026 is highly unlikely based on the current trajectory of AI development.
