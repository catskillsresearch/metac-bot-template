The development of a commercial hyperloop system faces significant technical, regulatory, and financial challenges, making the status quo outcome—where no system is operational by 2035—a considerable possibility. However, recent developments in India, particularly at IIT Madras and TuTr Hyperloop, show strong government support and progress, positioning India as a strong contender to launch the first commercial hyperloop system. This momentum is bolstered by India's ability to potentially overcome technical and regulatory hurdles with continued government backing.

In contrast, the United States, despite having early technical advantages and existing test infrastructure, faces substantial regulatory challenges and requires significant investment and political support to advance a commercial hyperloop project. Companies like Virgin Hyperloop and The Boring Company could spearhead efforts in the US, potentially targeting high-traffic corridors such as those on the East Coast. However, the pace of infrastructure development and the complexity of hyperloop technology present ongoing obstacles.

Overall, while India currently appears to be making more significant strides towards achieving a commercial hyperloop system, the US retains potential if it can effectively address its regulatory and investment challenges. The outcome remains uncertain, with both countries having plausible paths to success, but the status quo of no operational system by 2035 remains a strong possibility due to the inherent difficulties involved.
