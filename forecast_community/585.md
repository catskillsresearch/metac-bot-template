## Rationale for the Likelihood of at Least 2°C Global Warming by 2100

The world is currently on a trajectory strongly favoring a rise in global average temperature of at least 2°C above 1880 levels by 2100, as indicated by recent policy actions, scientific consensus, and the persistent gap between climate goals and actual emissions trends.

**Current Policy Trajectory and Scientific Projections**

Existing climate policies—those actually implemented, not just pledged—are projected to result in approximately 2.7°C of warming above pre-industrial levels by 2100. This median estimate comes with a substantial probability of even greater warming: there is about a one-in-three chance that warming could reach 3.1°C or higher and a 10% chance it could exceed 3.4°C, according to leading climate analytics. Notably, these projections have shown no improvement for several years, reflecting a stagnation in meaningful policy advancement despite growing evidence of climate impacts.

Even under the most optimistic, best-case scenarios—assuming immediate, aggressive global emissions reductions and deployment of negative emissions technologies—warming is still projected to rise to around 1.8°C by 2100. Achieving this scenario would require a historically unprecedented global commitment, rapid technological breakthroughs, and massive economic transformation that are not currently underway.

**Climate System Inertia and Feedbacks**

The climate system exhibits significant inertia due to the long atmospheric lifetime of greenhouse gases and the slow response of major systems such as oceans and ice sheets. This means that even immediate and dramatic emissions reductions would not quickly halt warming; additional increases are effectively locked in by past and current emissions. Furthermore, feedback mechanisms, such as permafrost thawing and diminishing natural carbon sinks, risk amplifying warming beyond current projections if not adequately addressed.

**Policy and Political Realities**

There is a persistent and substantial gap between the ambition of international climate agreements (such as the Paris Agreement's goal to keep warming "well below 2°C") and the actual measures being taken by national governments. Most current national pledges are voluntary and lack robust enforcement, making rapid global coordination and a sharp policy shift highly unlikely in the near term. Historical precedent suggests that transformative, coordinated policy flips of the required scale occur slowly and face significant obstacles, especially given varying economic priorities and levels of development across nations.

**Current and Projected Impacts**

Observations from recent years show worsening climate impacts, including record ocean temperatures, more frequent extreme weather events, and rapid loss of glacial mass—all consistent with ongoing warming trends. These developments underscore both the urgency and the difficulty of reversing course in time to avoid the 2°C threshold.

**Likelihood and Possible Exceptions**

Avoiding at least 2°C of warming by 2100 would require:
- Immediate, globally coordinated emissions reductions far beyond current commitments.
- Rapid achievement of net-zero emissions—ideally by 2050.
- Deployment of large-scale carbon removal technologies.
- Favorable climate sensitivity at the lower end of scientific estimates.

While such a “No” scenario is technically possible, it is regarded as highly improbable based on current trends and the lack of political momentum.

**Conclusion**

Given the evidence from climate models, expert analyses, and the realities of current global policy, the probability is overwhelming that there will be at least a five-year period of global average temperatures at or above 2°C above 1880 levels by 2100. The trajectory toward at least 2°C of warming is robust even when accounting for scientific uncertainty, policy-driven variability, and possible technological breakthroughs, unless there is an unprecedented and near-immediate transformation in global governance and energy systems.

**Key Points:**
- Current policies set the world on track for ~2.7°C of warming by 2100, with no recent signs of improvement.
- Even best-case, aggressive mitigation scenarios only narrowly avoid 2°C, and would require a level of global coordination and innovation not presently in evidence.
- Climate system inertia and feedbacks reduce the impact of even immediate emission cuts, making higher warming likely.
- The gap between climate goals and action remains substantial, with policy and economic obstacles slowing progress.
- Unless dramatic, immediate, and sustained global decarbonization occurs, the world is virtually certain to experience at least 2°C of warming by century’s end.
