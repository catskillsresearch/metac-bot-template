## Rationale for the Maximum World Real GDP Growth in a Single Year in the 21st Century

The maximum world real GDP growth recorded so far in the 21st century was 6.26% in 2021, a highly unusual spike driven by the extraordinary rebound from the COVID-19 pandemic. This growth surge was fueled by massive global fiscal and monetary stimulus, rapid vaccination rollouts, and the release of pent-up consumer demand after widespread economic shutdowns. Prior to 2021, global GDP growth typically ranged from 2% to 4% annually, with the previous high at 4.4% in 2004.

### Current Trends and Outlook

Recent forecasts from major international organizations, including the IMF, OECD, and World Bank, indicate a slowing trend in global growth. Projections for 2025–2026 place annual world real GDP growth between 2.7% and 3.3%, with some sources expecting it could dip to 2.3% due to rising trade tensions and policy uncertainty. Longer-term, the structural outlook is for subdued global growth, reflecting several persistent constraints:

- **Trade fragmentation and increasing protectionism**: Heightened geopolitical tensions and frequent tariff increases threaten to fragment global trade, limiting cross-border economic dynamism and global supply chain efficiencies.
- **Policy and economic uncertainty**: Unpredictable policy environments, especially in large economies, are contributing to a more cautious global investment climate.
- **Demographic shifts**: Aging populations, particularly in advanced economies and China, are slowing workforce growth and placing further pressure on productivity.
- **High debt levels**: Elevated government and private sector debts could restrict fiscal capacity to mount robust stimulus in future downturns.

Taken together, these factors make it unlikely that the typical growth environment will produce a new maximum single-year growth rate above the 2021 peak over the remainder of the century.

### Potential for Exceptional Outcomes

Despite these headwinds, several scenarios could still generate a higher single-year growth spike:

- **Crisis-and-rebound events**: A future global catastrophe, such as a pandemic or major war, might trigger a sharp economic contraction, setting the stage for an even stronger synchronized rebound if followed by globally coordinated and unprecedented economic stimulus and recovery efforts. Such a post-crisis spike—if larger in scale than the COVID-19 episode—could exceed the current record.
- **Technological revolutions**: Truly transformative innovations, such as the global deployment of advanced AI, clean energy breakthroughs (e.g., practical fusion energy), or other disruptive technologies, could unlock unprecedented productivity gains, leading to a one-time explosive growth year.
- **Emerging market surges**: Synchronized rapid expansion across multiple large emerging economies—beyond any observed in recent decades—has the potential to boost the global growth figure, especially if accompanied by favorable policy and trade environments.

### Barriers to Exceeding the Current Maximum

Nevertheless, the probability of repeating or surpassing a rebound the scale of 2021, absent another extraordinary global event, remains low. Downward revisions to the 2021 growth figure could technically lower the maximum, but such revisions are rare for widely scrutinized data points.

### Summary

Over the remaining 75 years of the century, the baseline expectation is for subdued global growth, with typical annual rates well below the 2021 exceptional maximum. Only highly improbable crisis-rebound or technology-driven scenarios are likely to produce a higher single-year growth rate, given persistent demographic, structural, and policy barriers. The distribution of possible outcomes is therefore heavily weighted toward the current 6.26% standing as the all-century maximum, with only a modest chance of a new, higher outlier resulting from extraordinary global circumstances.
