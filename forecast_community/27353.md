The entrenched positions of both Russia and Ukraine, coupled with the complexity of the ongoing conflict, create a challenging environment for achieving a bilateral ceasefire or peace agreement. The current status quo suggests a low likelihood of such an agreement without significant changes in the diplomatic landscape. Despite the lack of progress in recent negotiations, there remains a potential for change, particularly if Trump is re-elected and employs his unconventional diplomatic style.

Trump's personal relationships with key figures like Putin and Zelensky could provide a unique avenue for negotiation. His approach might involve a combination of diplomatic pressure, incentives, and possibly concessions to bring both parties to the table. However, the structural obstacles, including the unwillingness of both sides to compromise, remain formidable.

While the probability of a comprehensive bilateral agreement being achieved and sustained under the strict resolution criteria is low, the possibility of unforeseen developments or shifts in the geopolitical landscape cannot be entirely dismissed. Trump's potential influence, if re-elected, could introduce new dynamics, but historical trends and the current diplomatic environment suggest that significant changes would be required to shift the outcome to a favorable resolution.
