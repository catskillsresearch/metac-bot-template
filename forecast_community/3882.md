The outcome of humanity using more than one millionth of the sun's energy output is not expected to be known for several centuries. Current technological and societal trends indicate that we are far from achieving this milestone. If the status quo remains unchanged, humanity will continue to capture only a minuscule fraction of the sun's energy, far below the one-millionth threshold. Even if the current trend of solar energy growth continues, it is insufficient to close the multi-order-of-magnitude gap by 2100.

Experts and markets generally agree that without transformative technological advances, reaching the one-millionth threshold before 2200 is unlikely. The probability of achieving this by 2100 is considered extremely low. However, a breakthrough in technologies such as self-replicating space-based solar collectors or Dyson swarm technology could drastically accelerate our ability to harness solar energy, potentially allowing us to reach the threshold within a few centuries.

Conversely, a global catastrophe, such as a major asteroid impact, severe climate crisis, or other catastrophic events, could significantly delay or prevent the development of necessary technologies. Such events could disrupt technological progress and energy infrastructure, pushing the achievement of the threshold far into the future or rendering it ambiguous.
