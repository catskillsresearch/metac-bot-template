(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  
The outcome will be determined by May 1, 2026, or earlier if a qualifying public statement of Powell’s forced removal is made. As of May 9, 2025, there are just under 12 months remaining.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
If current trends persist—meaning Trump continues to express dissatisfaction but does not make a public, official move to terminate Powell—the outcome is "No attempt" to fire Powell before his scheduled term ends.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
Trump continues to publicly criticize Powell and apply political pressure, but stops short of making a formal or public statement that Powell is terminated, dismissed, or forcibly replaced. Powell remains in his position until his term expires in May 2026.

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
Trump or an authorized administration official publicly announces Powell's forced removal as FRB or FOMC Chair before May 2026, or names a successor in a manner that clearly signals Powell was replaced involuntarily. This could occur regardless of whether legal challenges prevent the removal from taking effect.

## Rationale and Probability Assessment

Recent developments show an extraordinary level of public criticism and threats from President Trump toward Chair Powell, including explicit statements that Powell’s “termination cannot come fast enough”[1][2][3]. Trump’s administration is reportedly studying the legality and logistics of firing Powell[2]. However, the legal consensus remains that, under existing law, a Fed Chair can only be removed for “cause”—generally interpreted as misconduct rather than a policy dispute[1]. Powell himself has stated that presidential removal is "not permitted under the law," and most experts—citing Supreme Court precedent—agree[1].

Despite this, the Trump administration has fired officials at other independent agencies, signaling a willingness to challenge or reinterpret established norms and legal protections for agency heads[1][2]. Still, no president has ever publicly attempted to fire a Fed Chair, and such a move would create major political and market turbulence[1][3]. Recent statements from Trump, while highly critical, have at times suggested he may wait for Powell’s term to expire, noting in interviews that he can replace Powell in a “short period of time” and asking rhetorically, “Why would I do that?”[3][4].

The status quo strongly favors “no attempt”—presidential threats and insults, but no official act of termination. However, a non-negligible risk remains given Trump’s pattern of norm-breaking and the administration’s ongoing legal review. The actual bar for this question (“an official public statement by Trump or the US government terminating or replacing Powell before May 2026”) is high, but not insurmountable—especially if economic events or political frustrations escalate.

Given the above, the most likely outcome is that no formal firing attempt will be made before Powell’s term expires, but the probability is higher than in any prior administration.
