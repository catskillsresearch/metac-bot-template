(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
The answer will be clear once President Donald Trump signs into law a reconciliation bill passed by Congress, or if this does not happen by December 31, 2025. As of today (May 10, 2025), that leaves up to around 8 months for the outcome to be determined.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
Currently, the House has passed the budget resolution necessary to start the reconciliation process, and relevant committees have until May 9 to submit their portions of the reconciliation bill[1][4][5]. The Republican leadership is targeting Memorial Day (May 26, 2025) for passing the full bill and sending it to President Trump for signing[2][5]. If this timetable holds, the bill could be signed into law in June 2025.

(c) **Scenario that results in an unexpected outcome:**  
A plausible unexpected scenario is if deep disagreements emerge between Republican Senate and House caucuses—particularly over contentious tax cuts, border security measures, or the $880 billion in required cuts by the Energy & Commerce Committee[5]. Such disagreements could stall the legislative process, delaying passage into July or beyond. Another risk is that negotiations over the debt ceiling or last-minute parliamentary challenges (e.g., the Byrd Rule) could force Republicans to rewrite and re-pass sections of the bill, pushing the signing into late summer or fall—or, if gridlock persists, failing to pass a reconciliation bill at all in 2025.

## Rationale

- **Status quo (Before July):**  
  The committee process is on a tight schedule, and leadership has publicly targeted Memorial Day for passage, with the possibility of a signing by June if things proceed smoothly[2][5]. This is the "default" path and carries the most weight, as delays often do not materialize as severely as feared.

- **Potential for moderate delay (July - August):**  
  Given the complexity of the bill—combining tax, spending, and border security policy—and the volume of committee work remaining, there's a significant risk of slippage. Past reconciliation efforts often run behind schedule, and key committees such as Ways and Means may not finish their work on time[5].

- **Later outcomes (September-December, Not in 2025):**  
  Longer delays could occur if partisan or intra-party divides deepen over controversial provisions or if external factors (like a surprise in the debt ceiling timetable or negative parliamentary rulings) force a reset or major rewrite. Historical precedent, however, suggests that trifecta governments are highly motivated and usually manage to pass at least one reconciliation bill in their first year, though often later than initially planned.

## Final Probabilities

Before July: 45
