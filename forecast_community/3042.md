# Will wildfires destroy a total exceeding 10Mha of global tree cover in any year before 2031?

## Current Status and Recent Trends

Global forest loss has reached unprecedented levels, with 2024 marking a dramatic shift in wildfire patterns. In 2024, tropical primary forest loss reached 6.7 million hectares - nearly double the amount lost in 2023 and representing destruction at a rate of 18 soccer fields per minute. For the first time on record, fires surpassed agriculture as the leading cause of tropical primary forest loss, accounting for nearly 50% of all destruction compared to the historical average of 20%.

The 2024 data is particularly alarming not only for tropical regions but when considering the global picture. While tropical forests saw record damage, boreal forests in Canada and Russia also experienced devastating fire seasons. In 2023, Canada alone lost nearly 7.8 million hectares of tree cover to wildfires - approximately six times the country's annual average for 2001-2022.

## Climate Drivers and Regional Vulnerabilities

The sharp increase in wildfire-driven forest loss is directly linked to climate change effects and weather patterns:

- **Temperature increases**: 2023 was the hottest year on record, with Earth's warming exceeding 1.5C over pre-industrial levels on an annual basis for the first time.
- **Drought conditions**: Brazil and much of Latin America experienced their worst drought on record, creating ideal conditions for rapid fire spread.
- **Regional vulnerabilities**: Boreal forests are particularly susceptible, with approximately 70% of all fire-related tree cover loss between 2001-2023 occurring in these northern regions.

Brazil, which will host the COP30 climate summit, accounted for 42% of all tropical primary forest loss in 2024. This loss was attributed to both fires and continued industrial soy and cattle farming activities.

## Scenarios for Future Wildfire Impact

### Potential Pathways to Exceeding 10Mha

Several factors suggest the 10Mha threshold could be crossed in the coming years:

- **Escalating trend**: The dramatic 80% year-over-year increase from 2023 to 2024 shows an alarming acceleration. Even a more modest 30-40% increase over the next couple of years could push annual wildfire-driven loss above 10Mha.
- **Simultaneous regional events**: If a single year experiences synchronized extreme fire conditions across both tropical and boreal regions, the combined global total could easily exceed 10Mha.
- **Climate feedback loops**: As forests burn, they release greenhouse gases that further accelerate climate change, creating conditions for more severe fires in subsequent years.
- **El Niño cycles**: Future strong El Niño events before 2031 could create extended drought conditions in fire-prone regions, potentially leading to record-breaking fire seasons.

### Mitigating Factors

Several elements could help prevent crossing the 10Mha threshold:

- **Policy interventions**: Some regions have demonstrated success in reducing fire-driven forest loss. Indonesia and Malaysia have implemented effective policies that could serve as models for other countries.
- **International pressure**: The Glasgow Leaders Declaration of 2021, signed by over 140 countries, committed to halting and reversing forest loss by 2030, which could drive stronger protection efforts.
- **Improved fire management**: Advances in early detection systems and rapid response capabilities could help contain fires before they reach catastrophic levels.
- **Climate variability**: Not every year will experience the worst-case combination of drought, heat, and ignition events simultaneously across major forest regions.

## Time Considerations

With approximately 5.5 years remaining until the end of 2030, there are multiple fire seasons during which the threshold could be crossed. The rapid acceleration seen in recent years suggests we may be entering a new era of mega-fires globally rather than experiencing temporary anomalies.

While the 10Mha threshold for wildfire-driven tree cover loss has not yet been definitively crossed in a single year, the trajectory is concerning. The combined effects of climate change, land use practices, and the vulnerability of both tropical and boreal forests create substantial risk of at least one year before 2031 exceeding this threshold.

The evidence indicates that we are witnessing not just random variation but a fundamental shift in fire regimes globally. With fires now causing nearly half of tropical forest destruction and creating unprecedented damage in boreal regions, the likelihood of a year exceeding 10Mha of wildfire-driven tree cover loss before 2031 appears significant.
