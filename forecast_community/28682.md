The European Union's stability and cohesion face ongoing challenges, but the likelihood of a member state triggering Article 50 to leave before 2030 remains low. Several factors contribute to the continued strength of EU membership:

1. Brexit's deterrent effect: The complexities and economic disruptions faced by the UK post-Brexit serve as a stark warning to other countries considering exit.

2. Moderation of eurosceptic parties: Many previously anti-EU parties have shifted their stance, now advocating for reform within the EU rather than outright withdrawal.

3. Economic interdependence: EU member states are deeply integrated economically, making exit costly and complex.

4. Ongoing expansion plans: The EU's consideration of new members indicates its continued attractiveness and relevance.

However, several factors could potentially increase the risk of a country leaving:

1. Rising populism and nationalism: Far-right parties have gained ground in several EU countries, with some achieving significant electoral success.

2. Economic challenges: Ongoing issues like inflation, energy prices, and economic disparities could fuel discontent with EU policies.

3. Migration and sovereignty concerns: Disagreements over migration policies and national sovereignty continue to strain relations between some member states and the EU.

4. Geopolitical pressures: The EU's ability to navigate external challenges, such as relations with Russia and potential shifts in US policy, could impact its cohesion.

The EU's capacity to address these challenges through compromise and reform will be crucial in maintaining unity. If the EU demonstrates adaptability and effectively tackles member state concerns, the likelihood of an exit decreases. Conversely, if divisions deepen and the EU is perceived as inflexible, the risk of a member state leaving increases.

While the current trajectory favors continued EU membership for all current members through 2030, the possibility of political shifts or unforeseen crises means a withdrawal scenario cannot be entirely ruled out. The most plausible path to an exit would involve a far-right or strongly eurosceptic party winning a national election in a member state like France, Italy, or Hungary, and quickly moving to trigger Article 50 before opposition can mobilize.

Given these factors, while an EU exit remains unlikely, there is a non-negligible risk of a member state triggering Article 50 if certain political and economic conditions align. The probability of this occurring before 2030 is low but not zero, reflecting the complex interplay of factors that could influence such a momentous decision.
