The time remaining until the outcome is known is approximately 24.5 years, extending from June 2025 to January 2050. Historically, there have been no offensive nuclear detonations since 1945, and current nuclear doctrines across the globe emphasize deterrence rather than offensive use. If the current trend continues, it is expected that there will be fewer than one offensive nuclear detonation by 2050.

Experts and markets generally anticipate zero offensive nuclear detonations by 2050. However, they acknowledge a low but nonzero probability of a small number of detonations occurring due to regional conflicts or catastrophic escalation. This expectation is rooted in the historical trend and the prevailing emphasis on deterrence.

In a scenario where global stability is maintained, effective diplomatic efforts would prevent any offensive use of nuclear weapons, thereby preserving the status quo of zero offensive detonations. Conversely, an unexpected scenario that could lead to a higher number of detonations involves a major geopolitical crisis or regional conflict. Such a situation could escalate to the point where nuclear weapons are used offensively, potentially involving multiple detonations. This could occur in regions with existing tensions, such as between India and Pakistan or involving North Korea, where the risk of escalation is more pronounced.
