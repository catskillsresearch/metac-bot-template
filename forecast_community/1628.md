The current longest verified human lifespan is 122 years and 164 days, held by Jeanne Calment. With approximately 24 years and 7 months until 2050, this record remains the benchmark. If current trends persist, the maximum verified human lifespan is likely to remain around this age, as no significant breakthroughs in extending human lifespan have been verified. Experts and markets generally expect that Calment's record will remain unbroken by 2050, given the plateau in maximum verified lifespans and the absence of major advancements in anti-aging science.

Unexpected scenarios could alter this outlook. A significant error in historical records might be discovered, leading to a revision of Calment's age and a reduction in the verified maximum lifespan. Conversely, a breakthrough in anti-aging technology or the discovery of a previously unknown supercentenarian with verified documentation could lead to a new record significantly surpassing 122 years. While there is ongoing interest and research in longevity, no practical or verified increase in maximum lifespan has been achieved to date.
