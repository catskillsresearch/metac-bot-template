The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) “grey list,” formally referred to as “Jurisdictions under Increased Monitoring,” is revised at each of the three annual FATF plenary meetings to reflect member states’ progress in addressing anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing (AML/CFT) deficiencies. The pattern over recent years demonstrates that most plenary meetings result in at least one jurisdiction either being added or removed, underscoring the dynamic and responsive nature of the FATF’s monitoring process. 

As of February 2025, the list comprised 25 jurisdictions, including Nigeria and South Africa, both of which have been under particular scrutiny due to their recent reform efforts and public commitments to exit the list.

**Historical Trends and Procedural Considerations**

The FATF’s regular plenary meetings are designed not just as formalities but as working forums where actual changes to the grey list are expected and frequently occur. The February 2025 plenary, for example, resulted in the removal of the Philippines following significant reforms verified during an on-site evaluation and the addition of Laos and Nepal, reflecting a responsive approach to both improvements and emerging risks. This cycle of regular updates reinforces the expectation that changes—either additions or removals—are more likely than a completely static outcome from any given plenary.

**Country-Specific Developments**

- **Nigeria:** The most robust recent evidence for a change centers on Nigeria. Nigerian officials, including the president and interior minister, have made clear the government’s intention to resolve outstanding FATF action items by the end of May 2025, ahead of the June plenary. While national objectives do not always guarantee FATF’s concurrence, such publicly documented actions and deadlines often precede removal, provided the FATF validates the reforms during its review and on-site assessments.

- **South Africa:** South Africa has made substantial progress, having addressed almost all action items in its FATF action plan. However, official statements from South Africa’s National Treasury and existing communications from FATF indicate that even full technical compliance by June does not necessarily translate to immediate removal; instead, the October 2025 plenary is seen as the more likely timeline for formal delisting, in line with FATF’s established practice of requiring a sustained and confirmed implementation period.

**Prospects for Additions**

No specific country has been publicly identified for imminent addition at the June 2025 plenary. However, the FATF’s ongoing surveillance means that countries facing emerging or newly recognized AML/CFT deficiencies can be added, sometimes without significant advance public reporting. For instance, renewed attention to Pakistan (previously removed in October 2022) demonstrates FATF’s willingness to reconsider jurisdictions if sufficient intelligence or evidence materializes, though such cases typically follow a multi-step review process.

**Status Quo Versus Change**

While the default status quo is always a possibility, the FATF’s operational history supports the expectation of one or more changes per plenary—whether through removals for progress (such as the Philippines in February 2025) or new additions in response to strategic deficiencies (such as Laos and Nepal). The cumulative evidence, particularly Nigeria’s stated deadline and the precedent of frequent list updates, suggest that a completely unchanged list after the June 2025 plenary would be atypical.

**Uncertainties**

Final outcomes depend on last-minute FATF evaluations, on-site assessments, and plenary consensus, none of which are fully predictable. Public statements and reform efforts by countries like Nigeria indicate high intent, but the FATF’s standards require both technical completion and evidence of effective, sustained implementation before changes are confirmed. The possibility of less-publicized additions, while present, currently lacks publicly available details.

**Conclusion**

Given the FATF’s historical pattern of frequent grey list updates, the credible and public reform commitments from jurisdictions like Nigeria, and the absence of signals pointing to a completely static outcome, the probability of at least one addition or removal from the grey list at the June 2025 plenary is high—though not without some degree of uncertainty, particularly regarding the precise timing of removals for countries like South Africa and the identification of new additions.
