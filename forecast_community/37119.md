## Consolidated Rationale for Forecasting FATF Black List Changes at the June 2025 Plenary

The annual cycle and recent history of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) strongly indicate that significant changes to the "High-Risk Jurisdictions subject to a Call for Action" (commonly referred to as the “black list”) are rare and tend to be accompanied by extensive prior warning and international signaling. As of May 2025, the black list comprises Iran, North Korea, and Myanmar, with no recent changes confirmed in the official February 2025 update.

### FATF’s Process and Signaling

Countries are placed on the black list only after persistent, significant deficiencies in their anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing (AML/CFT) regimes, combined with an absence of meaningful progress over an extended monitoring period. Placement on or removal from the black list is typically a gradual process, preceded by public warnings, action plans, and escalations first beginning with “grey listing” (jurisdictions under increased monitoring). Recent FATF cycles have seen activity primarily in the grey list (e.g., the addition of Laos and Nepal, removal of the Philippines), while the black list’s composition has remained steady.

### Myanmar’s Situation

Myanmar is the only blacklisted jurisdiction currently the subject of notable FATF attention. The February 2025 FATF plenary explicitly warned that, should Myanmar fail to show sufficient progress by June 2025, the FATF would consider further countermeasures against it. However, such language typically signals the potential adoption of stricter interventions while keeping the jurisdiction on the black list, not its removal. The FATF described Myanmar’s progress as “slow,” suggesting that removal from the list is unlikely at this time.

### Potential Additions: Absence of Imminent Candidates

Potential black list additions usually arise from persistent non-compliance among jurisdictions on the grey list. However, as of May 2025, there are no strong signals that any current grey-listed country faces imminent elevation. Recent news has highlighted calls from certain member states—such as India’s preparation of intelligence dossiers against Pakistan—but these have not resulted in official FATF warnings, nor do they align with the FATF’s documented process for blacklisting, which is characterized by public escalation and consultation. Pakistan, for example, was only recently removed from the grey list after a period of demonstrated cooperation and is not indicated in any FATF documentation as at risk of blacklisting in the near term.

### Historical Context and Status Quo Bias

Historically, changes to the FATF black list have been infrequent and characterized by clear, advance signaling. The FATF’s approach emphasizes stability and predictability, updating the black and grey lists at regular plenary meetings in February, June, and October. The default expectation, supported by the absence of credible indicators of imminent change, is that the black list will remain unchanged at the June 2025 plenary.

### Conclusion

In sum, all available evidence—ranging from recent FATF public statements and practice to the lack of new official warnings or announcements targeting specific jurisdictions—suggests that the outcome of the June 2025 FATF plenary will be the continued blacklisting of Iran, North Korea, and Myanmar, with no jurisdictions added or removed. The only anticipated development is the potential for enhanced countermeasures against Myanmar, but this would not alter the list’s composition. Given these considerations, the most consistent and well-supported rationale is that the composition of the FATF black list is likely to remain unchanged following the June 2025 plenary.
