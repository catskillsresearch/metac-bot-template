# Analysis of Future American Working Hours in 2030

The average American workweek has seen a significant historical decline, from 62 hours in 1870 to 40.25 hours in 2000, and further to 34.4 hours by 2019. This represents a long-term downward trend, though the pace has slowed considerably in recent decades.

## Key Factors Influencing Future Working Hours

**Technological Disruption and Automation**

By 2030, activities accounting for up to 30% of hours currently worked across the US economy could be automated, a trend accelerated by generative AI. This technological transformation will impact different sectors unevenly:
- Office support, customer service, and food service employment will likely continue to decline
- STEM, creative, and business/legal professionals will see their work enhanced rather than eliminated outright

**Demographic and Labor Force Changes**

The aging population will significantly influence the labor market by 2030:
- By 2030, all baby boomers will be at least 65 years old, with about one-fourth of the population in this age bracket
- The labor force is expected to grow by 8.9 million from 2020 to 169.6 million in 2030
- Labor force participation rates are projected to decline from 61.7% in 2020 to 60.4% in 2030
- These demographic shifts could create pressure on working hours for the remaining workforce

**Structural Employment Shifts**

The economy is projected to undergo significant restructuring:
- The US is expected to add approximately 11.9 million jobs between 2020 and 2030
- Healthcare and social assistance sectors will see substantial growth due to the aging population
- Federal investments in climate and infrastructure will alter labor demand
- Up to 12 million workers may need to transition to different occupations by 2030
- Workers in lower-wage jobs are up to 14 times more likely to need to change occupations than those in highest-wage positions

**International Trends and Policy Considerations**

Working hour trends vary globally:
- Mexico has announced plans to reduce standard working hours to 40 per week by 2030
- Spain has proposed reducing the workweek to 37.5 hours by the end of 2025
- European workers averaged 30.2 hours/week in 2023 compared to 34.6 hours/week in the US
- Meanwhile, German employers' associations have called for longer working hours, suggesting a 40-hour workweek

## Scenarios for 2030

**Downward Pressure on Working Hours**

Several factors could accelerate the decline in average working hours:
- Rapid AI adoption and automation deployment across multiple sectors
- Shifting worker preferences toward better work-life balance
- Potential policy changes inspired by international examples of shorter workweeks
- Continued growth of part-time employment in certain sectors

Under this scenario, average weekly hours could drop to around 28-30 hours per week.

**Upward Pressure on Working Hours**

Conversely, these factors might slow or reverse the decline:
- Labor shortages due to demographic shifts and declining labor force participation
- Economic challenges requiring increased productivity from existing workers
- Specific sector demands, particularly in healthcare, infrastructure, and construction
- Slower-than-expected automation adoption in key industries

In this scenario, average weekly hours might remain stable or even increase slightly to around 35-36 hours per week.

## Historical Context

The historical decline in average working hours has been substantial but has plateaued in recent decades. While Keynes famously predicted a 15-hour workweek by 2030 (made in 1930), economic analyses confirm this will not be realized. The US has historically been more resistant to dramatic reductions in working hours compared to some European counterparts.

The most likely outcome by 2030 is a modest reduction from the current 34.4 hours/week average. Technological changes will put downward pressure on hours, but this will be partially offset by demographic pressures and labor shortages in key sectors.
