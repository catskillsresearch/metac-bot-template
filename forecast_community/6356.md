The current understanding of cryptographic security and the historical robustness of AES-256 suggest that the likelihood of it being publicly broken by 2040 is exceedingly low. AES-256 has been extensively analyzed by the cryptographic community, and no practical vulnerabilities have been identified. The status quo outcome, where AES-256 remains unbroken, is heavily favored due to the slow pace of change in cryptographic breakthroughs and the extensive scrutiny AES-256 has undergone.

While the development of quantum computing poses a theoretical threat, the effective key length of AES-256 remains strong even against quantum attacks, such as those potentially facilitated by Grover's algorithm. The timeline for quantum computing to reach a level where it could threaten AES-256 is uncertain and likely extends beyond 2040. Additionally, the cryptographic community is actively working on post-quantum cryptography standards, which further supports the continued security of AES-256.

A scenario that could lead to AES-256 being broken would require a significant and unexpected breakthrough in cryptanalysis or quantum computing. This could involve a new mathematical insight that drastically reduces the complexity of breaking AES-256 or a rapid advancement in quantum computing capabilities. However, such breakthroughs are unprecedented and unlikely to occur within the next 14 years.

Overall, the combination of AES-256's current robustness, the lack of known practical attacks, and the historical trend of slow and incremental changes in cryptographic advancements strongly supports the conclusion that AES-256 will remain secure through 2040.
