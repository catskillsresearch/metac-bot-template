The probability of the United States entering a civil war that meets the specified criteria before 2031 is low. The U.S. is a wealthy, established democracy with strong institutional and historical barriers against such conflicts. Despite increasing political polarization, social unrest, and economic disparities, these factors alone are insufficient to escalate to a civil war. The criteria for this scenario are stringent, requiring both the invocation of the Insurrection Act and a significant number of deaths in military conflicts, which have not been met in modern U.S. history.

The professionalization and loyalty of the U.S. military to constitutional order further reduce the likelihood of such a conflict. The absence of organized armed factions with mass support and the resilience of democratic institutions suggest that political and social tensions will continue to be managed through political and legal means rather than military intervention. Historical trends show that civil wars in wealthy, established democracies are exceedingly rare, and the U.S. has consistently demonstrated the ability to resolve conflicts through democratic processes and reforms. Given these factors, the status quo outcome, where the U.S. does not enter a civil war, remains the most probable scenario.
