Leadership change in any of the United States’ designated foreign adversaries by the end of 2025 remains unlikely due to a combination of entrenched authoritarian control, regime stability, and a lack of credible indicators for imminent transitions. The adversary list includes China (Xi Jinping), Cuba (Miguel Díaz-Canel), Iran (Ali Khamenei), North Korea (Kim Jong Un), Russia (Vladimir Putin), and Venezuela (Nicolás Maduro).

These regimes share several key features that reinforce leadership continuity:

- **Centralized Power and Security Apparatus:** Each leader holds firm control over state institutions and security services, which are heavily invested in preventing both internal dissent and elite threats. This institutional design ensures that even rumors, health scares, or elite murmurs rarely translate into open succession struggles.

- **Recent Power Consolidation and Status Quo Bias:** Recent events have reinforced incumbency—such as Putin’s 2024 re-election and Xi Jinping’s elimination of term limits. These moves, coupled with historical precedent, demonstrate a tradition wherein leadership change typically results from death or a highly managed succession, not sudden removal or resignation.

- **Suppression of Dissent and Elite Cohesion:** Opposition within these states is systematically suppressed, and elite groups appear unified around current leaders. There are no reports of credible splits, purges, or security crises that could destabilize regimes in the short term.

- **Absence of Destabilizing Health or Political Events:** As of late May 2025, public reporting and allied threat assessments reveal no acute health crises or succession signals, even among older leaders like Khamenei and Maduro. While advanced age increases vulnerability to health events—especially for Khamenei (86) and Maduro—no urgent or credible warning signs are present.

- **External Pressures and Geopolitical Context:** While U.S. foreign policy under the Trump administration has become more confrontational—using sanctions, tariffs, and other levers to pressure adversaries—these strategies aim to alter state behavior, not regime change, and have not produced destabilization sufficient to imperil leadership positions. Furthermore, some adversaries, notably North Korea, are deepening alliances with fellow adversaries, further reinforcing internal security and stability.

- **Economic and Domestic Factors:** Economic difficulties, such as those driven by U.S. policies, persist in countries like Cuba and Venezuela, but have not translated into serious leadership vulnerability or credible unrest capable of precipitating regime collapse or removal from office.

- **Black Swan Risk Remains:** Although the probability of leadership change is low, it is not zero. Unexpected health crises or internal coups—often impossible to forecast in opaque regimes—do occasionally occur. The most plausible triggers for a surprise change would be a sudden health emergency in Iran or Venezuela, or an unanticipated internal power struggle in North Korea.

In summary, the available evidence overwhelmingly points to the continuation of the current leadership configuration through 2025. The durability of these regimes stems from deeply rooted authoritarian structures, effective threat suppression, absence of succession crises or health emergencies, and institutional preparation for continuity. While the aging of certain leaders and the inherent unpredictability of sudden health or political shocks prevent a zero-probability assignment, all credible indicators support the expectation that no leadership change will occur in these foreign adversaries by year’s end.
