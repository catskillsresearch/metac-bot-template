A comprehensive assessment of US crude oil production in April 2025 centers on recently published projections, observed production trends, and the policy and market environment. The official data from the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) will be released around late June or early July 2025, but the best available information enables a robust estimate.

The EIA’s May 2025 Short-Term Energy Outlook forecasts US crude oil production to average 13.42 million barrels per day for the year. This represents a downward revision from April’s forecast of 13.51 million barrels per day, reflecting lower-than-expected growth amid ongoing market headwinds, including slightly reduced rig activity and modest price pressures. S&P Global provides a similar projection, supporting a consensus view of stable but subdued growth.

Weekly EIA data from late April to early May 2025 show US crude oil production fluctuating narrowly between 13.38 and 13.46 million barrels per day. If April tracked these weekly levels, total monthly production would be roughly 402,000–403,800 thousand barrels, assuming 30 days in the month.

Risks to the downside include sudden disruptions in key producing regions such as the Permian Basin—responsible for almost half of US crude output—due to severe weather, infrastructure failures, or unexpected regulatory challenges. Such scenarios could push monthly output below 390,000 thousand barrels.

Conversely, the implementation of accelerated energy policies—namely, President Trump’s early 2025 “energy emergency” declaration and associated deregulatory measures—could temporarily boost output if producers rapidly expanded drilling and completions. This could push April 2025 production above 415,000 thousand barrels, though practical and logistical constraints may limit the speed and magnitude of such a surge.

Overall, with historical volatility in monthly production relatively low, most market experts and governmental forecasts anticipate April 2025 crude oil production to cluster near 402,000–403,000 thousand barrels. Outlier scenarios exist on both ends, but the prevailing signals from policy, market expectations, and actual production data support a moderate, stable outcome.
