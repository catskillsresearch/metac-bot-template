The development of weak Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and the resolution of the control problem are both complex challenges with uncertain timelines. Current research trajectories and commercial pressures heavily favor advancing AI capabilities over solving control and alignment issues. Most funding and effort is directed towards pushing the boundaries of AI functionality, while the control problem remains a largely theoretical challenge without clear solutions.

However, there are several factors that could potentially shift this balance:

1. Growing awareness of AI risks among policymakers, tech leaders, and researchers is leading to increased calls for regulation and safety measures.

2. Funding for AI alignment and safety research is increasing, though still not at the level of capability research.

3. There is potential for conceptual breakthroughs in alignment theory or the development of provably safe AGI architectures.

4. Projects aimed at mapping AI risks and solutions globally are gaining traction.

5. Regulatory efforts could potentially slow AGI development, allowing more time for control solutions to be developed.

The control problem presents unique challenges. It is inherently more difficult to prove that a control solution works than to demonstrate new AI capabilities. The problem may require solving fundamental issues in philosophy and ethics, and verifying solutions is extremely challenging.

Historical precedent in other technological domains suggests that safety solutions typically lag behind capability development. This pattern, combined with strong commercial incentives and international competition driving AGI development, makes it more likely that weak AGI will be achieved before the control problem is fully solved.

However, it's important to note that partial solutions or mitigation strategies for the control problem may be in place by the time weak AGI is developed. The complexity of both weak AGI development and the control problem introduces significant uncertainty into any predictions.

Unexpected breakthroughs in alignment research or unforeseen technical challenges in AGI development could alter the expected timeline. International cooperation on AI safety could also play a crucial role in slowing unsafe AGI development while control solutions are implemented.

Given these factors, while the current trajectory favors weak AGI preceding full solutions to the control problem, the outcome is far from certain. The long potential timeframe and the rapid pace of developments in the field of AI make any prediction inherently speculative.
