Chicago's rental market in 2025 demonstrates moderate but consistent year-over-year growth, underpinned by both national and local dynamics. In May 2025, the average rent in Chicago reached $2,000, up from $1,950 in May 2024, reflecting a 2.56% annual increase according to Zillow's Observed Rent Index. This trajectory aligns with national patterns, as the U.S. overall posted a 3.4% year-over-year increase as of April 2025, though Chicago continues to trend slightly below the national average.

Several factors contribute to this steady, positive growth. The city's rental market remains robust, with a "WARM" designation indicating elevated demand relative to supply. Tightening vacancy rates, particularly in neighborhoods like Logan Square, Lincoln Park, and Andersonville, are fueled by both a slowdown in new multifamily construction and rising interest rates that keep potential buyers renting longer. This persistent renter demand, coupled with steady investment interest due to Chicago's relative affordability, reinforces upward pressure on rents.

Despite this strength, Chicago's rent growth is moderate, tempered by affordability constraints and an incremental increase in available listings. While the multifamily segment is expected to see rent rises of about 2.1% in 2025, single-family rentals are forecasted to climb by 3.2%, supporting the general stability of the market. The city's rent is about 3% lower than the national average, providing a degree of insulation against the more extreme fluctuations seen in other markets.

Potential scenarios could disrupt this trajectory. An unexpected economic downturn, a surge in new rental supply, or a local crisis could drag year-over-year growth down near zero or even into negative territory. Conversely, a sudden influx of new residents, regulatory changes sharply restricting supply, or a spike in mortgage rates driving greater rental demand could push rent growth above 4%.

Legislative factors are also relevant. While statewide rent control remains prohibited, local advocacy and new ordinances—such as Chicago's Anti-Gentrification Ordinance targeting specific neighborhoods—could influence rental prices and market dynamics, especially in areas experiencing rapid change.

Overall, the most probable scenario for year-over-year rent growth in Chicago, according to the latest Zillow data, lies between 2.5% and 3.5%, with the direct annual increase for May 2025 being 2.56%. The market is shaped by a combination of strong demand, constrained supply, local policy shifts, and affordability pressures, resulting in a stable, moderate pace of rent appreciation that reflects both national and city-specific trends.
