Based on the search results provided and the current news updates, I'll analyze how much the 2025 reconciliation bill is likely to increase the deficit from FY 2025 to FY 2034.

(a) Time left until outcome is known: The question will be resolved when the CBO produces its cost estimate for the enacted reconciliation bill(s) during fiscal year 2025. Since it's currently May 13, 2025, and fiscal year 2025 ends on September 30, 2025, there are approximately 4.5 months remaining until the deadline.

(b) Outcome if nothing changed: If no reconciliation bill is passed, the question would be annulled. However, both chambers have already passed budget resolutions that establish the framework for reconciliation.

(c) Outcome if current trend continued: Based on the search results, the reconciliation bill appears to be heading toward a deficit increase in the range of $5 trillion over the ten-year budget window.

(d) Expectations of experts and markets: The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB) estimates the deficit impact at approximately $5 trillion through 2034[1]. The Wharton Budget Model similarly estimates a deficit increase of $5.1 trillion before economic effects and $4.9 trillion after modest economic effects[2]. The Senate budget resolution would allow for deficit increases of up to $3.3 trillion according to the American Action Forum[5].

(e) Unexpected scenario - low outcome: If significant additional spending cuts are found in committee markups beyond what's already identified, or if the final bill includes more revenue-raising provisions than currently anticipated, the deficit impact could be lower, perhaps around $3-4 trillion.

(f) Unexpected scenario - high outcome: If the final bill includes additional tax cuts beyond what's currently being discussed, or if fewer spending cuts materialize than anticipated, the deficit impact could exceed $5.5 trillion[1].

## Analysis of Potential Deficit Impact

The House Ways & Means Committee draft of the reconciliation bill suggests a deficit increase of approximately $5 trillion through 2034, with the potential to exceed $5.5 trillion according to preliminary estimates[1]. This aligns with the Wharton Budget Model's analysis, which projects a deficit increase of $5.1 trillion (before economic effects)[2].

The proposed reconciliation package is historically large compared to previous legislation. The House budget resolution initially allowed for a $2.8 trillion deficit increase over ten years[3], but the actual impact appears to be trending significantly higher. For context, this would exceed all previous deficit-increasing legislation of the past decade, including being 50% larger than the American Rescue Plan Act and twice as large as the original Tax Cuts and Jobs Act[3].

## Current Legislative Progress

Recent developments show some progress in finding spending cuts to partially offset the tax cuts. The House Energy and Commerce Committee has reportedly exceeded its target of finding $880 billion in savings over the 2025-2034 period, according to a CBO letter mentioned in recent news articles. These savings primarily come from changes to Medicaid and other healthcare programs.

However, the total proposed tax cuts (approximately $4.5 trillion) far exceed the identified spending cuts, leading to the substantial net deficit increase. The Senate reconciliation instructions allow for even larger deficit increases than the House version, potentially up to $5.7-$6 trillion.

## Final Forecast

Considering all available information, I forecast the following distribution for the deficit impact of the 2025 reconciliation bill over the FY 2025-2034 period:
