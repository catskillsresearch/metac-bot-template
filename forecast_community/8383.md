# Nuclear Winter Following Large-Scale Nuclear Conflict: Temperature Impact Assessment

The question of whether >100 offensive nuclear detonations in a single conflict by 2030 would cause a global temperature drop of ≥3°C requires analyzing both the likelihood of such a conflict and the resulting climate effects if it were to occur.

## Climate Impact Mechanisms

Nuclear detonations over urban and industrial areas would create massive firestorms, generating enormous plumes of smoke, soot, and dust. These particles would be lifted by their own heating to high altitudes where they could persist for weeks or longer. Scientific evidence shows that:

- Several hundred million tons of smoke and soot would form a uniform belt of particles encircling the Northern Hemisphere from 30° to 60° latitude
- These thick black clouds would block out all but a fraction of the Sun's light for a period as long as several weeks
- The power of black carbon is significant - it "lofts very high very quickly and it spreads very, very fast"

## Quantifying the Temperature Impact

Modern climate modeling provides strong evidence for substantial cooling following a large-scale nuclear conflict:

- Global mean surface temperatures would remain depressed by 0.5 to 1K below normal for up to 15 years after soot injection
- In a nuclear winter scenario involving a US/Russia conflict, models show an almost 10°C reduction in global mean surface temperature
- Surface temperatures would plunge for a few weeks, perhaps by as much as 11° to 22°C (20° to 40°F)
- To put this in perspective, the temperature change from pre-industrial times to today is only about 1°C, while in nuclear winter it approaches 10°C below climatological means after 2-3 years

## Additional Environmental Effects

The impacts would extend well beyond temperature drops:

- Solar radiation would decrease dramatically, with around a 75% decrease in surface radiation within the first couple of years
- Global precipitation would drop by approximately 58% after stratospheric soot injection
- Rainfall patterns would shift significantly, including weakening or disappearing monsoons and new rainfall over desert regions
- The conditions of semidarkness, killing frosts, and subfreezing temperatures, combined with high radiation levels, would interrupt plant photosynthesis and could destroy much of Earth's vegetation and animal life
- The growing season would be reduced by approximately 90% across many parts of the midlatitudes

## Key Uncertainties

Several factors would influence the magnitude of cooling:

- Target selection (urban vs. rural): Urban and industrial targets would generate significantly more soot than rural areas
- Weapon yields and number of detonations: Higher yields and more detonations generally produce more extensive firestorms
- Atmospheric conditions: Weather patterns at the time could affect how quickly and extensively the soot spreads globally
- Season and timing: These factors might influence initial fire severity and atmospheric circulation patterns

## Synthesis of Climate Evidence

If >100 offensive nuclear detonations were to occur in a single conflict, particularly targeting urban areas, the scientific consensus strongly supports a global temperature drop exceeding 3°C:

- For a full-scale US-Russia exchange involving thousands of warheads, models consistently show temperature drops of 5-10°C lasting nearly a decade
- Even "limited" scenarios (approximately 100 low-yield weapons targeting urban centers) project global temperature drops of 1-5°C
- The 3°C threshold specified in the question would almost certainly be exceeded in most urban-targeted nuclear conflict scenarios involving >100 detonations

The probability of experiencing a ≥3°C temperature drop, conditional on >100 nuclear detonations occurring in urban areas, is extremely high based on current climate science and modeling.
