(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  
There are approximately 8 months remaining until the final trading day of 2025, when Nvidia’s closing price will be compared to $134.29 to determine the outcome.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
If current price targets and sentiment persist, there is a modest lean toward a closing price above $134.29. The average analyst target for 2025 is above this threshold, but some quantitative models and technical trends indicate possible downside risk[2].

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome (Nvidia closes 2025 at or below $134.29):**  
This outcome could occur if:
- Demand for AI hardware and GPUs decelerates significantly, potentially due to economic slowdown, overcapacity, or new competition.
- Investor sentiment turns negative amid broader market weakness or sector rotation out of high-valuation tech.
- Nvidia underperforms relative to aggressive growth expectations, leading to multiple compression or a sharp re-rating[2].

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome (Nvidia closes 2025 above $134.29):**  
This outcome would be realized if:
- Nvidia maintains strong revenue and earnings growth, continuing to outpace expectations in AI and data center demand.
- The market remains favorable to high-growth tech stocks, or Nvidia’s unique positioning in AI translates into further positive re-ratings.
- Major product launches or partnerships drive further demand, supporting or exceeding current analyst targets[1][2].

## Rationale

Analyst consensus remains strongly bullish, with a median 2025 target of $164.23 and a “Strong Buy” rating from the majority of analysts—34 “Buy,” 5 “Hold,” and only 1 “Sell.” One notable forecast projects a year-end price of $137.50, still slightly above the $134.29 threshold, while the best-case scenario tops $192.50 and worst-case drops to $82.50, underscoring the wide range of potential outcomes[2].  

Technical and quantitative models, like CoinCodex and Longforecast, lean more cautious, sometimes predicting prices near or below the benchmark, reflecting current neutral sentiment and market volatility. However, Nvidia’s business momentum—exemplified by record revenues in its data center business and ongoing strong demand for new Blackwell GPUs—offers a fundamental tailwind[1].

The “status quo” outcome—leaning modestly above $134.29 by year-end—is supported by the prevailing analyst consensus but tempered by considerable uncertainty in economic and market conditions. Good forecasting emphasizes that most things change slowly and current outperformance tends to persist unless disrupted by clear negative catalysts.

## Final Probability

Probability: 65%  

This reflects moderate confidence that Nvidia will close 2025 above $134.29, incorporating both the bullish analyst consensus and the downside risks highlighted by macro volatility and technical caution[2].
