The current international landscape is characterized by a strong norm against the use of debris-generating kinetic ASAT weapons, supported by diplomatic efforts and policy shifts that emphasize non-destructive methods. This status quo, if maintained, would likely result in a "No" outcome, as there have been no publicly confirmed cases of a non-test, operational ASAT attack against a satellite. Major space-faring nations, including Russia and China, have shown a focus on non-destructive ASAT methods, and diplomatic efforts continue to solidify these norms, reducing the likelihood of offensive ASAT use.

However, the geopolitical environment remains volatile, with rising tensions among major powers such as the US, Russia, and China. This volatility increases the potential for a significant geopolitical crisis or conflict, which could lead to the use of ASAT weapons offensively against satellites. Such actions might be driven by strategic military objectives, such as disabling an adversary's communication or surveillance capabilities, or as a demonstration of technological prowess and deterrence. Non-kinetic ASAT methods, such as jamming or cyberattacks, present a moderate risk due to their difficulty in detection and attribution.

The strategic value of space assets and the potential for crisis escalation contribute to the assessment that, while the status quo outcome is "No," there is a moderate probability of a "Yes" outcome. The development and deployment of ASAT capabilities by countries like Russia and China, coupled with the complexities of attribution and detection for non-kinetic attacks, suggest that the probability of a non-test ASAT weapon being used offensively before 2030 is moderate.
