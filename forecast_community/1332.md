The global effort to reduce malaria mortality rates by 90% compared to 2015 levels by 2030 faces significant challenges. Current trends suggest that without major changes in approach and funding, this ambitious goal is unlikely to be achieved.

Recent reports indicate that progress has slowed or even reversed in some areas due to funding cuts and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on health systems. The potential dissolution of USAID and cuts to foreign aid budgets by major donor countries pose a significant threat to ongoing malaria control efforts. An ISGlobal study predicts 14 million additional deaths from various causes due to these cuts, highlighting the severity of the situation.

Climate change presents a mixed picture, potentially reducing malaria transmission in some areas while increasing it in others. The expansion of mosquito habitats and the emergence of drug-resistant strains of malaria further complicate control efforts. Political instability in affected regions can hamper healthcare access and disrupt prevention and treatment programs.

However, there are some positive developments to consider. New malaria vaccines have been approved and are being introduced in African countries. Studies show that the combination of vaccination and insecticide-treated nets is effective. Some regions, like Saudi Arabia, have reported significant reductions in infectious diseases, including malaria, demonstrating that rapid progress is possible with sustained effort and resources.

Technological advancements, including improved treatments and innovative vector control methods, offer hope for accelerated progress. The global health community remains committed to the goal, which could drive increased efforts and funding.

Despite these potential positives, the magnitude of the challenge (a 90% reduction) and the relatively short timeframe (less than 5 years remaining) make achieving this goal extremely difficult. The world is currently not on track to meet this target, and recent setbacks are likely to exacerbate the situation.

While unexpected breakthroughs or a massive increase in global commitment could potentially turn the tide, the weight of evidence suggests that achieving a 90% reduction by 2030 is unlikely. Good forecasters should put extra weight on the status quo outcome, which in this case points towards missing the target. However, the potential for technological breakthroughs and renewed global commitment keeps the possibility from being negligible.
