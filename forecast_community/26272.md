## Combined Rationale for Whether a Winning Bot Will Beat the Human Pro Aggregate Before Q3 2025

There is now just over a month remaining for any bot in the 2025 Quarterly AI Benchmarking tournaments to surpass the human Pro aggregate before Q3 begins. Over the last several quarters, AI forecasting bots have made remarkable progress, narrowing the gap with the elite Pro aggregate to historically small margins. This progress is evident in head-to-head tournament results and in broader trends in AI and large language model (LLM) capability, with leading bots leveraging advanced ensemble techniques, improved calibration, and innovative aggregation strategies.

Despite these gains, as of late May 2025 there is no public record of any bot outperforming the Pro aggregate on the official benchmarking criteria: only forecasts made by both groups on overlapping questions count, and results are evaluated by spot (final) scoring on the Baseline metric. The Pro aggregate remains difficult to beat due to its blend of domain expertise, collaborative calibration, and robustness to errors. This advantage is further reinforced by the structural challenge: only questions forecasted by both bots and Pros are considered, sometimes resulting in statistical noise or limited direct comparison.

Various scenarios could lead to either outcome. If AI improvement plateaus, or if the Pros maintain their high standard of coordination and calibration, humans are likely to retain a narrow edge for at least one more cycle. The tendency for world-changing performance shifts to occur incrementally—rather than as sudden regime changes—further favors continuity with the status quo. Additionally, should the overlap in forecasts between bots and Pros remain low, it could prevent any decisive bot victory in this round.

Conversely, a breakthrough remains plausible. Rapidly improving AI models, especially those employing agent-style or ensemble approaches, could achieve sufficiently accurate and well-calibrated predictions to edge out the Pros. If a leading bot deploys a substantial methodological advance or if the Pro cohort faces a dip in engagement or coordination, this could tip the balance in favor of the bots. The window for such an outcome is extremely narrow, but accelerating progress in bot methodology and the competitive intensity of recent tournaments mean an AI upset is now possible in a way it was not in previous years.

In sum, the evidence points to a near parity scenario: bots are on the cusp of equivalence with the Pro aggregate, but with only a month left and no victories yet recorded, the base rate still leans toward the status quo. A bot win before Q3 2025 is plausible and more likely than ever, but still requires either a timely leap in AI performance or an unexpected shortfall from the human Pros.
