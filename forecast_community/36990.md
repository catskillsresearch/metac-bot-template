(a) Time left: 45 days until June 28, 2025, when the podcast rankings will be checked on Spotify's Podcast Charts.

(b) Status quo outcome: The New York Times Daily maintains its higher position (#4) compared to The Tucker Carlson Show (#7) on Spotify's US Top Podcasts chart.

(c) Unexpected outcome scenario: A major political event or controversy occurs that dramatically increases interest in The Tucker Carlson Show, causing a surge in listenership. Alternatively, The New York Times Daily could face a controversy or production issue that disrupts its consistency, allowing Tucker Carlson's show to overtake it in the rankings.

As a professional forecaster, I'll analyze the available data to determine which podcast is likely to rank higher on Spotify on June 28, 2025.

## Current Rankings and Historical Performance

The New York Times Daily currently ranks #4 on Spotify's US podcast charts, while The Tucker Carlson Show sits at #7[5]. The Daily has maintained a consistently strong position in podcast rankings for several years and appears in Edison Research's Top 50 Podcasts list for Q1 2025, ranking #3 overall in the US based on reach[5]. 

According to recent news, The New York Times recently announced two new co-hosts for The Daily - Rachel Abrams and Natalie Kitroeff will join Michael Barbaro, with Abrams starting immediately and Kitroeff joining in June[5]. This refresh in hosting talent could potentially reinvigorate the show and maintain or boost its audience.

The Tucker Carlson Show has built a substantial following with over 200 episodes and 76.5k+ subscribers as of April 2025[3]. It focuses on current events and political issues from a conservative viewpoint, targeting a specific demographic interested in his perspective on politics and media criticism.

## Content Type and Appeal

The Daily produces daily news episodes with broad mainstream appeal, covering a wide range of current events and topics. Its consistent daily format gives it an advantage in maintaining regular listenership and engagement metrics that factor into Spotify rankings[5].

The Tucker Carlson Show, while popular, serves a more niche, politically-oriented audience and doesn't appear to have overtaken The Daily in major podcast rankings over the past year[3]. The political commentary nature of the show means its performance may fluctuate more based on current events and political climate.

## Market Trends and Competition

The podcast landscape shows some volatility in rankings, with shows like Mel Robbins' podcast and "Not Gonna Lie with Kylie Kelce" occasionally displacing established programs like Joe Rogan's in the Spotify charts[4]. However, news podcasts tend to maintain more consistent positions, especially those produced by major media outlets.

Neither podcast appears to be facing any known production issues, controversies or format changes that would significantly impact their rankings in the coming weeks[2].

## Forecast Rationale

Given the established position of The Daily at #4 versus The Tucker Carlson Show at #7, and considering The Daily's broader appeal, daily release schedule, and backing by The New York Times, the most likely outcome is that The Daily will maintain its higher position on Spotify's podcast charts on June 28, 2025.

However, we must account for uncertainty. Political events often drive engagement with political commentary shows, and Tucker Carlson has a dedicated following that could grow with the right catalyzing events. The upcoming presidential election cycle could potentially increase interest in political commentary.

I also need to consider that The Daily's recent co-host changes could either boost or potentially disrupt its performance, though the continuity of Michael Barbaro's presence likely minimizes this risk.

The New York Times Daily: 78%
The Tucker Carlson Show: 22%
