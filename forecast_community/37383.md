# Trump's Trade Approval Forecast: Analysis for June 25, 2025

## Current Trade Approval Context

Based on the most recent information, Donald Trump's net approval on trade appears to be around -20% (39% approval versus 59% disapproval on tariffs) as of late April 2025. This followed his "Liberation Day" announcement of sweeping tariffs on April 2, which triggered market volatility and a decline in his overall approval rating. While Trump's overall approval has improved slightly from a low of -9.7% in late April to around -5% by late May, trade policy remains one of his most contentious areas, with trade and tariff approval being "more negative and less volatile" than his topline numbers.

## Recent Trade Policy Developments

Several significant trade developments have occurred that will influence Trump's trade approval by June 25:

1. **EU Tariff Deadline Extension**: Trump has delayed imposing threatened 50% tariffs on European Union imports from June 1 to July 9, 2025, following a request from European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.

2. **Positive Negotiation Signals**: As of May 27, 2025, Trump has expressed optimism about upcoming trade talks with the EU, noting that "the E.U. has called to quickly establish meeting dates" and describing this as "a positive event."

3. **Targeted Approach to Tariffs**: Trump appears to be taking a more strategic approach, focusing primarily on China while showing more flexibility with other trading partners.

4. **Market Response**: Financial markets have responded positively to the tariff delay announcement, with European stocks jumping and U.S. futures rising (S&P 500 futures up 1.2% and Nasdaq 100 futures up 1.4% on May 26, 2025).

## Factors Influencing Trade Approval by June 25

### Positive Factors

1. **EU Negotiations Progress**: The delay of tariffs until July 9 has been well-received by markets, and any positive developments in negotiations before June 25 could improve trade approval ratings.

2. **Shifting Rhetoric**: Trump's messaging has evolved from confrontational to cautiously optimistic, which might improve public perception of his trade policies.

3. **Economic Context**: If economic indicators remain positive during this period, they could provide a tailwind for Trump's trade approval.

### Limiting Factors

1. **Historical Negativity**: Trade policy has consistently been underwater in approval ratings, with significant negative sentiment that won't disappear quickly.

2. **Complex Issue**: Trade policy is complex and often not well understood by the general public, making rapid opinion shifts less likely.

3. **Ongoing Uncertainty**: The July 9 deadline for EU tariffs creates continuing uncertainty that could limit improvement in approval ratings.

4. **Status Quo Persistence**: Public opinion typically changes gradually, especially on complex economic issues like trade policy.

## Forecast Analysis

The 28-day timeframe until June 25 provides limited opportunity for dramatic shifts in public opinion on complex trade issues. While Trump's overall approval has shown signs of improvement, issue-specific approval on trade tends to move more slowly.

The delay of EU tariffs and positive signals about negotiations represent a notable shift from the aggressive stance taken in early April. This, combined with positive market reactions, suggests some improvement from April's lows is likely.

However, the magnitude of improvement will likely be constrained by the fact that the threat of tariffs remains in place, and the negotiations with the EU won't conclude before our forecast date (the deadline is July 9). Public skepticism about tariffs remains broad and enduring, with polling showing disapproval on tariffs distinct from topline approval numbers.

Given these factors, Trump's net approval on trade by June 25, 2025, will most likely show moderate improvement from April's -20% figure but remain in negative territory. A breakthrough in EU negotiations could push approval higher, while a breakdown in talks could send it lower, though both scenarios are less probable than continued gradual improvement.
