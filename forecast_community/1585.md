The likelihood of a nuclear catastrophe leading to a 95% reduction in the human population by 2100 is considered low. Historical evidence and current geopolitical dynamics suggest that while the risk of nuclear conflict exists, the probability of it escalating to a full-scale nuclear war is not the most probable scenario. The principle of mutually assured destruction has historically deterred nuclear powers from engaging in direct conflict, and advancements in diplomacy, arms control, and international cooperation have further mitigated this risk.

In the event of a nuclear exchange, it is likely to be limited in scope, involving a small number of warheads and primarily affecting specific regions. While such an event would cause significant casualties and environmental damage, the global population is unlikely to decline by 95% or more. Human resilience, adaptability, and the uneven global impact of nuclear winter effects suggest that some regions, particularly in the Southern Hemisphere, would remain habitable. International aid efforts and access to alternative food sources would help stabilize and eventually recover the surviving population.

However, the potential for a catastrophic outcome cannot be entirely dismissed. A full-scale nuclear war between major powers, such as the US and Russia, could lead to a severe nuclear winter, causing drastic climate changes, agricultural collapse, and widespread infrastructure destruction. The compounded effects of radiation, starvation, disease, and societal breakdown could result in a significant population decline. Despite this, the heterogeneous impact of nuclear winter across different regions suggests that some populations might survive even in worst-case scenarios. Overall, while the risk is significant, the probability of a 95% reduction in the human population remains low.
