F1’s domestic opening weekend performance will be shaped by a mix of industry momentum, competitive landscape, star power, and the rising popularity of Formula One in North America.

There are roughly three weeks until the outcome will be known, with F1 releasing on June 27, 2025 and box office figures expected by the following Monday or Tuesday. Current industry tracking, as of mid-May and early June 2025, places a status quo opening around $47 million. If existing trends continue—such as strong marketing, positive trailer reception, and Formula One’s surging U.S. interest—forecasts have shifted upward, with the most common range among experts and industry trackers falling between $54–69 million. Consensus estimates from Box Office Theory and Warner Bros. cluster around $54–60 million, while a few speculative projections envision breakout potential well north of that, though consensus suggests this is less likely barring extraordinary reception.

Several positive signals support F1’s outlook. The film boasts Brad Pitt in the lead, director Joseph Kosinski (fresh off Top Gun: Maverick’s massive success), and high production values underscored by Hans Zimmer’s involvement. Warner Bros. has delivered multiple 2025 box office hits, indicating the studio is executing effective marketing campaigns. Formula One’s growth in U.S. viewership further expands the potential audience, distinguishing F1 from typical racing films.

However, risks remain. The film faces direct competition from Superman, which is projected for a $154–175 million opening the previous week, and other summer releases like Lilo & Stitch and Mission: Impossible, both of which have drawn substantial audience share. Racing films have historically delivered mixed box office performance, and F1’s 2 hour 35 minute runtime could restrict the number of daily showings. The $300+ million budget raises financial expectations, placing pressure on it to deliver a strong opening. Additionally, any negative early reviews or word-of-mouth, especially from international markets, could exert downward pressure on domestic earnings.

Unexpected downside scenarios involve poor critical reception, viral negative word-of-mouth, or a competitor dramatically overperforming, potentially pushing F1 as low as the $30–40 million range. Conversely, conditions such as exceptional reviews, overwhelming star appeal, viral social media momentum, and unexpectedly soft competition could push results toward the higher end of current projections, possibly challenging the low $70 million range or beyond, with only a remote chance of emulating Top Gun: Maverick’s $126.7 million opening.

The 2025 box office environment is robust, buoyed by blockbuster performances and a healthy summer slate, but F1’s ultimate opening will depend on the interplay of critical reception in release week, the effectiveness of the final marketing push, and its ability to stand out amidst formidable competition.
