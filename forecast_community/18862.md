The geopolitical landscape surrounding Ukraine's potential accession to NATO is complex and fraught with significant challenges. The ongoing conflict with Russia remains a primary obstacle, as it prevents Ukraine from meeting the necessary conditions for NATO membership. This conflict, coupled with the lack of a clear timeline for accession, underscores the status quo outcome that Ukraine does not join NATO before 2035. The requirement for consensus among NATO members further complicates the situation, as political divisions or a lack of agreement on Ukraine's membership could delay or prevent accession.

Despite these challenges, there are positive signals that could alter the current trajectory. The removal of the Membership Action Plan requirement and strong public support within Ukraine indicate a commitment to future membership. A resolution to the conflict with Russia could pave the way for Ukraine to meet NATO's membership conditions. Additionally, a shift in political dynamics within NATO, possibly driven by changes in leadership or broader geopolitical shifts, could facilitate a faster path to membership.

However, historical trends suggest that geopolitical changes often occur slowly, and the complexities of international relations and security concerns make rapid changes unlikely. The current geopolitical environment, characterized by significant hurdles and uncertainties, suggests that while there is potential for change, the status quo remains the more probable outcome within the given timeframe.
