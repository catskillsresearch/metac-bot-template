Nigeria's population is projected to exceed 400 million by 2050, driven by one of the highest population growth rates globally. This growth is primarily fueled by high fertility rates and a large youth population. Credible sources, including the United Nations, forecast that Nigeria's population will more than double by 2050, reaching around 410 million. While challenges such as poverty, emigration, and health issues exist, these factors are unlikely to significantly alter the growth trajectory unless there are major, sustained changes in fertility rates or other demographic factors. Historical trends indicate that demographic patterns change slowly, reinforcing the likelihood of continued population growth. Economic improvements and better healthcare could further reduce mortality rates, contributing to this growth. Although scenarios involving decreased fertility rates, increased emigration, or higher mortality rates could potentially slow growth, the current data and projections strongly suggest that Nigeria's population will surpass 400 million by 2050.
