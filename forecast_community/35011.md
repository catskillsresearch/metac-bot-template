(a) Time left: 5 days until the first round of the Polish presidential election (May 18, 2025), with a potential second round on June 1, 2025 if no candidate receives more than 50% of the vote in the first round.

(b) Status quo outcome: Based on the latest polling data, Rafał Trzaskowski leads in the first round but without an outright majority, necessitating a second-round runoff where he currently holds an advantage but not a guaranteed victory.

(c) No outcome scenario: Trzaskowski's polling lead narrows further in the final days, and in the second round, Karol Nawrocki successfully consolidates the conservative vote, including Mentzen's supporters. Lower turnout among liberal urban voters combined with higher rural mobilization gives Nawrocki a narrow victory.

(d) Yes outcome scenario: Trzaskowski maintains his first-round lead and successfully appeals to centrist voters in the second round. His campaign focusing on European values, democratic institutions, and security concerns resonates with a majority of voters, allowing him to win the presidency with 53-56% of the vote.

As a professional forecaster, I'll assess the likelihood of Rafał Trzaskowski becoming the next President of Poland based on the available evidence.

## Current Electoral Landscape

Rafał Trzaskowski, the Warsaw mayor and Civic Coalition candidate, currently leads in the polls for the first round of Poland's presidential election scheduled for May 18, 2025. The latest polling data shows him with approximately 31-33% support[1][3], followed by Karol Nawrocki (PiS-backed) at around 23-25%[1][3]. A second round is virtually guaranteed, as no candidate appears close to the 50% threshold needed for a first-round victory.

For second-round scenarios, polling indicates Trzaskowski holds an advantage:
- IBRiS polling shows Trzaskowski with 49.6% versus Nawrocki's 39.9%, with 10.5% undecided[3]
- Pollster Institute shows Trzaskowski with 55% versus Nawrocki's 45% in a hypothetical runoff[3]

## Historical Context and Status Quo Dynamics

In Polish presidential elections, the status quo tends to favor incumbents or their endorsed successors. While outgoing President Duda cannot run again, his party (PiS) has endorsed Nawrocki. However, several factors disrupt this status quo:

1. The Civic Coalition led by Prime Minister Donald Tusk won parliamentary elections in 2023, signaling a shift in voter preferences away from PiS[2]

2. The Civic Coalition performed strongly in the 2024 European elections, securing 37.06% versus PiS's 36.16%[2]

3. Trzaskowski narrowly lost to Duda in 2020 (48.97% vs 51.03%), suggesting he has established electoral viability[3]

## Key Factors Affecting the Outcome

**Trzaskowski's Strengths:**
- Experienced campaigner with high name recognition and mayoral record
- Backing of the current governing coalition
- Strong support in urban areas and among progressive voters
- Pro-European stance appealng to centrists concerned about Poland's international standing

**Challenges for Trzaskowski:**
- Recent polls show his lead narrowing somewhat from earlier positions[1][3]
- Potential vulnerability to conservative attacks on social issues
- Some media outlets suggest erratic behavior during campaign events (though these appear to be partisan sources)[3]

**Nawrocki's Path to Victory:**
- Consolidating the nationalist and conservative vote
- Mobilizing rural voters who traditionally support PiS
- Successfully portraying Trzaskowski as too liberal for mainstream Poland

## Probabilistic Assessment

Weighing all evidence, I assess that Trzaskowski remains the favorite to win the presidency, though not overwhelmingly so. The race will likely go to a second round where Trzaskowski's broader coalition-building potential gives him an advantage. However, Polish elections have proven volatile, and the 10% undecided voters in runoff scenarios could swing the outcome.

The strongest evidence supporting Trzaskowski's victory:
1. Consistent polling lead in both first and second round scenarios
2. Recent electoral momentum for his political alliance
3. Broader coalition-building potential in a runoff

The strongest factors weighing against certainty:
1. Historical volatility in Polish elections
2. Narrowing of his polling advantage in recent weeks
3. Strong mobilization potential of the conservative base

Probability: 65%
