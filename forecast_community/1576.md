# Global Extreme Poverty by 2030: Prospects and Challenges

Current data presents a sobering picture of global extreme poverty prospects. As of mid-2025, approximately 700 million people (8.5% of the global population) live in extreme poverty - defined as living on less than $2.15 per day. Despite decades of progress, the path toward substantial poverty reduction faces significant headwinds.

## Current Trajectory and Projections

The latest projections from authoritative sources consistently indicate that extreme poverty will remain well above the 375 million threshold by 2030. The World Bank explicitly states that "the global goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030 is out of reach". Most recent estimates suggest between 590-622 million people will still be living in extreme poverty by 2030 if current trends continue.

Progress in poverty reduction has significantly slowed in recent years. From 2013 to 2019, about 150 million people escaped extreme poverty, but projections indicate only about 69 million will do so between 2024 and 2030. This deceleration makes achieving dramatic reductions highly unlikely within the remaining timeframe.

## Regional Concentration and Challenges

The geographical distribution of extreme poverty presents particular challenges:

- Sub-Saharan Africa now accounts for 67% of people living in extreme poverty despite representing only 16% of the global population
- Approximately 438.6 million people in Africa were living in extreme poverty in 2025, with projections showing only a slight decrease to around 426 million by 2030
- Poverty rates in many low-income countries remain higher than pre-pandemic levels
- About 72% of people in extreme poverty live in countries eligible for International Development Association assistance

For Sub-Saharan African countries to achieve substantial poverty reduction, they would need sustained per-capita GDP growth of approximately 9% annually through 2030. This represents an extraordinary challenge given the historical average of just 1.2% in the decade before COVID-19.

## Compounding Factors Impeding Progress

Multiple interconnected challenges are actively hindering poverty reduction efforts:

- **COVID-19 Setbacks**: The pandemic reversed decades of progress, increasing global extreme poverty for the first time in years
- **Climate Change**: Disproportionately affects vulnerable populations and creates new poverty traps
- **Armed Conflicts**: Ongoing instability in many regions prevents economic development
- **Economic Challenges**: Including debt accumulation, trade disruptions, and inflation
- **Insufficient Aid**: Reductions in international assistance programs

These factors reflect the multidimensional nature of poverty and create substantial barriers to rapid progress.

## Potential Pathways to Success

For extreme poverty to fall below 375 million people by 2030, several unprecedented developments would need to occur:

1. Extraordinary economic growth in key regions, particularly Sub-Saharan Africa
2. Massive increases in targeted international aid and cooperation
3. Revolutionary approaches to poverty reduction
4. Significant improvements in governance and policy implementation
5. Technological breakthroughs that dramatically improve living standards

While these outcomes remain possible, they would require a dramatic departure from current trends and would need to overcome significant obstacles in a very short timeframe.

## Conclusion

The weight of evidence strongly suggests that achieving fewer than 375 million people in extreme poverty by 2030 is highly unlikely. The consistent projections from authoritative sources like the World Bank indicate that extreme poverty will remain substantially above this threshold. The required acceleration in poverty reduction would be unprecedented, particularly given the concentration of poverty in regions with historically slow growth.

While positive outlier scenarios remain theoretically possible - such as unexpected technological breakthroughs or dramatic policy innovations - these represent low-probability outcomes given current trajectories and constraints. The most likely scenario is that between 590-622 million people will still be living in extreme poverty by 2030, with poverty increasingly concentrated in Sub-Saharan Africa and fragile states.
