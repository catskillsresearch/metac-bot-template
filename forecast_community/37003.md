Tesla’s Q2 2025 vehicle deliveries will be shaped by a convergence of challenging market trends and strategic company responses. The company delivered 336,681 vehicles in Q1 2025, reflecting a 13% year-over-year decline, and expert consensus anticipates a continued downward trajectory for Q2, with market expectations centering around a 20% drop from Q2 2024’s 444,000 deliveries. This reflects weakening global demand, pronounced especially in China, where recent weekly deliveries have plunged by nearly 70% year-over-year, heightening concern about Tesla’s performance in its largest international market. European sales are also notably down, emphasizing the broader demand pressures across regions.

Amid these headwinds, Tesla is mounting an aggressive commercial response. The extension of 0% financing and other promotional activities in core markets, combined with CEO Elon Musk’s commitment to be “extremely hands-on” in Q2, could play an essential role in stabilizing or even reversing the prevailing trend. Historically, Musk’s direct involvement has been associated with stronger operational momentum, and the strategic push for exports from the Shanghai Gigafactory—now at record monthly levels—provides some buffer against domestic slowdowns, especially if this pace is sustained through the quarter.

Nevertheless, uncertainty remains elevated. Negative scenarios include continued demand deterioration in China, further production or supply chain disruptions, and potential reputational or regulatory setbacks, which could drive deliveries below 325,000 units. On the other hand, if incentive programs and management focus succeed in reigniting demand, and Shanghai’s export strength holds, Tesla could achieve a significant recovery, potentially approaching 380,000–400,000 units for the quarter.

The Model 3 and Model Y are expected to remain central to Tesla’s delivery mix, with recent production line upgrades likely to reduce friction seen at the start of the year. Yet, the competitive environment—particularly from Chinese EV manufacturers—continues to intensify, contributing additional downward pressure on market share.

In summary, Tesla’s Q2 2025 delivery outcome will be the result of balancing persistent demand and competitive challenges with robust operational responses and executive focus. The result is a wide plausible delivery range, reflecting highly dynamic and still-unfolding market circumstances.
