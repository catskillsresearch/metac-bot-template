A rigorous assessment of human extinction risk before 2100 must weigh both historical evidence and expert analysis of emerging and established threats. Human beings have demonstrated remarkable survival capabilities over at least 200,000 years, enduring global catastrophes like supervolcanic eruptions, pandemics, and even the advent of nuclear weapons. This historical resilience is bolstered by humanity’s wide geographic dispersion, adaptability to diverse environments, and growing technological capacity for mitigation and recovery.

While natural risks such as asteroid impacts, supervolcanic eruptions, and cosmic events are not negligible, their probability within the current century is exceedingly low. Natural pandemics, likewise, have historically failed to approach human extinction levels. The main focus of contemporary risk assessment therefore shifts to anthropogenic (human-caused) threats, which include the rise of advanced artificial intelligence, engineered pandemics, and nuclear conflict.

Among these anthropogenic threats, advanced artificial intelligence is frequently cited as the most salient novel risk, with expert estimates of extinction probability ranging from below 1% to as high as 15% depending on the methodology and time horizon considered. Nuclear war and engineered pandemics remain serious concerns, but there is little consensus that current or emerging technologies are likely to achieve the level of thoroughness required to eradicate all humans, including those in remote or protected locations or future off-world habitats.

Climate change, while capable of causing large-scale societal disruption and population declines, is largely ruled out by leading scientists as a direct mechanism for extinction within the century; its greater risk lies in its potential to amplify other threats and as a multiplier for cascading disasters. Indeed, one of the most substantial risks is the possibility of multiple catastrophic events occurring in combination—wherein societies reeling from one disaster may become more vulnerable to subsequent shocks. This risk of cascading and interconnected threats is recognized as an amplifier, but the complete elimination of all human life remains a very high bar, even for such scenarios.

Demographic projections for 2100 foresee substantial human populations, even accounting for scenarios of dramatic decline due to fertility trends or severe disasters. The core concern for most credible forecasts is not extinction but rather shifts in human dominance, irrelevance, or severe reduction in numbers.

Methodologically, there is a disparity between domain experts—who sometimes assign higher probabilities due to their focus on existential risks—and superforecasters or large aggregated prediction platforms, which tend to provide lower (often around 1%) probability estimates for extinction by 2100, reflecting more conservative and broadly crowdsourced judgment. The convergence of these independent methodologies on this low, nonzero probability underscores both the uncertainty and the prevailing expectations of continued survival.

Ultimately, the continued existence of humankind by 2100 is supported by evidence of species resilience, geographic redundancy, technological mitigation measures, and expert consensus that even severe global crises are unlikely to result in immediate extinction. However, the rapidly evolving risk landscape and the emergence of novel threats mean that the probability is not zero; cascading catastrophes or unprecedented technological failures could, in principle, overcome our historical resilience. Nevertheless, the aggregated weight of evidence strongly favors human persistence through the end of the century, barring an extremely rare, global, and coordinated existential event.
