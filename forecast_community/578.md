(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
As of May 12, 2025, there are approximately 74 years and 7.5 months remaining before January 1, 2100, when we will know the outcome.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
The current trajectory, according to scientific consensus and demographic projections, is that humans will still exist in 2100. The United Nations and the IPCC project a global human population in 2100 between 7 and 16 billion, with extinction not foreseen even under severe catastrophe scenarios[3]. Historically, humans have survived multiple catastrophic threats, and no mainstream scientific organization predicts total extinction by 2100.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome (humans survive):**  
Despite facing risks like climate change, nuclear war, pandemics, or advanced AI, humanity continues to adapt and survive. Population numbers may decline or societies may be severely disrupted, but some humans remain alive somewhere on Earth or potentially off-Earth settlements[1][3]. Societies could be transformed and influence diminished, but biological humans as defined in the question persist.

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome (human extinction):**  
A global catastrophe—such as an engineered pandemic with near-100% lethality, full-scale thermonuclear war combined with nuclear winter, or rogue self-improving AI deliberately or accidentally exterminating all biological humans—completely eradicates every last Homo sapiens, leaving no trace of viable humans anywhere in the observable universe by January 1, 2100.

## Rationale

Expert assessments and aggregated forecasts provide a useful anchor for this kind of low-frequency, high-impact question. While an informal poll at the Global Catastrophic Risk Conference in 2008 reported a median probability of 19% for human extinction by 2100, that poll is subject to substantial selection bias and is widely regarded as an outlier[4]. More recent, broader aggregations—such as those on the prediction platform Metaculus—produce a median probability of just 1% based on hundreds of forecaster estimates[4].

Similarly, a 2023 survey involving both technical experts and superforecasters found superforecasters assigning only a 1% chance to human extinction by 2100; experts put the probability slightly higher at 6%, but still considered it unlikely[2]. The Global Challenges Foundation's 2016 report, as well as other academic estimates, generally cluster in the low single-digit percentages per century.

The most cited existential risks—climate change, nuclear war, AI, biotechnology, and natural disasters—are each serious but have not, according to contemporary scientific modeling, crossed the threshold of likelihood required for human extinction within this timeframe. For example, MIT climate scientists consider the probability of climate change causing human extinction by 2100 to be "very low, if not zero"[1]. Population projections for 2100 reinforce this: even under pessimistic scenarios, billions of humans are expected to survive[3].

Finally, history demonstrates the resilience of Homo sapiens in the face of dramatic environmental changes and global crises. While the risk of massive disruption or even civilizational collapse is significant, true extinction—the total disappearance of all humans—is a substantially higher bar.

## Final Probability

**Probability: 1%**

This estimate aligns with the aggregated judgment of expert communities and prediction platforms, incorporates the high resilience humans have shown historically, and heavily weights the status quo outcome, as good forecasters should. While existential risk is real and non-negligible, true human extinction before 2100 remains highly unlikely under current knowledge[2][3][4].
