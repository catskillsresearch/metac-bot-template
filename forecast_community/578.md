# Assessing Human Extinction Risk by 2100

The question of whether humans will go extinct by 2100 requires careful analysis of both expert forecasts and the underlying existential risks facing humanity. While complete human extinction would be unprecedented, several credible threats warrant serious consideration.

## Expert Probability Estimates

Different forecasting groups have produced varying estimates of human extinction risk by 2100:

- Technical experts predict a 6% chance of human extinction by 2100, while superforecasters estimate a significantly lower probability of 1%.
- AI experts specifically estimated a 3% chance that AI would cause human extinction by 2100, while superforecasters put this specific risk at just 0.38%.
- The prediction platform Metaculus showed a median probability of human extinction by 2100 at 1%, based on over 700 individual forecasts.

This divergence between expert and superforecaster predictions is noteworthy - experts estimate a 20% chance of catastrophic events by 2100, while superforecasters put it at around 9%. This may reflect either greater domain knowledge among experts or potential selection bias, as those most concerned about existential risks are more likely to study them.

## Key Extinction Risk Factors

### Artificial Intelligence

Recent surveys indicate increasing concern about AI risks. According to Wikipedia data from 2024, AI experts estimated a 15% risk of extinction from AI in the next 30 years, with Geoffrey Hinton predicting a 10-20% probability. Scientific American's 2025 estimate was more conservative at 0-10% by 2100.

The concern centers on advanced AI systems potentially developing goals misaligned with human values or being weaponized in ways that threaten human survival.

### Climate Change

Climate scientists generally consider complete human extinction from climate change alone to be extremely unlikely. However, climate change could act as a risk multiplier, exacerbating other threats through resource scarcity and geopolitical instability. Some reports indicate that crossing certain thresholds could potentially lead to runaway global heating, though mass extinction of humans would require crossing multiple critical boundaries.

### Pandemics and Bioweapons

Advances in biotechnology create both opportunities for pandemic prevention and risks of engineered pathogens with unprecedented lethality. Natural pandemics have caused significant mortality throughout human history but have never approached extinction-level events.

### Nuclear War

Despite reductions since the Cold War, thousands of nuclear weapons remain deployed globally. A full-scale nuclear exchange could cause catastrophic damage to human civilization, though complete extinction would require additional cascading effects.

## Historical Context and Human Resilience

Homo sapiens have demonstrated remarkable resilience over approximately 200,000-300,000 years, surviving numerous catastrophic events including ice ages, supervolcano eruptions, and natural disasters. This historical survival provides some evidence for human adaptability in the face of extreme challenges.

However, anthropogenic (human-caused) risks represent fundamentally different threats than those faced throughout evolutionary history. Our technological capabilities now enable us to create novel risks that could potentially overcome our evolved resilience.

## Multiplicative Stresses and Civilizational Vulnerability

A common theme across many extinction risks is that they may cause global catastrophe but are unlikely to wipe out the human species in isolation. However, it is realistic to expect that some catastrophes may trigger further catastrophic consequences or occur in combination.

The severity of some past major mass extinctions likely resulted from reinforcing interactions between multiple stresses. In modern times, the interconnection of stresses and our response to environmental shocks may present the greatest existential risk. The fragile nature of global supply chains means a catastrophe that disrupted power and food supply chains would quickly render cities uninhabitable. A civilization reeling from one catastrophe might also be less resilient to further threats.

## Geographic Dispersion and Population Size

Several factors reduce the likelihood of complete human extinction:

1. Geographic dispersion and population size provide redundancy against many threats
2. Human adaptability and ingenuity in response to challenges
3. Growing awareness of existential risks leading to mitigation efforts
4. Potential for self-sustaining space colonies providing backup for humanity

For extinction to occur, a threat would need to affect all human populations globally, overcoming our species' widespread distribution and adaptability.

## Weighing the Evidence

The most reasonable approach is to give weight to both expert and superforecaster perspectives while acknowledging the status quo bias - the observation that dramatic changes like human extinction are rare, and humanity has demonstrated significant resilience historically.

Based on the available evidence, the probability of human extinction by 2100 likely falls somewhere between the superforecaster estimate (1%) and the lower end of expert predictions (6%). The most likely extinction pathways would involve either advanced AI with misaligned goals, engineered pandemics, or cascading effects from multiple simultaneous crises that overwhelm human adaptive capacity.
