(a) **Time left until resolution:** About 74 years and 7.5 months, as the outcome will be determined on January 1, 2100.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:** Humans continue to exist on Earth and possibly beyond, though the level of prosperity, dominance, and environmental conditions may vary significantly. Historically, Homo sapiens have survived a wide array of natural and anthropogenic crises, demonstrating resilience to extinction-level threats[2][3].

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome (i.e., humans do _not_ go extinct):**
- Humanity manages to avoid global catastrophic risks such as nuclear war, runaway AI, engineered pandemics, or complete ecological collapse. 
- Technological and policy measures are sufficient to mitigate existential threats.
- Even with severe global disasters (e.g., large-scale war, climate impacts, or population collapse), at least a remnant human population survives somewhere on Earth or in off-world habitats, thus meeting the defined criteria for continued human existence[1][2][3].

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome (i.e., humans _do_ go extinct):**
- A catastrophic event (or cluster of events)—such as uncontrolled AI, a super-pandemic, full-scale thermonuclear exchange, or irreversible ecological collapse—eliminates all biological humans everywhere in the observable universe before 2100, with no survivors capable of viable reproduction[1][3][5].
- Alternatively, an unforeseen or “unknown-unknown” risk not currently identified strikes with catastrophic efficacy.

## Rationale

When forecasting human extinction before 2100, evidence and expert consensus warrant placing strong weight on the status quo outcome—i.e., that humans will not go extinct—because:

- **Historical Resilience:** Humans have survived severe population bottlenecks, natural disasters, pandemics, and even near-extinction events over at least 200,000 years[2].
- **Probabilistic Assessments:** The best available aggregate forecasts from superforecasters and broad expert surveys cluster around a 1% median probability of human extinction by 2100. For instance, Metaculus (a large forecasting platform) currently assigns a 1% median probability, and superforecasters in recent tournaments consistently forecast low extinction odds[1][3][5].
- **Expert and Scientific Consensus:** While some domain experts suggest higher odds (up to 6%), and past polls of existential risk researchers have estimated probabilities as high as 19%, these results often reflect selection bias and are not representative of broader scientific consensus[1][5].
- **Climate and Technological Threats:** Though climate change and rapid technological change pose serious risks, mainstream scientific analysis suggests that even severe scenarios are unlikely to result in total human extinction by 2100[2]. Anthropogenic risks, such as AI or engineered pandemics, represent new and poorly quantified threats, but even here, the highest-quality aggregations rarely exceed a 5-6% probability[1][3][5].

### Key Comparative Forecasts

| Source/Group                        | Probability of Extinction by 2100 |
|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Superforecasters (FRI, 2023)[1][5]  | 1%                               |
| Metaculus median (2021)[3]          | 1%                               |
| Domain Experts (FRI, 2023)[1][5]    | 6%                               |
| Oxford GCR Conference (2008)[3]     | 19% (selection effect noted)      |

### Uncertainty and Tail Risk

While extinction risk is not zero and uncertainty remains—especially from novel technologies like AI—both the historical baseline and the most robust, broad-based forecasts suggest that the world is likely to change slowly, and total extinction remains a low-probability event within this century[1][3][5].
