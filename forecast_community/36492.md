(a) Time until outcome: The question resolves once legislation is enacted before January 1, 2026, affecting the 48E clean electricity tax credit, or by default on January 1, 2026, if no legislation is enacted. This gives approximately 7.5 months from today (May 10, 2025) until the resolution deadline.

(b) Status quo outcome: "No sunset reduction before 2026" - This would occur if Congress takes no action to modify or repeal the 48E tax credit before January 1, 2026. Currently, 48E is scheduled to begin for facilities starting construction after December 31, 2025, and phase out at the later of 2032 or when U.S. greenhouse gas emissions from electricity reach 25% of 2022 levels.

(c) Unexpected outcome scenario: Despite Republican control of Congress and the White House, a coalition of moderate Republicans from districts with significant clean energy investments, combined with all Democrats, could block attempts to fully repeal the credits. Instead, they might negotiate a compromise creating a longer transition period (2029-2031 sunset) with safe harbor provisions to protect ongoing projects, surprising those who expected a quick repeal or short sunset.

Based on the available information, I'll assess the probabilities for each outcome:

The recent search results indicate significant political attention on the future of clean energy tax credits following the Republican electoral victories. While a "full-scale repeal of energy credits seems unlikely," organizations should plan for "some changes"[1]. The Clean Electricity Investment Tax Credit (48E) has been specifically identified as being "attacked" along with the 45Y Production Credit[4].

Economic analyses suggest that repealing these credits would have significant impacts. Reports from The Brattle Group and NERA Economic Consulting indicate that full repeal would increase electricity prices nationwide by 9.2% across all sectors by 2029 and could reduce direct spending in the power sector by $250 billion through 2035[5]. This economic impact provides a counterweight against immediate repeal.

The current political landscape features Republicans with slim majorities, especially in the House where they hold just a 5-seat advantage. Many representatives come from districts benefiting from renewable energy investments and face re-election in 2026. This suggests political caution among some Republicans about aggressive action against energy credits.

The most likely outcomes involve some form of earlier sunset or modification rather than complete repeal without protections. The corporate law firm Crowell & Moring has assessed 48E as a "moderate" risk of repeal[4], indicating significant but not overwhelming probability of elimination.

Given the recent implementation of the final rules for 48E in early 2025[3] and the significant investments already made in anticipation of these credits, a compromise approach with safe harbor provisions seems more politically feasible than immediate termination without protections for ongoing projects.

The budget reconciliation process allows Republicans to modify these tax credits with a simple majority vote, making some action likely, but the narrow margins in Congress suggest moderation rather than extremism in the approach.

Taking all these factors into account, I'll now provide my probabilistic forecast:

2025-2026 sunset w/o safe harbor: 10%
2025-2026 sunset w/ safe harbor: 25%
2027-2028 sunset w/o safe harbor: 15%
2027-2028 sunset w/ safe harbor: 20%
2029-2031 sunset w/o safe harbor: 5%
2029-2031 sunset w/ safe harbor: 10%
No sunset reduction before 2026: 15%
