# Will the PSOE finish 2025 ahead of the PP in the polls average?

## Current Polling Landscape

The most recent polling data shows a clear advantage for the PP (Popular Party) over PSOE (Spanish Socialist Workers' Party). According to Politico's Poll of Polls from May 2025, PP leads with approximately 34% compared to PSOE's 28%, representing a significant 6-point gap. This aggregate polling average establishes the status quo that would need to change substantially for PSOE to finish ahead by year-end.

Individual polls show some variance in this gap:
- DYM poll (late May 2025): PP at 35.9%, PSOE at 28.7% - a 7.2-point gap
- CIS poll (May 8, 2025): PSOE at 32%, PP at 29.3% - a 2.7-point advantage for PSOE
- 40dB poll (April 27, 2025): PP at 33.9%, PSOE at 29.3% - a 4.6-point gap

It's worth noting that the state-run Centro de Investigaciones Sociológicas (CIS) consistently shows more favorable results for PSOE than other polling institutes. In fact, CIS rates PSOE higher than the general trend in 81% of their polls, while often rating PP lower.

## Historical Context and Trends

Since the July 2023 general election (where PP won 33.1% and PSOE 31.7%), the overall trend has shown PP maintaining a lead over PSOE in most polls. While there have been fluctuations, with PSOE occasionally taking the lead in some individual polls (particularly CIS polls), the aggregate polling average has consistently favored PP.

Despite forming the government through coalition agreements, PSOE has struggled to translate governing power into polling advantages. This pattern has persisted through early 2025, with PP generally maintaining or even strengthening its position as the polling leader.

## Factors That Could Influence Future Polling

Several key factors could affect the polling trajectory over the next seven months:

**Factors Favoring PP (No outcome):**
- The current trend shows PP strengthening its position rather than weakening
- PSOE coalition government faces challenges with maintaining stability (with 40.9% to 44.8% of virtual seats according to polls)
- Multiple polls indicate PP's lead is persistent across different polling institutes
- Fragmentation on the left (between Sumar, Podemos, and other left parties) weakens PSOE's position
- PP has shown consistent gains in recent months

**Factors Favoring PSOE (Yes outcome):**
- Economic performance improvements could boost government popularity
- International positioning by PM Sánchez could increase his standing
- Potential scandals affecting PP leadership
- Occasional polls (particularly CIS) already show PSOE ahead, indicating potential volatility
- Government policy successes could translate to improved polling
- The rise of Vox (now polling between 12-15%) could potentially draw more support from PP than PSOE

## Political Dynamics and Third-Party Impact

The rise of Vox is a significant factor in Spain's political landscape. Recent polling shows Vox gaining momentum, with support rising from 11.2% to 15.3% according to CIS data from April 2025. This growth could affect both major parties but might have a more pronounced impact on PP's right flank.

Additionally, the fragmentation on the left between PSOE, Sumar (polling around 5-6%), and Podemos (around 3-4%) continues to be a challenge for consolidating progressive votes. This splintering weakens PSOE's competitive position against a more united right-wing bloc.

## Forecasting Analysis

For PSOE to overtake PP in the polls average by December 31, 2025, they would need to overcome a substantial 6-point gap. This would require either a significant improvement in government performance/perception or a major scandal affecting PP leadership within the remaining seven months.

The polling trend over the past several months shows PP generally maintaining or slightly increasing its advantage rather than losing ground. Recent polls from May 2025 indicate the gap remains substantial and may be widening slightly rather than narrowing.

Spanish public opinion tends to shift slowly absent a major national crisis or political event. The persistent polling gap since the 2023 election suggests significant inertia in voter preferences that would be difficult to overcome in seven months without major developments.

Given the persistent polling gap, the time remaining until December, and the lack of clear catalysts for dramatic change, the more likely outcome is that PP will maintain its lead in the poll average through the end of 2025.
