Turkey's annual inflation did not fall to 4% or less before 2025 due to a combination of entrenched economic, monetary, and structural factors that kept price increases far above the targeted threshold throughout the relevant period.

Throughout 2022–2024, inflation consistently ran in double digits and at times reached extreme levels, peaking at around 75% in mid-2024. Even as of April 2025, the annual rate had only eased to 37.9%, the lowest point since late 2021, but remained far from the 4% mark. Official monthly releases from TurkStat for every month in the eligibility window confirm that annual inflation never approached the 4% threshold.

The Central Bank of Turkey responded to surging inflation with a dramatic pivot toward tighter monetary policy, raising interest rates from single digits to 45% and adopting a more conventional and data-driven stance. Despite these aggressive measures, the pace of disinflation was gradual due to persistent inflationary pressures. These included lira depreciation, the pass-through effects of earlier unorthodox monetary policies, global commodity shocks, administrative price adjustments, and domestic cost pressures in sectors like food, housing, and energy.

Independent forecasts, as well as the Turkish government’s own Medium-Term Program, consistently projected double-digit inflation through 2024 and into the following years. The Central Bank’s official forecasts for end-2025 remain at 24%, with 12% expected for 2026 and 8% for 2027. Major international organizations and financial markets similarly saw no prospect of inflation falling anywhere near 4% during the assessed period. The last time Turkey recorded annual inflation close to 4% was in early 2011, making such a sharp drop both historically unprecedented and unsupported by any credible scenario in recent years.

No evidence from official statistics, policy changes, or external shocks indicates the occurrence of a rapid, extraordinary disinflation event that could have driven annual inflation below 4% in any single month before 2025. The macroeconomic environment in Turkey during this period was dominated by structural and institutional inertia, with policy interventions able only to slow, but not swiftly reverse, the entrenched inflationary dynamics.

In sum, inflation in Turkey during 2022–2024 never fell to or below 4% and remained among the highest globally despite policy efforts, as confirmed by every major data point, forecast, and expert assessment available at the close of the period.
