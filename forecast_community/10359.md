(a) **Time Until Outcome is Known:**  
The Metaculus question is resolved if, for any month from January 2022 to December 2024, Turkey's annual inflation falls to 4% or less. As of today (May 13, 2025), all relevant monthly inflation data for 2022, 2023, and 2024 have already been published by TurkStat. The six-month post-publication delay for revision has also passed, so the answer is now knowable.

(b) **Status Quo Outcome if Nothing Changed:**  
There has not been a single month between January 2022 and December 2024 in which Turkey's annual inflation rate fell to 4% or below. Throughout this period, annual inflation was persistently well above 10%, peaking at over 75% in May 2024, and the lowest end-of-year projections for 2024 were in the 40–60% range[2][3][5][1]. Therefore, under the status quo, the answer is "No"—Turkey's inflation did not fall to 4% or less during the qualifying period.

(c) **Scenario Resulting in a No Outcome:**  
The actual observed scenario—continued high inflation, with monthly and yearly inflation rates consistently exceeding the 4% threshold every month from January 2022 through December 2024[2][3][5]. This outcome is supported by all official sources and forecasts, with no record of inflation falling anywhere near the qualifying level in this period.

(d) **Scenario Resulting in a Yes Outcome:**  
The only possible scenario for a "Yes" outcome would have been if, at any point from January 2022 to December 2024, the Turkish Statistical Institute (TurkStat) had reported an annual inflation rate of 4% or less, and this figure stood after six months for revision. No such month occurred; all available data confirms this.

## Rationale

All available data, including official Turkish government and central bank statements as well as international forecasts, indicate that Turkey's annual inflation rate remained far above 4% in every month between January 2022 and December 2024. For example, official inflation rates for 2022 were above 72%, for 2023 approximately 54%, and for 2024 between 41% and 61% depending on the source[2][3][1][5].  

Forecasts and targets for 2025 and subsequent years, while showing some optimism for disinflation (decline to 24% by end-2025, single digits by 2026–2027[1][3][5]), have no effect on the relevant period for the question.

There is no evidence, according to either TurkStat or other external monitors, of annual inflation in Turkey falling to or below 4% in any month of the covered window.

## Final Answer

Probability: **0%**

Turkey's annual inflation did not fall to 4% or less in any month between January 2022 and December 2024, making the probability that this event occurred **zero**[2][3][1][5].
