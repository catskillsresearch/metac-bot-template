The political landscape in Puerto Rico is notably complex and does not align neatly with the traditional U.S. two-party system. The New Progressive Party (NPP), which advocates for statehood, includes members who affiliate with both major U.S. political parties, adding to the unpredictability of potential election outcomes. The competitive nature of Puerto Rican politics, characterized by a lack of overwhelming dominance by any single party, suggests a higher likelihood of a split delegation or representation by parties other than the Democrats.

The status quo heavily favors Puerto Rico remaining a U.S. territory, as achieving statehood requires significant political will and legislative action from the U.S. Congress, which has historically been divided on this issue. Even if statehood is achieved, the unique political dynamics in Puerto Rico, with local parties not directly mapping onto U.S. national parties, make the election of two Democratic Senators uncertain.

However, a scenario where both Senators are Democrats could occur if the Democratic Party successfully aligns with the pro-statehood movement and capitalizes on any dissatisfaction with the Republican Party. This alignment could lead to a shift in the political climate towards a stronger Democratic preference, possibly influenced by national Democratic support for statehood and a realignment of local parties with U.S. national parties.

Overall, while the possibility of Puerto Rico becoming a state and electing two Democratic Senators exists, the current political environment and historical challenges suggest a more divided political outcome is more likely.
