(a) **Time until outcome resolution:**  
The question will be resolved by January 1, 2026, so there are approximately 7.5 months remaining.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changes:**  
As of May 13, 2025, no chamber of Congress has approved legislation that creates a new, explicit exemption from the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) for any of the specified executive departments or agencies, including the CIA and EPA. Historically, such exemptions are rare and there are no credible reports of such a bill passing either chamber so far this year[3][4][5].

(c) **Scenario for a No outcome:**  
Congress continues to focus on budget, regulatory, and programmatic rollbacks—such as repealing environmental rules, cutting funding, or accelerating agency reorganizations—but does not pass any law, or even section of law, that explicitly exempts a listed department or agency from FOIA, either in full or in part. Policy changes stay within existing FOIA exemptions and administrative rulemaking, rather than amending the underlying statute[3][4][5].

(d) **Scenario for a Yes outcome:**  
A legislative package (possibly in budget reconciliation, regulatory reform, or through a special bill) passes at least one chamber and contains text that explicitly creates a new statutory exemption from FOIA for one of the listed agencies (e.g., CIA or EPA), or carves out a new class of information making a department partially or fully exempt. This could be motivated by heightened national security concerns, executive branch restructuring, or an attempt to shield politically sensitive regulatory decisions.

## Rationale

- **Recent Activity:** The current congressional focus is on budget cuts, deregulation, overturning energy/environmental rules, and reorganizing agencies—none of which, according to legislative trackers and news sources, have included explicit FOIA carve-outs for departments like EPA, DOD, or CIA[3][4][5].
- **Legislative History:** Statutory, agency-specific FOIA exemptions are very rare; the overwhelming majority of FOIA limits are handled through the act’s nine exemptions (such as classified/national security and deliberative process) or through “Exemption 3 statutes” referenced within FOIA, but not through wholesale department-based exemptions[1][3][5].
- **Current Bills:** Major legislation advanced in the House (e.g., budget reconciliation, regulatory rollbacks) targets program funding, policy mandates, or authority but does not propose explicit FOIA exemptions for covered departments[3].
- **Political Climate:** Although there is a clear deregulatory push and talk of reorganizing or eliminating federal agencies, even in aggressive proposals like the Reorganizing Government Act, the reported legislative language is focused on organization and authority—not on transparency law carve-outs[3]. Deregulation of environmental or energy policy does not, so far, entail secretiveness through statutory FOIA waivers.
- **Remaining Uncertainty:** There is always a possibility that a last-minute amendment or crisis could prompt a new FOIA exemption targeting national security or regulatory agencies (e.g., the CIA, DOD, or EPA), especially if such a measure is embedded in a large omnibus bill or NDAA. However, this would represent a significant break from recent precedent and would likely draw substantial attention and controversy.

## Final Assessment

Given the lack of action so far, the rarity of agency-specific FOIA statutory exemptions, and the absence of credible reports of such a proposal having traction, the default (status quo) outcome is No. While a sudden event or controversy could raise the probability, such scenarios are outsized relative to historical patterns.

**Probability: 12%**
