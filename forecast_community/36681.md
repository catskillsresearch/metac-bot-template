(a) **Time left until resolution:**  
There are just under 12 months remaining before Jerome Powell's current term as Chair of the Federal Reserve Board ends on May 15, 2026. The question resolves immediately (and as "Yes") if President Trump or the US government publicly announces Powell's forcible removal before then.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changes:**  
No attempt is made to fire Jerome Powell, and he remains Fed Chair until his term expires in May 2026.

(c) **Brief scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
Despite ongoing criticism and pressure, President Trump and his administration refrain from any public move to terminate Powell. Trump continues to voice dissatisfaction, but ultimately allows Powell to finish his term, possibly focusing on naming a successor closer to expiration. No qualifying public statement or action regarding Powell's removal is made before May 1, 2026.

(d) **Brief scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
Economic or political developments (such as a recession, persistent disagreement over rates, or a new legal pretext) reignite White House frustration. Trump or his administration publicly declares Powell's termination, or Trump names a successor as Chair before Powell's term ends, accompanied by a statement making it clear the change was not voluntary. This occurs before May 1, 2026, regardless of subsequent legal injunctions or outcomes.

## Rationale

- **Precedent:** No US president has ever attempted to fire a Fed Chair. The status quo, historically, is very stable.  
- **Legal and Institutional Barriers:** Removal of a Fed Chair before the end of a term is only allowed "for cause," generally interpreted as misconduct, not policy disagreement[1][2]. Most legal experts and the Fed itself see such a removal as prohibited under current law, and Powell has directly stated removal is "not permitted under the law"[1].  
- **Recent Precedent for Other Agencies:** Trump has fired high-level officials from other independent agencies (FTC, NCUA, US Copyright Office), citing "inconsistency with the administration's priorities" rather than misconduct. This shows willingness to challenge norms of independence[2]. However, these firings are not directly analogous: the Fed's legal independence is especially sacrosanct, and any such move would likely face immediate legal challenge and market backlash[4].  
- **Trump’s Rhetoric and Actions:** In April 2025, Trump repeatedly called for Powell's removal, publicly stating that "Powell’s termination cannot come fast enough!"[2][3] and his administration openly considered whether firing Powell was possible[3]. However, by late April and in early May 2025, Trump has clearly and repeatedly stated in interviews that he has no intention to fire Powell before his term ends, citing the short time left and the practicality of waiting to name a successor[4].  
- **Powell’s Stance:** Powell has insisted he will finish his term and that the law protects his position. He has continued to hold rates steady despite political pressure, emphasizing independence and economic conditions—though he is aware of the mounting scrutiny[1].  
- **Political and Market Risks:** Attempting to fire a Fed Chair would likely trigger immediate market turmoil and a constitutional/legal confrontation. The threat of such disorder is widely seen as a disincentive[4].  
- **Reported Internal Calculus:** There was serious White House debate about firing Powell, including legal review and discussions with Kevin Warsh (a potential successor), who advised against premature removal. Key officials reportedly convinced Trump that such an action would not achieve the intended effect and would be damaging[3].  
- **Recent Statements:** From early May 2025, Trump has made clear, repeated, public statements across multiple interviews that he will not fire Powell before the end of his term. This is consistent—even if Trump continues to criticize Powell harshly and call for rate cuts.

## Status Quo Weight

The base rate is strongly in favor of *no attempt* being made: history, legal obstacles, recent de-escalation, and Trump's own statements all point to inaction. While there is legal uncertainty and precedent for challenging independent agencies, the political and economic risks—and Trump's clear public walk-back—make a high-probability scenario of an attempt unlikely.

However, the situation could change if (for example) economic conditions deteriorate rapidly, Powell acts in a way Trump finds intolerable, or court rulings alter the landscape.

## Final Probability

Given all of the above, the most likely outcome remains **no attempt** at removal. Still, the unprecedented political environment, ongoing legal uncertainty, past serious consideration of firing, and Trump's track record of norm-breaking mean that the risk is nonzero.

**Probability: 12%**
