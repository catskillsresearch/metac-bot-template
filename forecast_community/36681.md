# Comprehensive Analysis of Jerome Powell's Position as Fed Chair Through May 2026

Jerome Powell's term as Chair of the Federal Reserve Board continues until May 15, 2026, with approximately 11.5 months remaining from the current date. Throughout his tenure, Powell has faced criticism from President Trump, creating a complex dynamic around his leadership of America's central bank.

## Legal and Institutional Protections

The Federal Reserve occupies a unique position in the American governance structure. The Federal Reserve Act specifically states that board members, including the Chair, can only be removed "for cause," which historically has been interpreted to mean misconduct or malfeasance, not policy disagreements. This provides significant protection for Powell's position.

A crucial recent development strengthening Powell's standing occurred on May 22, 2025, when the Supreme Court issued a ruling that explicitly differentiated the Federal Reserve from other independent agencies. The Court stated that "The Reserve is uniquely structured quasi-private" and follows "distinct historical" precedent. This ruling strongly suggests that the Federal Reserve Chair is protected from presidential removal powers that might apply to other agency heads.

Powell himself has publicly stated that removal of top Federal Reserve officials is "not permitted under the law" and has indicated he would challenge any attempt to remove him in court. This stance is supported by Republican Senator John Kennedy, who declared, "I don't think the president, any president, has the right to remove the Federal Reserve chairman".

## Evolution of Trump's Position

President Trump's approach to Powell has evolved through several distinct phases:

**Initial Criticism (April 2025)**: Following Powell's statements about Trump's tariff policies potentially causing "higher inflation and slower growth," Trump called Powell a "major loser" and threatened that "Powell's termination cannot come fast enough!"

**Consideration Phase (April 2025)**: White House lawyers reportedly reviewed legal options for firing Powell, including whether there was "good cause" to do so.

**De-escalation (Early May 2025)**: By May 4, 2025, Trump stated in multiple interviews that he would not fire Powell before his term ends. Trump said, "No, no, no. Why would I do that? I can replace him in a short time," indicating a significant shift from his earlier position.

Despite backing away from threats to fire Powell, Trump continues to express frustration with Powell's monetary policy decisions, particularly regarding interest rates. He has described Powell as "completely inflexible," "not a fan of mine," and "a total stiff".

## Economic and Market Considerations

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick have reportedly advised Trump against attempting to fire Powell, arguing it would not lead to the interest rate cuts he desires and could destabilize financial markets. One source close to the White House described the idea of firing Powell as "a grenade with the pin pulled out."

Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee warned that undermining central bank independence could lead to higher inflation, slower economic growth, and weaker hiring. William English, an economist at Yale and former senior Fed staffer, stated that Trump's attacks on the Fed aren't "going to make the American people better off over time" and would likely result in higher inflation.

## Potential Catalysts for Change

Several factors could potentially alter the current trajectory:

1. **Economic Deterioration**: A severe economic downturn or crisis directly attributed to Powell's leadership could increase pressure for his removal.

2. **Escalating Policy Disagreements**: If Powell makes additional statements criticizing Trump's economic policies, particularly regarding tariffs, this could reignite tensions.

3. **Legal Reinterpretations**: Despite the recent Supreme Court signals, new legal interpretations could theoretically emerge that weaken protections for independent agencies.

However, with less than a year remaining in Powell's term, the incentive to risk a major constitutional confrontation is diminishing, especially when Trump can simply appoint his preferred successor in 2026 when Powell's term as Chair ends.

## Probabilistic Factors

The likelihood of an attempt to fire Powell must weigh several competing factors:

**Factors Decreasing Probability**:
- The Supreme Court's recent indication that the Fed Chair is protected from removal
- Trump's explicit statements that he won't fire Powell before his term ends
- The relatively short time remaining in Powell's term
- The potential market instability and economic consequences
- Opposition from key administration officials

**Factors Increasing Probability**:
- Trump's demonstrated willingness to challenge institutional norms
- Ongoing policy disagreements over interest rates and tariffs
- Potential economic deterioration that Trump might blame on Powell
- Trump's history of changing positions despite public statements

The weight of evidence suggests that the status quo—Powell serving out his term—remains the most probable outcome. The legal, institutional, market, and political barriers to removal are substantial and have been strengthened by recent developments, while Trump has explicitly backed away from earlier threats to fire Powell.
