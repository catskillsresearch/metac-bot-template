(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
It is currently May 9, 2025. The decisive second-round presidential vote in Romania is scheduled for May 18, 2025, so the final outcome will likely be known within the next 1–2 weeks.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
Călin Georgescu is not a candidate in the May 2025 presidential election, as he was banned from running after the annulled November 2024 results, and is not on the ballot for the rerun. Unless this decision is reversed and he is allowed to participate in the ongoing election, he cannot become president[1][4].

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
Georgescu remains banned from the ballot, is not declared president-elect after the new elections, and no extraordinary event overturns his disqualification. The election produces a different winner (such as George Simion or Nicușor Dan)[1][4]. This is the ongoing situation.

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
Some unprecedented legal, political, or judicial reversal allows Georgescu to re-enter the race after May 9, 2025, and he subsequently runs, wins, and is officially declared the president-elect before January 2026. There is no current evidence this is plausible, as the second-round election is scheduled and two other candidates are on the ballot[1][4].

## Rationale and Probability Assessment

Historically, electoral disqualifications in established European democracies are rarely overturned within days of a scheduled election, especially following national and international scrutiny. The Romanian authorities have moved forward with a new vote without Georgescu, and polls, as well as the official candidate lists, no longer include him[1][4]. The only path to a "Yes" outcome would require both a legal reversal and a rapid reorganization of the election process to include his candidacy, for which there is no current indication. Even with public protests, there is no precedent or sign that authorities will act in this way, particularly after the high-profile annulment and explicit foreign interference findings[1][4].

Georgescu’s continued political relevance is limited to endorsements and possible roles outside of the presidency, but that does not satisfy the question’s criteria. In summary, the status quo is strongly entrenched, and the likelihood of a last-minute reversal is extremely low.
