(a) Time left until outcome is known: Approximately 8 months (from May 10, 2025 until January 1, 2026)

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: The §45X tax credit would continue without requiring domestic materials or subcomponents, only requiring that the finished goods be produced in the US.

(c) Scenario for No outcome: Republicans focus on phasing out clean energy incentives rather than imposing new requirements, and the slim Republican majority in the House makes it difficult to pass significant changes to the §45X tax credit structure due to moderate Republican resistance.

(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: Republicans use budget reconciliation to impose domestic content requirements on §45X as part of a "Buy American" initiative, framing it as strengthening domestic manufacturing rather than eliminating clean energy incentives outright.

As a professional forecaster, I'll analyze whether the IRA's Advanced Manufacturing Production Tax Credits will start requiring domestic materials or subcomponents in 2025.

Based on the current information, the §45X tax credit program explicitly does not require domestically-sourced materials or subcomponents. The regulations clearly state that while finished goods must be produced in the US, their subcomponents (such as steel, framing, or electrical parts) do not need to be domestically sourced[1][5]. This has been confirmed in the final regulations issued in late 2024.

The political landscape is certainly in flux with Republicans controlling both Houses of Congress and the White House. However, several factors weigh against a rapid change to domestic content requirements:

First, the Republican majority in the House is extremely slim at 220-213, giving substantial leverage to moderate Republicans. We've already seen 21 Republican representatives advocate for a "thoughtful phaseout" rather than elimination of clean energy incentives[5]. This suggests that moderate Republicans may resist dramatic changes to the existing framework.

Second, even with reconciliation authority, making substantial policy changes (rather than just funding adjustments) can be procedurally challenging. The Byrd Rule limits what can be included in reconciliation bills to provisions that directly affect the federal budget.

Third, imposing domestic content requirements would represent a significant shift in policy direction. While the current administration may wish to reduce IRA spending, adding new domestic content requirements would actually make the tax credits more restrictive rather than simply reducing their availability or value.

It's also worth noting that there are already phasedown provisions built into the §45X credit structure. For most manufactured goods, the credit value phases down to 75% of its value in 2030, 50% in 2031, and 25% in 2032[1]. This existing phasedown may satisfy some Republican desires to limit the program's long-term fiscal impact.

The most likely scenario is that Republicans may attempt to accelerate the phasedown timeline or reduce credit values rather than imposing new domestic content requirements. If any changes to §45X occur, they would likely focus on reducing overall program costs rather than restructuring eligibility criteria.

Given the status quo, the limited time remaining in 2025, the slim Republican majority, the procedural challenges of reconciliation, and the existing evidence that subcomponents and materials do not need to be domestically sourced, I assess that domestic content requirements for §45X are unlikely to be enacted before January 1, 2026.

Probability: 15%
