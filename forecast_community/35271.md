(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  
There are nearly 8 months remaining until January 1, 2026, the deadline for resolution.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
As of May 9, 2025, Anthropic has not officially announced the release of a Claude 4 model[1][5]. If this state persists—with no official release or announcement—then the outcome would be **No**.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
Anthropic does not publish any document, blog post, article, or video announcing a successor to the Claude 3/3.7 series before January 1, 2026. Even if rumors, leaks, or incremental updates (such as to the Claude 3.x line) circulate, unless Anthropic officially discloses the existence and performance of a new major version and brands it as a next-generation model, the question resolves as **No**.

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
Before January 1, 2026, Anthropic publicly announces—via an official document—a model that is explicitly presented as the successor to the Claude 3/3.7 family. The announcement includes a new major version designation (e.g., "Claude 4," "Claude Next"), and describes performance results or confirms the new model's existence, regardless of whether it is generally available. The announcement could occur via a blog post, press release, or at a major industry event.

## Rationale

- **Historical cadence and industry signals:** Anthropic has shown a pattern of releasing major model updates roughly every 12–18 months, with incremental improvements between major versions[5]. Industry buzz and credible rumors point to a strong likelihood of a major release within 2025, possibly as early as mid-year[1][4][5].
- **Competitive pressures:** The rapid progress of competing labs (OpenAI, Google DeepMind) incentivizes Anthropic to maintain its innovation pace. The deployment of new features, partnerships (e.g., with Google Cloud), and expansion of research programs signals ongoing investment in flagship models[2][3].
- **Recent rumors and leaks:** Multiple sources as of early 2025 have suggested that the tech world is expecting Claude 4 to arrive soon, with some expecting an announcement as early as Q1 or Q2 2025[1][4][5]. However, all reputable sources agree that, as of now, no official announcement has been made.
- **Weight for status quo:** Good forecasting practice emphasizes that most of the time, major changes take longer than enthusiasts expect. Despite strong rumors, without official confirmation, there remains a real chance of delays or strategic pivots.

## Probability Estimate

Given the credible rumors of an imminent announcement, Anthropic's release cadence, and the competitive context, it is highly likely—but not certain—that Anthropic will announce a Claude 4 model in 2025. However, the absence of an official announcement as of May, and the potential for unforeseen delays, warrant caution.

**Probability: 80%**
