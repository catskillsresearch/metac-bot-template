## Rationale for the Probability that OpenAI Will Release an LLM Product or API Hallucinating 5x Less Than GPT-4 by June 30, 2025

OpenAI’s most recent public model releases, such as GPT-4.1 and GPT-4.5, show a pronounced trend of stagnation or regression in factuality benchmarks. Empirical reports from early to mid-2025 reveal that newer OpenAI models—specifically o3 and o4-mini—exhibit increasing hallucination rates, with values ranging from 33% to as high as 79% on various factuality assessments, compared to as low as 16% in earlier models. Even GPT-4.5, which promoted a 43% reduction in hallucinations compared to its predecessor, only reduced the hallucination rate to approximately 37% on the SimpleQA test—far from the required threshold of a 5x reduction relative to GPT-4’s baseline.

Concurrently, OpenAI’s recent development trajectory has prioritized improvements in coding, reasoning, instruction following, and context handling rather than targeting dramatic gains in factual accuracy or explicit factuality benchmarks. Their latest releases do not publicly claim or even preview scores meeting or exceeding the required ≥95% internal factual eval or ≥92% on TruthfulQA. No official announcements, leaks, or whitepapers indicate that a new factuality-focused model is imminent or in advanced development.

Meanwhile, the industry has demonstrated that technical solutions for reducing hallucinations are feasible in principle, as evidenced by Google’s Gemini-2.0-Flash-001—achieving an impressive 0.7% hallucination rate (99.3% accuracy) in certain settings. This sets an upper bound for what is technically possible, but Gemini’s performance is not generalizable to OpenAI, whose models currently trail in this metric.

Well-established techniques for minimizing hallucinations—including chain-of-thought prompting, prompt engineering, retrieval-augmented generation, structured reasoning, and automated verification—can deliver substantial yet incremental gains. For example, chain-of-thought prompting can boost reasoning accuracy by around 35%, and verification prompts can yield up to a 17% reduction in hallucinations in tested scenarios. However, industry experts agree that as models approach high factual reliability, each additional improvement becomes exponentially harder, demanding significant research investment and, potentially, novel architectural innovation.

With only approximately one month remaining before the deadline, OpenAI would need to:
- Complete R&D and large-scale validation of a new model or pipeline achieving ≥95%/≥92% accuracy,
- Prepare and test it for public or developer access as a product or API,
- Make an official release with claims subject to third-party verification.

Historical precedent and standard release cadence further constrain the plausibility of such an abrupt development and launch, especially given the lack of any precursors, such as public teasers, alpha programs, or industry rumors.

While a last-minute factuality-optimized release is theoretically possible, it would represent a dramatic and uncharacteristic pivot from OpenAI’s observable trajectory. There is no public indication—either qualitative or quantitative—that OpenAI is on the cusp of delivering a 5x reduction in hallucination rates relative to GPT-4. All public evidence, including recent regression in factual metrics, focus on alternative capabilities, and lack of product signals, point strongly toward the status quo being maintained at least through June 30, 2025.

In summary, although methods for reducing hallucinations are rapidly advancing, OpenAI’s current progress, available time, and strategic direction make it exceedingly unlikely that a compliant LLM product or API—meeting the strict benchmarks specified—will be released by the end of June 2025.
