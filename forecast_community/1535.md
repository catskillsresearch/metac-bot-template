The question of whether most protons that currently make up Earth and us will eventually decay involves timescales that are effectively indefinite, potentially spanning \(10^{34}\) years or more. This makes it a question of cosmological significance, far beyond human observation and current experimental capabilities.

Currently, the status quo suggests that most protons will not decay. This is based on the lack of experimental evidence for proton decay and the possibility that protons are stable or have lifetimes much longer than current experimental bounds. Theoretical predictions from Grand Unified Theories (GUTs) propose that protons could decay into lighter particles over extremely long timescales, but these predictions remain unproven.

Several scenarios could result in protons not decaying: they could remain stable indefinitely, be absorbed by black holes, or the universe could undergo a phase transition that does not involve proton decay. Additionally, unknown physics or scenarios, such as the universe being a simulation, could also result in protons not decaying.

On the other hand, if GUTs are correct, protons may eventually decay, and experimental evidence for this could be observed in the future. However, given the current state of knowledge, the lower bound on proton lifetime is extremely long, and alternative fates for protons are plausible.

The status quo heavily favors the scenario where protons do not decay, as this aligns with all current experimental data. While GUTs provide a theoretical framework for proton decay, the lack of empirical evidence and the existence of alternative scenarios suggest that the probability of most protons decaying is less than 50%. The slow pace of change in fundamental physics and the absence of new evidence or breakthroughs further support the likelihood that the status quo will persist.
