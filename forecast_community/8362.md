# US-China War Prospects Through 2035: A Comprehensive Assessment

The relationship between the United States and China has evolved into an intense strategic rivalry characterized by military competition, economic tensions, and geopolitical maneuvering. As we look toward 2035, it's essential to analyze the factors that could lead to or prevent direct military conflict between these superpowers.

## Current Strategic Environment

The US-China relationship is marked by escalating tensions across multiple domains. China is accelerating its military modernization, with plans to build a nuclear force of approximately 1,500 operational warheads by 2035. Meanwhile, the US Defense Secretary has warned allies about the "imminent risk" posed by China, particularly regarding Taiwan.

The conventional military balance appears to be shifting gradually in China's favor. As directly defending territory in the region becomes harder for the US Joint Force due to Beijing's coercive diplomacy against its neighbors, Washington will likely pursue more lethal munitions, rely more heavily on long-range-strike warfare, and try to expand its posture of bases and agreements closer to potential conflict zones. If current technological and capability trends continue, the US role as the primary security guarantor in the region will be progressively challenged.

## Taiwan as the Primary Flashpoint

Taiwan represents the most likely trigger for a US-China war. China views Taiwan as a core interest and continues to increase military pressure on the island. The Pentagon has identified a potential timeline for Chinese action against Taiwan around 2027, though experts caution against treating this as a fixed deadline.

However, a Chinese invasion of Taiwan remains unlikely in the near term. Such an operation would be extraordinarily risky for Beijing, with no guarantee of success. Amphibious assaults are among the most difficult military operations to execute, and China cannot rule out US intervention, which would likely exact a devastating toll on the People's Liberation Army.

## Deterrence Dynamics

Several factors reduce the likelihood of direct military conflict:

**Nuclear Deterrence**: China's nuclear expansion, while concerning from a nonproliferation standpoint, may actually enhance strategic stability through mutual vulnerability by the mid-2030s. With a much larger nuclear force, China should have more confidence in the security of its second-strike capability, assuming the US has not radically changed its own nuclear or nuclear-relevant conventional capabilities. This mutual vulnerability could encourage arms control talks similar to US-Soviet dynamics during the Cold War.

**Economic Interdependence**: Despite ongoing "decoupling" efforts and trade disputes, the US and Chinese economies remain significantly intertwined. The economic costs of a major conflict would be catastrophic for both nations and the global economy. This economic interdependence serves as a powerful restraint against military confrontation, though its influence may diminish if decoupling accelerates.

**Lessons from Ukraine**: Beijing has likely observed Russia's challenges in Ukraine, reinforcing the risks of military adventurism and providing a cautionary tale against high-risk military operations.

**Internal Challenges**: China faces significant domestic economic and demographic challenges that would be exacerbated by war, potentially threatening CCP control and stability.

## Escalation Risks

If the conventional military balance continues to swing in China's favor, US deterrence may weaken, and escalation dynamics could become more unpredictable in an armed conflict. To avoid losing a war over territory near the Chinese mainland, the US might attack Chinese computer networks and space-based capabilities or conduct long-range precision strikes against mainland targets â€“ actions Beijing would likely view as highly escalatory.

Nearly half of the Atlantic Council's survey respondents (46 percent) agreed that the emerging axis of Russia, Iran, China, and North Korea will be formal allies by 2035. Among respondents who foresaw both the world being divided into China- and US-aligned blocs and these countries becoming formal allies, 62 percent also anticipated another world war over the next decade.

## Potential War Scenarios

A US-China war meeting the threshold of 1,000+ battle-related deaths in a single year would most likely stem from:

1. **Taiwan Invasion Scenario**: China attempts to forcibly reunify with Taiwan, triggering US intervention. Initial limited exchanges escalate as both sides target each other's military capabilities, resulting in significant casualties.

2. **Accidental Escalation**: A minor incident in the South China Sea or around Taiwan spirals out of control due to miscalculation, poor communication, or domestic political pressures.

3. **Third-Party Trigger**: Conflict between China and a US ally (such as Japan or the Philippines) draws in US forces, leading to direct US-China combat.

## Long-term Stabilization Prospects

By the mid-2030s, several factors could contribute to strategic stability:

1. **Strategic Arms Talks**: The financial strains created by conventional and nuclear arms buildup might provide the foundation for arms-control agreements, which could help stabilize relations between the two powers.

2. **Mutual Nuclear Vulnerability**: A rough military balance in East Asia could provide a foundation for strategic coexistence. With both sides secure in their second-strike capabilities, the risk of nuclear escalation would create powerful incentives for conflict avoidance.

3. **Crisis Management Mechanisms**: Both sides may develop more robust communication channels and crisis management protocols to prevent unintended escalation.

## Conclusion

The probability of a US-China war before 2035 must account for both the risk of intentional conflict (primarily over Taiwan) and the risk of unintended escalation from smaller incidents. The international system typically changes slowly, and the status quo of no direct US-China war has persisted for decades despite previous periods of tension.

While tensions between the US and China are significant and growing, with Taiwan representing a serious flashpoint, several factors suggest that direct military conflict meeting the 1,000 battle-related deaths threshold remains unlikely, though certainly possible. The combination of nuclear deterrence, economic interdependence, lessons from Ukraine, and the enormous costs of conflict provide powerful incentives for both sides to avoid war. However, the risk of miscalculation, especially regarding Taiwan, creates a non-trivial probability of conflict.
