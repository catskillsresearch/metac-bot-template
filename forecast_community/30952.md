(a) Time until outcome: About 6 months (May 2025 to November 2025)
(b) Status quo outcome: Based on most recent data, the 12-month CPI change in March 2025 was 2.4%, which is already below the November 2024 baseline of 2.73258%.
(c) No outcome scenario: Inflation could accelerate due to the impact of tariffs being passed on to consumers, tight labor markets from reduced immigration, and fiscal stimulus from tax cuts, pushing the November 2025 rate above 2.73258%.
(d) Yes outcome scenario: Current disinflationary trends continue, with energy price declines and moderating core inflation keeping the November 2025 rate below the November 2024 baseline of 2.73258%.

The question asks whether the 12-month percentage change in the US Consumer Price Index will be lower in November 2025 than it was in November 2024 (2.73258%).

## Current Inflation Trends

The most recent data shows a moderating trend in inflation. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) experienced a 2.2% increase over the 12 months ending March 2025[1][3]. On a monthly basis, the CPI-U actually decreased 0.1% in March, after rising 0.2% in February[2].

This represents significant progress in disinflation, as the current annual rate (2.2%) is already below the November 2024 baseline of 2.73258%. The trend appears to be downward, despite occasional monthly fluctuations.

## Factors Supporting Lower Inflation

Several factors suggest inflation may remain below the November 2024 baseline:

1. **Energy price declines**: Recent data shows energy prices fell 2.4% in March 2025 alone, with gasoline prices dropping by 6.3%[5]. This significant component of the CPI has been applying downward pressure on overall inflation.

2. **Moderating core inflation**: Core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy components, has shown signs of stabilization. The year-over-year growth in core CPI fell to 1.8% in March 2025, down from 2.2% previously[5].

3. **Current momentum**: The most recent Forbes analysis indicates that the "year/year CPI inflation rate fell to 2.41% in March" and projects that "the 12-month inflation rate will reach the Fed's 2% goal sometime in Q3 or Q4" of 2025.

## Factors Supporting Higher Inflation

However, there are also factors that could push inflation higher:

1. **Tariff impacts**: Multiple sources indicate that tariffs implemented in early 2025 may begin to show up more prominently in consumer prices. April's inflation data is expected to show acceleration due to companies passing on higher tariff costs[5].

2. **Food price increases**: The food index continued to rise, up 0.4% in March 2025[5], suggesting persistent inflationary pressures in this sector.

3. **Housing costs**: Housing and utilities costs continue to increase, with this index rising to 343.51 in March 2025 from 342.40 previously[5].

## Recent Inflation Trends

Looking at the monthly progression of inflation data:
- December 2024: CPI at 2.9% year-over-year
- February 2025: CPI at 2.8% year-over-year
- March 2025: CPI at 2.4% year-over-year

This shows a clear downward trend in the annual inflation rate in recent months, despite some monthly fluctuations.

## Status Quo Analysis

The current trajectory of inflation is downward, with the March 2025 rate (2.4%) already below the November 2024 baseline (2.73258%). For inflation to exceed the baseline by November 2025, there would need to be a reversal of this established trend.

While tariffs and other policy changes could create upward pressure, there's significant evidence that the overall inflation picture remains under control. The Federal Reserve's policy stance appears to be successfully managing inflation, with recent data showing that the 12-month inflation rate may reach the Fed's 2% goal in the third or fourth quarter of 2025.

## Conclusion

Given the current downward inflation trend and the fact that the March 2025 rate is already below the November 2024 baseline, the most likely outcome is that inflation will remain below 2.73258% in November 2025. While there are upside risks from tariffs and other policy initiatives, the established disinflationary trend would need to significantly reverse for inflation to exceed the November 2024 baseline.

The status quo strongly favors a "Yes" outcome - that November 2025's inflation rate will be lower than November 2024's rate of 2.73258%.

Probability: 65%
