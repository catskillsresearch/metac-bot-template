With approximately 3 years remaining until 2028, the current status quo indicates that 4% of U.S. adults self-reported as following a vegetarian diet in 2019. If current trends continue, this figure is expected to rise to around 7%, driven by gradual growth in plant-based diets and supported by community forecasts and market trends. Experts and market analyses project a range of 6-8% by 2028, reflecting a steady increase in vegetarianism due to market growth in plant-based foods and heightened awareness of health and environmental benefits.

However, several unexpected scenarios could influence these projections. A significant backlash against plant-based diets, possibly due to unforeseen health concerns, negative media coverage, or a major scandal involving plant-based products, could lead to stagnation or even a decline in vegetarianism, potentially resulting in an outcome closer to 3-4%. Conversely, a major breakthrough in plant-based food technology, making vegetarian options significantly cheaper and more accessible, combined with strong policy support or a cultural shift towards sustainability and animal welfare, could accelerate adoption. This could be further bolstered by government incentives or influential public figures advocating for plant-based diets, potentially pushing the percentage of U.S. adults following a vegetarian diet to around 10%.
