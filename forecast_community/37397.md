The Artemis Accords have maintained a steady trajectory of expansion since their inception in October 2020, accumulating 55 signatory countries by May 15, 2025, with the most recent additions—Bangladesh in April and Norway in May—demonstrating a consistent pattern of approximately one new country joining each month in 2025. This regularity suggests ongoing diplomatic momentum and active engagement with non-signatory nations.

Recent international activities reinforce this trajectory. A prominent workshop hosted by the UAE on May 21-22, 2025, brought together representatives from 30 countries to discuss the implementation and principles of the Artemis Accords, indicating significant global attention and outreach. NASA has explicitly stated their expectation that "additional countries will sign the accords in the coming weeks and months," implying that negotiations with potential signatories are already at an advanced stage. These events often act as catalysts for new accessions, facilitating both formal and informal diplomatic discussions.

Further bolstering the likelihood of a new signature, NASA and the U.S. State Department have maintained active promotional campaigns for the Artemis Accords, leveraging international forums and summits such as the “Humans to the Moon & Mars Summit” at the end of May 2025. These gatherings not only support diplomatic engagement but also provide high-visibility platforms that encourage formal commitments from attending countries.

Despite this momentum, some countervailing factors could delay the next signing beyond June. With 55 nations already participating, the pool of remaining non-signatories with active space programs or clear near-term interests is gradually shrinking. Internal government approval processes required for international agreements can be slow and unpredictable, introducing the possibility of delays. There are no public announcements or official confirmations of any country planning to sign specifically in June 2025, which adds a degree of uncertainty and maintains the weight of the status quo.

Nevertheless, the pattern of regular monthly signings, sustained diplomatic activity—including explicit statements by NASA anticipating new signatories soon—and the recent, well-attended workshop all support the expectation that the expansion of the Artemis Accords is likely to continue in the near term. While governmental processes can introduce irregularity, the overall context suggests both active negotiation pipelines and near-term opportunities for new members to formally join.
