(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  
There are approximately 7.5 months remaining until the resolution date of January 1, 2026.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
If current trends persist—specifically, the Ukrainian General Staff reporting daily Russian personnel losses of 1,100–1,300 per day with the total as of mid-May 2025 around 965,000—the reported 1 million Russian losses threshold will almost certainly be reached before January 2026, likely by late August or September 2025[4][5].

(c) **Scenario for a No outcome:**  
A "No" outcome could occur if the Ukrainian General Staff ceases public reporting of Russian losses for at least 30 consecutive days before reaching 1 million (e.g., a peace agreement, ceasefire, or reporting disruption), or if the intensity of combat and thus reported losses drops dramatically and unexpectedly, pushing the crossing of the 1 million mark past January 1, 2026.

(d) **Scenario for a Yes outcome:**  
A "Yes" outcome occurs if the Ukrainian General Staff continues its current reporting tempo and publishing casualty numbers, and the tally reaches 1 million or more before January 1, 2026.

## Rationale and Probabilistic Assessment

**Current Numbers and Trajectory:**  
The Ukrainian General Staff officially reports Russian personnel losses of approximately 965,000 as of May 11, 2025, with recent daily averages exceeding 1,200[4]. In April 2025 alone, around 36,000 casualties were reported, and this high tempo has continued into May. Independent corroboration by UK Defence Intelligence and multiple OSINT trackers supports these elevated figures and trends[4][5].

**Trend Analysis:**  
At a steady rate of 1,200 daily, the 35,000-loss gap between the current total (965,000) and 1 million would be closed in roughly 29 days. This implies the 1 million mark is highly likely to be reported around early- to mid-June 2025—well before the end of the year—unless there is a sudden and sustained change in either the reporting or battlefield tempo[4][5].

**Disruptive Scenarios and Risks:**  
- There is no credible indication of imminent ceasefire, peace deal, or major disruption to Ukrainian General Staff reporting[5].  
- Russia shows no public intention to de-escalate, despite heavy losses[5].  
- Non-combat disruption or policy change in Ukrainian reporting remains possible but, absent specific signals, is historically rare.

**Weighting the Status Quo:**  
Good forecasting practice emphasizes that absent clear, near-term catalysts, the status quo generally persists. The dynamics of the conflict, political imperatives on both sides, and established reporting practices suggest that the daily publication of loss data is highly likely to continue for the next 1–2 months, at minimum.

## Final Assessment

Given the current pace of Russian personnel losses as reported by the Ukrainian General Staff, the absence of signals for imminent reporting stoppage or peace agreement, and the small shortfall to the 1 million mark, the base case is that the 1 million threshold will be reached and publicly reported well before January 1, 2026[4][5]. Key risks—disruption to reporting or a sudden war-ending settlement—are judged to be present but low probability over the next several months.

**Probability: 95%**
