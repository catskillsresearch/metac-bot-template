(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  
There are just under 8 months remaining until the question closes on January 1, 2026.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
As of early May 2025, official Ukrainian reports and UK intelligence estimate Russian personnel losses at approximately 950,000 since February 2022[5]. The current daily average of reported losses is over 1,200 per day[4][5]. If this trend persists, the 1 million threshold will be surpassed within the next 2–3 months, likely by July or August 2025—well before the resolution deadline.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
A No outcome would occur if, before the threshold is reached, there is either:

- A ceasefire or peace agreement leading to the Ukrainian General Staff ceasing daily reporting, or  
- A sustained interruption in publication (no updates for 30+ days) not clearly attributable to a ceasefire, or  
- A dramatic, sustained reduction in battle intensity causing reported average casualties to drop well below current levels, delaying the 1 million mark past January 1, 2026.

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
A Yes outcome will occur if the Ukrainian General Staff continues publishing daily loss reports at or near the current rate. At over 1,200 reported Russian casualties per day and a starting point of approximately 950,000, the milestone will be reached in roughly 40 days. This would put the crossing point in late June or early July 2025, with ample margin for reporting errors or fluctuations in intensity[4][5].

## Rationale

Given the current operational status and the tempo of fighting, the status quo is by far the strongest predictor for this forecast. The latest data show the war's intensity and Russian casualty rates are at or near their highest levels since the invasion began. There are no credible indications of an imminent ceasefire or a breakdown in Ukrainian reporting practices[2][4][5].

Even if the daily casualty rate decreases moderately, the time to the 1 million mark is short—fewer than 50,000 additional losses required, compared to 160,000 reported in just the first four months of 2025[4][5]. The only credible way the outcome would not resolve Yes is if there is a sudden, sustained cessation of hostilities or an abrupt end to the Ukrainian General Staff's publication of loss data. While these are plausible in theory, there is currently no evidence or news suggesting such a development is imminent.

Standard forecasting practice puts considerable weight on inertia—the world usually continues on its present course. All leading indicators reinforce this: a historically high casualty rate, continued daily reporting, and no signals of de-escalation or reporting interruptions.
