With less than two weeks remaining before the G7 Summit in Canada (June 15–17, 2025), there is no formal invitation from Canada to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and multiple credible reports indicate that India is not inclined to accept a last-minute offer even if one were extended. The diplomatic relationship between India and Canada remains deeply strained, rooted in unresolved tensions stemming from Canada’s allegations of Indian involvement in the 2023 killing of Khalistani separatist Hardeep Singh Nijjar, which led to the mutual expulsion of diplomats and persistent Indian concerns about the activities of Khalistani separatists in Canada. 

Indian government sources, as well as official statements from the Ministry of External Affairs, consistently confirm that no preparations are underway for a high-level visit, reinforcing the lack of logistical groundwork essential for such a short-notice trip. Security risks—especially the threat of disruptions by separatist groups—compound these barriers and present further disincentives to Modi’s attendance. 

Canada has already confirmed invitations to other guest countries such as Australia, Ukraine, South Africa, and Brazil, while declining to comment publicly on India’s status; this pattern highlights a deliberate and strategic omission reflective of ongoing diplomatic challenges. Although there have been some recent signals of openness to improve bilateral ties, such as outreach by Canada’s new government, these developments are too recent and modest to enable a swift normalization required for Modi’s participation at the summit.

Given the entrenched diplomatic friction, the absence of both an official invitation and adequate preparation time, explicit statements of non-attendance from Indian officials, and the significant security and logistical concerns associated with a late decision, all available evidence overwhelmingly points to Prime Minister Modi not attending the G7 Summit in June 2025.
