Several major factors will shape the outcome of the 2025 Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Award for Favorite Animated Movie. The awards are determined entirely by votes from children and pre-teens, making the result especially sensitive to current trends, franchise loyalty, and network promotion. 

Sequels and established franchises hold a distinct advantage, as the nominees include Inside Out 2 (Pixar/Disney), Moana 2 (Disney), Despicable Me 4 (Illumination/Universal), and Plankton: The Movie (Nickelodeon/Netflix), among others. Historical patterns at the KCAs show that sequels from major studios—especially those with enduring resonance among young viewers—tend to perform strongly. Inside Out 2, for instance, builds on the critically acclaimed original and benefits from Pixar’s consistent success with both children and broader audiences. Its emotional storytelling and familiar characters are likely to connect deeply with the KCA demographic.

Nickelodeon's own productions, however, enjoy a unique “home-field” advantage. Plankton: The Movie, as a SpongeBob SquarePants spinoff, not only taps into the massive KCA-winning legacy of the franchise (over 21 wins to date), but can also benefit from direct network promotion and visibility on the voting platform. Nickelodeon has a well-documented pattern of leveraging cross-promotion and platform power to rally support for its in-house content, particularly in the final weeks leading up to the awards.

Disney’s presence is also formidable, with three contenders: Inside Out 2, Moana 2, and Mufasa: The Lion King. Moana 2 is especially well-positioned, given the original’s widespread popularity, appealing music, and ongoing promotional campaigns from Disney. Mufasa: The Lion King may not generate as much excitement as the other sequels, but it offers the multi-generational draw of its classic roots.

Despicable Me 4, supported by the ever-popular Minions, is another contender—while the franchise usually resonates with younger viewers, it may face stiffer competition from Disney and Nickelodeon’s films this year. The remaining nominees, like Dog Man, The Wild Robot, and Transformers One, do have dedicated audiences but generally lack the same current cultural momentum and brand dominance in the KCA context.

An upset is plausible if Nickelodeon mounts a major push for Plankton: The Movie or if a viral social media campaign shifts momentum late in the voting period, potentially favoring any of the major sequels. However, based on voting tendencies, studio influence, and franchise appeal, the leading contenders remain Inside Out 2, Plankton: The Movie, and Moana 2—each buoyed by built-in audiences, studio backing, and recent promotional efforts.

Overall, the race is likely to hinge on the interplay between established franchise loyalty, network-driven promotion, and the unpredictable tastes of the young voting base.
