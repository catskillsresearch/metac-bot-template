# PEPFAR's Existential Crisis: Assessing the Program's Future Through January 1, 2026

## Current Status of PEPFAR

PEPFAR is currently in an unprecedented state of vulnerability. Its statutory authorization expired on March 25, 2025, placing the program in legal limbo for the first time in its two-decade history. While PEPFAR remains a permanent part of U.S. law and continues to exist as a legal entity, it now operates under temporary funding mechanisms and judicial interventions that have kept some elements of the program operational.

On January 20, 2025, President Trump issued an executive order implementing a 90-day pause on foreign assistance, including PEPFAR programs. Although Secretary of State Marco Rubio granted narrow waivers for certain PEPFAR activities—particularly HIV treatment and prevention programs for pregnant women—implementation has been highly fragmented and delayed, resulting in significant operational disruption.

## Key Factors Affecting PEPFAR's Future

**Political Opposition and Eroding Support**
PEPFAR has lost its standing as a foreign policy priority, weighed down by growing skepticism of foreign aid and declining bipartisan interest. The program's most recent reauthorization was only for one year instead of the traditional five years, reflecting increased congressional hesitation. Opposition has grown particularly among Republican lawmakers who have raised concerns about potential connections to abortion services.

**Executive Branch Hostility**
The Trump administration has demonstrated clear hostility toward foreign aid programs, including PEPFAR. The January 2025 executive order and subsequent implementation suggest a deliberate strategy to scale back or eliminate such programs. Despite court orders compelling the resumption of some foreign aid activities, reports indicate ongoing noncompliance and continued operational chaos.

**Funding Crisis and Operational Collapse**
The program is currently operating under significant funding constraints. The FY 2025 Continuing Resolution passed in March included level funding for PEPFAR's bilateral programming at $4.85 billion, but implementation has been severely compromised by the foreign aid review. Field reports indicate widespread service disruptions:

- PrEP delivery services have been suspended in some countries and reduced in others
- Product introduction goals have stalled, with procurement for 2025 paused
- Research studies involving over 11,000 participants have been terminated
- Health system strengthening projects and management information systems have been disrupted
- Clinic closures are occurring across multiple African countries

**Judicial Intervention**
Federal courts have intervened to block the most extreme administrative actions, ordering resumption of some activities. However, these judicial orders have been met with partial compliance at best, creating ongoing uncertainty about PEPFAR's operational status.

**Future Budget Uncertainty**
Deep uncertainty persists as the Department of State consolidates what remains of U.S. global health efforts. Discretionary spending cuts proposed for fiscal year 2026 and the White House's intent to pursue rescissions of at least $20 billion, likely to include previously appropriated PEPFAR funds, further threaten the program's viability.

## Potential Scenarios

**Scenario for PEPFAR's Survival**
PEPFAR could continue to exist if:
- Congress passes a new appropriations bill or continuing resolution before the end of 2025 that includes funding for PEPFAR
- Court interventions continue to block executive attempts at termination or consolidation
- Political pressure (domestic or international) prevents complete dismantling
- The program continues in a diminished form but maintains its distinct identity and core functions

**Scenario for PEPFAR Ceasing to Exist**
PEPFAR could cease to exist if:
- Congress enacts legislation that eliminates or merges PEPFAR, or zeroes out its funding
- The executive branch successfully terminates or absorbs PEPFAR through bureaucratic restructuring, and this action remains unchallenged for 60 consecutive days
- FY 2026 appropriations eliminate all PEPFAR funding
- The ongoing dismantling of implementation capacity leads to formal absorption or dissolution of PEPFAR's functions

## Weighing the Evidence

While government programs typically demonstrate resilience and inertia, PEPFAR faces a unique confluence of threats that place it at unprecedented risk:

1. The program's legal authorization has already expired, creating both legal ambiguity and operational vulnerability
2. Executive actions have already caused severe operational disruptions, with clinic closures and service interruptions reported globally
3. The political consensus that sustained PEPFAR for two decades has fractured, with vocal opposition emerging in Congress
4. Proposals for consolidation or elimination are actively under discussion within both the executive branch and Congress
5. The program's implementation infrastructure is being systematically dismantled, undermining its capacity to function

However, several factors could prevent PEPFAR from completely ceasing to exist:

1. The inertia of government programs and bureaucratic complexity often slow termination processes
2. Judicial intervention has provided temporary relief and could continue to block abrupt termination
3. PEPFAR's historical success and importance in global health could generate political pressure for preservation
4. International diplomatic considerations may discourage complete elimination
5. Last-minute congressional action could maintain minimal funding

The status quo is one of ongoing dismantling rather than stability. PEPFAR is operating without proper authorization, with reduced funding, and with significant operational disruptions worldwide. Its core functions and distinct identity are increasingly at risk of being eliminated or absorbed into other initiatives before January 1, 2026.

Given the expired authorization, executive hostility, weakened political support, ongoing operational collapse, and active discussions of consolidation or elimination, PEPFAR faces the most significant existential threat in its history. While the program continues to exist in a technical legal sense, the trajectory strongly suggests continued erosion and a substantial risk of formal cessation before the end of 2025.
