US industrial production is poised to show positive year-over-year growth for May 2025, continuing a trend established throughout the early part of the year. The most recent available data indicates that industrial production grew by approximately 1.5% year-over-year in April, providing a comfortable cushion above zero for May's comparison. This positive baseline is underpinned by consistent gains in manufacturing—the sector's largest component—which has demonstrated resilience and steady expansion, particularly with recent strength in the auto sector and a jump in the manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) to 52.3 in May, signaling robust activity. Mining output has also contributed positively, and while utilities have shown weather-driven volatility, these fluctuations have not been large enough to offset year-over-year gains.

Broader economic factors also support this outlook. US real GDP is forecast to grow by 1.6% in 2025, and capacity utilization, while below its long-term average, suggests there is still room for output expansion without running into supply constraints. The industry benefits from favorable conditions such as lower interest rates and ongoing investment in manufacturing, which bolster demand and support further growth. While there are risks—such as trade tensions, potential for new tariffs, supply chain disruptions, and sector-specific headwinds—the impact of these risks appears limited in the absence of sudden, large-scale economic shocks.

The momentum from Q1 2025 (with industrial production rising at a 5.5% annual rate) creates a strong base effect, making a sharp negative turn highly improbable barring an unexpected, severe contraction in multiple sectors simultaneously. The history of industrial production also suggests that transitions from growth to contraction are typically gradual and require significant underlying economic shifts, none of which are currently evident.

In summary, with manufacturing and mining supporting growth and utilities' volatility remaining within manageable bounds, and with leading indicators (such as the PMI) pointing to ongoing expansion, US industrial production is well-positioned to record another month of positive year-over-year growth in May 2025. The probability of an abrupt, broad-based downturn sufficient to erase the current growth margin is low in the current economic context.
