The objective of breaking up NOAA, as outlined in the Project 2025 blueprint, faces significant barriers to being marked as complete in the Project 2025 Tracker spreadsheet before July 1, 2025. Although the blueprint explicitly calls for dismantling NOAA and commercializing key operations such as the National Weather Service, actual implementation has, so far, been limited to budget reductions and targeted service changes. These moves—including the termination of the Billion-Dollar Weather and Climate Disasters database and preparations for the possible closure of up to 19 NOAA facilities—reflect incremental steps aligned with Project 2025’s vision, but do not amount to the comprehensive breakup described in the objective.

A major obstacle is the public stance of Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, who, during his January 2025 confirmation hearing, explicitly rejected the plan to break up NOAA, stating he had “no interest in separating it” and confirming this was not on his agenda. His opposition creates a bureaucratic check on any accelerated restructuring efforts, particularly since NOAA comprises the majority of the Commerce Department’s budget in non-census years and handles critical functions for public safety and climate monitoring.

Institutional inertia also plays a strong role: federal agencies like NOAA, with extensive responsibilities and integration into national infrastructure (such as hurricane and severe weather forecasting), are logistically challenging to restructure quickly. Such a transformation would likely require complex administrative procedures or even legislative action—very difficult tasks to complete within the roughly six weeks remaining before the July 1 deadline. Public warnings from scientists about risks to safety and the political costs of disrupting NOAA’s services further diminish the likelihood of a rapid, wholesale breakup.

While the trajectory of ongoing cuts and operational changes signals movement toward Project 2025’s goals, the fundamental restructuring required to consider the agency “broken up” is highly unlikely to be accomplished so soon. The most probable outcome is that the tracker will continue to list this objective as “in progress,” as the status quo is reinforced by bureaucratic opposition, the scale and complexity of NOAA’s operations, and the limited time available for such a dramatic change.
