Rationale:

The prospect of Yulia Navalnaya becoming president or prime minister of Russia faces significant challenges but is not entirely implausible given the long time horizon until 2100.

Currently, the status quo strongly favors a negative outcome. Navalnaya is in exile, unable to return to Russia while Putin or a similar authoritarian regime remains in power. The Russian political system is tightly controlled by Putin and his allies, with formidable barriers to opposition figures gaining power. The security apparatus effectively suppresses dissent, and even if Putin himself leaves office, the system he has built may persist.

However, the extended timeframe introduces considerable uncertainty and increases the possibility of major political changes in Russia. Historical precedents such as Corazon Aquino and Violeta Chamorro demonstrate that wives of opposition leaders can sometimes rise to power following significant political upheavals.

Navalnaya has explicitly stated her political ambitions and remains active in opposition activities. She has gained international recognition, engaged with world leaders, and is developing policy platforms. The launch of her TV channel "Future of Russia" showcases her ongoing efforts to influence Russian politics from exile. These factors could position her as a leader-in-waiting if circumstances in Russia change dramatically.

A scenario leading to Navalnaya's rise to power might involve a combination of internal pressures (such as economic difficulties or public dissatisfaction) and external factors (like international isolation or sanctions) causing the collapse of the current regime. In the resulting political upheaval, Navalnaya could return to Russia and leverage her late husband's legacy and her own political work in exile to emerge as a unifying figure.

Nevertheless, significant obstacles remain. Navalnaya's long absence from Russia could hinder her ability to build domestic support. Even if regime change occurs, there's no guarantee she would emerge as the leader among potentially competing opposition factions. The Russian state's control mechanisms are much stronger than those in the historical precedents mentioned.

While the probability of Navalnaya becoming Russia's leader increases over time, it remains low in the near term. The status quo is still the most likely outcome, but given the long time horizon and the potential for unexpected events to reshape Russian politics, a small but non-negligible probability exists for Navalnaya to assume a leadership position in Russia by 2100.
