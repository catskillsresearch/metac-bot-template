# Venezuela Civil War Risk Analysis: Looking Toward 2050

Venezuela is currently experiencing a profound multifaceted crisis characterized by political repression, economic collapse, and humanitarian disaster. The Maduro regime continues to consolidate power through increasingly authoritarian means, with recent elections widely condemned as fraudulent by international observers.

## Current State Assessment

The economic situation has deteriorated significantly in recent months. The US has revoked Chevron's license to operate in Venezuela, imposed a 25% tariff on Venezuelan oil imports, and is pursuing aggressive sanctions. These actions have triggered a new economic crisis reminiscent of the catastrophic 2019 situation, with the bolivar devaluing rapidly and GDP projected to contract by 2.5% in 2025.

Venezuela's humanitarian crisis continues to worsen:
- Roughly 8 million Venezuelans have left the country since 2014
- After the recent election, 43% of Venezuelans surveyed were considering leaving
- Extreme poverty affects approximately 86% of the population
- Severe shortages of vital resources such as food, medicine, and basic services persist

## Regime Stability Factors

**Factors strengthening regime resilience:**

1. External support from Russia, China, Cuba, and Iran provides economic lifelines and strategic backing
2. Military leadership remains largely loyal to Maduro, with disloyal elements purged
3. Extensive security apparatus including intelligence services, the National Guard, and loyalist civilian militias (colectivos) effectively suppress dissent
4. Opposition forces are fragmented, with some leaders co-opted and others forced into exile

**Factors undermining regime stability:**

1. Escalating economic crisis with renewed sanctions threatening to repeat the devastating 2019 situation
2. Massive outflow of migrants weakening the social fabric
3. Growing international isolation, with diplomatic pressure increasing
4. Widespread human rights violations, including arbitrary detentions, torture, and possible extrajudicial executions

## Armed Groups and Security Dynamics

Armed groups—including the National Liberation Army (ELN), the Patriotic Forces of National Liberation (FPLN), and groups that emerged after the demobilization of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC)—operate mostly in border states, brutally enforcing regulations governing everyday activities.

"Colectivos," criminal groups, and armed groups reportedly intimidated opposition candidates and voters during the electoral campaign, particularly in border and mining areas. However, these groups typically do not pose a direct challenge to state authority in a manner consistent with civil war dynamics.

## Civil War Risk Assessment

For Venezuela to experience civil war before 2050, several developments would likely need to occur:

1. **Military fragmentation**: Significant portions of the armed forces would need to defect with their weapons and organize resistance
2. **Territorial control by insurgents**: Opposition forces would need to secure and hold territory
3. **External recognition and support**: International actors would need to provide material support to opposition forces
4. **Escalation of violence**: Conflict intensity would need to reach levels recognized internationally as civil war

The most likely pathway to civil war would involve a severe economic shock combined with fracturing of military loyalty, potentially triggered by external factors such as intensified sanctions or regional conflict.

## Trend Analysis

Recent trends show increasing repression following the disputed elections, with thousands of arbitrary arrests carried out against political opponents, human rights defenders, and journalists. Detention conditions continue to deteriorate, and impunity prevails for human rights violations.

Economic indicators show a worsening situation, with renewed inflation and currency devaluation suggesting that the population's suffering will intensify, potentially increasing social unrest. However, the pattern thus far has been one of repression followed by adaptation rather than organized armed resistance.

## International Context

The international context significantly affects Venezuela's trajectory:
- U.S.-Venezuela relations have deteriorated, with renewed sanctions and diplomatic pressure
- Russia, China, Cuba, and Iran continue to provide strategic support to the Maduro regime
- Regional countries are concerned about stability but have limited leverage
- The disputed Essequibo region with Guyana represents a potential external conflict that could affect internal dynamics

## Long-term Outlook

Given the extended timeframe (until 2050), several factors must be considered:

1. The regime has demonstrated remarkable staying power through multiple crises, suggesting resilience against civil war triggers
2. However, sustained economic deterioration could eventually lead to fractures within the armed forces, particularly if officers' economic interests are severely impacted
3. The ongoing migration crisis serves as a safety valve, reducing internal pressure as millions choose exit over fight
4. Historical patterns suggest most regimes resembling Venezuela's persist for many years as authoritarian states rather than collapsing into civil war

Looking at historical patterns of civil war onset, Venezuela lacks critical factors like an organized insurgency with territorial control. The regime has been effective at preventing the opposition from militarizing, despite numerous challenges to its rule.

The most likely scenario remains continued authoritarian rule with periodic episodes of unrest that fall short of organized armed insurgency controlling territory. However, the extended timeframe introduces substantial uncertainty and provides ample opportunity for conditions to change dramatically.
