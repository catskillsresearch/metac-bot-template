India and Pakistan’s relationship since partition has been defined by repeated cycles of armed conflict, punctuated by four major wars—1947-48, 1965, 1971, and 1999—and frequent, sometimes deadly, border skirmishes. The disputed Kashmir region remains the chief flashpoint, with terrorist attacks in the area often serving as triggers for military escalation. The most recent significant incident, in May 2025, was precipitated by a terrorist attack in Indian-administered Kashmir. This led to a series of military actions by both sides—including airstrikes, missile exchanges, artillery fire, and downed aircraft—that resulted in at least 38 to 53 confirmed deaths, with some reports suggesting the toll may be even higher.

This recent pattern, in which a terrorist incident leads to rapid and deadly escalation, is consistent with previous crises and shows that, despite nuclear deterrence, both governments remain willing to engage in direct military action that causes significant casualties. Statements from senior officials after the May 2025 crisis underscore heightened risks: Pakistan’s military leadership noted a lowered threshold for escalation, warning that future confrontations may not remain limited to Kashmir and could involve both nations more broadly. Indian officials indicated that further military responses remain a distinct possibility should provocations occur.

Nuclear weapons on both sides act as a deterrent against full-scale war, but this has not prevented high-intensity, limited conventional conflicts or stopped the casualty toll from rising during crises. The two countries continue to invest in military readiness along their shared border while the lack of robust crisis-management mechanisms and mutual distrust increases the risk that a future incident could quickly spiral out of control. Leading up to 2025, international mediation—such as diplomatic interventions by the United States, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey—has occasionally succeeded in brokering ceasefires, but there is little evidence these efforts have addressed the underlying drivers of conflict or will always be effective in rapidly unfolding situations.

Historical precedent suggests that even in periods of relative calm, smaller armed incidents and border clashes are a regular feature of the relationship, with fatalities accumulating over time. Since January 2021, the cumulative death toll from direct military exchanges is already more than halfway to the 100-death threshold, and the long timeframe until 2050 provides ample opportunity for this figure to be surpassed—either through one moderate-to-major conflict or through the accumulation of casualties from recurring, smaller incidents. Core structural risks persist: territorial disputes (especially over Kashmir), terrorism, resource competition such as water rights, and domestic political incentives to respond forcibly to provocations.

Given these recurring patterns, the unresolved and volatile nature of the relationship, explicit warnings from military leaders about the increased likelihood and potential severity of future escalation, and the recent demonstration that significant casualties can occur in a matter of days, the probability that armed conflicts between India and Pakistan will result in at least 100 deaths before 2050 is substantial. This outcome appears likely unless there is an unprecedented, sustained shift toward peace and crisis management mechanisms that have not yet been observed in practice.
