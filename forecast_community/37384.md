# Trump's Immigration Approval Forecast Rationale for June 25, 2025

As we assess Donald Trump's likely net approval on immigration for June 25, 2025, according to the Silver Bulletin, the current landscape provides several key insights to consider.

## Current Approval Trends

The most recent high-quality polling data shows Trump's net approval on immigration hovering around neutral territory. The May 2025 Marquette Law School Poll found a net approval of exactly 0% (50% approve, 50% disapprove). This represents an improvement from more negative figures earlier in his term, with immigration emerging as one of Trump's "least bad topics" according to Silver Bulletin commentary, though still not a net positive.

Trump's overall job approval remains underwater, with the Silver Bulletin tracker showing figures between -5% and -8% as of late May 2025. While his overall numbers show a slight rebound in recent weeks, they remain in negative territory, with immigration performing relatively better than other policy areas.

## Policy Implementation and Public Response

Since taking office in January 2025, the Trump administration has aggressively implemented immigration policies that were central to his campaign promises. Through Executive Order 14160 on January 20, 2025, Trump sought to end birthright citizenship for children of undocumented immigrants. His administration has also:

- Declared a national emergency at the border, defining the situation as an "invasion"
- Expanded deportation efforts with a goal of removing one million immigrants annually
- Suspended refugee admissions
- Dismantled discretionary immigration pathways established under the previous administration
- Introduced measures to promote voluntary departure

These policies have created polarized reactions, contributing to the mixed approval ratings we currently observe.

## Near-Term Outlook

Looking at the 28-day window until June 25, several factors suggest Trump's net immigration approval will remain close to neutral:

1. **Trend Stability**: Public opinion tends to shift slowly in the absence of major shocks. The recent stabilization around neutral suggests this trend may continue.

2. **No Major Intervening Events**: No significant policy events or public controversies affecting immigration have emerged that would likely shift public opinion dramatically before June 25.

3. **Legislative Timeline**: While a comprehensive tax and immigration bill is being considered in the Senate, and the House has passed a proposed 3.5% tax on remittances, Senate action is not expected before late June or July.

4. **Ongoing Implementation**: The administration continues to implement its deportation policies and other immigration enforcement measures, but these are extensions of existing initiatives rather than dramatic new developments.

## Potential Scenarios for Significant Shifts

A substantial deviation from the current neutral trend would require a significant and sudden event, such as:

- A major immigration crisis or highly publicized border incident that dramatically shifts public opinion
- Passage or failure of pending immigration/tax legislation with strong public reaction
- A Supreme Court decision on birthright citizenship with immediate and widespread public response
- Implementation of the proposed remittance tax creating either backlash or support

Based on the current political landscape, none of these scenarios appears likely to materialize before June 25, 2025.

## Expected Outcome

Given the historical pattern of presidential approval ratings, the absence of anticipated major events, and the current stabilization around neutral territory, Trump's net approval on immigration according to the Silver Bulletin on June 25, 2025, will most likely remain between -2.0% and 0.0%. There is a meaningful but smaller chance it could register slightly positive (between 0% and 2%), while significant movement in either direction beyond these ranges appears unlikely without new, disruptive developments.
