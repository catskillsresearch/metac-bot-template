The average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage in the US as of late May 2025 stands at 6.86%, with daily and weekly data indicating a slight upward bias in recent weeks. Recent averages have fluctuated between 6.87% and 6.92%, suggesting that, if the current mild trend persists, rates could reach around 6.90%–6.92% by June 12, 2025.

Expert consensus places rates near 7% in the near term, with economic and policy commentary emphasizing several contributing factors: persistently high Treasury yields, ongoing inflation pressures, and unresolved concerns about US government debt and potential credit rating downgrades. Most prominent market observers—including mortgage bankers, realtors, and investment banks—are not anticipating a significant policy-driven decline in rates by mid-June. Forecasts for 2025 as a whole are somewhat lower, generally ranging from 6.4% to 6.8%, but these annualized projections do not capture the short-term volatility currently observed.

Underlying this cautious outlook is the recognition that, despite hopes for Federal Reserve rate cuts, no such moves are expected before June 12. The Fed’s current stance reflects continuing inflation and labor market considerations, making a near-term, surprise rate cut unlikely. On the other hand, the risk of upward shocks remains: a sudden spike in inflation data, new tariffs, or a financial market disturbance could push Treasury yields—and thus mortgage rates—above 7.1%. Conversely, only a substantial, unexpected improvement in inflation or a serious economic downturn would rapidly lower rates, and there is no current evidence of such catalysts.

While the central expectation is for rates to remain within a narrow band slightly below or around 7%, the possibility of volatility—driven by economic data releases or geopolitical surprises—demands a wide confidence interval. In sum, unless disrupted by unforeseen events, the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage average for June 12, 2025, is most likely to stay in the 6.85% to 6.92% range, reflecting the interplay of persistent economic uncertainty, stable-to-upward rate pressures, and cautious policy expectations.
