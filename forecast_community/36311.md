The size of the U.S. Supreme Court has remained at nine justices since 1869, reflecting a strong historical inertia that favors maintaining the status quo. This longstanding tradition is reinforced by significant procedural and political obstacles that make altering the Court's size a challenging endeavor. Currently, there is a notable lack of legislative momentum and active resistance to court expansion from both major political parties and the public. Efforts to pass legislation to increase the number of justices have consistently failed to gain sufficient support in Congress, and initiatives like the "Keep the Nine" constitutional amendment further solidify the status quo.

For a change in the size of the Supreme Court to occur, a significant political shift would be necessary. This could involve a change in the majority party in Congress or a major Supreme Court decision that galvanizes public and political support for court expansion. Such a shift could potentially lead to the successful passage of legislation to increase the number of justices, which would then need to be signed into law by the President. However, these political shocks are unpredictable and currently not visible in the political landscape.

Given these factors, the probability of the U.S. Supreme Court increasing in size before 2029 remains low. The combination of historical precedent, current political resistance, and the substantial procedural hurdles involved suggests that the status quo is likely to persist in the near future.
