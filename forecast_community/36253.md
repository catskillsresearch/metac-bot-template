(a) **Time left until outcome known:**  
The NATO summit is scheduled for June 24-26, 2025, so the final decision on the alliance’s new defense spending target will be public in about six weeks.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changes:**  
If no new agreement is reached, the default outcome is that the spending target remains at 2% of GDP (“2 or lower”).

(c) **Scenario for an unexpected outcome:**  
An unexpected outcome could result if there is a last-minute geopolitical shock (such as a major escalation in Ukraine or a sudden economic downturn in Europe), which causes key allies to balk at any increase and insist on maintaining the 2% target, perhaps with some vague non-binding language about “aspiring” to higher spending. Alternatively, intense US pressure or a new Russian provocation could push consensus toward adopting the full 5% target as a hard requirement, though this is unlikely given the significant resistance and practical constraints among member states.

## Rationale

- **Status quo bias:** The world often changes incrementally, so while a significant shift in NATO defense targets is widely discussed, inertia and practical/financial constraints, especially among southern and western European members, mean that a dramatic leap is always a moderate risk.
- **Momentum for an increase:** Over 22 countries already meet or exceed the 2% target, and most major allies publicly acknowledge that 2% is insufficient in the current security context. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte has strongly argued that spending must go substantially higher, and European leaders are now openly discussing figures "considerably more than 3%"[5][2].
- **Leading options under discussion:**  
  - There is strong momentum behind a dual-tier structure: 3.5% of GDP for “traditional” defense spending (tanks, planes, missiles, personnel) and an additional 1.5% for “broader security-related spending” (infrastructure, cyber, resilience), totaling a notional 5% by 2032. Numerous authoritative news agencies, official statements, and diplomatic sources confirm this structure is the focus of current negotiations[1][2][5].
  - However, as of mid-May 2025, consensus remains elusive, with diplomat sources noting “very wide gaps to bridge,” especially over the 1.5% “flexible” portion and pushback from states still struggling to meet 2%[1][4].

- **Most likely compromise:**  
  - The best-supported scenario is that NATO agrees to a new minimum spending floor of 3.5% of GDP by 2032, structured as 3.5% for core defense, with the 5% figure presented as a long-term ambition or as a “soft” goal[4][5][2]. This matches both the middle ground offered by Rutte and the boundary of what several member states suggest is achievable.
  - If a range is set (e.g., “3.5–5% by 2032”), the lower end (3.5%) will be the resolution per the question’s rules.
- **Lower figures (2.5% or 3%)** could emerge if negotiations stall and a lowest-common-denominator position is necessary to maintain unity, but this is less likely given the political capital expended by the Secretary General and the need to appease US demands.
- **Full 5% outcome:** Formally adopting the 5% as a hard near-term target is very unlikely, but could occur if the US applies extraordinary pressure and European security fears sharply escalate—even then, it would probably be watered down by long phase-in periods and flexible definitions[2][1].

## Probability Assignment

- **2 or lower:** There is significant pressure to move upward, but the chance of deadlock, major economic crisis, or procedural delays persists. Assign 12%.
- **2.5:** There is little evidence of serious support for this figure as a new floor; it has been mentioned in past planning but not recent negotiations. Assign 3%.
- **3:** Some countries would prefer 3%, and there is a legacy of this being a plausible “stretch” target, but current momentum is for “considerably more than 3%”[5]. Assign 20%.
- **3.5:** This is the most widely cited compromise, supported by both Rutte’s proposal and multiple government statements; it fits the middle ground between the US (5%) and Europe (reluctance beyond 3%). Assign 50%.
- **4:** There is little public discussion of a 4% target; if compromise breaks down between 3.5% and 5%, it could be a fallback, but it is not a focus in negotiations. Assign 5%.
- **5:** The US is pressing for 5%, but major member states view it as unachievable in practical terms; it’s most likely to be adopted as an aspirational or long-term goal, not as the immediate floor. Assign 10%.
