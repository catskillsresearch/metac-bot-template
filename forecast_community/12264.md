There are roughly nine and a half years until the 2035 deadline, and while rapid advances in genome sequencing, gene editing, and cellular engineering have generated excitement, no live thylacine has yet been produced that survives beyond early infancy. Research has achieved important milestones in decoding the species’ genome and even in initiating aspects of cellular reprogramming, but significant hurdles remain. Among these are the challenges of marsupial cloning, the creation and gestation of a viable embryo, and the attainment of sustained postnatal survival. Historically, de‐extinction and similar biotechnological projects have seen slow, incremental progress rather than sudden breakthroughs, as unexpected regulatory, biological, or technical obstacles have repeatedly slowed or derailed efforts.

That said, the potential for a transformative discovery in gene‐editing or in the specialized reproductive technologies required for a marsupial cannot be entirely discounted. If such an unforeseen breakthrough were to occur, it could spur a rapid transition from promising laboratory results to the production of a live, sustained thylacine. However, given the weight of past experience and the inherent complexity of recreating an extinct species, the balance of evidence favors the persistence of existing technical challenges through the deadline.
