# Community Water Fluoridation Recommendation: Status and Potential Changes by July 1, 2025

As of May 20, 2025, the CDC continues to recommend 0.7 mg/L as the optimal level for fluoride in community water supplies. This recommendation has been in place since 2015 and is currently published on the CDC's official website. If no changes occur by July 1, 2025 (41 days from now), this recommendation will remain the official guidance.

## Current Status and Recent Developments

The CDC's longstanding recommendation of 0.7 mg/L fluoride is supported by dental and public health organizations, including the American Dental Association (ADA), which recently reaffirmed that "eighty years of community water fluoridation at optimal levels has proven to be safe and effective at reducing tooth decay to improve oral health". The ADA continues to advocate for fluoridated water and cited an Australian study finding that fluoridation at current recommended levels "had no measurable effect on cognitive neurodevelopment or IQ scores in children".

However, this recommendation now faces unprecedented pressure for change:

- On April 8, 2025, HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. publicly announced his intention to direct the CDC to stop recommending the addition of fluoride in public drinking water.
- The Department of Health and Human Services is reconvening an expert panel to review the evidence and potentially make a new recommendation.
- The EPA announced it will "expeditiously review new science on fluoride in drinking water," particularly focusing on recent studies linking fluoride to low IQ in children.
- States such as Utah and Florida have recently banned water fluoridation, signaling heightened political momentum for change.

## Timeline and Implementation Considerations

The key question is whether these announced policy changes will be implemented before July 1, 2025. Several factors are relevant:

- Kennedy's announcement was made in early April 2025, providing approximately 3 months for implementation before the July deadline.
- The newly introduced bill mandates that "beginning in 2025, and every three years thereafter, fluoride levels shall be adjusted in accordance with any updated guidelines".
- The EPA's review is being conducted alongside Secretary Kennedy and DHHS, suggesting coordination and potential acceleration of the process.

## Barriers to Rapid Change

Despite the clear political momentum, changing a longstanding federal public health recommendation involves several administrative hurdles:

- Federal agencies typically move slowly, especially for established public health guidelines.
- The process requires convening panels, reviewing evidence, stakeholder consultation, drafting and reviewing new policies, and updating public communications.
- There may be internal resistance or procedural delays, especially given the strong support from professional bodies like the ADA.
- The CDC's fluoridation recommendation is widely used and integrated into public health infrastructure nationwide.

## Critical Factors Affecting the Timeline

There are several paths to a change in recommendation by July 1:

1. The CDC could simply remove its recommendation page without replacement (fastest option).
2. The CDC could quickly issue a revised recommendation below 0.7 mg/L.
3. The agency could formally end its support for community water fluoridation entirely.

The simplest administrative action—removing or changing the recommendation—could potentially be completed within the 41-day timeframe, especially with explicit direction from the HHS Secretary who has direct authority over the CDC.

## Weighing the Evidence

The status quo typically has strong inertia in government policy, but several unusual factors suggest a higher probability of change:

1. The explicit directive comes from the cabinet secretary with direct authority over the CDC.
2. The EPA is simultaneously reviewing the scientific evidence on fluoride safety.
3. There is clear political momentum with states already implementing similar policies.
4. The announcement was made over 40 days ago, giving agencies time to prepare for changes.

However, bureaucratic processes do move slowly, and the CDC has not yet updated its recommendation as of May 20, 2025. The agency's webpage was recently updated on May 15, 2025, and still maintains the 0.7 mg/L recommendation, suggesting no immediate changes have been implemented despite the Secretary's announcement more than a month ago.

Given these competing factors, while change is clearly coming to the CDC's fluoride recommendation, the probability that it will occur before July 1, 2025, must be carefully weighed against the typical timeline for federal public health guidance revisions.
