Taiwan's approach to the question of a formal independence declaration by 2035 is shaped by a combination of longstanding domestic consensus, powerful external deterrents, and evolving international dynamics. The island currently exists as a de facto sovereign nation, governed by the principle of "substantive independence, status quo maintenance"—a policy firmly supported by the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and embraced across Taiwan’s major political spectrum. Taiwan’s leadership has repeatedly asserted that the country is already independent in practice and sees no immediate necessity for a formal declaration, a stance that resonates with the prevailing public sentiment, which consistently favors the status quo over risky constitutional changes.

China maintains an explicit "red line" regarding any formal move toward Taiwanese independence, routinely issuing severe warnings and investing heavily in military modernization. The People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has dramatically increased its readiness and capabilities, with substantial growth in defense spending and regular military exercises in the Taiwan Strait explicitly aimed at deterring separatist actions. These military signals are coupled with diplomatic and economic coercion, all designed to make a formal independence declaration prohibitively risky for Taiwan.

At the same time, the United States has subtly recalibrated its policy language, notably removing its former explicit opposition to Taiwanese independence in official statements as of early 2025. Washington now emphasizes opposition to unilateral changes to the status quo and calls for peaceful, uncoerced resolutions, while maintaining a posture of strategic ambiguity. Although this shift provides Taiwan with a bit more diplomatic space, it does not equate to a guarantee of military protection should Taiwan cross China’s red line.

Economic factors further reinforce inertia: Taiwan’s economy is deeply integrated with that of China, and both domestic political actors and ordinary citizens are acutely aware that a formal declaration could trigger catastrophic disruptions. Internationally, Taiwan’s recognition remains limited, with only a small number of UN member states maintaining formal diplomatic ties. This reality curtails the practical benefits of a formal declaration while amplifying the risks.

Although the possibility of a declaration cannot be ruled out—especially if prompted by dramatic changes such as a sharp escalation in Chinese aggression, a surge in Taiwanese pro-independence sentiment, or major shifts in U.S. security commitments—each prerequisite scenario faces formidable obstacles. Historical public opinion data show a steady increase in support for "maintaining the status quo" and a decline in advocacy for "independence as soon as possible". Without clear, decisive catalysts—such as an existential threat perceived by Taiwan, a collapse of deterrence, or a transformative global realignment—the incentives for both Taiwan’s leadership and its key international partners align strongly with preserving the current ambiguous arrangement.

In summary, Taiwan’s policy of avoiding a formal independence declaration is underpinned by domestic consensus, effective Chinese deterrence, U.S. strategic ambiguity, economic pragmatism, and a global preference for stability. The preservation of de facto independence, rather than a formal declaration, remains the overwhelmingly probable outcome given present trajectories.
