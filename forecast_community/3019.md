The number of small firearms per capita in the US in 2029 will likely be influenced by several key factors. Based on current trends, the ratio could reach approximately 1.43 firearms per person if the annual growth rate of 1.5% continues. However, this projection is subject to various uncertainties and potential shifts in the political and social landscape.

Experts and market reports generally anticipate continued growth in civilian firearm ownership, albeit potentially at a slower pace than in recent years. This expectation is supported by ongoing growth in the small arms and ammunition markets.

Several scenarios could significantly impact this projection. On the lower end, a major shift in gun control legislation at the federal level, combined with large-scale buyback programs and changing cultural attitudes towards gun ownership, could lead to a substantial reduction in firearms per capita. This might involve strict new federal gun control laws and widespread voluntary surrenders of firearms.

Conversely, a high-end scenario could involve escalating social unrest, increased fear of crime, or a period of severe civil unrest. Such conditions, coupled with a loosening of gun regulations or restrictions on certain types of firearms, could trigger a surge in firearm purchases across all demographics. This could potentially push the ratio much higher than current projections.

It's important to note that the outcome could also be influenced by factors such as economic conditions, technological advancements in firearm manufacturing, changes in hunting and sport shooting trends, and shifts in public perception of personal safety and self-defense needs.

Given these considerations, the firearms per capita ratio in the US by 2029 could range from a significant decrease to a substantial increase compared to current levels, with a wide range of possible outcomes in between.
