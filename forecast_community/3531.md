The scientific consensus and historical data strongly suggest that Betelgeuse is not expected to explode imminently, with estimates indicating that a supernova event is not likely for at least tens of thousands of years. Recent dimming events observed in Betelgeuse have been attributed to non-terminal causes such as circumstellar dust or starspots, rather than processes indicating an imminent supernova. The inherent uncertainty in predicting supernovae, combined with the slow nature of stellar evolution, supports the view that the probability of Betelgeuse going supernova before 2030 is extremely low. While unforeseen developments could theoretically occur, such as rapid changes in Betelgeuse's core leading to a supernova, these scenarios are highly unlikely based on current understanding. Astronomers continue to monitor the star, but no new evidence has emerged to suggest that a supernova is imminent within the next few years. The status quo, where Betelgeuse does not explode, remains the most likely outcome given the lack of any significant changes in its observable characteristics.
