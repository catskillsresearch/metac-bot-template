Over the past two decades, U.S. counterterrorism efforts have continuously evolved, with significant investments in robust intelligence gathering, enhanced border and visa screening processes, and advanced technological systems that create a layered defense against large‐scale terrorist attacks. These systematic improvements—notably strengthened interagency cooperation and international intelligence sharing—have consistently identified and disrupted plots long before they could escalate, contributing to a track record of averting attacks comparable to 9/11.

The current posture largely benefits from steady, incremental enhancements and a mature security infrastructure established after 2001. This continuity has allowed the United States to adapt to emerging threats, such as new exploitations in border security or cyber vulnerabilities, and to learn valuable lessons from near-miss incidents. The ongoing refinement of these measures has created an environment where any potential threat is met with a coordinated and technology‐informed response.

However, significant risk factors remain. Should political decisions lead to reduced funding or a rollback of critical counterterrorism programs, gaps could emerge. Likewise, if terrorist organizations develop novel tactics—possibly exploiting weaknesses in visa tracking or combining cyber and physical methods—there exists a possibility that these vulnerabilities might be exploited before defensive measures can adapt. In such scenarios, an orchestrated and novel approach by determined adversaries could, in theory, create a path for an attack with casualties on the scale of 9/11.

Overall, given the considerable improvements made over the past two decades and the tendency for security enhancements to evolve gradually, the current robust and adaptive defense system is expected to continue to preempt major terrorist plots. The balance between the continually refined status quo and the potential for emerging challenges underscores the importance of sustained investments and vigilance in maintaining a comprehensive counterterrorism posture through 2030.
