Rationale:

Oral semaglutide shows strong potential for approval as an obesity treatment by the FDA or EMA before 2027. Several factors support this likelihood:

1. Advanced Regulatory Process: Novo Nordisk has submitted a New Drug Application (NDA) to the FDA for oral semaglutide 25mg, with an expected decision in Q4 2025. This timeline provides ample opportunity for approval well before the 2027 deadline.

2. Compelling Efficacy Data: The OASIS 4 trial demonstrated significant weight loss efficacy, with patients losing an average of 15.1% body weight over 68 weeks. This robust data strengthens the case for approval.

3. Established Safety Profile: Oral semaglutide (Rybelsus) is already approved for diabetes treatment, and injectable semaglutide (Wegovy) is approved for obesity. This existing safety data reduces the likelihood of unexpected safety concerns arising during the review process.

4. Market Demand and Medical Need: There is a clear unmet need for effective oral obesity treatments, which could expedite the approval process given the public health implications.

5. Regulatory Precedent: The FDA and EMA have shown openness to new obesity treatments, recognizing the significant public health impact of the condition.

While approval seems likely, potential hurdles must be considered:

1. Regulatory Unpredictability: Despite positive indicators, the approval process can be complex and subject to unforeseen delays or requests for additional data.

2. Manufacturing and Supply Chain Issues: As seen with injectable semaglutide, production challenges could potentially delay the launch even if approval is granted.

3. Long-term Safety Considerations: Regulators may require additional long-term safety data for oral administration in obesity treatment.

4. Competitive Landscape: The evolving market for obesity treatments could influence the regulatory approach.

Given the advanced stage of the approval process, positive trial results, and the established use of semaglutide in other forms, approval by at least one regulatory body (FDA or EMA) before 2027 appears highly likely. The FDA's expected decision in Q4 2025 provides a significant buffer for potential delays while still meeting the 2027 deadline. Additionally, EMA typically follows FDA decisions closely, suggesting that FDA approval would likely lead to EMA approval well before 2027.

While maintaining a degree of caution due to the inherent unpredictability of regulatory processes, the strong positive indicators and the extended timeline until 2027 support a high probability of approval.
