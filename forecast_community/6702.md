The legal and procedural framework for a reunification referendum in Northern Ireland stipulates that a "border poll" can only be called by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland if it appears likely that a majority would vote in favor of reunification. This requirement is deliberately subjective, with no precise threshold defined in law, leaving significant discretion to the Secretary of State. 

Currently, support for Irish reunification in Northern Ireland is indeed rising—climbing from 27% in 2022 to 34% by early 2025—while support for remaining in the UK has declined slightly, from 50% to 48% over the same period. Projections based on these trends suggest that parity between pro-unity and pro-union positions could be reached around 2027, and pro-unity may potentially outpace the status quo by 2028 if current shifts continue. However, this growth remains gradual, and as of mid-2025, a clear pro-reunification majority does not yet exist, and no official poll is scheduled or in active preparation.

Key upcoming events—including Northern Ireland Assembly elections in 2027, local government elections in 2028, and a likely Westminster election in 2029—are seen as potential inflection points. Strong nationalist outcomes in these elections could accelerate political momentum and public support for a referendum. Nonetheless, the UK government and current Irish leadership are not prioritizing a poll before 2030, emphasizing stability, reconciliation, and cross-border cooperation instead. Notably, even leading pro-unity organizations such as Ireland’s Future are structuring their campaigns and proposals around a 2030 target for a referendum, acknowledging the need for prolonged public engagement, preparation, and official groundwork.

A range of factors could still accelerate the timeline. These include major political or economic shocks, such as post-Brexit disruptions, a collapse of power-sharing in Northern Ireland, dramatic changes in voter attitudes, or unexpected election results. Such events could create both political and civic pressure that might prompt the Secretary of State to act sooner than currently anticipated. Additionally, shifting attitudes among unionists—particularly the increasing openness to considering a border poll—suggest that political landscapes remain capable of rapid change.

That said, the default scenario remains one of institutional inertia and cautious policymaking, characteristic of previous constitutional decision-making in Northern Ireland. The bar for calling a border poll is high, and all available evidence as of 2025 points to the likelihood that no referendum will occur before 2030 unless there is a clear, sustained, and rapid shift in public sentiment and the political environment in the remaining years of the decade. The timing of elections late in the decade further complicates the organization and execution of a referendum within the specified window.

In summary, while support for reunification is advancing and the groundwork for a future referendum is being laid, the combination of slow-moving trends, political caution, and legal subjectivity makes a pre-2030 referendum possible but unlikely under current trajectories. The situation remains dynamic, with major shocks or decisive electoral outcomes representing the most plausible catalysts for any acceleration of the process.
