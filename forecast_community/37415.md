Kalshi is actively offering daily prediction markets on Major League Baseball (MLB) games and has displayed a strong commitment to expanding its sports offerings, particularly during the summer months when MLB serves as a core component of daily sports markets. The company operates in a broad swath of the U.S. (44 states as of late May 2025), and even amid regulatory scrutiny—including a Nevada cease-and-desist order and public pressure from Major League Baseball and various state regulators—Kalshi has responded by enhancing user protections and compliance measures rather than withdrawing or pausing its MLB contracts. These new guardrails, such as a Customer Protection Hub and partnership with Integrity Compliance 360, supplement the platform’s stated long-term strategy and reflect its commitment to maintaining operations in the face of outside pressures.

Despite this resilience, regulatory and legal risk remain the most significant threats to uninterrupted daily MLB market offerings. The regulatory environment is fluid: the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) remains under lobbying pressure from MLB to clamp down further on sports event contracts, and pending legal actions create the possibility of an abrupt order halting or restricting sports markets. However, as of the most recent reporting, there is no concrete evidence of an imminent regulatory shutdown or operational pause for June 2025.

Kalshi’s public communications reinforce its intent to maintain daily event coverage, especially for marquee sports like baseball, and no reduction in market coverage has been signaled. Although there are inherent business risks—such as the possibility of low trading volumes in summer or unforeseen technical issues—these are less likely scenarios given the company’s resources, technical track record, and the consistent pattern of offering daily markets across major sports seasons.

Given that sudden regulatory interventions are typically telegraphed and changes within large regulated platforms tend to happen gradually, the weight of evidence points to continued daily MLB market availability barring an unanticipated legal or operational shock. Maintaining the status quo is the path of least resistance, particularly over a relatively short period, and the last month of Kalshi operations demonstrates resilience and adaptability under pressure.

In summary, Kalshi’s operational momentum, consistent expansion of sports contracts, robust compliance posture, and lack of credible signals of imminent market withdrawal make it most likely that the platform will offer markets on daily baseball games every day in June 2025. However, this outlook remains contingent on the absence of a sudden, adverse regulatory or legal intervention, which, while possible, is not currently forecasted to occur.
