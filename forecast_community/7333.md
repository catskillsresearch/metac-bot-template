# Assessing the Likelihood of a Full Year Without US Stock Exchanges by 2120

The probability of a full year with no open stock exchanges in the US by 2120 requires careful consideration of historical patterns, market resilience, potential disruptions, and long-term technological evolution over the next 95 years.

## Historical Resilience of US Markets

US stock markets have demonstrated remarkable durability throughout their history. Since the founding of the New York Stock Exchange in 1817, markets have operated almost continuously for over 200 years. The longest closure on record was approximately four months during World War I in 1914, which still falls significantly short of a full year. Other notable but brief closures include one week following Lincoln's assassination, ten days during the Panic of 1873, five days after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, and two days during Hurricane Sandy.

Even during extreme events like the Great Depression, multiple wars, and the COVID-19 pandemic, US markets remained operational, sometimes with temporary trading halts but never approaching a full-year closure. This historical pattern strongly suggests that markets have a powerful institutional momentum toward maintaining operations.

## Technological Evolution and Increasing Resilience

Market infrastructure has evolved significantly toward greater resilience over time. The transition to electronic and remote trading capabilities has dramatically decreased vulnerability to localized disasters or physical threats. Current market infrastructure includes:

- Distributed systems across multiple geographic locations
- Backup power systems and redundant data centers
- Remote access capabilities for market participants
- Extensive contingency planning for various disaster scenarios

The digitization of markets has made them significantly less vulnerable to physical disruptions compared to previous eras when trading floors were essential. This trend will likely continue, with markets becoming even more distributed and automated, further reducing the probability of extended closures.

Recent evidence of this resilience is visible in market adaptations to various challenges. In May-June 2025, markets continued to function despite US-China trade tensions, with the S&P 500 rallying 3.3% following announcements of a trade truce. RBC Capital Markets analysis shows ongoing forward-looking planning with potential S&P 500 year-end targets between 5,700-5,900, demonstrating expected market continuity despite short-term fluctuations.

## Potential Scenarios for Extended Market Closure

While extremely unlikely, several scenarios could theoretically lead to a full-year closure:

**Catastrophic Global Events:**
- Global-scale nuclear conflict disrupting all market infrastructure
- Unprecedented cyberwarfare targeting and disabling all financial systems
- Worldwide economic collapse leading to abandonment of current market structures

**Fundamental Transformations:**
- Complete overhaul of the global financial system rendering traditional exchanges obsolete
- Radical political change leading to elimination of public equity markets
- Technological paradigm shifts making current forms of public stock markets obsolete

**Regulatory/Political Scenarios:**
- Government-mandated closure during extreme financial crisis
- International sanctions or conflicts disrupting the entire US financial system

However, even these extreme scenarios would need to persist for a full year and simultaneously affect all US exchangesâ€”an extraordinarily high threshold given the distributed nature of modern market infrastructure.

## Long-Term Uncertainty and Black Swan Events

The lengthy 95-year time horizon introduces substantial uncertainty. Technological changes could fundamentally alter market structures, geopolitical developments over such a long period are unpredictable, and the possibility of "black swan" events increases over longer time frames.

Nevertheless, the strong historical precedent of market resilience, the increasing technological robustness of market infrastructure, the economic importance of continuous market operation, and the presence of multiple redundant market systems all suggest that the probability of a full year without any open US stock exchanges by 2120 remains extremely low.

The most plausible scenarios leading to year-long market closures would require truly catastrophic, civilization-threatening events. While these cannot be ruled out entirely over a 95-year timeframe, they remain highly improbable based on all available evidence and historical patterns.
