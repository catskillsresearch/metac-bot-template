Countries with a median age above 30 tend to exhibit mature political institutions, robust economies, and state capacity that historically serve as stabilizers over long periods. In these settings, gradual demographic shifts, incremental socioeconomic changes, and established conflict‐management mechanisms typically forestall the large-scale mobilization that can lead to civil wars. Even when pressures such as economic inequality, political polarization, or resource stress from climate impacts emerge, they have generally been managed through gradual reforms rather than erupting into severe upheaval. Only in scenarios where multiple extreme shocks converge—such as a sudden and deep economic collapse, drastic environmental stress, or rapid and radical political disintegration—would even these stable systems risk fracturing into internal conflict. Overall, the combination of demographic maturity and strong institutional resilience suggests that while unexpected systemic disruptions could theoretically trigger a civil war, the prevailing trend is toward relative stability.
