# Nuclear Weapons Yield Assessment: Prospects for >30 MT Weapons by 2030

The prospect of any country possessing nuclear weapons with yields above 30 megatons (MT) by 2030 must be evaluated against historical trends, current arsenals, and strategic developments in nuclear weapons programs worldwide.

## Historical Context and Current Status

The era of extremely high-yield nuclear weapons peaked during the Cold War, with the Soviet Union's Tsar Bomba test in 1961 producing a yield of approximately 50-58 megatons. Since then, global nuclear weapons development has shifted decisively toward smaller, more accurate warheads rather than massive yields.

Currently, no country maintains nuclear weapons with yields above 30 MT in their active arsenals. The largest yield weapon in the U.S. arsenal is the B83-1 gravity bomb with a yield of 1.2 megatons, which is significantly below the 30 MT threshold. After the planned retirement of the B83, the most powerful weapon in the U.S. arsenal will be the W88 SLBM warhead, with an explosive yield of 455 kilotons.

## Technical and Strategic Considerations

Several factors make the development of >30 MT weapons unlikely:

1. **Limited Strategic Utility**: Modern precision guidance systems have reduced the need for extremely high yields. Multiple smaller warheads provide more flexibility and effectiveness than single large ones.

2. **Current Nuclear Doctrine**: Nuclear powers have moved toward "dial-a-yield" weapons that commanders can set to various force levels rather than fixed high-yield weapons. Even the B61-13, a new U.S. gravity bomb, will have a maximum yield of 360 kilotons, far below the 30 MT threshold.

3. **Physical Constraints**: Weapons with yields above 30 MT present significant engineering challenges for delivery systems due to their size and weight.

4. **Environmental Concerns**: The environmental consequences of testing such weapons make their development politically problematic.

## Potential Candidates for >30 MT Weapons

### Russia

Russia maintains the world's largest nuclear arsenal and represents the most likely candidate to develop a weapon exceeding 30 MT by 2030. The primary candidate would be Russia's Poseidon/Status-6 underwater nuclear drone, which has been publicly acknowledged and is reportedly under development. Some Russian sources have claimed it could carry a multi-megaton warhead designed to create radioactive tsunamis against coastal targets.

However, there is significant uncertainty about the actual yield of the Poseidon's warhead, and no credible sources have confirmed it would exceed 30 MT. For this scenario to materialize, Russia would need to successfully develop and deploy this system with a confirmed yield exceeding 30 MT by 2030.

### China

China is rapidly expanding its nuclear arsenal, with projections indicating it will reach over 1,000 operational warheads by 2030, up from approximately 600 currently. According to intelligence reports, China is developing "a more diverse nuclear force, comprising systems including low-yield precision strike missiles and ICBMs with multi-megaton yields."

While this suggests China may be developing warheads in the multi-megaton range, there's no indication they're pursuing yields as high as 30+ MT. Their focus appears to be on having multiple options across the yield spectrum rather than pushing the upper boundaries of yield.

### Other Nuclear Powers

The United States, United Kingdom, France, India, Pakistan, North Korea, and Israel maintain arsenals with yields well below the 30 MT threshold, and none have indicated interest in developing such high-yield weapons.

## Resolution Criteria Considerations

For any country to be determined to have a nuclear weapon with a yield above 30 MT by 2030, at least two credible sources would need to confirm this capability without contestation from other credible sources. Given the classified nature of nuclear weapons programs and the tendency of governments to obscure details about their most advanced weapons, meeting these evidentiary standards would be challenging even if such a weapon were developed.

## Weighing the Evidence

The global trend has been moving away from extremely high-yield weapons for decades, with no country currently possessing such weapons in their active arsenals. There are significant technical challenges and limited strategic utility for weapons above 30 MT.

While Russia's Poseidon system is the most plausible candidate for a >30 MT weapon, there remains considerable uncertainty about its specifications and deployment timeline. China's nuclear expansion is significant, but there's no specific evidence suggesting pursuit of weapons exceeding 30 MT.

Given the status quo and recognizing that dramatic changes in nuclear posture typically evolve slowly, the continuation of current trends toward smaller, more accurate warheads appears most likely. However, we must account for the possibility that Russia's Poseidon system could meet the criteria within the timeframe, or that strategic competition could drive development of such weapons.

The likelihood of any country having a nuclear weapon with yield above 30 MT by 2030 is low, as the strategic and technical trends of the past several decades have moved away from such high-yield weapons. For this to occur, we would need to see a significant reversal of these long-standing trends in nuclear weapons development.
