Multiple institutional, geopolitical, and political factors shape the probability of the United States withdrawing from one of its current mutual defense treaties by 2030. The U.S. remains party to six major mutual defense agreements: the Rio Treaty, NATO, ANZUS, and bilateral treaties with the Philippines, South Korea, and Japan. Historically, these alliances have been pillars of U.S. strategy, rarely abandoned outright and generally reinforced during times of heightened threat.

The current international environment is characterized by rising challenges from Russia and China, which has, in recent years, led to the strengthening of defense partnerships in both Europe and the Indo-Pacific. U.S. commitments have been explicitly reaffirmed, and alliances such as NATO and Indo-Pacific treaties have seen increased activity, joint exercises, and resource prioritization, especially in response to crises like Russia’s aggression in Ukraine and China’s assertiveness in the South China Sea and around Taiwan.

Domestically, the Trump administration’s issuance of Executive Order 14199 in February 2025 marked a significant shift, mandating a comprehensive review of all U.S. international treaties, including mutual defense agreements, to determine if any are "contrary to the interests of the United States." Recommendations from this review are due by August 2025, raising the prospect—though not the inevitability—of formal withdrawal proceedings or de facto abandonment through a sustained suspension of support. In parallel, the FY2026 budget proposal recommended dramatic cuts to contributions for international organizations, sparking concern among allies about the future reliability of U.S. commitments.

Despite these signals, several entrenched factors strongly favor the continuation of existing mutual defense treaties:
- The strategic advantages these alliances provide—forward basing, intelligence sharing, and regional influence—are difficult and costly to replace.
- The treaties are deeply embedded in U.S. law and diplomatic practice, with complex legal processes and often Congressional involvement required for formal withdrawal.
- The U.S. defense establishment and Congress have historically resisted major shifts away from core alliances, and bipartisan consensus continues to recognize their strategic necessity.
- Allies themselves are increasing their defense spending and preparing for potential U.S. retrenchment, underscoring the enduring value of these partnerships.

While the ongoing treaty review and recent budget proposals introduce genuine uncertainty, the inertia of institutional and strategic interests, combined with the elevated threat environment, create substantial barriers to withdrawal. The most plausible scenarios for a U.S. exit would involve either a formal process initiated under the current executive review—potentially targeting less strategically vital agreements like the Rio Treaty—or a year-long suspension of support that amounts to de facto withdrawal. Yet, as of June 2025, there is no public evidence of completed or imminent withdrawal action.

In sum, while the risk environment for U.S. alliance commitments is more fluid than in the previous decade, especially given explicit executive signals and fiscal pressures, the strong pull of status quo bias, the absence of formal withdrawal processes to date, and the reinforcing pressures of global competition make a U.S. withdrawal before 2030 unlikely barring considerable and sustained domestic political upheaval.
