(a) **Time Left Until Outcome Known:**  
There are about 7.5 months remaining until the end of 2025. The question resolves based on any quarter from Q2 2023 through Q4 2025, so all relevant BLS data will be available in early 2026.

(b) **Status Quo Outcome if Nothing Changed:**  
If recent historical trends continue, the percentage of U.S. workers in white-collar jobs remains relatively stable or increases slightly, reflecting three decades of steady growth from about 59% (early 1990s) to 62.2% in 2022. There is no precedent for a rapid 2 percentage point drop within a short time frame; such a shift would be highly unusual[1].

(c) **Scenario Resulting in a NO Outcome:**  
The labor market continues its gradual post-pandemic normalization. Job growth slows modestly in white-collar sectors, but major losses or displacement do not materialize before 2026. Unemployment ticks up slightly as forecast, but white-collar employment remains well above 60%, consistent with very gradual past shifts[2][4].

(d) **Scenario Resulting in a YES Outcome:**  
A rapid, widespread adoption of AI or automation tools, combined with a severe economic downturn, triggers layoffs or reclassification in sales, office, professional, or management jobs. White-collar employment falls sharply—atypical given historical inertia—and dips at or below 60% in any single quarter before Q4 2025 ends. Such a scenario would likely require both an unusually fast technological disruption and recessionary conditions occurring together[1][4].

## Rationale

- **Historical data** shows remarkable stability and even gradual increase in white-collar job share over the last 30 years[1].  
- **Current forecasts** expect only moderate rises in unemployment and softening job growth, mostly concentrated outside core white-collar sectors[2][4].  
- **Job growth in 2024–2025** is expected to slow, especially in white-collar industries, but not collapse. Three-quarters of new jobs have been in other industries (health care, government, leisure/hospitality)[4], suggesting white-collar job share might stagnate or inch downward, but large sudden drops remain unlikely.
- **Community prediction markets** (Metaculus) give a low probability (7%) for the resolved event, reflecting the strong trend inertia and lack of major disruptive evidence so far[1].
- **AI and automation risk** is significant in theory, but as of mid-2025 there are no reports of massive, rapid displacement in these occupational groups. Economic shocks, if any, have not yet led to a large rebalancing between white- and blue-collar shares.

Given these points, the prudent approach is to put substantial weight on the status quo scenario, as large, rapid shifts in such aggregate employment shares are historically rare and no compelling data yet suggest such a break.

**Probability: 10%**
