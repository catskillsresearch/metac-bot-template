The current landscape of Effective Altruism (EA) funding is characterized by a significant concentration of resources, with Good Ventures/Open Philanthropy being the primary large-scale donor. As of now, there is no evidence of a new donor or foundation emerging in the EA space that matches the scale of Good Ventures' donations. The status quo outcome, if nothing changes, is a "No" outcome, as the existing EA-aligned organizations, while growing, do not reach the scale required to meet the criteria set by the question.

The possibility of a new donor emerging at this scale by 2026 is contingent upon several factors. A potential scenario for a "Yes" outcome could involve the emergence of a new ultra-wealthy individual or family who becomes interested in the EA movement and decides to make large-scale donations. This could be driven by a significant event or shift in public perception that draws attention to EA causes, prompting a new donor to contribute over $250 million (inflation-adjusted) in 2026. Such a donor might come from sectors like tech or finance, where rapid wealth accumulation is possible, and could be influenced by a shift in philanthropic focus or global events that highlight the importance of EA principles.

However, the current trends and historical patterns suggest a low probability of such a development. The EA community has seen growth in resources, but this has not translated into diversification among large-scale donors. The strict criteria for public disclosure and EA alignment further reduce the likelihood of a new donor meeting the requirements. Additionally, economic conditions or policy changes could deter potential large-scale donors from entering the space.

While the potential for unforeseen changes, such as new wealth creation or shifts in philanthropic interests, cannot be entirely ruled out, the absence of public commitments from potential new donors and the high bar for both donation size and EA alignment support a conservative estimate. Given the current information and historical trends, the emergence of a new donor on the scale of Good Ventures by 2026 remains unlikely.
