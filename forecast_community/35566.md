(a) **Time until outcome is known:**  
The Eurovision 2025 Grand Final is scheduled for 17 May 2025. As of 9 May 2025, there are 8 days remaining until the official winner is announced.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
Spain is not predicted to win—the consensus of leading predictors (bookmakers and expert previews) is that Spain is a long shot, with about a 1% implied probability of victory[1][5]. The status quo outcome is therefore "No" (Spain does not win).

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
If Spain performs as expected, "Esa Diva" by Melody places mid-table or lower, with the winner coming from among the favorites like Sweden or Finland, as predicted by bookmakers and experts[1][5]. The EBU officially declares another country as the winner, and Spain does not receive the highest combined jury and televote points.

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
Despite current low expectations, Melody delivers a standout live performance, captivating both juries and viewers across Europe. A combination of favorable running order, strong staging, and a weak showing from other favorites contributes to Spain unexpectedly topping the final points tally. The EBU officially declares Spain the Eurovision 2025 winner.

## Rationale

While Eurovision is known for some unpredictability, outcomes tend to align with bookmaker odds and expert consensus, especially in recent years. Spain's entry "Esa Diva" by Melody is widely viewed as a competent but not standout contender, and Spain's recent Eurovision track record has been mostly middling, with only one Top 3 finish (2022) in the past decade[5]. Current betting odds give Spain about a 1% chance to win, placing them far behind the main favorites such as Sweden and Finland[1][5]. No new developments or rule changes suggest a major shift in Spain's favor.

Unpredictable factors—such as a viral live performance or bloc voting swings—can always alter the result, but good forecasting gives extra weight to the status quo, as sudden leaps from outsider to winner are rare in recent Eurovision history. Given the convergence of expert previews, odds, and the lack of strong upward momentum for Spain's entry, the chance of a Spanish victory appears very slim.

**Probability: 1%**
