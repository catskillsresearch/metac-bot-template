# BP vs Shell: Comparative Performance Outlook for June-July 2025

Looking at the performance trajectory for BP and Shell through June-July 2025, several key factors will likely determine their relative share price performance. Currently, Shell holds a distinct advantage, having outperformed BP by approximately 7% year-to-date. This performance gap reflects fundamental differences in their financial health, strategic direction, and market perception.

## Financial Performance Disparities

Shell demonstrates considerably stronger financial metrics compared to BP:

- Shell reported Q1 2025 net income of $4.78 billion, significantly outperforming analyst expectations despite a 35% year-over-year decline
- BP's Q1 2025 profits dropped more dramatically by 49% to $1.38 billion, down from $2.72 billion in the previous year
- Shell maintains a robust share buyback program of $3.5 billion, marking its 14th consecutive quarter of significant repurchases
- BP has reduced its share buyback program to just $750 million
- BP's net debt has risen to nearly $27 billion, limiting its financial flexibility

The correlation between the two stocks is surprisingly low at 0.33, suggesting their price movements are not closely related despite operating in the same sector.

## Strategic Positioning and Market Perception

The companies are pursuing divergent strategies that are influencing investor sentiment:

- Shell is focusing on modest growth in upstream and integrated gas segments, targeting a 1% annual increase through 2030
- BP has undergone a substantial strategic overhaul, cutting investments in low-carbon initiatives by more than $5 billion annually while increasing oil and gas expenditure to $10 billion each year
- BP's strategy shift initially caused a decline in share prices, as it marked a departure from previous green energy commitments
- Shell's more balanced approach to the energy transition appears to be gaining more favorable analyst ratings and market perception

## Activist Influence on BP

In February 2025, activist hedge fund Elliott Management acquired a significant position in BP, pushing for strategic modifications:

- Elliott's involvement sparked a 6.5% increase in BP's stock price as investors anticipated a renewed focus on oil and gas production, similar to Shell's approach
- Their activism is advocating for strategic changes to enhance shareholder value
- BP has announced plans to divest $20 billion by 2027 and is conducting a comprehensive evaluation of its Castrol lubricants segment
- The company aims to lower its net debt to $14-18 billion by 2027, down from $23 billion in 2024

## External Market Factors

Both companies face similar industry headwinds that could impact their performance:

- OPEC+ production increases may put further pressure on oil prices
- Lower commodity price forecasts could affect sector sentiment
- Shell's more diversified upstream and integrated gas operations provide greater resilience in this challenging environment
- BP's higher debt levels make it more vulnerable to oil price volatility

## M&A Speculation

Recurring reports suggest Shell is considering acquiring BP. This introduces significant uncertainty:

- Acquisition speculation could temporarily boost BP's share price
- However, such a deal would likely be preceded by BP underperforming rather than outperforming Shell
- The timing and likelihood of such a transaction remain highly uncertain

## Probability of BP Outperforming Shell

The evidence strongly suggests Shell will maintain its performance advantage over BP during June-July 2025. While Elliott's activism creates potential upside for BP, the two-month timeframe is likely too short for meaningful operational improvements to materialize in superior share price performance. 

Shell's stronger financial metrics, more robust shareholder returns, and better strategic execution provide a solid foundation for continued outperformance. BP's higher debt levels, reduced buyback program, and negative earnings revisions create significant headwinds that will be challenging to overcome in this relatively short timeframe.

BP could potentially outperform Shell if a significant near-term catalyst emerges, such as rapid asset sales accelerating debt reduction, immediate concrete changes from Elliott's activism welcomed by the market, or unexpected positive regulatory approvals. Alternatively, a negative surprise at Shell could suppress its price, allowing BP to outperform despite modest gains.

Based on current trends and the fundamental performance gap between the companies, Shell appears much more likely to maintain its outperformance through June-July 2025.
