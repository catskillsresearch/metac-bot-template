(a) Time left until outcome: About 7 months (May 13, 2025 to December 31, 2025)
(b) Status quo outcome: Neither Polymarket nor Manifold can legally offer real-money betting in the US
(c) No outcome scenario: Continued state-level opposition blocks regulatory progress, with more states issuing cease-and-desist orders, and the CFTC maintains restrictive policies toward prediction markets not already approved
(d) Yes outcome scenario: A favorable court ruling extends Kalshi's precedent to other platforms, or the CFTC issues a no-action letter specifically addressing Polymarket or Manifold, allowing real-money operations in at least one state

The landscape for prediction markets in the United States is currently in a state of significant flux. Based on the available information, I can provide a comprehensive assessment of whether Polymarket or Manifold will become legal for real-money betting in the US in 2025.

## Current Regulatory Environment

The prediction market space has seen notable developments in recent years, particularly with Kalshi's legal victory against the CFTC in September 2024. This ruling allowed Kalshi to offer Congressional Control Contracts before the 2024 US elections, establishing an important precedent[1]. Following this victory, Kalshi expanded its offerings to include sports contracts in January 2025, indicating some regulatory flexibility at the federal level[1].

However, significant challenges remain at the state level, with at least six states—Illinois, Maryland, Montana, Nevada, New Jersey, and Ohio—having issued cease and desist letters directing prediction markets to stop offering their services[2]. These state regulators argue that prediction market activities resemble unauthorized sports wagering, while operators maintain their operations are legally sound under federal oversight by the CFTC[4].

## Recent Market Developments

Despite regulatory challenges, prediction markets have demonstrated significant market potential:

- Polymarket and Kalshi reportedly took in over $40 million in wagers on the papal conclave's outcome in May 2025
- Polymarket has been active in tracking recession odds, with over $5 million wagered on US recession probability bets
- The CFTC invited public comments on prediction markets offering sports contracts ahead of a roundtable discussion set for April 30, 2025, indicating ongoing regulatory consideration[5]

## Path to Legalization

For real-money betting on Polymarket or Manifold to become legal in the US in 2025, a specific change in law or government policy must occur. Several potential pathways exist:

1. **Federal Court Rulings**: The ongoing case between KalshEx and CFTC could establish precedent favorable to prediction markets[1]

2. **CFTC Regulatory Action**: The CFTC's planned prediction markets roundtable discussions may establish "clear rules of the road and safeguards" that could benefit platforms like Polymarket or Manifold[1]

3. **State-Level Authorization**: Despite federal-level developments, state-specific authorization would still be needed for full legality

## Factors Weighing Against Legalization

Several significant obstacles remain:

1. **Active State Opposition**: Multiple states have taken aggressive regulatory action against prediction markets, reflecting substantial regulatory resistance[2][4]

2. **Unresolved Litigation**: The core case between KalshEx and CFTC remains unresolved as of early 2025[1]

3. **Regulatory Classification Dispute**: Fundamental disagreement persists about whether prediction markets constitute gambling (state purview) or regulated commodity trading (federal purview)[4][5]

4. **Global Regulatory Concerns**: Polymarket has faced increasing international scrutiny, with Singapore, Thailand, and France implementing restrictions or blocks

## Forecasting the Outcome

The question requires a specific change in law or government policy for a "Yes" resolution. While there are positive signs in the evolving regulatory landscape, especially at the federal level, the persistent state-level opposition presents a significant barrier.

The most likely path to legalization would involve either:
- A federal court ruling that explicitly extends to platforms like Polymarket or Manifold
- A specific CFTC no-action letter addressing these platforms
- Individual state legislation carving out exceptions

Given the status quo bias and the need for specific policy changes rather than just risk acceptance by the platforms, I must weigh the significant state-level resistance against the momentum created by Kalshi's precedent and the CFTC's apparent openness to dialogue.
