(a) **Time left until resolution:**  
There are about 7.5 months until January 1, 2026, the deadline for this question.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
Boris Johnson is not the leader of the Conservative Party and is not a sitting MP. There are no signs of an imminent leadership challenge or his formal candidacy. The status quo outcome is **No**: Johnson does not return as leader by the deadline.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
The Conservative Party continues under the leadership of Kemi Badenoch or another successor; Johnson remains outside Parliament or does not pursue or win the party leadership before 2026. Political instability, while significant, does not result in his return.

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
A dramatic crisis or collapse in Conservative leadership (e.g., electoral wipeout or internal party revolt) prompts a renewed leadership contest. Johnson swiftly re-enters Parliament via a by-election and wins the party leadership, overcoming internal opposition and reputational baggage before January 1, 2026.

## Rationale

- **Party and Johnson's Position:**  
  Boris Johnson has not held the Conservative leadership since July 2022 and left the House of Commons in June 2023[4]. He did not contest the 2024 party leadership election and is not currently a sitting MP, which is a major barrier to leadership[1][4]. While technically possible for a non-MP to be elected leader, it is unprecedented and logistically challenging.

- **Recent Political Climate and Rumors:**  
  Conservative performance has been disastrous, and party polling continues to slide, with Reform UK overtaking the Conservatives as the preferred right-of-centre opposition among voters[2]. Multiple press reports cite Johnson's allies speculating about a comeback if Reform UK "self-destructs" within the next few years. However, even supportive sources and allies tend to frame this as a plan for after a future collapse or at the next general election, not as an immediate move before the 2026 deadline.

- **Johnson’s Own Words and Actions:**  
  Boris Johnson has publicly expressed support for Kemi Badenoch, the current Conservative leader, stating she "just needs time to get going" and urging her to "keep going". He has downplayed rumors of an imminent return, joking about the unlikelihood of his swift reinstatement. There are no reports of him actively campaigning for a parliamentary seat or organizing a leadership challenge as of May 2025.

- **Party Dynamics and Practical Hurdles:**  
  The Conservative Party is currently engaged in internal reviews and post-defeat soul-searching, but senior figures caution that swapping leaders again would be politically damaging and could make the party appear desperate. Additionally, even if the party pushed for Johnson's return, he would need to secure a parliamentary seat in the very limited time remaining before the deadline.

- **Forecasting Framework:**  
  The status quo tends to persist absent extraordinary events. While Johnson remains a figure of speculation and nostalgia among some party members and activists, there is no concrete movement, campaign, or process underway to reinstate him before January 2026. Political shocks do occur, but the hurdles—lack of a seat, intra-party divisions, bad optics, and public fatigue with Johnson's controversies—are substantial.

## Final Assessment

While Boris Johnson's name continues to circulate as a potential "saviour" for the Conservative Party's long-term future, the evidence as of May 2025 overwhelmingly supports a **No** outcome. There is no active leadership plot, he is not in Parliament, and even supportive commentary frames his potential return as a longer-term prospect, not a likelihood before January 2026.

**Probability: 3%**
