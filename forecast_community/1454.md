China's recent aggregate Freedom House scores have stabilized at 9 out of 100, reflecting one of the lowest levels of political rights and civil liberties worldwide—by far the lowest among major global economies. This score is based on entrenched authoritarian rule, characterized by the Chinese Communist Party's extensive control over the political system, legal environment, and virtually all forms of public expression. Repression of civil society, independent media, and dissent has been aggressively sustained, and the documented trajectory over the past decade is unmistakably negative: China’s score has fallen from the mid-teens to single digits, largely due to escalating crackdowns on civil society, religious groups, ethnic minorities, and online freedoms.

Current trendlines and expert consensus indicate little reason to anticipate substantive liberalization. The most plausible scenario is continued stagnation or marginal further decline—possibly to an aggregate score in the 7–9 range by 2028—since both political rights and civil liberties have approached their scoring floor under Freedom House’s criteria, and further deterioration would likely require extraordinary repression. Analysts and China scholars see virtually no prospect for meaningful reform or the relaxation of one-party control, with official state policy favoring ongoing restrictions and technological advancements facilitating deeper surveillance and control.

Unexpected scenarios remain possible but are judged extremely unlikely. A major internal crisis—such as a dramatic regime crackdown, the launch of even more pervasive surveillance, or severe new penalties for dissent—could force the score lower, potentially into the 2–5 range, though such changes would require a clear, severe shock to the status quo. Conversely, any abrupt upward movement in the score—resulting from democratization, legalization of opposition, substantial opening of the media, or restoration of civil society—would necessitate a historic and unprecedented transformation of China’s political system, an outcome that current trends and expert opinion strongly discount.

In sum, all indications point toward a persistently low Freedom House aggregate score for China in 2028, with a modest potential for further decline should repression intensify, and only extraordinarily unlikely scenarios leading to significant improvement.
