(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
There are just under eight months remaining until January 1, 2026, when the question will be resolved.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
If current trends persist—with ongoing gray zone tactics, increased military exercises, and heightened diplomatic pressure but no escalation to a full-scale invasion—the outcome will be No: China will not have invaded Taiwan by the end of 2025[1][2][5].

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
China maintains a campaign of military intimidation and coercion around Taiwan—such as air and naval drills, cyberattacks, and economic pressure—but does not deploy at least 1,000 PLA troops with the intent to seize the main island, nor is a full-scale invasion reported by major news agencies. Regional deterrence (involving the U.S. and allies) and domestic Chinese concerns about economic and social stability outweigh incentives for war[1][2][5].

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
A rapid escalation—triggered by an unexpected political crisis, an accident at sea or in the air, or a perception that a diplomatic window is closing—leads China to launch a full-scale military operation against Taiwan. The invasion is substantial enough that 1,000 or more PLA troops land on the main island, with the intention of asserting PRC sovereignty, as publicly reported by major outlets[3][4].

## Rationale

While the risk of conflict over Taiwan is frequently cited by military and policy analysts, the bulk of current expert and institutional analysis suggests a lower probability of an outright invasion in 2025. This is due to several factors:

- **China’s preference for gray zone tactics:** China is intensifying pressure through blockades, drills, cyberattacks, and economic means, without crossing into open war. Analysts view blockades or limited conflict as more probable than a high-risk amphibious assault[1][5].
- **Military and operational constraints:** Despite major military modernization, many in the defense analysis community believe issues with command quality, economic vulnerabilities, and social stability within China still make a large-scale invasion unattractive in 2025. The Chinese military will continue to build up capabilities into 2027 and beyond, suggesting that 2025 is not seen as a key decision point internally[2].
- **Domestic and international costs:** Invasion would likely provoke severe military, economic, and diplomatic backlash from the U.S., its allies, and global markets, producing unpredictably high risks for Xi Jinping’s regime[2][5].
- **Status quo bias:** Historically, major geopolitical actors avoid drastic moves unless forced by crisis. Continued escalation without invasion remains the most probable path, especially in light of recent but not unprecedented upticks in military signaling[1][2][5].

Scenarios for a rapid shift toward invasion cannot be completely discounted, especially in a volatile region. Some past analyses and voices (such as Gen. Minihan and retired General Orita) have suggested a window for war in 2025[3][4]. However, most current government and independent assessments in early- to mid-2025 point to a continuation of the status quo, with elevated pressure but not full-scale war[1][2][5].

## Final Probability

**Probability: 20%**

This estimate reflects a low but non-negligible chance—consistent with assessments that an outright invasion is possible but unlikely in 2025, with the status quo or limited conflict scenarios far more probable[1][2][5].
