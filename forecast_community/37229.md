Harvard University’s current Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) certification status is upheld, not by a final legal resolution, but by a federal court’s preliminary injunction that blocks the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) May 2025 revocation attempt while litigation continues. The injunction maintains Harvard’s ability to enroll international students; it was granted in light of the irreparable harm a sudden certification loss would pose to thousands of students and the university’s operations. This intervention reflects the court’s recognition that the case presents serious legal questions and significant stakes.

Preliminary injunctions in high-profile federal disputes like this are generally intended to preserve the status quo while the merits are thoroughly considered—a process that routinely extends for weeks or months. Courts are typically reluctant to swiftly reverse such orders absent extraordinary new developments, especially while the underlying litigation is active and unresolved.

DHS has opened an additional administrative review process to potentially enforce the revocation by another route, but such action would likely be subject to Harvard’s challenge and further judicial scrutiny. Historically, similar administrative actions against universities have triggered prolonged litigation and, when coupled with existing court orders, have rarely resulted in abrupt program terminations within a short window of time.

With just over a month until July 1, 2025, a rapid chain of events would be necessary for Harvard to lose SEVP certification: the preliminary injunction would need to be lifted, a government administrative action completed and enforced, and all subsequent legal appeals resolved against Harvard—an unlikely confluence given the complexity and pace of major federal litigation.

In summary, barring a highly unusual and expedited reversal by the courts or an unexpected administrative maneuver that survives immediate legal challenge, the structure and pace of federal court processes make it much more likely that Harvard’s SEVP certification will remain active through July 1, 2025. The university’s current operational status for international students is protected under the ongoing injunction, and the time remaining is far too short for the government’s pending actions to be definitively concluded and enforced absent extraordinary developments.
