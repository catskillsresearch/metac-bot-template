## Rationale for the Forecast: AI Autoformalization of Arbitrary Mathematical Proofs by 2030

AI systems have achieved rapid and impressive progress in mathematical reasoning and autoformalization, with hybrid models combining large language models (LLMs) and proof assistants now providing meaningful assistance to mathematicians on a range of problems. These approaches, supported by significant investment from academic, governmental, and industry initiatives—such as DARPA's expMath program—are successfully accelerating the formalization of mathematics and reducing barriers for practitioners in select domains.

However, the current state of the field reveals substantial limitations when it comes to the automatic formalization of arbitrary proofs from leading mathematics journals. Present systems perform well on structured or textbook-level problems, or within carefully curated datasets, but they remain well below the threshold required by the resolution criteria: robust, fully automated translation of random proofs from the mathematical literature into verification-ready formal code at a 90% success rate.

The principal technical barriers include:

- **Complexity and Diversity of Proofs**: Research-level proofs in top journals exhibit varied notational conventions, highly informal and context-dependent argumentation, frequent use of implicit assumptions, and creative reasoning steps. This diversity greatly exceeds the scope of existing training data and challenges the generalization capacity of present-day AI.
- **Informality and Implicit Reasoning**: Many proofs leave sub-arguments unspoken and rely on shared background knowledge among experts. Current AI struggles to fill these implicit gaps reliably or to translate highly informal human reasoning into symbolically precise, formalizable steps.
- **Robustness and Verification**: Even when AI-generated formalizations are syntactically plausible, they often fail the stringent standards of proof assistants; any error or omission typically results in failure rather than partial credit, further lowering autonomous formalization rates.
- **Transparency and Rigor**: There are growing concerns that AI-generated outputs may lack transparent, human-understandable reasoning. Without clear step-by-step explanations, even technically correct formalizations may undermine the culture of mathematical rigor and scrutiny.

While the trajectory is promising—owing to large-scale investments, explosive research output, and marked productivity gains from hybrid human-AI workflows—most leading mathematicians and AI researchers see near-term advances as continuing to augment, rather than automate, the hardest aspects of mathematical formalization. The prevailing expectation is that AI will increasingly democratize access and accelerate progress by making formal mathematics more accessible and by assisting with error checking, but the leap to fully autonomous, general-purpose formalization at the level and reliability specified remains highly challenging within this timeframe.

That said, the possibility of transformative breakthroughs cannot be discounted. The field is subject to rapid, unpredictable advances, particularly as latent reasoning and neuro-symbolic methods develop and as collective efforts focus on critical bottlenecks. A sudden leap—potentially yielding near-human or superhuman capabilities in formalization—remains conceivable, but would require overcoming entrenched difficulties in language understanding, context sensitivity, and creative logical inference.

In summary, although substantial progress in AI-assisted mathematics is highly likely and will reshape mathematical workflows, achieving robust, fully automated conversion of arbitrary top-journal proofs into verifiable symbolic form with at least 90% reliability before 2030 would require not just steady improvement, but a series of fundamental breakthroughs. The prudent expectation is continued dramatic augmentation of mathematical practice, with routine, universal automation remaining an aspirational goal amid ongoing research and development.
