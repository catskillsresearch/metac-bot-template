The Eurozone currently exhibits moderate but fragile economic growth, with GDP projections for 2025 hovering around 0.9–1.1% and anticipated improvement to 1.4–1.5% by 2026. This growth outlook has been downgraded from previous forecasts, largely due to heightened global uncertainty, especially stemming from escalated US trade policies and tariffs, which have created economic headwinds and contributed to a clouded external environment. Despite these challenges, inflation is projected to converge to the ECB’s target (around 2%), and labor markets remain robust, with unemployment near historic lows.

Fiscal conditions present ongoing vulnerabilities. The euro area’s budget balance is expected to stabilize below the -3% of GDP threshold, with the debt-to-GDP ratio on an upward trajectory due to persistent primary deficits and rising interest payments. Fiscal consolidation efforts are limiting government spending options, and the outlook for public finances remains surrounded by significant uncertainty—partly linked to geopolitical tensions and cyclical economic components. These structural fiscal pressures introduce risks, particularly if economic growth were to stagnate or borrowing costs were to rise unexpectedly.

Trade tensions, especially with the US, loom large as a risk factor. A scenario involving a global trade war could shave more than a full percentage point off euro area growth, representing a non-negligible threat to economic stability. Additionally, the European automotive sector—a key pillar for the broader EU economy—faces its own headwinds.

Politically, growing nationalist sentiment and political fragmentation in several member states, including the major economies of Germany, France, and Italy, present medium-term risks. However, the political leadership in these core countries continues to express strong commitment to the Euro project and to greater European integration, reflecting high institutional inertia and the prohibitive economic and political costs of exit.

Institutionally, the European Central Bank and Eurozone governance structures have repeatedly demonstrated resilience and adaptability through multiple severe episodes, including the 2008 financial crisis, the sovereign debt crisis, Brexit, and the COVID-19 pandemic. These institutions have capacity to respond with both monetary and policy tools to stabilize markets and member states in distress.

The requirements for a full “collapse” of the Eurozone, as defined by either the ECB formally closing or the euro ceasing to be the primary currency in Germany, France, and Italy, set an extremely high threshold. Achieving this scenario before 2030 would require a convergence of multiple severe shocks—such as an uncontrollable fiscal crisis, a sovereign default in a major economy, the rise of anti-euro governments in all the core countries, and a deep crisis of political legitimacy and confidence in the European project—occurring at the same time and overwhelming institutional responses.

In sum, while the Eurozone faces real and persistent economic, fiscal, and political challenges, its embedded resilience, high level of economic integration, and institutional adaptability have so far allowed it to weather substantive crises. The base rate for a fundamental breakdown within the next few years remains low but non-zero, reflecting both the gravity of potential risk factors and the formidable barriers to a genuine collapse as strictly defined.
