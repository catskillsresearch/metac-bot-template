(a) Time left until outcome is known: Approximately 7.5 months until the end of 2025 when final worldwide box office data will be available.

(b) Status quo outcome: Based on current data, Ne Zha 2 is the highest-grossing film of 2025 with over $2.1 billion worldwide. As a sequel, it is part of a franchise.

(c) Scenario for No outcome: An original, non-franchise film released later in 2025 could surpass Ne Zha 2's box office total. This would require a standalone film to generate over $2.2 billion globally, which is extremely rare and has only been achieved by a handful of films historically.

(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: Ne Zha 2 maintains its position as the highest-grossing film of 2025, or another franchise film such as Avatar: Fire and Ash (releasing December 2025) surpasses it. Given the historical performance of franchise films and the current trajectory, this is highly likely.

Based on the search results and news articles, I can provide a comprehensive forecast about whether the highest-grossing film of 2025 will be part of a franchise.

## Current Box Office Status

As of May 13, 2025, multiple reliable sources confirm that Ne Zha 2 is currently the highest-grossing film of 2025 worldwide, with reported earnings between $1.89 billion and $2.18 billion[1][2][3]. Ne Zha 2 is unquestionably a franchise film, being a sequel to the original Ne Zha. Its closest competitor is A Minecraft Movie, with approximately $909 million in global earnings[1][2][3], which is also a franchise film based on the popular video game property.

## Historical Context and Trends

Looking at recent years' data, franchise films have consistently dominated the global box office:
- In three of the past four years, the highest-grossing film worldwide was part of a franchise[5]
- In 2024, Disney's Inside Out 2 (a franchise film) was the highest-grossing animated film until Ne Zha 2 surpassed it in February 2025[5]
- The all-time highest-grossing films list is overwhelmingly dominated by franchise entries, with Avatar, Avengers, and other series occupying the top positions[5]

## Upcoming Releases and Potential Challengers

Several major franchise films are scheduled for release later in 2025 that could potentially challenge Ne Zha 2:

1. **Avatar: Fire and Ash** (December 19, 2025) - The third installment in James Cameron's Avatar series has substantial potential to earn over $2 billion given the previous films' performances. Early marketing has already begun, and projections suggest it could earn $1.9 billion worldwide.

2. **Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning** - As the final installment in the long-running franchise starring Tom Cruise, this has strong box office potential.

3. **Jurassic World Rebirth** - The latest entry in the Jurassic Park/World franchise.

4. **Zootopia 2** - Projected to earn approximately $1.7 billion globally.

However, to overtake Ne Zha 2, these films would need to generate over $2.2 billion globally, which is an extraordinarily high threshold that only a handful of films have ever achieved.

## Regional Box Office Variations

While several news articles mention other films being the "highest-grossing film of 2025" in specific regions or markets, these are not reflective of the global totals:
- Ajay Devgn's 'Red 2' is reported as the highest-grossing film in India for 2025 so far
- 'Yadan' is reported as becoming the highest-grossing film in Korea
- Marvel's 'Thunderbolts' is the highest-grossing Hollywood film in India specifically

None of these regional successes are close to challenging Ne Zha 2's global dominance, and importantly, all of these regional leaders are also franchise films (sequels).

## Analysis of Non-Franchise Contenders

There is very little evidence of any non-franchise film that could potentially surpass Ne Zha 2 in 2025. The search results and recent news articles do not mention any standalone original film with the box office potential to generate over $2 billion globally. The highest-grossing non-franchise films historically have rarely crossed the $1.5 billion mark.

## Probability Assessment

Given that:
1. The current highest-grossing film of 2025 (Ne Zha 2) is a franchise film
2. Its closest competitors (A Minecraft Movie, Captain America: Brave New World) are also franchise films
3. The most anticipated upcoming releases with billion-dollar potential are all franchise films
4. The historical dominance of franchise films in recent years
5. The extremely high threshold ($2.2 billion) that would need to be surpassed by any challenger
6. No indication of any non-franchise film with potential to achieve such numbers

The probability that the highest-grossing film of 2025 will be part of a franchise is extremely high. While there is still time for surprises, the status quo strongly favors a franchise film maintaining the top position.

Probability: 97%
