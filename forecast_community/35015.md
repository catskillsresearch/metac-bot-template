# Will the highest-grossing film of 2025 be part of a franchise?

The global box office landscape of 2025 is overwhelmingly dominated by franchise films, reflecting a continuation of trends seen in recent years. As of late May 2025, the highest-grossing film worldwide is *Ne Zha 2* with approximately $2.18 billion in global revenue, a sequel that definitively qualifies as a franchise film. The current top performers trailing behind include *A Minecraft Movie* ($931 million), *Detective Chinatown 1900* ($496 million), *Captain America: Brave New World* ($415 million), and *Thunderbolts* ($332 million) – all franchise entries or adaptations of existing properties.

## Historical Context and Current State

In three of the past four years, the highest-grossing films worldwide have been franchise entries, demonstrating studios' strategic preference for established intellectual properties with built-in audiences. *Ne Zha 2*'s current $2.18 billion gross places it in the same league as all-time box office champions like *Avatar* and *Avengers: Endgame*. This exceptional performance has set an extremely high threshold for any potential challenger.

Looking at the current box office charts, there is a complete absence of original, non-franchise films in the top positions. Every film currently contending for the year's highest gross is part of an established franchise, cinematic universe, or adaptation of existing intellectual property.

## Upcoming Releases and Contenders

Several major franchise films are still scheduled for release in the remaining seven months of 2025, including:

- *Avatar: Fire and Ash* (December 19, 2025)
- *Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning*
- *Jurassic World Rebirth*
- *Zootopia 2*

Of these upcoming releases, *Avatar: Fire and Ash* represents the most serious contender to potentially overtake *Ne Zha 2*. The previous *Avatar* films have been extraordinary box office performers, with both the original film and its sequel crossing the $2 billion mark globally. Industry predictions suggest *Avatar: Fire and Ash* could generate between $1.9-2.5 billion worldwide. Similarly, the new *Jurassic World* film starring Scarlett Johansson and directed by Gareth Edwards is projected to earn around $1.12 billion globally.

## Scenarios for Non-Franchise Success

For a non-franchise film to become 2025's box office champion, it would need to:

1. Release in the remaining seven months of the year
2. Generate unprecedented global appeal and word-of-mouth momentum
3. Surpass *Ne Zha 2*'s massive $2.18 billion benchmark
4. Outperform all upcoming franchise heavyweights including *Avatar: Fire and Ash*

Based on the search results and current market dynamics, there is no evidence of any original non-franchise film with sufficient momentum or anticipation to challenge the current leaders. No original films appear in the current top performers for 2025, and none of the most anticipated upcoming releases are original non-franchise productions.

## Market Dynamics

The franchise dominance is reinforced by several structural advantages:
- Built-in global awareness and marketing efficiencies
- Pre-existing fan loyalty and anticipation
- International appeal that transcends language and cultural barriers
- Studio prioritization of marketing resources

These advantages create significant obstacles for any original film trying to compete at the highest levels of box office performance. While surprise breakout hits can and do occur, they rarely reach the $2+ billion threshold that would be needed to surpass the current leader.

Even if *Ne Zha 2* were to be overtaken, the most likely scenario is that another franchise film – particularly *Avatar: Fire and Ash* – would take the top position rather than an original non-franchise production.

In conclusion, given the current state of the box office, historical precedent, upcoming release slate, and structural market dynamics, the highest-grossing film of 2025 will almost certainly be part of a franchise.
