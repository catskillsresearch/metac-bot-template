The European Union currently does not mandate the stunning of commercially farmed fish before slaughter, and no binding EU-wide legislation exists to enforce such a requirement. The existing regulations primarily focus on terrestrial animals, and the principle of minimizing suffering is applied generally rather than specifically to fish. The legislative process in the EU is known for being slow and incremental, often requiring significant time to develop and implement new standards, especially when they involve technical and species-specific challenges.

Despite these hurdles, there is a growing momentum for improving animal welfare, driven by public concern and advocacy from animal rights groups. The European Green Deal and other sustainability initiatives emphasize ethical and sustainable food systems, which could provide a framework for future legislation on fish welfare. Advancements in stunning technology may also help overcome some of the technical barriers currently faced.

However, the path to enacting binding legislation is fraught with challenges. Technical difficulties in developing suitable stunning methods for all fish species, lack of political will, and competing legislative priorities could impede progress. The absence of draft legislation or concrete proposals further complicates the likelihood of achieving a binding requirement by 2029.

Nonetheless, the EU has a history of gradually increasing animal welfare standards, and public and political pressure could accelerate this process. If technological solutions become more feasible and advocacy efforts continue to gain traction, there is potential for legislative change. The probability of a positive resolution by 2029 remains uncertain, but the increasing focus on animal welfare and sustainable practices suggests that change, while challenging, is not impossible.
