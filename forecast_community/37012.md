# Project 2025 Implementation Progress Analysis

The question of whether Project 2025 will classify at least 120 objectives as "Done" by July 1, 2025, requires careful analysis of current implementation rates, administrative capacity, and potential obstacles.

## Current Implementation Status

As of May 16, 2025, the Project 2025 Tracker shows that 101 out of 313 total objectives (32%) have been completed and classified as "Done". To reach the threshold of 120 objectives, an additional 19 objectives must be completed within the remaining 46 days before July 1, 2025. Importantly, there are currently 64 objectives (20% of total) classified as "In Progress," creating a substantial pipeline of initiatives that could potentially be completed before the deadline.

## Implementation Rate and Trajectory

The administration has demonstrated a significant implementation pace since taking office on January 20, 2025. With 101 objectives completed in approximately 4 months, the administration has averaged about 25 objectives per month. This robust implementation rate has been independently verified, with reporting confirming that about one-third of Project 2025 objectives were completed during the administration's first four months.

The current trajectory suggests continued strong implementation. If the established rate of approximately 25 objectives per month continues for the remaining 46 days (about 1.5 months), we would expect approximately 37-38 additional objectives to be completed by July 1. Even with a more conservative estimate of half the current rate, we would still expect around 18-19 additional completions - right at the threshold needed.

## Administrative Capacity and Commitment

Despite Trump's public distancing from Project 2025 during the campaign, the administration has actively embraced many of its recommendations. The implementation appears systematic across federal agencies, with varying completion rates depending on department complexity and focus. Some departments show particularly high completion rates - almost 92% of USAID-related objectives have been accomplished, while the Department of Energy, Environmental Protection Agency, and Department of the Interior are all around 40% complete.

This implementation pattern demonstrates both strategic prioritization and administrative capacity to advance multiple objectives simultaneously across different agencies.

## Progress Pipeline Analysis

The 64 "In Progress" objectives represent a crucial pipeline. To reach 120 "Done" objectives, only 19 of these 64 (approximately 30%) would need to be completed in the next 46 days. Given that many objectives have already progressed significantly through the implementation process, this conversion rate appears achievable. The Project 2025 tracking data indicates a steady progression from "In Progress" to "Done" status over time.

## Potential Limitations and Uncertainties

Several factors could potentially impact the completion rate:

1. Administrative bottlenecks or capacity constraints as more complex objectives are tackled
2. Legal challenges to certain policy implementations that could delay official completion
3. Classification criteria for marking objectives as "Done" may involve subjective elements
4. Shifting political priorities that could divert resources from certain initiatives

However, there is currently no evidence in the available data suggesting any significant slowdown in implementation pace. The administration appears to have prioritized rapid execution of the Project 2025 agenda through executive action, which allows for bypassing potentially lengthy congressional processes.

## Conclusion

Based on the current implementation momentum (101 objectives already complete), the substantial pipeline of in-progress work (64 objectives), and the demonstrated administrative capacity to implement at a rate of approximately 25 objectives per month, it appears highly likely that at least 19 additional objectives will be classified as "Done" by July 1, 2025. This would push the total above the 120 threshold. The established trajectory and ongoing commitment to the agenda suggest that, barring unexpected major disruptions, the Project 2025 implementation will continue at a pace sufficient to meet or exceed this benchmark.
