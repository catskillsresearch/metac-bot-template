The S&P/Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price Index for April 2025 is calculated using the repeat sales method and reflects the average change in market prices for constant-quality homes, utilizing a three-month moving average to smooth out volatility and capture broad national trends. The index is published with a two-month lag, meaning the April 2025 value will be reported in late June or July 2025.

Heading into spring 2025, recent index releases show steady but decelerating gains. For example, values climbed from 332.72 in January to 335.08 in February, with month-over-month increases ranging from 0.25% to 0.71%. Annual price growth has also moderated, slipping from 4.1% in January to 3.9% in February. This moderation is evident in both the S&P/Case-Shiller Index and complementary market data.

Market dynamics in early 2025 indicate continued but cooling momentum. Inventory levels rose significantly—up over 7% month-over-month and nearly 36% year-over-year—while mortgage rates increased, recently passing 6.8%. At the same time, home sales rose sharply month-over-month (+11.3%), but remain down year-over-year, and the median sales price growth has slowed, rising only 1.2% month-over-month as of April 2025. A notable macroeconomic concern is the 1.0% drop in the U.S. Leading Economic Index in April, the largest monthly decline since March 2023. This signals increasing economic headwinds that could dampen housing demand.

Despite these cooling signals, ongoing inventory shortages and persistent demand are likely to provide a floor for prices. The lack of sufficient supply relative to demand, particularly in many metropolitan areas, continues to support home values, even as affordability is squeezed by high mortgage rates and rising consumer pessimism.

Given the three-month moving average methodology, sudden swings in a single month are likely to be muted in the April report. Therefore, unless a significant shock occurs—such as an abrupt economic downturn, a sharp increase in mortgage rates, or a major policy shift—continued modest appreciation is expected, albeit at a slightly slower pace than earlier in the year. However, risks are skewed toward weaker-than-expected growth or a flat outcome if the recent negative economic indicators translate into significantly reduced buyer activity.

Overall, the most consistent expectation for the April 2025 S&P/Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price Index is a value slightly above recent months, reflecting sustained but slowing growth, tempered by increasing inventories, economic headwinds, and affordability constraints. However, a minor probability for a weaker reading remains, in case market headwinds intensify more rapidly than anticipated.
