(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
The question will resolve on or after February 1, 2026. As of May 13, 2025, this is about 8.5 months from now.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
If no further mass outbreaks or depopulations occur after today, only flock depopulations already confirmed in 2025 would count. Based on reporting, by early 2025 (January), at least 18.8 million commercial egg layers were culled in January alone, with further outbreaks in December 2024 and more activity likely since then[4]. Reliable cumulative 2025 data as of May suggests at least 20–25 million birds have already been culled, though this is likely an underestimate as the peak culling typically occurs later in the year.

(c) **Outcome if current trend continued:**  
Recent years have seen the US cull between 50 and 60 million birds annually due to HPAI, with a notable spike during winter and early spring (as reflected in the January 2025 figure of 18.8 million layers affected)[4]. If 2025 follows this pattern, and outbreaks persist through fall and winter, the annual total would likely fall between 40 and 60 million birds, consistent with the 2022–2024 period[4].

(d) **Expectations of experts and markets:**  
- The USDA's own economic outlook projects continued egg shortages and significant 2025 egg price surges (+41%) due to avian flu, pointing to persistent and likely large-scale flock losses[4].
- Although poultry prices themselves are expected to remain more stable, the underlying implication is that high culling will continue.
- No significant change in culling policy has been announced, and the spread of H5N1 to dairy cattle has not altered USDA's response protocol for poultry.
- Expert commentary and news analysis suggest that unless there is a radical change (e.g., a policy shift to vaccination, a major climatic effect suppressing flu spread, or the virus burning out), the annual cull will remain within recent historical levels.

(e) **Unexpected scenario resulting in a low outcome:**  
If the virus mutates to a less pathogenic form or spreads more extensively in non-poultry animal reservoirs (e.g., cattle), leading to fewer poultry outbreaks, or if a sudden, widespread adoption of effective vaccination/biosecurity sharply reduces outbreaks mid-year, the annual total could drop to the 10–20 million range. Rapid regulatory action to change culling protocols could also cause a steep decline.

(f) **Unexpected scenario resulting in a high outcome:**  
If H5N1 mutates to become even more infectious among poultry or there is a catastrophic failure in biosecurity (e.g., a new, highly contagious strain coinciding with high migratory bird activity), or if staff shortages at regulatory agencies severely delay response and containment, the US could see a record-breaking year: over 70 million birds culled—potentially 80 million or more if multiple large commercial facilities are affected.
