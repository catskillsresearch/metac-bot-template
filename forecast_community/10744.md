Hungary’s continued membership in the EU is anchored by a combination of entrenched public support and formidable legal and constitutional barriers to exit. Historically, a vast majority of the domestic electorate has favored EU membership, and this sentiment underpins the political environment. The constitutional and procedural hurdles—such as the requirements for amending the constitution and holding a referendum—act as significant roadblocks against any abrupt move toward triggering Article 50.

While there is ongoing tension with Brussels and political rhetoric can at times favor a more nationalistic agenda, such pressures have traditionally resulted in renegotiations or sanctions rather than a decisive break with the union. A departure would likely require an extraordinary political realignment: a radical shift in leadership that not only reverses the long-held consensus but also overcomes the entrenched institutional safeguards. Even scenarios involving intensified conflict with EU institutions or the imposition of punitive measures appear more likely to drive further consolidation around the status quo rather than spur an exit.

Thus, absent a dramatic and unprecedented change in the domestic political and constitutional landscape, the combination of strong public support for membership and high exit thresholds makes Hungary’s departure from the EU before 2030 a highly unlikely event.
