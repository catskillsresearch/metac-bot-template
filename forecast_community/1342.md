The fraction of planets with intelligent life capable of interstellar communication, denoted as \( f_c \), remains a highly uncertain parameter due to the current lack of empirical evidence beyond Earth. Given that Earth is the only known planet with intelligent life capable of such communication, the status quo outcome would likely be at the lower end of the range, around 0.001 (0.1%). If the current trend of no confirmed detection of extraterrestrial technosignatures continues, this outcome would likely remain low, potentially around 0.001 to 0.01 (0.1% to 1%).

Experts generally acknowledge the high uncertainty surrounding \( f_c \), with estimates ranging from 0.001 to 1. This wide range reflects both optimistic and pessimistic views, with a central tendency towards lower values due to the lack of evidence and the "N=1" problem, where Earth is the only data point. Markets or betting platforms, if they existed for this question, would likely reflect this wide distribution of uncertainty.

Unexpected scenarios could significantly alter these estimates. A low outcome might result from advanced civilizations predominantly using non-detectable communication methods, such as fiber optics or quantum communication, or deliberately avoiding broadcasting signals for security reasons. Conversely, a high outcome could arise from a breakthrough discovery of multiple extraterrestrial civilizations using detectable communication technologies, such as radio or laser signals, suggesting that a significant fraction of intelligent civilizations do develop such capabilities.
