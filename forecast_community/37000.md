Donald Trump began his second term with a consistent pattern of frequent golf outings, as tracked by public sources. As of May 15, 2025, Trump Golf Track recorded 24 days spent golfing out of 114 total days in office, equating to roughly 21% of his presidency. If Trump were to stop golfing entirely from mid-May through July 1, the percentage would decrease as the total days in office increase, resulting in a lower bound near 15%. However, this scenario is unlikely given his established habit of regular golf outings and no indications of significant changes to his schedule.

Historically, Trump's rate of golf outings has remained relatively steady, with seasonal trends indicating a potential uptick in the spring and summer months when golf frequency typically increases. If his current pace continues—approximately one day golfing every 4.75 days—he would add about 10 more golf days in the remaining 47 days until July 1, 2025. This would yield an estimated total of 34 days out of 161 in office, resulting in a projected percentage just above 21%.

Expert and media consensus generally expects Trump's percentage of time spent golfing to remain in the low 20s, possibly ticking up slightly in the summer, but without evidence for a dramatic increase. There is some chance the percentage could approach or reach 25% if he substantially raises his golf frequency during this period, such as through more golf-centric trips or events, but such a spike would require a marked change from his already steady pace. Conversely, if unforeseen events—such as health issues, diplomatic crises, or significant changes in presidential focus—were to curtail his ability to golf, the percentage could fall to the high teens or near 17%.

Overall, absent extraordinary circumstances, the expected percentage of days Trump will have spent golfing by July 1, 2025, remains anchored in the 20–25% range, with both historical precedent and current patterns supporting this projection.
