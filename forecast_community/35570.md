(a) Time left until outcome is known: About 7 months (from May 9, 2025 until the December 2025 data is published in early January 2026).

(b) Status quo outcome: Based on current trends, Madrid housing prices will continue to rise but at a more moderate pace than the 18% threshold, likely in the 5-10% range for 2025.

(c) Scenario for No outcome: Economic stabilization occurs as new housing developments in Madrid increase supply, interest rate cuts slow down, and high prices naturally dampen demand, resulting in price growth below 18% for 2025.

(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: An unexpected surge in foreign investment combines with continued housing supply shortages in Madrid, while interest rates fall more rapidly than anticipated, creating a speculative bubble that pushes prices above the 18% threshold.

As a professional forecaster, I need to assess whether Madrid housing prices will increase by more than 18% in 2025. Let me analyze the available data and projections methodically.

## Current Market Indicators

The Spanish housing market has shown significant strength recently, with nationwide house prices rising by 11.16% (8.71% inflation-adjusted) in Q1 2025 compared to Q1 2024, reaching an average of €2,311 per square meter[1]. This indicates robust growth, though not at the 18% threshold we're considering for Madrid.

For Madrid specifically, the data suggests continued but moderating growth. After the substantial 20% increase in 2024, experts are projecting more modest growth for 2025:

- Industry analysts are forecasting price increases in Madrid between 5% and 10% for 2025[2][3]
- CaixaBank Research expects housing prices across Spain to grow by 5.9% in 2025[4]
- BBVA specialists predict a more conservative 3% increase in real estate prices[5]

## Market Fundamentals Analysis

Several factors support continued price appreciation, though likely at rates below 18%:

1. **Interest Rate Environment**: The ECB reduced rates four times in 2024 to 3%, with further cuts expected in 2025. This will improve mortgage affordability and support housing demand[2].

2. **Supply-Demand Imbalance**: A significant imbalance exists between limited housing supply and rising demand, creating upward pressure on prices[2].

3. **New Development Impact**: More supply is expected to enter the market in 2025, particularly with new developments in the Community of Madrid, which should moderate price growth[2].

4. **Market Maturity**: Prices have already reached high levels after the 20% increase in 2024, suggesting some natural moderation in growth rates[2].

## Historical Context

The Spanish real estate market tends to move in cycles. After a very strong year (20% growth in Madrid in 2024), it would be unusual to see another year of acceleration. The data from January 2025 shows the average price in Spain at €2,049/m², representing just a 0.4% month-over-month increase[5], suggesting a more moderate pace.

## Probability Assessment

When forecasting, I must acknowledge both the status quo trajectory and potential disruptive factors:

1. **Status quo path**: All expert forecasts point to continued but moderating price growth in Madrid, with projections clustering in the 5-10% range, well below the 18% threshold.

2. **Disruptive factors**: While unexpected events could accelerate price growth (such as a surge in foreign investment or dramatically faster interest rate cuts), the current high base prices after 2024's 20% increase make another 18%+ year highly unlikely.

Given that we're already partway through 2025 (May) and the monthly price increases have been modest (around 0.4-0.7% per month)[5], reaching an 18% annual increase would require a dramatic acceleration in the latter half of the year that isn't supported by any current indicators or expert forecasts.

Even in high-demand areas like Madrid, the consensus among real estate professionals is that growth will moderate as prices have already reached significant levels and new supply is entering the market.

Probability: 15%
