The current situation in Russia suggests a low probability of a large-scale armed conflict before 2030. The Russian government maintains a strong grip on power through significant repression and military rebuilding efforts, effectively suppressing any nascent opposition movements. Economic conditions, while challenging, have not deteriorated to the point of causing widespread unrest, and the military situation in Ukraine has not resulted in a catastrophic defeat that could trigger internal upheaval.

Historically, large-scale conflicts in Russia have typically followed severe military defeats and state incapacity, neither of which are currently evident. The state has been proactive in preventing such outcomes by increasing surveillance, centralizing authority, and focusing on military and economic stabilization. The absence of visible organized armed opposition capable of challenging the state at a large scale further supports the likelihood of the status quo persisting.

However, unforeseen developments, such as a significant military defeat or severe economic collapse, could alter this assessment. Such events could lead to widespread discontent among the population and elites, potentially coalescing into organized armed opposition involving factions within the military or regional separatist movements. While the current evidence suggests a stable status quo, the potential for drastic changes means that the possibility of a large-scale armed conflict cannot be entirely dismissed.
