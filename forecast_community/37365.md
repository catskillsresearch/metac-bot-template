Several interrelated factors inform the likely inventory/sales ratio for US apparel businesses in April 2025:

The most recent data, for March 2025, reports an inventory/sales ratio of 2.06 for US apparel, piece goods, and notions merchant wholesalers (NAICS 4243), with inventories at $27.81 billion and sales at $13.48 billion. This figure fits well within the range observed over the past year (2.0–2.2), indicating relative stability in inventory management for this sector.

Apparel wholesalers typically maintain higher inventory/sales ratios than the broader wholesale trade, which hovered around 1.30–1.37 in March, reflecting the fashion sector’s longer product cycles and more complex inventory requirements. The March 2025 total business inventories/sales ratio was 1.34 across all sectors.

In April 2025, several economic indicators suggest a cautious but steady market:

- **US retail sales grew only 0.1% in April, with apparel sales showing softness or outright declines according to multiple sources. Declining apparel sales were also evident in other countries, such as the UK (down 1.8%) and New Zealand. This international weakness in apparel demand may signal headwinds for US apparel wholesalers as well, potentially resulting in slower inventory turnover and slight upward pressure on the inventory/sales ratio.**
  
- **Despite overall modest growth, some US small business clothing retailers reported 5.3% year-over-year sales increases, suggesting localized strength. However, this appears to be the exception rather than the rule in April’s data.**

- **Inventory management at the wholesale level has remained disciplined, with only moderate increases in overall wholesale inventories (up 0.5% from February to March). Retail inventories, by contrast, looked leaner than their 2015–2019 averages, indicating many retailers have been exercising caution in stockholding as they face tariff uncertainty and shifting consumer preferences.**

Several broader factors influence these trends:

- **Tariff discussions and the threat of increased apparel costs have prompted some wholesalers and retailers to consider stockpiling inventory. However, there is little evidence of a major pre-tariff buying spree in April. The growing secondhand and resale apparel market, spurred in part by rising clothing prices, could also be diverting some demand from new apparel wholesale channels.**

- **Seasonal transitions in April—when businesses move from spring to summer fashion—can influence inventory turnover rates, often leading to modest changes in the ratio, but not dramatic swings.**

Unexpected events could push the ratio lower or higher:

- If there had been a sudden retail buying surge—due to aggressive promotions, shifts in consumer sentiment, or retailers rushing to restock ahead of tariffs—the ratio could fall below 2.0 as inventories are depleted.
- Conversely, a sharper-than-anticipated pullback in consumer apparel spending, or wholesalers stockpiling ahead of tariffs without matching sales, could drive the ratio above 2.2.

In summary, with historical metrics showing stability, the absence of major shocks in April, and only moderate inventory and sales fluctuations, the inventory/sales ratio for US apparel wholesalers in April 2025 is likely to remain near the March baseline. Modest upward bias is possible if weak apparel sales persist, but significant deviation from the 2.0–2.2 range appears unlikely barring unexpected events. The sector continues to be influenced by policy uncertainty, evolving consumer behavior (including a growing resale market), and prudent inventory management amid mild economic pressures.
