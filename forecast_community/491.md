# China's Carbon Intensity Reduction: Will the 60% Target Be Met by 2030?

China's commitment to reduce carbon emissions per unit of GDP by 60-65% below 2005 levels by 2030 represents one of the world's most significant climate pledges. This target is a cornerstone of China's "dual carbon" goals, which include peaking carbon emissions before 2030 and achieving carbon neutrality by 2060.

## Current Progress and Trajectory

As of mid-2025, China's progress toward its carbon intensity reduction target shows mixed results. Recent data indicates that carbon intensity decreased by 3.4% in 2024, falling short of the annual target of 3.9%. Cumulatively, China has only achieved approximately 8% reduction in carbon intensity from 2020 to 2024, a pace significantly behind what's needed to reach the 60% threshold by 2030.

Multiple independent analyses in early 2025 have concluded that China is "significantly off track" or "very behind" for achieving the full 65% carbon intensity reduction target, and even meeting the minimum 60% threshold will be "extremely difficult" without a marked acceleration in progress. To catch up, China would need an unprecedented 22% drop in emissions intensity between 2026 and 2030, which analysts describe as extremely challenging given current trends.

## Clean Energy Progress vs Coal Expansion

China's renewable energy sector has shown remarkable growth, with record levels of investment and capacity additions:

- Wind, solar, and clean technology sectors grew rapidly, contributing 10% of China's GDP in 2024—an unprecedented share
- Clean energy now meets incremental electricity demand growth, resulting in the first quarterly drop in absolute CO₂ emissions in early 2025, with emissions falling by 1.6% despite increasing electricity demand

However, this progress is partially offset by China's continued expansion of coal-fired power capacity:

- China built 94.5 GW of new coal-fired power plants in 2024 alone, accounting for over 90% of global additions that year
- This ongoing coal expansion undermines progress in emissions intensity reduction, especially when tied to industrial growth

## Policy Framework and Implementation

China has established a comprehensive policy framework to support its climate goals:

- The "1+N" policy system provides the foundation for China's decarbonization efforts, where "1" refers to top-level design and "N" represents specific implementation plans for key sectors
- China's carbon trading system is expanding, which may help accelerate emissions reductions if properly implemented

However, implementation challenges remain:

- Data transparency issues and regional variation in reporting and implementation may hinder both real progress and external validation
- Provincial enforcement of national policies can be inconsistent, potentially slowing emissions intensity reductions

## Economic Factors and Structural Changes

The emissions intensity metric is sensitive to macroeconomic trends and structural economic changes:

- If China's GDP growth slows or shifts further toward services and high-value manufacturing, intensity could drop faster
- The clean energy sector is growing three times as fast as the overall economy, which could accelerate decarbonization if this trend continues
- Economic pressures could push China to prioritize growth over emissions reductions, particularly if global economic conditions deteriorate

## Outlook for 2030

Looking ahead to 2030, several factors will determine whether China achieves its 60% carbon intensity reduction target:

- China needs to sustain and accelerate its renewable energy deployment while sharply curtailing further coal expansion after 2025
- Major sectors must undergo substantial electrification and energy transition, with economic growth decoupled from fossil fuel use
- Policy enforcement must tighten and local data quality improve to ensure genuine progress
- China's implied carbon intensity reduction pathway requires a sharp acceleration from the current pace to achieve the minimum 60% threshold

The most likely outcome based on current trends is that China will get very close to its target, possibly just meeting or narrowly missing the 60% reduction threshold. The direction is positive, but the pace needs to increase substantially in the coming years to ensure success.
