As a professional forecaster, I'll analyze this question about potential AI training pauses by major companies before 2026.

(a) Time left until outcome known: Approximately 7 months and 19 days (from May 12, 2025 to January 1, 2026)

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: None of the three companies (OpenAI, Google DeepMind, or Anthropic) announce a pause on training runs above a certain size for safety reasons.

(c) Scenario resulting in No outcome: The three major AI companies continue their competitive development of increasingly powerful models through 2025, implementing safety measures and responsible scaling policies that allow them to continue training without requiring a complete pause. They maintain that their existing governance frameworks and safety protocols are sufficient.

(d) Scenario resulting in Yes outcome: A significant safety incident or concerning capability emerges in one of the companies' models, prompting immediate action. Alternatively, mounting pressure from governments or coordinated action among the companies leads to at least one announcing a temporary pause on large training runs while better safety measures are developed.

## Rationale

The question asks whether OpenAI, Google DeepMind, or Anthropic will announce a pause on all training runs above a certain size for safety reasons before January 1, 2026. Let me analyze the evidence and context to develop my forecast.

### Current Competitive Landscape

As of May 2025, the AI development landscape remains highly competitive. Recent developments suggest the major AI labs are focused on capability advancement rather than pausing development:

- Google recently upgraded its Gemini 2.5 Pro model, making it widely available and increasing usage limits[1]
- Anthropic released Claude 3.7 Sonnet and Claude Code in February 2025[2]
- All three companies are described as engaged in "AI leaderboard jockeying" as of April 2025[5]

This indicates that the competitive dynamics are pushing these companies to continue advancing their models rather than pausing development.

### Safety Approaches

The search results reveal important context about how these companies are approaching AI safety:

- Anthropic has a "Responsible Scaling Policy" and focuses on "building tools with human benefit at their foundation"[2]
- There's evidence of collaboration on safety standards, as Google announced it would adopt Anthropic's Model Context Protocol (MCP)[3]
- The concept of "if-then commitments" has emerged as a framework for "preparing for risks from AI without unnecessarily slowing the development of new technology"[4]

These approaches suggest the companies are pursuing safety through governance mechanisms and standards rather than through pausing development.

### Timeline Expectations

The search results indicate that AI leaders expect continued rapid development:

- The CEOs of all three companies "have all said they expect human-level AI before the end of the decade"[5]
- This timeline expectation suggests they are planning continued development rather than anticipating pauses

### Historical Precedent

There is no evidence in the search results of any previous pauses by these companies on training runs for safety reasons. This absence of precedent is significant, as companies tend to follow established patterns of behavior.

### Status Quo Bias Consideration

As a forecaster, I must acknowledge that the status quo typically persists in the absence of strong forces for change. The current status quo involves ongoing AI development with safety measures integrated into the development process rather than through pauses.

For a pause to occur within the next ~8 months, there would need to be either:
1. A significant safety incident that forces reconsideration
2. New coordinated regulation that requires pauses
3. A major shift in the competitive dynamics between these companies

None of these appears imminent based on the available evidence.

## Conclusion

Given the competitive landscape, the current approaches to AI safety, the absence of historical precedents for pauses, and the short time horizon remaining before January 2026, it appears highly unlikely that any of the three companies will announce a pause on training runs above a certain size for safety reasons.

The companies are pursuing safety through governance frameworks, responsible scaling policies, and technical standards rather than through pauses. They are also engaged in active competition that incentivizes continued development.

While a safety incident or regulatory intervention could change this trajectory, there is no evidence suggesting such developments are likely in the next ~8 months.
