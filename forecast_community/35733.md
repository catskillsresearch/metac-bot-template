## Rationale on Whether the United States Will Recognize Taiwan Before January 20, 2029

Since 1979, the United States has adhered to a policy of “strategic ambiguity” regarding Taiwan, providing robust but unofficial support while formally recognizing the People’s Republic of China as the sole legal government of China. This approach, anchored in the Taiwan Relations Act and consistent with the One China Policy, has allowed Washington to supply arms to Taiwan, maintain deep economic ties, and support Taiwan’s international participation without formally recognizing it as a sovereign state.

Recent years have seen meaningful, though incremental, shifts in this dynamic. In February 2025, the U.S. State Department removed the phrase “we do not support Taiwan independence” from its official materials—a move that signals a willingness by the current Trump administration to take greater diplomatic risks and test Beijing’s red lines on Taiwan. While such language shifts have occurred before, including under the Biden administration (and were subsequently reversed after strong Chinese protest), the fact that they are recurring reflects mounting pressure within the U.S. to reconsider elements of the longstanding status quo.

Congressional activity has intensified, with new resolutions introduced calling for the abandonment of the One China Policy and the restoration of formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan. Some members of Congress have advocated appointing a U.S. ambassador to Taipei and supporting Taiwan’s inclusion in international organizations such as the United Nations. These initiatives, however, do not carry legal force absent presidential action, as the authority to grant diplomatic recognition lies exclusively with the President.

Despite these signals, several enduring and powerful constraints remain. Beijing has repeatedly warned that U.S. recognition of Taiwan would cross a clear red line, threatening severe economic and military retaliation. This threat—alongside the risk of destabilizing the Indo-Pacific region, provoking a broader crisis, or undermining U.S. alliances—serves as a major deterrent to formal recognition. The U.S.'s existing approach offers flexibility, enabling substantial support for Taiwan while avoiding direct confrontation with China.

Global diplomatic inertia further supports the status quo: only 12 countries maintain formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan, reflecting the strong international pressure (mainly from China) against such moves. Even among U.S. allies, there is little momentum to break with the One China Policy or establish official relations with Taiwan.

Taken together, these factors mean that recent U.S. rhetorical and legislative shifts, while notable, remain largely symbolic. The incremental expansion of unofficial ties—through increased military cooperation, trade, and high-level visits—does not cross the threshold of formal recognition. Such a step would likely require an extraordinary shock: a dramatic escalation in the Taiwan Strait (such as Chinese military aggression), a complete collapse in U.S.-China relations, a unilateral declaration of independence by Taiwan, or a radical shift in domestic U.S. politics that makes the costs of continued ambiguity outweigh the risks of recognition.

Absent such an extraordinary event, institutional inertia, the grave risks of escalation, and the proven utility of ambiguity are all strong forces maintaining the current policy. The most probable path is continued deepening of unofficial support and rhetorical backing for Taiwan, without issuing a formal declaration or appointing ambassadors—thus maintaining the legal and diplomatic boundaries that have defined U.S.-Taiwan relations since 1979.

In summary, while the U.S. has shown increased risk tolerance and support for Taiwan, the structural, geopolitical, and historical barriers to formal recognition remain extremely high. Only an extraordinary crisis or fundamental recalibration of U.S. interests and risk tolerance is likely to produce a move toward official recognition before January 20, 2029.
