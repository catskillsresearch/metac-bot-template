# Rationale for Próspera's Population in 2035

Próspera, Honduras' first ZEDE (Zone for Employment and Economic Development), represents an ambitious experiment in charter cities. Currently, Próspera occupies a 58-acre tract on the island of Roatan, with plans to expand to approximately one square mile. As of mid-2025, the population consists of approximately 200 full-time residents, with an additional 200 local workers who commute from elsewhere in Roatán.

## Current Status and Growth Trajectory

Próspera began construction in 2021 with essentially zero permanent residents. By 2025, it has grown to around 200 full-time residents, with a larger ecosystem of e-Residents and limited e-Residents bringing the total registered people to approximately 1,800. The development has been slower than initially projected, as early plans had envisioned reaching 10,000 residents by the end of 2025.

The city offers residential options including condos in Duna Tower, where a studio costs $130,000 and a two-bedroom apartment costs $200,000. Construction continues with innovative approaches, including robots turning wooden blocks into construction materials at "The Circular Factory".

## Factors That Could Accelerate Growth

Several factors could drive substantial population growth in Próspera by 2035:

**Strong Investor Backing**: Próspera has secured investment from prominent figures in technology and venture capital, including Balaji Srinivasan, Peter Thiel, Marc Andreessen through Pronomos Capital, and more recently Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong through Coinbase's venture capital division. This financial backing could accelerate development if initial successes are demonstrated.

**Tax Advantages**: Próspera offers significant tax benefits, with only a 5% income tax, 2.5% sales tax, and 1% business tax, with a portion going to the Honduran government. This could attract entrepreneurs, remote workers, and businesses seeking tax efficiency.

**Economic Development Activities**: The city has been hosting conferences focused on biotech startups and cryptocurrency, which could help establish it as a hub for innovation. In 2024, biotech startup events led to $1.5 million in venture capital investments.

## Challenges and Risks

Several significant challenges could limit or even eliminate Próspera's population by 2035:

**Political and Legal Uncertainty**: As of 2025, ZEDEs including Próspera remain operational despite ongoing legal disputes. Political opposition in Honduras represents a substantial existential risk to the project.

**Immigration Constraints**: Próspera doesn't run its own immigration system, meaning anyone wanting to relocate needs to obtain Honduran residency. This could limit the rate at which international residents can move to the city.

**Infrastructure Development**: The pace of construction and infrastructure development has been slower than initially projected, which could constrain population growth if this trend continues.

## Growth Scenarios

By 2035, several distinct scenarios could unfold:

**Low Growth Scenario**: If legal challenges persist and political opposition increases, Próspera could struggle to grow beyond a small community of several hundred to a few thousand residents. In the most extreme case, if Honduras revokes the ZEDE laws, Próspera could cease to exist entirely.

**Moderate Growth Scenario**: If Próspera maintains its legal status and continues its current trajectory, it could reach between 3,000-7,000 residents by 2035. This would represent significant growth from current levels while falling short of the most ambitious projections.

**High Growth Scenario**: If Próspera successfully establishes itself as a hub for innovation (particularly in biotech and crypto), resolves legal challenges, expands its territory, and demonstrates the viability of its economic model, population could grow exponentially. Under ideal conditions, Próspera could potentially reach 10,000-20,000 residents by 2035.

The wide range in potential outcomes reflects the experimental nature of Próspera and the significant uncertainties surrounding its development. As one of the world's most ambitious charter city projects, its population trajectory will depend on how successfully it navigates political, legal, economic, and infrastructural challenges in the coming decade.
