# Denver Rental Market Analysis: May 2025 Year-Over-Year Rent Changes

The year-over-year increase in rent for Denver, CO in May 2025, according to Zillow, will most likely be 0%, reflecting a remarkably stable rental market compared to May 2024. Multiple data points from comprehensive market updates indicate that Denver's rental prices have remained flat over the past year, despite modest month-over-month fluctuations.

## Current Market Status

As of May 2025, the average rent for single-family homes in Denver stands at $3,100, showing no change compared to May 2024. This stability contrasts sharply with the national rental market, where Zillow reports asking rents increased by 3.4% in April 2025 compared to the previous year. Denver's rental market has diverged significantly from national trends, positioning it as an outlier among major metropolitan areas.

## Key Factors Influencing Denver's Rental Market

Several important elements are currently shaping Denver's flat rental growth:

1. **Housing Value Decline**: Denver's housing market has experienced a 2.8% decline in home values over the past year, with the average home value at $568,754. This downward pressure on home prices may be creating spillover effects in the rental market.

2. **Increased Rental Concessions**: Denver is experiencing the highest increase in rental concessions (discounts for renters) among the 50 largest metro areas. This indicates landlords are offering incentives rather than raising rents to attract tenants.

3. **Supply-Demand Balance**: The city currently has 951 available rentals with properties staying on the market for an average of 37 days. This relatively balanced market lacks the extreme supply shortages that would typically drive up prices.

4. **Multifamily vs. Single-Family Trends**: While single-family rentals show flat year-over-year growth, multifamily units have shown weakness. According to Apartments.com, multifamily rents in Denver fell by 3.6% year-over-year in Q1 2025, making it the second-largest decline among the top 50 markets nationwide.

## Regional Variations

Interestingly, while Denver proper shows flat year-over-year growth, nearby Highlands Ranch has seen more substantial rental growth of $140 year-over-year, reaching $3,490. This suggests significant regional differences within the metro area, with some suburbs maintaining stronger rental growth than the urban core.

## Possible Deviations from Expected Outcome

While the most likely outcome is 0% year-over-year growth, several scenarios could alter this projection:

**Potential for Lower Growth**: If late-May data reveals an unexpected surge in vacancies or increased rent concessions not yet captured in preliminary data, the final ZORI figure could register a slight year-over-year decline. This could push the figure negative, potentially between -0.5% and -1.5%.

**Potential for Higher Growth**: A sudden late-month surge in new high-priced lease signings (e.g., from luxury units or large new developments) or an unexpected reversal in demand—perhaps due to tech sector hiring or a new major employer—could push ZORI to post a small positive YoY figure, up to approximately 1%.

## Comparative Context

The flat rental growth in Denver stands in stark contrast to the national picture, where the typical U.S. asking rent climbed to $1,968, an increase of 3.5% since last year according to the Zillow Observed Rent Index. This divergence highlights Denver's unique market conditions and suggests local factors are strongly influencing rental trends.
