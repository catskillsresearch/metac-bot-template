(a) **Time left until resolution:**  
There are about 7.5 months remaining until January 30, 2026, the cut-off for the outcome: a bilateral ceasefire must begin by December 31, 2025, and last 30 days to resolve as Yes. If this does not happen by the deadline, it resolves No.

(b) **Status quo outcome (if nothing changes):**  
No durable bilateral ceasefire has been achieved since Russia’s 2022 invasion. Previous attempts have consistently failed, with both sides unwilling to make the necessary concessions, particularly on territory and NATO status[2][1]. The current trend is continued fighting with intermittent diplomacy but no agreement.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
Negotiations between Russia and Ukraine, even under heavy US (Trump administration) pressure, fail to produce a 30-day, comprehensive bilateral ceasefire covering all territories. Disputes over territorial concessions, especially Crimea and Donbas, and preconditions for talks (Ukraine wants a ceasefire first; Russia wants talks without a ceasefire) continue to block progress. Each side accuses the other of intransigence, and military operations continue past the cut-off date[2][1].

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
Intensive negotiations—perhaps brokered by the US or Turkey—lead to a deal where both sides agree to a 30-day, full-front ceasefire, with guarantees enforced by third parties. Ukraine, under significant external pressure, reluctantly accepts a temporary freeze along current lines without formal recognition of Russian gains, or Russia softens its terms out of military necessity or larger diplomatic calculus. The ceasefire holds without major violations for 30 days, thus meeting the criteria.

## Rationale

**Diplomatic and Military Position:**
- As of mid-May 2025, the US, under President Trump, is pushing hard for a ceasefire, presenting Ukraine with peace frameworks that would require major concessions[1].
- Russia conditionally expresses willingness for a front-line freeze but demands formal recognition of its control over occupied territories, which Ukraine (and its Western partners) reject as unacceptable[1][2].
- Ukraine and Europe are united on demanding a 30-day unconditional ceasefire as a precondition for talks. Russia wants to negotiate first, and only then discuss a ceasefire[2].
- There are repeated statements by both Russia and Ukraine that the other is not negotiating in good faith, with Russia continuing drone attacks and Ukraine conducting operations behind Russian lines, indicating that the war remains very much active.

**Recent Negotiation Efforts:**
- Trump has claimed a ceasefire is possible “in the not-too-distant future,” and US diplomacy is applying maximum pressure for an agreement[4].
- Secret and public talks continue, but Russia’s negotiating stance remains maximalist, and Ukraine has strong domestic and international constraints against major concessions[1][2].
- While there are ongoing talks, no evidence has emerged that a bilateral, comprehensive ceasefire is imminent. When pressed, Russia falls back on demands that Ukraine finds unacceptable, and Ukraine refuses to enter serious negotiations without a prior ceasefire[2].

**Inertia and Obstacles:**
- The status quo heavily favors a No outcome. Both sides see continued war as preferable to an unacceptable settlement, especially Ukraine, given public opinion and the risks of domestic backlash from ceding territory.
- Even if a ceasefire is agreed upon, the risk of immediate violation is high given the lack of trust, continued active operations, and the fragility of enforcement mechanisms.
- External actors (US, EU, Turkey) can help broker deals, but neither side appears close to a politically tenable compromise, and Russia has multiple incentives to drag out talks unless it gets its core demands.

**Odds of Change:**
- The probability of a bilateral ceasefire is higher than it was before the Trump administration’s renewed push, but deep underlying obstacles remain[1][2]. The likeliest scenario is that negotiations continue in stops and starts, but fighting persists beyond the deadline.

## Final Assessment

**Probability: 30%**

This reflects modestly increased odds given the new diplomatic efforts and external pressure, but still a greater likelihood that no bilateral, durable ceasefire will come into force by the end of 2025. The inertia of the war, uncompromising demands on both sides, and a history of failed talks all weigh in favor of the status quo, which is continued conflict[1][2][4].
