(a) Time until outcome: Approximately 5 months. The question will be resolved based on Eurostat's Q3 2025 GDP data, which should be released around October-November 2025.

(b) Status quo outcome: Spain continues to outpace Eurozone growth. Based on the most recent data and forecasts, Spain's economy has been growing significantly faster than the Eurozone average (3.2% vs. approximately 0.8% in 2024).

(c) Scenario for No outcome: Eurozone growth accelerates more rapidly than expected due to aggressive monetary easing by the ECB, while Spain experiences a sharper-than-anticipated economic slowdown due to weakening in key sectors (as suggested by recent data showing 6 out of 10 major sectors declining). Additionally, external shocks like U.S. trade policy changes could impact Spain's export-oriented sectors more severely than anticipated.

(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: Spain maintains its economic momentum through Q3 2025, continuing to benefit from strong tourism, robust household consumption, and resilient labor markets. The Eurozone continues to struggle with weak performance from major economies like Germany and France, maintaining the significant growth differential between Spain and the Eurozone average.

Based on the search results and current economic indicators, there is strong evidence that Spain's economy is likely to continue outperforming the Eurozone average through Q3 2025.

## Current Growth Differential

Spain has been consistently outgrowing the Eurozone by a significant margin. In 2024, Spain's economy grew by approximately 3.2%, which was about four times higher than the Eurozone average of 0.8%[1][2][5]. This robust growth has continued into 2025, with Spain's economy expanding by 0.6% in Q1 2025, making it the second fastest-growing economy in Europe behind Ireland[2].

## Growth Forecasts

Multiple economic forecasts support the continuation of Spain's outperformance:

- The European Commission projects Spain's economy to grow by 2.3% in 2025, compared to just 1.3% for the Eurozone[4]
- The International Monetary Fund recently upgraded Spain's 2025 growth forecast to 2.5%, confirming its position as one of the Eurozone's strongest performers[5]
- The Spanish government has increased its growth projections for 2025 to 2.4%, up 0.2 percentage points from previous estimates[5]

These forecasts consistently show Spain maintaining a growth advantage of approximately 1-1.2 percentage points over the Eurozone average through 2025.

## Growth Drivers

Spain's economic outperformance is supported by several structural factors that are likely to persist through Q3 2025:

1. **Strong domestic consumption**: Private consumption continues to be a key driver, supported by a resilient labor market and rising wages[1][5].

2. **Tourism sector strength**: Spain's tourism industry, which represents 13% of the economy, continues to show robust growth, with record numbers of visitors[5].

3. **Labor market resilience**: Continued job creation and declining unemployment rates are supporting household incomes and consumption[5].

4. **Investment recovery**: Investment is expected to strengthen in 2025, supported by EU recovery funds and looser monetary conditions[3][5].

## Potential Risks

Despite the positive outlook, there are several risks that could affect Spain's relative performance:

1. **Sectoral weaknesses**: Recent data suggests that 6 out of 10 major economic sectors in Spain are experiencing declines, which could eventually impact overall growth[2].

2. **External trade tensions**: Increasing U.S. protectionism and global trade tensions could disproportionately affect export-oriented European economies[3].

3. **Political uncertainty**: Domestic political instability in Spain could potentially affect policy implementation and economic confidence[5].

However, these risks appear to be outweighed by the strong fundamentals and positive momentum of the Spanish economy.

## Status Quo Persistence

It's important to note that economic growth patterns tend to be persistent in the short to medium term. The significant growth differential between Spain and the Eurozone has been maintained for several years and would require substantial changes in economic conditions to reverse within the next few quarters.

Considering the substantial current growth differential (approximately 2.4 percentage points), even if this gap were to narrow somewhat, it would still be highly likely that Spain would outgrow the Eurozone through Q3 2025.
