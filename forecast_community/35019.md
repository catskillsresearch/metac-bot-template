Spain’s economy is set to grow considerably faster than the Eurozone between Q3 2024 and Q3 2025, underpinned by a combination of structural advantages, favorable cyclical dynamics, and strong performance across key sectors.

Spain has maintained a pronounced growth lead over the Eurozone since 2023, with GDP expanding by 3.2% in 2024 and projected to grow by approximately 2.6% to 2.8% in 2025, according to the European Commission and other leading institutions. In contrast, consensus forecasts place Eurozone growth at only around 0.9% to 1.1% for 2025, creating a robust gap that has persisted into early 2025, where Spain’s Q1 growth (0.6%) was double that of the Eurozone (0.3%).

Several factors are driving Spain’s continued outperformance:

- **Robust Domestic Demand:** Spain’s private consumption remains strong, supported by steady job creation, rising wages, easing inflation, and improving household financial conditions. The labor market continues to add jobs at a healthy pace and wage growth further boosts purchasing power.
- **Resilient Tourism and Services:** Spain’s tourism sector, a critical economic contributor, is experiencing sustained momentum, and services exports continue to perform well. This resilience is especially evident in regions like the Canary Islands, which are projected to lead national growth.
- **Favorable Investment Outlook:** Corporate investment is being bolstered by continued deployment of EU recovery funds and a benign financial environment as monetary policy becomes more accommodative.
- **Institutional and Policy Support:** The broader macroeconomic policy stance remains supportive, helping buffer against external headwinds and underpinning the expansion of both consumption and investment.

While risks exist—including potential trade disruptions (notably from U.S. tariff policies), sectoral weakness in areas like finance and IT, or an unexpected resurgence of growth in core Eurozone economies such as Germany—these scenarios would require either a significant negative shock to Spain or a synchronised, substantial acceleration across the Eurozone’s major economies to close the current growth gap. The impact of such shocks remains limited in current baseline forecasts, with Spain’s diversified growth base and resilient internal demand providing buffers.

Finally, all major institutional and private-sector forecasts as of late May 2025 reinforce the expectation that Spain will continue to outgrow the Eurozone over the relevant period. Given the strength of the underlying drivers, recent comparative data, and the weight of forward-looking projections, Spain’s economy is highly likely to record higher real GDP growth than the Eurozone between Q3 2024 and Q3 2025.
