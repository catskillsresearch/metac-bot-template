(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  
As of May 13, 2025, there are about 7.5 months remaining before January 1, 2026, when the question will resolve based on whether a full-scale Chinese invasion of Taiwan has occurred.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
There will be no full-scale Chinese invasion of Taiwan by January 1, 2026; that is, no open-source, confirmed reports from sources like the Associated Press and The New York Times of a PLA invasion or a deployment of at least 1,000 PLA troops onto the main island with the aim of asserting PRC sovereignty.

(c) **Scenario for a No outcome:**  
China continues its current campaign of military coercion, pressure, and “grey zone” tactics—frequent air and naval incursions, live-fire exercises, and economic/political pressure—but does not escalate to an outright invasion or the deployment of 1,000+ ground troops onto Taiwan’s main island. The United States and its allies maintain deterrence through military presence and diplomatic signals, and no catastrophic crisis or miscalculation triggers direct conflict before the deadline[2].

(d) **Scenario for a Yes outcome:**  
A dramatic escalation occurs—perhaps following a political crisis, perceived provocation, or serious miscalculation—leading China to launch a full-scale amphibious assault or large-scale airborne operation, confirmed by major Western media, with at least 1,000 PLA troops landing on Taiwan with the declared aim of regime change or sovereignty transfer. This would likely come with international crisis, rapid global response, and major combat operations in and around Taiwan[1][4].

## Analytical Rationale

- **Weighting the Status Quo:**  
Historical precedent, expert analysis, and recent events all suggest inertia heavily favors the status quo in the Taiwan Strait. Since the end of the Chinese Civil War, despite spikes in tension, China has not initiated a direct military assault on Taiwan. The costs, risks, and uncertainties associated with a cross-strait invasion—particularly the high probability of U.S. military intervention and devastating global economic consequences—act as powerful deterrents, even as Chinese military capabilities and pressure campaigns intensify[2][1].

- **Recent Developments in 2025:**  
Military activity around Taiwan is at historic highs, with frequent incursions, blockades of sorts, live-fire drills, and psychological pressure[2][4]. However, these are widely interpreted as signals and coercion rather than pre-invasion mobilization. Multiple authoritative analyses (Institute for the Study of War, Chatham House, Council on Foreign Relations, ASPI) emphasize that PLA posturing aims to intimidate, wear Taiwan down, and test international resolve, but does not yet indicate imminent invasion[2].  

  China’s own internal assessments, per expert reporting, indicate concerns about the PLA’s readiness for complex amphibious operations, ongoing economic headwinds, and the risk of triggering U.S. involvement[2]. Most publicized war-game deadlines and risk assessments continue to highlight 2027 as a key year, not 2025, following Xi Jinping’s directive for PLA readiness by the PLA’s centenary[2].

- **Expert Consensus and Probabilities:**  
Leading Western intelligence, strategic, and academic sources currently estimate the likelihood of invasion before 2026 as below 20%[2]. Some outlier voices suggest a higher probability, but these are not the mainstream view. Most analysis sees a naval blockade, cyber/offensive action, or continued grey zone tactics as far more likely short-term escalatory steps[1].

- **Potential for Accidental Escalation:**  
While the risk of miscalculation is rising amid constant military activity, the threshold for a large-scale, deliberate invasion remains high. No open-source indicators suggest that the PLA is mobilizing for a landing of the necessary scale for scenario (2) of the question’s resolution criteria[2][4].

## Final Forecast

Given the available evidence, the historical stability of the status quo, the deterrent effect of the U.S. alliance structure, and the lack of concrete indicators of imminent invasion preparation, the probability of a full-scale Chinese invasion of Taiwan (as defined by the question) before January 1, 2026, is assessed as:

**Probability: 15%**

This reflects a non-zero but low likelihood—higher than in previous years, due to escalated tensions and capabilities, but still constrained by overwhelming structural disincentives and the absence of direct mobilization signals[2][1].
