(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
Reporting for calendar year 2025 will be finalized by the CDC after the year's end, likely in the first or second quarter of 2026. As of May 2025, about 7–12 months remain until the official average can be calculated and published.

(b) **Outcome if nothing changed:**  
If death counts remain at the most recently observed levels, the average would be calculated using the already reported (or closely estimated) deaths for 2022 and 2023, and projected values for 2024 and 2025. The best available official figures are:
- 2022: approximately 246,000 deaths
- 2023: approximately 76,000 deaths[5]
- 2024: trend suggests similar or fewer deaths than 2023
- 2025: trend so far suggests similar or fewer than 2024[1][3]
Estimated four-year average:  
\[
\frac{246,000 + 76,000 + 76,000 + 76,000}{4} = 118,500 \text{ deaths/year}
\]

(c) **Outcome if the current trend continued:**  
Deaths declined sharply from 2022 to 2023 and have remained at low levels through the start of 2025. If the 2024 and 2025 annual deaths mirror 2023 (around 76,000), the average remains about 118,500 deaths/year. If the downward trend accelerates (e.g., 2024 and 2025 see 50,000 deaths each), that average would drop closer to 112,000 deaths/year.

(d) **Expectations of experts and markets:**  
Community predictions and expert assessments are tightly clustered around a four-year average of about 117,000–120,000 deaths/year, with the 25th–75th percentile range spanning roughly 85,000 to 193,000 deaths/year[2]. The central forecast is in the 115,000–125,000 band, reflecting the very high 2022 death toll, followed by sustained lower annual mortality thereafter.

(e) **Unexpected scenario for a low outcome:**  
A dramatic and sustained reduction in COVID-19 deaths in late 2024 and 2025 – for example, due to a new, highly effective vaccine rollout, the near-elimination of severe disease through widespread population immunity, or an unexpected virus mutation rendering SARS-CoV-2 far less lethal – could sharply lower annual deaths to below 50,000, dragging the four-year average below 110,000.

(f) **Unexpected scenario for a high outcome:**  
An unforeseen event such as the emergence of a highly transmissible and immune-evasive variant causing a major new wave in late 2024 or 2025, with associated policy or healthcare system failures, could cause deaths to spike well above the recent baseline (potentially exceeding 100,000 in a year), increasing the four-year average above 130,000.
