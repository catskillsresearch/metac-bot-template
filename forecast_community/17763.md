# Will Threads Surpass Twitter in Monthly Active Users Before 2026?

As of May 2025, Threads has made remarkable progress, reaching 350 million monthly active users (MAUs) while X (formerly Twitter) maintains approximately 586-600 million MAUs. With roughly 7 months remaining until the end of 2025, the question is whether Threads can close this significant 236-250 million user gap.

## Current User Metrics & Growth Trajectories

Threads has demonstrated impressive growth since its July 2023 launch:
- February 2024: 130 million MAUs
- August 2024: 200+ million MAUs 
- November 2024: 275 million MAUs
- January 2025: 320 million MAUs
- April 2025: 350 million MAUs

This represents an average monthly growth of approximately 15-18 million users over recent periods, with some fluctuation in growth rates. Meanwhile, X maintains approximately 586-600 million MAUs as of early 2025. This creates a substantial gap of 236-250 million users that Threads would need to overcome.

## Mathematical Challenge

To surpass X by December 31, 2025, Threads would need to:
1. Add approximately 250 million users in 7 months (averaging 35-36 million new users monthly)
2. More than double its current growth rate of 10-15 million users per month
3. Simultaneously hope for X to experience user decline or minimal growth

Based on current trajectories, if Threads maintains its recent growth rate of 15 million users per month, it would add approximately 105 million users by December 2025, reaching around 455 million MAUs - still well below X's current 586-600 million.

## Factors Favoring Threads

Several elements support Threads' continued growth:

1. **Meta's Ecosystem Advantage**: Seamless integration with Instagram's massive user base provides a powerful onboarding channel and cross-platform promotion capabilities.

2. **Feature Development**: Meta continues enhancing Threads with new functionality including post scheduling, analytics, improved search, and transparency features like "Account Status".

3. **Platform Maturation**: The introduction of video ads signals that Threads has reached sufficient user engagement levels to begin monetization efforts.

4. **Consistency and Stability**: While X has faced numerous controversies under Elon Musk's leadership, including content moderation issues (with reports indicating 20% of posts contained antisemitic messages), Threads has positioned itself as a more stable alternative.

## Factors Favoring X

Despite Threads' momentum, several factors support X maintaining its lead:

1. **Substantial User Gap**: The 236-250 million MAU difference represents a formidable challenge to overcome in just 7 months.

2. **Network Effects**: As the incumbent platform, X benefits from strong network effects with established communities, celebrity/journalist presence, and entrenched user habits.

3. **Growth Rate Challenges**: Platforms typically follow an S-curve growth pattern - rapid acceleration followed by plateau. Threads' monthly user acquisitions may naturally decelerate rather than accelerate.

4. **Platform Engagement**: Despite impressive user acquisition, questions remain about engagement depth compared to X's highly active user base.

## Critical Uncertainties

Several unknowns could significantly impact this outcome:

1. **X's User Count Accuracy**: Some skepticism exists about X's reported figures, particularly regarding bot accounts and measurement methodology.

2. **Potential Black Swan Events**: Major platform controversies, outages, regulatory actions, or bans could dramatically alter the competitive landscape.

3. **International Expansion**: Threads' growth in markets where X might be struggling could accelerate its trajectory.

4. **User Retention**: Early data showed Threads struggled with retention after initial signups, though more recent figures suggest improved stickiness.

## Growth Projection Analysis

To close the gap by December 2025, Threads would need to dramatically accelerate its growth while X would need to experience significant decline:

- **Conservative Scenario**: At 15 million new users monthly, Threads reaches ~455 million MAUs (still ~145 million behind X)
- **Aggressive Scenario**: At 25 million new users monthly, Threads reaches ~525 million MAUs (still ~75 million behind X)
- **Extreme Scenario**: At 35+ million new users monthly, Threads reaches ~600 million MAUs (potentially surpassing X)

The extreme scenario would require Threads to more than double its recent growth rate while hoping X experiences stagnation or decline - a challenging proposition given platform dynamics at this scale.

## Conclusion

While Threads has demonstrated remarkable growth since its launch, closing a 250 million user gap in just 7 months represents an extraordinary challenge. The platform would need to dramatically accelerate its already impressive growth rate while X would need to experience significant user decline.

The most plausible scenario is that Threads continues strong but somewhat decelerating growth through 2025, potentially closing much of the gap with X but not quite overtaking it until 2026. If current trajectories hold, Threads appears well-positioned to eventually surpass X, but the timeframe of 7 months appears too short for this transition. However, given the volatile nature of social media platforms, unexpected events could still shift this trajectory in either direction.
