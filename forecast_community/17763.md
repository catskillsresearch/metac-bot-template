(a) Time left until outcome: About 7.5 months (from May 13, 2025 to December 31, 2025)
(b) Status quo outcome: Threads has 320-350 million MAUs, while X (Twitter) has between 349-611 million MAUs according to available estimates
(c) No scenario: Threads' growth stalls due to content moderation issues, spam problems, or user fatigue, while X successfully implements new features that attract and retain users
(d) Yes scenario: Threads maintains its current growth trajectory of adding 20-25 million MAUs per month, reaching over 500 million MAUs by December, surpassing X's user count

Based on the search results and recent data, I'll provide a detailed probabilistic forecast about whether Threads will surpass Twitter (now X) in monthly active users before 2026.

## Current User Base Analysis

As of May 2025, Threads has demonstrated remarkable growth, reaching approximately 320-350 million monthly active users (MAUs)[5][2]. This represents a significant increase from the 275 million MAUs reported in November 2024[2][4]. The platform has been consistently adding users at an impressive rate - approximately 20 million new users per month in recent periods[1][2].

Meanwhile, X (formerly Twitter) reports considerably varied user numbers depending on the source. While company announcements cite approximately 611 million MAUs[3], independent analytics firms have suggested lower numbers around 349-550 million[1]. This discrepancy creates some uncertainty in establishing a precise benchmark for Threads to surpass.

## Growth Trajectory Analysis

Threads has demonstrated exceptional growth momentum:

- July 2023 (launch): 100 million sign-ups in first five days[2]
- February 2024: 130 million MAUs[2]
- July 2024: 175 million MAUs[2]
- November 2024: 275 million MAUs[2][4]
- Early 2025: 320-350 million MAUs[5][2]

This represents a tripling of its user base in about one year, with growth actually accelerating rather than slowing. According to Meta's earnings calls, Threads added 100 million users between July and November 2024 alone, which represents a growth rate of approximately 25 million users per month during that period[4].

## Key Factors Supporting Continued Growth

1. **User Migration from X**: Evidence suggests Threads has benefited significantly from discontent with X's platform changes under Elon Musk's leadership. Reports indicate that many users have migrated from X to Threads due to concerns about content moderation, political polarization, and platform stability[4].

2. **Meta Ecosystem Integration**: Threads benefits from tight integration with Instagram's massive user base of over 2 billion users, providing a substantial pool for continued user acquisition[2].

3. **Feature Development**: Meta continues to invest heavily in Threads, adding features like post scheduling, analytics, and community notes that enhance user engagement and retention[2][5].

4. **Ad Monetization**: Meta has begun testing video ads on Threads, indicating confidence in the platform's future and providing resources for continued growth[5].

## Potential Limiting Factors

1. **Content Quality Concerns**: Recent reports indicate issues with spam and suspicious content recommendations on Threads, which could hamper user retention if not addressed[5].

2. **Competition from Other Platforms**: While X is Threads' primary competitor, platforms like Bluesky are also vying for users seeking alternatives to mainstream social media.

3. **Market Saturation**: The social media landscape is increasingly crowded, potentially limiting the overall growth potential for any single platform.

## Probabilistic Forecast

If Threads maintains its current growth trajectory of approximately 20 million new MAUs per month, it would add approximately 140 million users by December 31, 2025, reaching 460-490 million MAUs. This would likely surpass X's user count if:

1. X's growth remains stagnant or continues to decline
2. The lower-bound estimates of X's current MAUs (around 349-550 million) are more accurate than the company's self-reported figures

Given the consistent upward trajectory of Threads and the relative stability or decline of X, there is a strong probability that Threads will surpass X in MAUs before the end of 2025. The primary uncertainty lies in determining X's true current user base, but even taking the higher estimates, Threads' growth rate puts it on track to potentially surpass X within the timeframe.

The status quo typically has strong inertia, and X has been the dominant microblogging platform for many years. However, the evidence of Threads' accelerating growth and X's challenges suggests this is a case where the status quo may indeed be disrupted within the specified timeframe.

Probability: 75%
