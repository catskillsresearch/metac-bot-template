## Rationale for the Probability That Bitcoin Will Fall Below $10 (2021 USD) Before 2121

Bitcoin’s price as of June 2025 is above $100,000, having achieved repeated all-time highs and rebounded from significant corrections, which attests to its extraordinary resilience and the growing maturity of its market infrastructure. Institutional adoption, including the rapid accumulation of assets in spot Bitcoin ETFs and significant corporate treasury holdings, has reinforced Bitcoin’s position as a mainstream digital asset. This widespread adoption has created robust network effects and a financial ecosystem supporting high liquidity, brand recognition, and persistent demand.

Historically, Bitcoin has weathered multiple severe drawdowns, with declines exceeding 80% at times, but has never approached the $10 threshold since 2012. Each recovery has established higher price floors, reflecting growing confidence, institutional support, and technological maturity. The supply of Bitcoin on exchanges continues to decline, indicating strong holding behavior among investors. Parallel to this, regulated exchanges, custody solutions, and financial products have established a foundation that supports long-term stability and resilience.

Nonetheless, forecasting nearly a century into the future introduces profound uncertainty. Digital assets have no historical precedent for century-long durability, and technological obsolescence is a real risk. Over 96 years, existential threats could emerge, including quantum computing breakthroughs that render Bitcoin’s cryptography obsolete, comprehensive global regulatory bans, successful attacks on the protocol’s integrity, catastrophic loss of confidence, or the rise of a technologically superior alternative. Bitcoin, unlike gold, has no intrinsic non-monetary use; its value is entirely dependent on collective belief and technological infrastructure. This creates the theoretical possibility for a self-reinforcing collapse of confidence, especially if disrupted by societal, regulatory, or technological shocks.

For Bitcoin to fall below $10 (2021 USD), not only would it require a market decline of more than 99.99% from current levels, but also a near-total abandonment of the network by all users, miners, and institutions. Such a collapse would likely require a dramatic compound effect of multiple catastrophic events—technological obsolescence, irreparable protocol failure, aggressive international regulation, or a crisis of confidence so severe that even black-market, collector, or remittance value would evaporate.

Inertia and slow change dominate most financial asset trajectories. While most assets that have survived for decades or centuries—such as gold or major fiat currencies—did so through a combination of technological relevance, policy adaptation, and persistent demand, Bitcoin’s continued existence above $10 requires that at least one of its use cases or cultural narratives remains intact for the bulk of the century. Even if marginalized or eclipsed in mainstream finance, Bitcoin could persist with a niche, speculative, or symbolic value far above the $10 mark.

Given the scale of decline required, Bitcoin’s demonstrated historical resilience, the magnitude of current institutional and social capital invested, and the network effects that confer “stickiness” to digital artifacts, a fall below $10 remains possible but improbable. The risk, while nonzero, is contingent on unpredictable and compounding factors that would need to fundamentally undermine not just price but the very concept and infrastructure supporting decentralized digital value.

In summary, while the unprecedented duration of the forecast window ensures that existential risks must be taken seriously, the baseline evidence from market structure, adoption trends, and resilience through past crises supports the expectation that Bitcoin will not fall below $10 (2021 USD) before 2121—unless a combination of rare, systemic, and catastrophic failures occur.
