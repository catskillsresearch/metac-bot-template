(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
As of May 12, 2025, there are approximately seven weeks remaining until July 2025, when the question will be resolved.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
The current average UK house price remains well above the crash threshold of £260,968 (a 30% decline from June 2023's £372,812). Most industry forecasts and recent data predict modest house price growth or stability in 2025[1][3][4]. Therefore, if present conditions persist, the market will not experience a crash by the defined criteria.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
A No outcome occurs if the Rightmove House Price Index does not show a national average asking price at or below £260,968 for any month before July 2025. This is the default expectation: house prices remain above the crash threshold, supported by modest growth predictions, recovering mortgage affordability, and stable market fundamentals[1][3][4].

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
A Yes outcome only occurs if there is an extraordinary and sudden fall—over 30% from current prices—before July 2025. This scenario requires an extremely rapid and severe market shock, such as a major financial crisis, a swift and deep recession, or an abrupt collapse in mortgage credit and demand. There is no evidence such a scenario is currently unfolding, and nothing in recent forecasts points toward a fall of this magnitude[1][4][5].

## Rationale

The UK housing market in early 2025 is stable, with the average price still significantly above the crash threshold. Economic indicators, mortgage trends, and institutional forecasts all point toward modest growth or, at worst, flat prices for the remainder of 2025[1][3][4]. The time left until July 2025 is very short for a 30% price collapse to materialize. Historically, changes of this magnitude require a major economic or financial crisis, for which there is currently no sign.

Good forecasters assign extra weight to the status quo, especially over short time horizons, as dramatic changes are rare and usually require clear precursors. No such precursors are present now; if conditions persist, a crash is extremely unlikely. Only an unprecedented, sudden economic shock could trigger a crash, and the likelihood of this in the next seven weeks is highly remote.
