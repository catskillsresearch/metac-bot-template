(a) **Time until the outcome is known:**  
There are about seven weeks remaining until July 2025.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
The UK housing market has seen a significant price correction since June 2023, but current data (March/April 2025) shows average house prices at £268,000–£269,000, substantially above the crash threshold of £260,968. All major forecasts predict modest growth or stability for the rest of 2025[3][4]. If current trends continue, the outcome will be **No crash**.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
Prices remain stable or rise modestly. The average UK house price stays well above £260,968 through June 2025 due to easing mortgage rates, continued buyer demand, and gradual economic improvement. No unforeseen shocks hit the housing or financial system. The current trajectory, combined with expert predictions of 1–4% growth in 2025, means a crash is extremely unlikely barring a black swan event[2][3][4].

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
A sudden, severe economic shock (e.g., a financial crisis, rapid interest rate hikes, mass unemployment, or drastic policy changes) triggers an unprecedented collapse in buyer demand, with prices dropping over £7,000 within weeks. This scenario would require a monthly drop of more than £1,000 from an already low base—the steepest, fastest decline in modern UK housing history, and there is no evidence or credible forecast indicating this is imminent[2][3][4].

## Rationale

- The UK average house price as of March 2025 is £268,000[4], about 2.7% above the crash threshold.
- The trend for 2025 is modest growth, with forecasts projecting between +1.1% and +4% for the year[3].
- Mortgage rates, though high, are easing, and both demand and new supply show signs of resilience rather than panic[2][4].
- Underlying economic conditions (low unemployment, improving inflation, wage growth) provide additional stability[1].
- There are no signs of mass distress sales or sudden credit contraction. The housing market is not showing the characteristics of a bubble about to burst.
- Time is a critical factor: with less than two months left and no sign of accelerating declines, only an extraordinary, unforeseeable crisis could plausibly drive a 30% drop from June 2023 levels before July 2025[2][3][4].

## Final Assessment

**Probability: 1%**

A UK housing market crash to or below £260,968 in average asking price before July 2025 is extremely unlikely given current prices, expert forecasts, and the short time horizon remaining[3][4]. Only a truly unexpected and catastrophic shock could change this outcome.
