I'll analyze whether global average wealth per adult will increase in 2024 compared to 2023, based on the available data.

(a) Time until outcome is known: The outcome will be known when the World Inequality Database (WID) publishes its 2024 data. As of today (May 9, 2025), this data should already be available or soon to be published, as we're well into 2025.

(b) Status quo outcome: Based on the search results, wealth per adult dropped 3.6% to USD 84,718 at the end of 2022[5]. However, there was a significant recovery in 2023, with global wealth per adult growing by approximately 4.2%[5]. If this trend continues, the status quo would be continued growth in 2024.

(c) Scenario for No outcome: Global wealth per adult could decrease in 2024 if there was a major economic downturn, similar to what happened in 2022 when wealth declined due to a strong US dollar and currency effects[5]. Significant market corrections, geopolitical instability, or a new economic crisis could all lead to wealth contraction.

(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: If economic recovery continued through 2024, with stable or weakening US dollar, reduced inflation, and continued growth in emerging markets (particularly in Asia-Pacific), we would likely see increased global wealth per adult. The strong growth in 2023 (4.2% nominal and 8.4% real growth)[5] suggests momentum that could carry into 2024.

Looking at the available data, several factors suggest continued growth in wealth per adult for 2024:

## Historical Trends and Recent Performance

The search results indicate that global wealth experienced a significant recovery in 2023 after contracting in 2022. Total net private wealth fell 2.4% in 2022, while wealth per adult dropped 3.6% to USD 84,718[5]. This contraction was followed by a strong rebound in 2023, with approximately 4.2% growth that more than offset the previous losses[5].

Since 2008, wealth per adult has shown a consistent upward trajectory across most regions, though with varying growth rates. EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa) had the highest wealth per adult at approximately $166,000 in 2023, followed by APAC (Asia-Pacific) at $155,000, and the Americas at $146,000[5].

## Regional Growth Patterns

The search results show interesting regional patterns that could influence the 2024 outcome:

- Growth in wealth per adult since 2008 has been strongest in APAC (130%), followed by the Americas (100%), with EMEA showing the lowest growth at less than 30%[5].
- The convergence of emerging economies with mature markets continues, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region, which could support continued global growth in 2024.
- While the US has high levels of wealth per adult, its growth rate trails APAC[5], suggesting that developing economies might drive global averages upward in 2024.

## Inequality and Distribution Factors

The distribution of wealth remains highly uneven, with the US hosting 38% of the world's millionaires, Western Europe 28%, and China 10% as of 2023[5]. This concentration means that economic performance in these regions disproportionately affects global averages.

The search results indicate that inequality has decreased slightly in the US and Canada since 2008 (measured by the Gini coefficient)[5]. This suggests some redistribution of wealth that could positively impact median wealth figures.

## Considering the Status Quo Bias

As a forecaster, I must account for the status quo bias - the tendency for conditions to remain relatively stable over time. The world economy generally changes incrementally rather than dramatically, barring major shocks.

The 2023 recovery was robust, with real (inflation-adjusted) global wealth growing by nearly 8.4%, outpacing nominal growth as inflation slowed[5]. This strong momentum likely carried some inertia into 2024, and without evidence of major economic disruptions, the most probable outcome is continued growth, albeit possibly at a more moderate pace.

Furthermore, the search results don't indicate any major global policy shifts or economic crises that would suggest a reversal of the upward trend in 2024.

Probability: 75%
