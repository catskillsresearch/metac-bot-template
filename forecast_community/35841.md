(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
The 2025 Tour de France will finish on July 27, 2025. Today is May 13, 2025, so there are just under 11 weeks, or approximately 75 days, until the winner is officially known.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
If existing trends persist and all main contenders arrive healthy and in top form, Tadej Pogačar is the strong favorite to win the 2025 Tour de France. He is the defending champion, reigning world champion, and recently achieved the rare Triple Crown by winning the Giro d’Italia, Tour de France, and World Championships in 2024. The consensus among analysts is that he is the best all-around rider in the peloton and is not yet at his peak[1][3][5].

(c) **A scenario that results in an unexpected outcome:**  
A significant crash, illness, or early race incident could take out Pogačar or his closest rivals, as the Tour de France is notoriously dangerous[4]. If this happens, opportunistic rivals such as Jonas Vingegaard, Remco Evenepoel, or even a supporting rider like João Almeida or Juan Ayuso could capitalize. Alternatively, extreme weather or tactical errors could throw the race into chaos, opening the door for a 'dark horse' or outsider to claim the yellow jersey.

## Forecasting Rationale

- **Status Quo:**  
Pogačar’s dominance—winning virtually everything in 2024 including the Tour and the Worlds—positions him as the clear favorite. His versatility, climbing, time-trialing, and team strength put him above the rest[1][3][5].
- **Main Rivals:**  
Jonas Vingegaard has beaten Pogačar before and, as a two-time champion and 2024 runner-up, has the right skill set to win if circumstances tip in his favor. However, reports mention an unspecified “question mark” about his 2025 form[5].
- **Legitimate Challengers:**  
Remco Evenepoel, who finished third in his Tour debut in 2024 and is an exceptional time trialist, could win if he can match the top climbers on mountain stages. Primož Roglič, despite a history of bad luck in the Tour, is still one of the most talented Grand Tour riders.
- **True Outsiders:**  
João Almeida and Juan Ayuso, both teammates of Pogačar at UAE Team Emirates, are strong but would need to be unexpectedly unleashed or benefit from Pogačar's misfortune. Given team dynamics and pecking order, their chances are slim unless chaos ensues.
- **The 'Other' Option:**  
The Tour’s unpredictability always warrants a small probability for a shock outsider or a previously unheralded rider to seize the day.
