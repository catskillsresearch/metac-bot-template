Revolut is currently in the standard "mobilisation" phase after receiving its restricted UK banking license from the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) on July 25, 2024. This mobilisation phase, which typically lasts up to 12 months, is a common regulatory procedure for new banks in the UK and is designed to allow firms to build out their operations and demonstrate readiness to operate as a fully licensed bank. Historical precedent shows that other neobanks, such as Monzo and Starling, have successfully completed this phase within the expected timeline, setting a clear regulatory benchmark.

Recent operational updates indicate that Revolut is actively progressing toward full authorisation. By March 2025, Revolut had embarked on an aggressive hiring campaign to build out its UK banking operations, aiming to have a staff of around 200 by year-end. This significant allocation of resources highlights Revolut’s commitment to meeting PRA requirements. Furthermore, the company has been conducting critical system tests with a small group of customers to ensure operational robustness—a standard step in the mobilisation process. Revolut executives have consistently emphasized their ongoing, open dialogue with regulators, which is essential for addressing potential compliance issues promptly and maintaining alignment with PRA expectations.

No material regulatory concerns or delays have been reported as of late May 2025. Both internal communications from Revolut and external industry analysts suggest that the company remains on track, with no major obstacles or scandals emerging during the final stages of mobilisation. While there is always a possibility of unexpected regulatory findings, operational failures, or last-minute compliance requests that could marginally delay the process, such scenarios become progressively less likely as the culmination of the 12-month period approaches and no red flags have surfaced.

It is important to note that Revolut’s large UK customer base and complex operations do raise the stakes for regulatory diligence, but the company’s track record during this phase, robust financial performance, and high strategic prioritization of the UK bank launch—including significant investments in staff and infrastructure—mitigate many of these risks. Moreover, Revolut’s broader strategic ambitions, such as establishing a Western Europe HQ and pursuing new banking licenses in regions like France, further incentivize a timely and successful transition to a fully licensed UK bank.

Given these factors—the standard regulatory timeline, Revolut’s demonstrable operational progress, industry precedent, proactive engagement with regulators, and absence of publicized setbacks—the removal of restrictions before July 26, 2025, is the most likely outcome, with only a limited risk of last-minute complications.
