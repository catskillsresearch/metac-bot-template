The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has consistently maintained a strong stance against same-sex marriage, affirming that marriage should only be between a man and a woman. This position is deeply rooted in the Church's theological framework, which emphasizes the importance of traditional marriage in achieving eternal exaltation. Despite societal pressures and legal developments, the Church has reaffirmed its doctrine on marriage as unchanged, even when supporting legislation like the Respect for Marriage Act, which it views as essential for protecting religious freedom rather than endorsing same-sex marriage.

Several factors contribute to the low likelihood of the Church changing its stance on same-sex marriage by 2030:

1. **Doctrinal Authority and Change Mechanism**: Major doctrinal changes in the Church typically require explicit revelation to Church leadership. The President of the Church, considered a prophet, plays a crucial role in announcing such changes.

2. **Institutional Structure and Leadership**: The Church's hierarchical structure and conservative leadership make it challenging for sudden doctrinal shifts. Senior leaders are generally older and more traditionally inclined, contributing to the stability of Church doctrine.

3. **Global Considerations**: The Church operates globally, and while societal attitudes vary significantly across regions, the Church maintains its doctrine consistently worldwide. This approach helps ensure that its teachings are not diluted by varying cultural norms.

4. **Recent Reaffirmations**: Church leadership has explicitly stated that the doctrine on marriage "will remain unchanged," emphasizing this stance even in the context of supporting civil protections for LGBTQ+ individuals.

5. **Distinction Between Policy and Doctrine**: While the Church has softened some policies, such as reducing harsh disciplinary measures against same-sex married members, these adjustments are characterized as policy changes rather than doctrinal revisions.

6. **Generational Shifts and External Pressures**: Although younger Church members may hold more accepting views toward LGBTQ+ issues, there is currently no indication that these shifts will lead to a doctrinal change regarding same-sex marriage within the Church.

Overall, the Church's stance on same-sex marriage is deeply entrenched in its theological and institutional framework, making a significant doctrinal shift highly unlikely by 2030.
