Online poker currently enjoys robust liquidity, with numerous real‐money sites routinely hosting over 1,000 cash players at various stakes, creating a strong foundation for a thriving human-centric ecosystem. Over the next five years and seven months, the market’s historical resilience and the incremental pace of change suggest that the status quo is likely to persist—provided the industry continues to adapt. Key to this adaptation is the ongoing investment in and enhancement of advanced anti‐bot detection technologies and regulatory measures designed to counter any breakthrough in sophisticated AI bot technology. Successful prevention of widespread, undetectable bot infiltration is essential for maintaining player trust and ensuring that human participation remains at levels required to keep a healthy number of viable sites active. Conversely, if the industry fails to keep pace with rapid advances in AI—resulting in the proliferation of superhuman bots that undermine game fairness and erode player confidence—then liquidity could collapse, driving significant portions of the market to drop below survivable thresholds. Given the current state of the industry and its track record of gradual, adaptive change, however, the factors supporting a stable, human-based online poker environment remain strong despite evolving technological challenges.
