# Approval Rating Comparison: Carney vs. Trump for July 1, 2025

As of mid-May 2025, the approval rating landscape between Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and US President Donald Trump shows a notable disparity that will likely persist through Canada Day.

## Current Approval Standing

Donald Trump's approval rating stands at 40% according to April 2025 data, reflecting a 7-point decline from February. This downturn correlates with widespread disapproval of key Trump policies:
- 59% of Americans disapprove of his tariff increases
- 55% disapprove of federal department and agency cuts
- 51% believe he's overusing executive orders for policymaking

Mark Carney, while lacking exact Morning Consult figures, demonstrates stronger public support with approximately 48% approval and only 30% disapproval based on March polls. An Ipsos poll showed 44% of Canadians selected Carney as "best Prime Minister," giving him a double-digit lead over his main opponent.

## Factors Strengthening Carney's Position

**Honeymoon Period Momentum**: Having just formed his cabinet on May 13, 2025, Carney benefits from the traditional approval boost new leaders typically enjoy in their early months. This timing aligns perfectly with the July 1 comparison date.

**Strong Anti-Trump Positioning**: Carney has effectively positioned himself as a defender of Canadian sovereignty against Trump's rhetoric about annexing Canada. This stance resonates strongly with Canadians, 77% of whom view Trump negatively according to March polling.

**Economic Credentials and Focus**: As a former central banker, Carney's economic expertise gives him credibility on financial matters. His focus on middle-class tax cuts and eliminating interprovincial trade barriers by July 1 appeals to voters concerned about economic issues.

**Cabinet Efficiency**: Carney has streamlined his cabinet from 39 to 29 ministers, signaling a focus on efficiency and economic growth that could bolster public perception.

**Cross-Party Appeal**: Polling indicates Carney enjoys stronger cross-partisan appeal than his political rivals. Liberals strongly favor Carney (86%), while Conservatives dislike him less (65%) than Liberals dislike Conservative leader Poilievre (74%).

## Trump's Challenging Outlook

**Historically Low Approval**: Trump's approval ratings have consistently been among the lowest of modern presidents, with remarkable stability in his support base regardless of events.

**Policy Unpopularity**: Current polling shows majority disapproval for Trump's signature policies, particularly regarding tariffs that have caused market volatility.

**Canadian-American Tensions**: Trump's aggressive stance toward Canada has damaged his image internationally while simultaneously boosting Carney's domestic standing as Canadians rally behind their leader.

**Polarization Ceiling**: The deeply polarized American political landscape limits Trump's potential approval ceiling, even if economic conditions improve.

## Key Variables Before July 1

Several factors could influence approval ratings in the remaining 47 days:

- Implementation success of Carney's promised tax cuts and trade barrier removals by July 1
- Development of US-Canada trade tensions and sovereignty disputes
- Economic performance indicators in both countries
- Potential international crises or domestic issues

While unexpected events could shift public opinion, Trump's historically stable approval patterns suggest dramatic changes are unlikely absent extraordinary circumstances.

Canadians increasingly see Carney as the leader best suited to handle relations with Trump, with the Liberal Party rated most capable of addressing Trump's tariff threats. This perception, combined with Carney's momentum and Trump's challenges, creates a favorable environment for Carney to maintain higher approval through July 1, 2025.
