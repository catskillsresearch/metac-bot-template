(a) **Time Left Until the Outcome Is Known**

Roughly 7.5 months remain until January 1, 2026—the deadline for any legislative action to reduce the planned phase-out date of the Section 48E Clean Electricity Investment Tax Credit (ITC), or to repeal it, for this forecast’s resolution.

(b) **Status Quo Outcome If Nothing Changed**

If Congress and the administration take no action before January 1, 2026, the outcome would be:  
**No sunset reduction before 2026.**  
The 48E ITC would remain scheduled to phase out at the later of 2032 or when U.S. electricity sector greenhouse gas emissions fall to 25% of 2022 levels[1][2][5]. Recent Treasury and IRS regulations further support a full implementation track for the tax credit[2][4][5].

(c) **Description of a Scenario That Results in an Unexpected Outcome**

A plausible unexpected scenario could involve a rapid political shift. For example, if budget negotiations in Congress bog down over extending Trump-era tax cuts, and a majority of Republicans (even those from clean-energy-friendly districts) close ranks behind a fiscal package, 48E could be subject to immediate repeal with little or no safe harbor to grandfather ongoing projects, especially if procedural rules (like budget reconciliation) are used to speed passage. Alternatively, a moderate bipartisan bloc could insist on a softer phaseout, resulting in a 2027–2028 sunset with broad safe harbor protections.

## Rationale

### Current Legislative Context

- The House GOP has unveiled a comprehensive tax bill that proposes to phase out both the clean electricity production (45Y) and investment (48E) credits, years ahead of their current schedule[3].
- The bill specifically targets most major Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) clean energy tax credits for accelerated phase-out or repeal, and appears designed to fund extensions of other tax cuts[3].
- Details indicate an intent to end or sharply limit the credit before the existing 2032/25% emissions trigger[3].

### Evidence of Specific House Action

- The House Ways and Means Committee is actively reviewing these proposals and seeks passage by early July 2025[3].
- While much of the media and legislative reporting focuses on electric vehicle credits, explicit references to phasing out the clean electricity credits (45Y and 48E) are present in multiple sources[3].

### Political and Practical Risks

- The House Republican majority is slim, and some members represent districts with substantial clean energy activity, creating risks for party defections[3].
- Senate passage and presidential approval are not assured, but, with a Republican trifecta (White House, Senate, House), and ability to use budget reconciliation, the path exists for passage by a simple majority.

### Stakeholder Resistance

- Mayors, attorneys general, and some Republicans are publicly urging Congress to retain at least some clean energy credits, citing economic/job impacts and industrial policy reasons. This splits Republican strategy between fast repeal and phased, “thoughtful” phaseouts with safe harbors for ongoing investments.

### Implementation Status

- Regulations for the 48E ITC have been finalized; the credit has only just become available for new construction as of January 1, 2025[2][4][5].
- There is no evidence yet of enacted changes—but the House is moving quickly toward a vote, and the timeline for presidential signature could make changes effective soon after July 2025, well before 2026[3].

## Probabilities (with rationale)

- The default, status quo scenario ("No sunset reduction before 2026") has substantially weakened due to concrete legislative action targeting all major IRA clean energy credits.
- The most probable outcome is a phase-out or repeal effective in 2025 or 2026, and safe harbor provisions are historically common for ongoing investments in such transitions, but not guaranteed.

| Outcome                                 | Probability | Reasoning                                                                                                                                                         |
|------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 2025-2026 sunset w/o safe harbor         | 15          | Aggressive House proposals, budget pressures, but potential pushback from project developers and some pro-renewable districts.                                    |
| 2025-2026 sunset w/ safe harbor          | 38          | Most likely: phase-out or repeal made effective 2025/26, but “grandfathering” of projects underway to avoid market chaos and lawsuits.                            |
| 2027-2028 sunset w/o safe harbor         | 7           | Less likely, but could result from Senate negotiations or as a compromise if moderate Republicans balk at 2025/26 cutoff.                                         |
| 2027-2028 sunset w/ safe harbor          | 9           | Some chance of a phaseout compromise pushing the sunset out a bit, with safe harbor for projects already in the pipeline.                                         |
| 2029-2031 sunset w/o safe harbor         | 2           | Very unlikely, but not impossible if Congress slows its pace or if negotiations drag out, leading to a mid-term phase-out.                                        |
| 2029-2031 sunset w/ safe harbor          | 4           | Safe harbor could still be attached to a later phaseout, but political momentum is for faster action.                                                             |
| No sunset reduction before 2026          | 25          | Still meaningful, as legislative gridlock or successful advocacy campaigns could stall changes, but status quo is no longer the leading scenario.                 |

### Final Probabilities

2025-2026 sunset w/o safe harbor: 15  
2025-2026 sunset w/ safe harbor: 38  
2027-2028 sunset w/o safe harbor: 7  
2027-2028 sunset w/ safe harbor: 9  
2029-2031 sunset w/o safe harbor: 2  
2029-2031 sunset w/ safe harbor: 4  
No sunset reduction before 2026: 25

**Summary:**  
The most likely next development is that Congress enacts legislation in 2025 to sunset or repeal the 48E Clean Electricity Investment Tax Credit effective 2025 or 2026, with a safe harbor for projects already underway, though significant uncertainty remains due to political dynamics and possible legislative gridlock[3].
