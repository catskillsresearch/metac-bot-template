## Rationale for What Will Happen Next Concerning the Repeal of the 48E (ITC) Clean Electricity Tax Credit

The outlook for the repeal or accelerated sunset of the 48E Clean Electricity Investment Tax Credit is shaped by an intersection of legislative momentum, political constraints, economic considerations, and industry influence.

**Legislative Developments and Timeline**

In spring 2025, House Republicans passed the "One Big Beautiful Bill," proposing a significant acceleration of the 48E tax credit phaseout. Instead of the original schedule—where 48E would sunset no earlier than 2032 or when U.S. power sector emissions drop below 25% of 2022 levels—the House bill mandates a phaseout beginning after 2028, reducing the credit by 20% per year from 2029 and eliminating it entirely after 2031. Variations of the bill and amendments from conservative members suggest even stricter cutoffs, including ending eligibility for projects that do not begin construction within 60 days of enactment.

**Political Context and Constraints**

While Republicans currently control the White House, Senate, and House, their majority in the House is slim. Many Republican representatives hail from districts with significant clean energy investments, creating political incentives to protect economic interests and mitigate potential job losses in their constituencies. These dynamics have already shifted the legislative strategy from immediate repeal to a more gradual phaseout, with transition periods and the prospect of safe harbor provisions for ongoing projects. 

The pathway through the Senate—likely via budget reconciliation—remains open for such legislation, but negotiations could further adjust the sunset timeline or expand safe harbor protections to secure enough support from moderate or industry-aligned lawmakers.

**Industry Influence and Economic Impact**

Industry lobbying and real-world economic projections are shaping the conversation. Studies warn that repealing or sharply curtailing 48E could increase electricity prices for consumers and businesses, reduce U.S. GDP, and cost hundreds of thousands of jobs by 2030. These findings have gained traction in public and legislative debates, reinforcing the push for safe harbor provisions to protect projects already underway and for phaseout schedules that avoid abrupt economic disruption.

**Safe Harbor and Compromise Dynamics**

The mounting political and economic pressures make it highly probable that any enacted repeal or phaseout of the 48E credit will include safe harbor provisions for projects already in development, minimizing shocks to ongoing investment and allowing lawmakers to claim both fiscal discipline and economic stewardship. The House-passed version already reflects this dynamic by phasing out rather than immediately repealing the credits and signaling openness to tailored exceptions and transition rules. 

**Potential Obstacles to Legislative Action**

Despite the momentum, there remains a nontrivial risk that legislative gridlock, intra-party divisions—especially from moderates in clean energy–dependent districts—or unforeseen economic or energy crises could delay or block the passage of any repeal or modification before the January 1, 2026 deadline.

**Conclusion**

Congress is likely to enact an accelerated phaseout of the 48E credit before January 1, 2026, with a structure resembling the House proposal: an earlier sunset beginning after 2028 and a phase-down to 2031, paired with safe harbor protections for ongoing or shovel-ready projects. However, the exact timing and nature of these provisions will depend on continued intra-party negotiations and the outcome of the legislative process in the Senate. There is still a meaningful, though smaller, chance that action could stall, resulting in no sunset reduction before the deadline. This outlook reflects current legislative text, political realities, and the influence of industry and economic considerations.
