Based on the search results, I'll provide an analysis of whether EnergyStar.gov will still be online on July 1, 2025, combining the key elements from both forecasts.

The Energy Star program is currently in a precarious position following the Trump administration's announced plans to eliminate it as part of broader EPA restructuring efforts. As of May 14, 2025, we have approximately 1.5 months until the resolution date of July 1, 2025, when the website's status will be determined.

## Current Status and Context

EnergyStar.gov remains online and operational as of early May 2025, though with some degradation in services. The ProductFinder tool is currently unavailable due to "ongoing maintenance", but the website continues to provide information about 2025 product criteria and tax credit changes.

The EPA has announced plans to eliminate the Energy Star program as part of broader agency restructuring aimed at reducing costs. According to reports, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin stated the reorganization "will save at least $300 million annually for the American people". Senior EPA officials, including Paul Gunning (Director of the Office of Atmospheric Protection), have communicated that the program and its overseeing office are slated for elimination.

## Factors Supporting Continued Website Operation

Several factors suggest EnergyStar.gov may remain online through July 1, 2025:

1. **Statutory Obligations**: The EPA has reiterated its commitment to "fulfilling all of our statutory obligations". Energy Star is tied to federal tax credits that remain active, with the website specifically providing updated guidance for claiming these credits in 2025.

2. **Lack of Timeline**: Despite the announced elimination, no public statement or timeline from the EPA specifies a shutdown date for EnergyStar.gov specifically.

3. **Administrative Inertia**: Government program shutdowns, especially those requiring coordination across agencies and external stakeholders, typically occur gradually rather than abruptly.

4. **Industry and Political Pressure**: Nearly 1,100 companies and organizations have urged the EPA to maintain full funding and staffing levels for Energy Star, indicating significant stakeholder resistance to rapid elimination.

## Factors Supporting Website Shutdown

Countering these points are several factors that could lead to the website being offline by July 1:

1. **Clear Elimination Directive**: The administration has explicitly targeted Energy Star for elimination, not just reduction, suggesting a comprehensive shutdown is planned.

2. **Budget Priorities**: The reorganization aims to save hundreds of millions of dollars, creating strong financial incentives to shut down program infrastructure quickly.

3. **Political Will**: Strong political determination could accelerate the shutdown process beyond typical government timelines.

4. **Early Signs of Degradation**: Some Energy Star web services are already experiencing "maintenance" issues, potentially signaling the beginning of a phased shutdown.

## Probabilistic Assessment

Considering these factors, the most likely scenario is that EnergyStar.gov will still be accessible on July 1, 2025, though possibly in a reduced or static state. The timeline of less than two months from mid-May to July 1 is relatively short for complete decommissioning of a federal website tied to ongoing tax credits and statutory requirements.

The key determining factors are:
- The pace of administrative execution
- Whether statutory obligations (particularly tax credit verification) will maintain the website's necessity
- The extent of political pressure from stakeholders

While the program's eventual elimination appears certain based on current policy, the inertia of government operations and legal requirements suggest the website will likely remain accessible at the specific checkpoint date of July 1, 2025.
