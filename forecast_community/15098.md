The timeline for assessing whether Russia will democratize substantially hinges on when Vladimir Putin ceases to be President. If he were to leave office soon, the relevant period for evaluating democratization would extend five years from that point. However, as long as he remains in power, this timeline is pushed further into the future.

Currently, Russia is classified as a "Consolidated Authoritarian Regime" by Freedom House, with deeply entrenched authoritarian structures. The political environment is characterized by a significant consolidation of power, suppression of political opposition, and control over media. These factors create substantial barriers to democratization, making the status quo outcome one where Russia remains authoritarian unless significant systemic changes occur.

A scenario leading to continued authoritarianism would involve Putin's successor maintaining or even intensifying the existing regime's policies. This could happen through a leader from within Putin's inner circle or the security apparatus, ensuring the persistence of the authoritarian status quo. The entrenched political structures, lack of independent media, and suppression of opposition would likely continue, maintaining Russia's classification as a Consolidated Authoritarian Regime.

Conversely, a scenario that could lead to democratization would require a significant political upheaval or reform movement following Putin's departure. This could be triggered by internal dissent, economic pressures, or external influences, leading to a more open political environment. A new leadership committed to democratic reforms could implement changes such as free and fair elections, independent media, and the protection of civil liberties, moving Russia towards a Transitional or Hybrid Regime classification.

However, given the current political landscape, the entrenched nature of the authoritarian regime, and the lack of strong opposition structures, the probability of substantial democratization within five years of Putin leaving office is low. Historical trends and recent developments suggest continuity rather than rapid change. While external factors or internal crises could create opportunities for democratization, these are unpredictable and historically rare in Russia's context. Therefore, the status quo outcome of continued authoritarianism is more likely.
