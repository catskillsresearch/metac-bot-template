# The Equal Rights Amendment Certification: Analysis Through May 2025

As of late May 2025, the National Archivist has maintained a consistent position refusing to certify and publish the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) as the 28th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. This stance is explicitly grounded in "established legal, judicial, and procedural decisions" referencing the expired congressional ratification deadline.

## Current Status and Legal Context

The ERA presents a unique constitutional circumstance as "the only proposed constitutional amendment to achieve approval by 38 states after the expiration of a ratification deadline set and extended by Congress". Despite meeting the Article V requirement of ratification by three-fourths of states, certification remains blocked primarily due to deadline issues.

The National Archives' position has been reinforced by:

- Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) opinions from 2020 and 2022 stating the "ratification deadline established by Congress for the ERA is valid and enforceable" and that the amendment "had expired and was therefore no longer pending before the states"
- Federal court decisions that have largely upheld the validity of the ratification deadline
- The Archivist's December 2024 statement explicitly declaring that "the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) cannot be certified as part of the Constitution"

## Political Developments and Institutional Responses

In January 2025, President Biden made a significant declaration, stating that the ERA had "cleared all necessary hurdles to be formally added to the Constitution as the 28th Amendment". However, this presidential recognition did not translate into certification action, as the White House clarified that Biden would not order the Archivist to certify the amendment.

The American Bar Association passed a resolution in August 2024 declaring the ERA ratified as the 28th Amendment, providing significant professional legal backing. Despite this institutional support and continued advocacy pressure, the National Archives has maintained its procedural stance, viewing its role as upholding the integrity of the constitutional amendment process rather than making interpretive judgments.

## Institutional Inertia and Procedural Conservatism

The National Archives and its leadership have demonstrated strong institutional conservatism regarding the ERA. The agency views its certification role as procedural rather than interpretive, and has consistently deferred to Congress or the courts to resolve the deadline issue before taking action. This position has transcended political administrations and appears deeply embedded in the institution's approach.

Without unequivocal direction from Congress or the judiciary, the Archivist has been unwilling to act unilaterally, especially given the unprecedented nature of certifying an amendment ratified after its congressional deadline had expired. The Archives' reluctance is reinforced by fear of overstepping its authority in this unique constitutional situation.

## Potential Paths to Certification by June 2025

For certification to occur by June 30, 2025, one of several significant developments would need to happen:

1. **Judicial Intervention**: A federal court could issue a binding order compelling the Archivist to certify the ERA regardless of deadline concerns.

2. **Congressional Action**: Congress could pass legislation removing or retroactively extending the ratification deadline, explicitly directing the Archivist to proceed with certification.

3. **Administrative Reversal**: The Archivist could independently reverse the institution's long-standing position, determining that Article V requirements have been met regardless of deadline issues.

4. **Leadership Change**: New leadership at the National Archives could bring a different interpretation of the Archivist's role and legal obligations regarding the ERA.

However, the short timeframe remaining (approximately 5 weeks until the June 30 deadline) makes such dramatic shifts unlikely without extraordinary developments.

## Conclusion

The institutional position against certification remains robust, with no evidence as of late May 2025 of imminent action from Congress or the courts that would alter this stance. While certification is not impossible, it would require a significant and abrupt departure from established legal interpretations and institutional practices within a very limited timeframe.
