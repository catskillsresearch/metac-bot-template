(a) **Time until outcome is known:**  
There are approximately 7.5 months (over 230 days) remaining until January 1, 2026, when the question will be resolved.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
As of now, Anthropic has not announced Claude 4 or an explicit successor to the Claude 3/3.7 model family. The latest official release is Claude 3.7 Sonnet, and no formal documentation or publication by Anthropic declares the creation, performance, or existence of a “Claude 4” or equivalent[1][4][5].

(c) **A scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
Anthropic does not make a public announcement meeting the specified criteria (blog post, article, or video with explicit successor language and any performance results) before January 1, 2026. Reasons could include technical delays, strategic rebranding, a pivot to incremental (3.x) upgrades, or unforeseen corporate/investment changes that slow major releases[5].

(d) **A scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
Anthropic publishes an official document before January 1, 2026, announcing a new major AI model—explicitly positioned as the successor to the Claude 3/3.7 family (regardless of whether the name is “Claude 4” or a rebranded equivalent)—and includes some performance results or an indication the model exists, even if only in testing. This scenario would align with Anthropic’s historical cadence of frequent major upgrades and would follow through on credible industry rumors and internal leaks anticipating a 2025 announcement[1][4][5].

## Rationale and Forecast

Anthropic’s historical pattern has been to release significant upgrades every few months, with each cycle bringing substantial improvements to reasoning, multimodal understanding, and safety features[1][4]. The leap from Claude 3.5 to 3.7 in early 2025 preserved this cadence. Industry insiders and multiple media reports in early 2025 suggested that Claude 4 was in the final stages of development, with some expecting its debut as early as late February to March 2025[1][4][5]. However, as of mid-May 2025, no official announcement meets the resolution criteria.

Despite the absence of a formal release so far, the AI field is highly competitive. Anthropic faces continued pressure from OpenAI and Google DeepMind to maintain relevance, which has historically driven frequent, prominent releases. Market and investor expectations further incentivize a major update in 2025[1][5].

That said, there is always a risk that Anthropic could shift strategy, focusing on further incremental Claude 3.x enhancements or rebrand their next major leap to a different naming convention. Additionally, unforeseen technical, legal, or ethical complications could slow their timeline[5].

Historically, the status quo exerts a strong pull: most companies do not radically change their upgrade pace or market behavior without cause. Still, in this sector—where rapid iteration is the norm and there is extensive evidence of ongoing work toward a major successor—a total absence of a major release throughout the rest of 2025 would be more surprising than its arrival, especially given the strong speculative signals and Anthropic’s competitive positioning[1][4][5].

**Probability: 85%**

I estimate an 85% probability that Anthropic will announce an AI Claude 4 model (or equivalent successor, per the criteria) before January 1, 2026. This reflects both the high likelihood based on past trends and credible rumors, and a 15% allowance for potential delays, rebranding, or other disruptions that could preclude a qualifying announcement.
