Anthropic officially announced the Claude 4 model series—comprising Claude Opus 4 and Claude Sonnet 4—on May 22, 2025, marking a major advancement in their AI model lineup. This announcement was made at their first-ever developer conference and was widely documented through official channels and major industry partners.

The Claude 4 series is explicitly positioned as the successor to the Claude 3/3.7 line, satisfying all established criteria for a significant next-generation release. In clear contrast to incremental updates, such as the hypothetical continuation of the 3.x line, the new models feature a new major version designation and are described as a marked step forward in capabilities and performance.

Claude Opus 4 is highlighted as Anthropic's most intelligent model to date, excelling particularly in coding and agentic tasks, with performance that surpasses previous benchmarks. Sonnet 4, meanwhile, replaces Sonnet 3.7 and offers a balance of intelligence and efficiency, designed for everyday use but still incorporating major improvements.

Both models feature advanced hybrid reasoning capabilities, which allow toggling between near-instant responses and extended, multi-step reasoning for long-running, complex tasks. This includes the ability to analyze thousands of data sources, execute lengthy workflows, and perform coding at the highest level. The models’ technical advancements include state-of-the-art context windows (up to 200K tokens) and the ability to maintain focus and accuracy over many sequential tasks.

These models are available through Anthropic’s own user tiers (Pro, Max, Team, Enterprise) as well as for developers via the Anthropic API, Amazon Bedrock, and Google Cloud’s Vertex AI, reflecting a broad commercial rollout. Pricing is transparently structured, with Claude Opus 4 starting at $15 per million input tokens and $75 per million output tokens, alongside substantial cost savings via prompt caching and batch processing.

The launch event emphasized the models' role in advancing autonomous AI agents, coding proficiency, and agentic reasoning, underscoring that this is a generational leap rather than a mere incremental update. All relevant announcement documentation, technical performance results, and product details were made publicly available, leaving no ambiguity regarding the transition to the Claude 4 generation.

In summary, the criteria for a major model announcement were fully met: Anthropic publicly introduced Claude 4 models within 2025, as explicit successors to the Claude 3/3.7 line, featuring substantial improvements and widespread availability—firmly establishing the release as a transformative event in the company’s roadmap.
