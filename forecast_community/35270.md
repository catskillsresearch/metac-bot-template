(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  
The outcome will be determined by January 1, 2026. As of May 9, 2025, there are just under 8 months remaining.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
OpenAI has repeatedly stated that GPT-5 is planned for release "within months" of early 2025 and that it will be the successor to GPT-4.5, which launched at the end of February 2025. The current trajectory—if announcements and project momentum hold—points toward a "Yes" outcome, as all signals suggest an announcement is planned for 2025[1][2][3][4][5].

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
A "No" would result if OpenAI, due to technical, strategic, or regulatory hurdles, delays the announcement or release of GPT-5 until after January 1, 2026. This could also occur if OpenAI shifts focus to incremental updates (e.g., more o-series releases) or entirely new branding, and either does not reference the next system as GPT-5 or fails to publish a qualifying announcement before the deadline[5].

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
A "Yes" will occur if OpenAI publishes a blog post, article, or official video before January 1, 2026, that describes GPT-5’s existence or performance results. This could happen anytime in mid-to-late 2025, especially since their CEO and official sources have indicated a "months" timeline since February-April 2025—even factoring recent delays[1][2][3][4][5].

## Rationale

- OpenAI follows a pattern of releasing major models every 12–15 months. GPT-4.5 shipped in late February 2025, and several high-level statements from OpenAI leadership explicitly position GPT-5 as the next major release for both API and ChatGPT users[4][1][2][3].
- Sam Altman and OpenAI have been clear, as recently as April 2025, that GPT-5 is coming "in a few months," even after acknowledging some delays to ensure model quality and sufficient infrastructure[5].
- Industry tracking and external coverage converge on a mid-to-late 2025 launch expectation, with only modest risk of significant additional slippage[1][2][3][5].
- The only meaningful uncertainties are technical/integration hurdles or unforeseen strategic changes; however, OpenAI’s market incentives and history with prior releases make further year-long delays less likely unless a major disruption occurs.

Given that the "status quo" is a highly likely "Yes" and forecasting best practice is to weigh this heavily unless strong contrary evidence emerges, the probability of a qualifying GPT-5 announcement in 2025 remains high.

Probability: 85%
