## Rationale for the Maximum Number of Humans Uploaded in Any 5-Year Period if Whole Brain Emulation Is Achieved by 2100

Progress toward successful whole brain emulation (WBE) before 2100 faces formidable technical, ethical, legal, and societal barriers. As of 2025, no human-level brain emulation has been demonstrated and only small animal brains have been fully mapped at high resolution, underscoring the enormous complexity and data requirements of the human brain, which contains approximately 86 billion neurons and trillions of connections. While some futurists anticipate significant advances by mid-century, the prevailing view among neuroscientists and technical experts is that WBE, especially at scale, is unlikely to be realized this century. Even optimistic forecasts typically view technical feasibility as plausible but not imminent, with median expert projections often extending into the 22nd century.

If WBE does become possible, initial adoption will be tightly circumscribed by the destructive nature of scanning, high costs, and psychological, ethical, and regulatory concerns. Early users are expected to come from a tiny, highly selective elite, such as notable figures, wealthy individuals, or those facing terminal illness—paralleling scenarios described in Robin Hanson’s "The Age of Em," which predicts a small number of “copy clans” (potentially on the order of 1,000 original uploads) dominating the initial emulated population. Because destructive emulation terminates biological life, widespread voluntary uptake is improbable without significant shifts in cultural attitudes or the introduction of non-destructive alternatives.

Economic and technological factors will further constrain numbers. In the absence of breakthroughs that dramatically lower costs or make brain scanning non-destructive, the technology will remain accessible to only a privileged minority. Regulatory and societal resistance could restrict uploading to a handful of cases, especially if public sentiment skews toward skepticism or opposition. Psychological and existential concerns regarding personhood, consciousness, and digital identity are also likely to deter many potential adopters, at least in the early decades following technical feasibility.

Unexpected scenarios could either depress or greatly increase adoption. In a low-adoption world, WBE may be restricted by law or taboo, or early emulations may lead to negative outcomes (e.g., failed consciousness, severe suffering), resulting in only a few uploads before further use is halted. Conversely, a suite of transformative breakthroughs—such as the development of safe, non-destructive, and affordable scanning methods, combined with a surge in social demand (perhaps triggered by existential risks or a viral cultural movement)—could make uploading accessible to larger populations. In the most extreme scenario, millions could be uploaded within a five-year window, particularly if governments or corporations mobilize for large-scale digital preservation as a response to global threats. However, such massive adoption remains at the edge of plausibility and is not supported by the majority of expert analysis.

In sum, the most credible scenarios predict that even if destructive whole brain emulation becomes possible before 2100, the maximum number of unique humans uploaded in any 5-year period will likely range from the low hundreds to a few thousand, with higher numbers possible only in rare, high-uncertainty tail events driven by rapid technological change and unprecedented social adoption. The balance of expert opinion suggests that technical bottlenecks, ethical restrictions, and socioeconomic selectivity will keep peak five-year uploads well below mass adoption levels before 2100, though deep uncertainty remains about the pace and direction of future advances.
