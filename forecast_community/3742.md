## Rationale for the Likelihood of 2024–2027 Average CO₂ Remaining Below 433.19 ppm

The average global atmospheric CO₂ concentration for the period 2024–2027 is highly likely to remain below 433.19 ppm. This assessment is based on the following synthesis of recent data, underlying trends, and key influencing factors:

**Observed Data and Immediate Trends**
- The global mean CO₂ concentration in 2024 was approximately 422.7–423 ppm, marking a record annual increase of about 3.5–3.75 ppm. This jump was partially driven by phenomena such as El Niño, widespread drought, and extensive wildfires, which temporarily enhanced the rate of atmospheric CO₂ accumulation.
- Despite this record increase, the four-year running mean, even if growth continues at this elevated rate, would result in an average well below the 433.19 ppm threshold for the 2024–2027 period.

**Baseline Projections With Current Trends**
- Projecting forward using recent growth rates (about 3–3.75 ppm/year), annual mean CO₂ levels would be expected to fall in the following range:
  - 2024: ~423 ppm (observed)
  - 2025: ~426–427 ppm
  - 2026: ~429–431 ppm
  - 2027: ~432–434 ppm
- The arithmetic mean for these years remains around 428–429 ppm, safely below the specified threshold. Even conservative, higher-end projections assuming persistently large annual increases do not produce a four-year mean above 433.19 ppm unless there is a dramatic and immediate change in the underlying carbon cycle dynamics.

**Required Conditions for Exceeding the Threshold**
- Surpassing the 433.19 ppm average would necessitate a sustained and unprecedented acceleration in annual CO₂ increases—on the order of 5–6 ppm per year for several consecutive years. This would likely require:
  - A major surge in fossil fuel emissions,
  - Large-scale and chronic weakening or reversal of natural carbon sinks (forests, oceans),
  - Persistent, extreme climate events (multiple years of severe droughts, catastrophic wildfires globally),
  - Major additional greenhouse gas releases (such as rapid permafrost thaw triggering methane and subsequent CO₂ spikes).
- There is currently no evidence of such an abrupt shift in the global emission trajectory or large-scale collapse in carbon sinks.

**Context From Emissions Scenarios**
- Even under the RCP8.5 “very high emissions” scenario, which represents a worst-case pathway with minimal mitigation, the 2024–2027 average is projected to remain below the 433.19 ppm benchmark. Recent observations indicate current trends are tracking near or slightly below this scenario, reinforcing the likelihood of staying under the threshold.

**Factors Affecting Growth Rate**
- While there is evidence that natural carbon sinks may be weakening (as seen in the record increase for 2024 despite relatively stable fossil emissions), and climate feedback mechanisms (like those triggered by high global temperatures) could theoretically accelerate atmospheric CO₂ growth, such effects would need to not only persist but intensify abruptly and dramatically to drive annual increases high enough to breach the threshold.
- Ongoing emissions reductions in some regions and international mitigation efforts may also help moderate annual increases, though these are not yet sufficient to halt the overall upward trend.

**Influence of Natural Variability**
- Interannual variability due to El Niño/La Niña cycles can cause temporary fluctuations in growth rates, but such variability is unlikely to sustain increases above 4–5 ppm/year for multiple years in succession.

**Summary**
In sum, current and projected data, coupled with our understanding of the carbon cycle and climate feedbacks, strongly suggest that the average global atmospheric CO₂ concentration for 2024–2027 will remain below 433.19 ppm unless a historically unprecedented and sustained escalation in both emissions and natural feedbacks occurs almost immediately. All established business-as-usual, high-emissions, and conservative scenario analyses align on this expectation.
