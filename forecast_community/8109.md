# Saudi-Israeli Normalization by 2031: A Comprehensive Analysis

The question of whether Saudi Arabia will normalize relations with Israel by 2031, assuming Iran does not acquire nuclear weapons, requires examining multiple interconnected factors that will shape this complex geopolitical decision.

## Current State of Affairs

As of mid-2025, Saudi Arabia has not normalized relations with Israel. The kingdom's leadership, particularly Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, has repeatedly and firmly stated that normalization is contingent upon meaningful progress toward Palestinian statehood. This position has become more entrenched following the October 2023 Gaza conflict, which significantly increased the political costs associated with normalization absent tangible achievements for Palestinians.

Despite ongoing U.S. mediation efforts and reported progress on elements of a potential "mega-deal" involving security guarantees and nuclear cooperation, formal diplomatic relations remain stalled primarily due to the Palestinian issue. Recent developments, such as Israel blocking a Saudi-led delegation from visiting the West Bank in early 2025, have further complicated prospects for normalization.

## Key Factors Influencing Normalization

### Palestinian Statehood Requirements

The most significant obstacle to normalization is the Palestinian question. Saudi Arabia has maintained a consistent position that formal recognition of Israel could only happen with the establishment of a Palestinian state. This stance reflects both the kingdom's role as custodian of Islam's holiest sites and the strong resonance of the Palestinian cause across the Arab and Muslim world.

Recent Saudi diplomatic statements have emphasized that vague promises of a "pathway" to Palestinian statehood are insufficient; instead, concrete, "irreversible" progress is required. This demand stands in stark contrast to current Israeli policies, which have moved further away from Palestinian statehood since the 2023 conflict.

### Regional Dynamics and Security Considerations

The Saudi-Iran rapprochement since 2023 has fundamentally altered the regional security calculus. Iranian-Saudi relations have been thawing for several years, recently reaffirmed by high-level diplomatic exchanges. This détente reduces—though does not eliminate—one of the primary strategic rationales for Saudi-Israeli alignment: countering Iranian influence.

Saudi officials have reportedly informed Iran they would not allow their territory to be used in any future U.S. military operation against Tehran, signaling Riyadh's preference for engagement rather than escalation. This shifting security environment makes normalization with Israel less urgent from a strategic standpoint.

### U.S. Mediation and Incentives

U.S. involvement remains critical to any potential agreement. The proposed normalization package typically includes:

- A U.S.-Saudi defense treaty with security guarantees
- Saudi civilian nuclear program with U.S. assistance
- Advanced technology cooperation, including artificial intelligence
- Progress toward Palestinian statehood

Secretary of State Antony Blinken has stated that "much of the heavy lifting for normalization is complete, including negotiations on complex U.S.-Saudi elements of an agreement". However, the U.S. has reportedly begun decoupling its strategic and nuclear cooperation with Saudi Arabia from the normalization track, potentially reducing leverage on Riyadh to proceed without progress on Palestinian issues.

### Domestic and Regional Legitimacy

Saudi Arabia faces unique constraints that other Arab states like the UAE or Bahrain did not confront when normalizing ties with Israel. As custodian of Islam's two holiest sites, Saudi Arabia's religious leadership role creates heightened sensitivity to the Palestinian cause. Public opinion in the kingdom and across the region remains strongly pro-Palestinian, making unilateral moves toward normalization politically risky for Saudi leadership.

The legitimacy of Mohammed bin Salman's rule and Saudi Arabia's broader regional standing could be damaged by normalization absent meaningful benefits for Palestinians, particularly in the aftermath of the Gaza conflict that intensified anti-Israeli sentiment throughout the Arab world.

## Scenarios for the Next Five Years

### Scenario for No Normalization

The most likely outcome is continued non-recognition through 2031. In this scenario:

- Israeli-Palestinian tensions remain unresolved, with no credible roadmap or significant steps toward a Palestinian state
- Saudi Arabia maintains its insistence on Palestinian statehood as a non-negotiable condition for normalization
- Regional public opinion and Saudi domestic considerations continue to make normalization politically costly
- Saudi Arabia pursues its economic and strategic objectives through other means, including improved relations with the U.S. and possibly Iran, without formalizing ties to Israel

This scenario represents the status quo trajectory and aligns with the historical inertia of Middle Eastern diplomacy on sensitive issues.

### Scenario for Normalization

Despite substantial obstacles, normalization by 2031 remains possible if:

- The U.S. successfully brokers a comprehensive agreement that delivers on key Saudi demands, particularly regarding Palestinian statehood
- A durable ceasefire or peace process takes hold in Gaza and the West Bank, creating diplomatic space for Saudi leaders to justify normalization
- Shifts in Israeli politics enable meaningful concessions on the Palestinian issue
- Saudi leadership determines that normalization's benefits for Vision 2030, U.S. relations, and regional stability outweigh domestic and regional opposition
- A face-saving formula emerges that allows Saudi Arabia to present normalization as advancing Palestinian interests

This breakthrough scenario would likely require substantial diplomatic creativity and political shifts in both Israel and Saudi Arabia.

## Weighing the Evidence

The current environment strongly favors continued non-recognition. Several factors reinforce this assessment:

1. **Weight of status quo**: Middle Eastern diplomatic breakthroughs are rare, especially on issues as symbolically charged as Israeli recognition.

2. **Hardened positions**: The Gaza conflict has strengthened rather than weakened Saudi insistence on Palestinian statehood as a precondition.

3. **Reduced urgency**: The Saudi-Iran détente has diminished the strategic imperative for an anti-Iran alliance with Israel.

4. **Domestic constraints**: Saudi leadership faces significant political costs domestically and regionally for normalization without tangible Palestinian gains.

5. **Decoupling of incentives**: The U.S. is reportedly separating Saudi strategic cooperation from the normalization track, potentially reducing pressure on Riyadh.

However, the 5.5-year timeframe until 2031 allows for significant shifts in regional dynamics. The desire for U.S. security guarantees, nuclear cooperation, and economic benefits creates powerful incentives that could eventually outweigh obstacles, particularly if creative diplomatic formulas emerge to address the Palestinian issue.

## Conclusion

The probability of Saudi-Israeli normalization by 2031, assuming Iran does not acquire nuclear weapons, remains below 50%. While normalization is technically possible under the right conditions, the sustained lack of progress on the Palestinian issue, Saudi Arabia's firm public stance linking normalization to statehood, ongoing regional volatility, and the reduced urgency following Saudi-Iran rapprochement all suggest that the obstacles to normalization remain substantial. However, sustained U.S. diplomatic efforts, potential shifts in Israeli or Saudi domestic politics, or creative approaches to the Palestinian question could still create a pathway to normalization within this timeframe.

### Probability: 35%
