The Square Kilometre Array (SKA) project is an ambitious international effort to build the world's largest radio telescope. Its completion by 2031 depends on several key factors:

Technical Challenges: The SKA involves integrating thousands of dishes and over a million low-frequency antennas across two continents, presenting significant technical and logistical hurdles. Processing the enormous data volumes generated by the array is another major challenge.

Recent Progress: As of 2025, there have been encouraging developments. The first SKA-Mid telescope was activated in South Africa in January 2024, and the SKA-Low telescope in Australia produced its first image using 1,024 antennas in March 2025. These milestones demonstrate that key systems are working, albeit on a much smaller scale than the full array.

Funding and International Cooperation: The project's success heavily relies on sustained funding and strong international cooperation. Economic pressures could potentially lead to funding shortfalls from partner countries, which would cause delays.

Timeline and Historical Trends: The original 2019 plan aimed for completion by 2030, just meeting the 2031 deadline. However, large-scale international scientific projects typically experience delays of 2-5 years from initial targets. As of March 2025, less than 1% of the full array was complete, indicating significant work remains.

Remaining Time: With about 5.5 years left until the 2031 deadline, there is still time for the project to accelerate. However, the complexity and scale of the full SKA2 implementation present substantial risks for delays.

While recent progress is encouraging, the ambitious scope of SKA2 and the historical pattern of delays in similar projects suggest that meeting the 2031 deadline will be challenging. The successful early tests provide some optimism, but scaling up to the full array remains a significant hurdle. Balancing these factors, it appears that while completion by 2031 is possible, there is a substantial risk of delays pushing the project beyond this date.
