There remains roughly 75 years until 2100 in which the world’s evolution will decisively show whether a rapid, global population decline of 10% or more could occur, and if so, what the primary trigger might be. Historically, deterrence practices and careful crisis management have kept nuclear war at bay despite several close calls, underlining that even when tensions flare—between major nuclear-armed powers or regional rivals—nuclear weapons, while the most intensely destructive technology available, have been held in check. This enduring “nuclear taboo” coexists with a landscape where other global risks, such as climate change, pandemics, and systemic economic or ecological collapses, are evolving steadily and carry the potential to induce widespread hardship over time.

Nonetheless, if a catastrophic decline were to occur rapidly—within five years—it is important to consider that an all-out or even limited nuclear exchange, triggered by miscalculations or rapidly escalating geopolitical crises, could set off a cascade of events. In such a scenario, the immediate devastation from the nuclear blasts, coupled with the subsequent nuclear winter and ensuing collapse of food production and infrastructure, would likely be the key driver behind the dramatic population loss. On the other hand, the possibility exists that other global disruptions could produce a similar catastrophic effect without nuclear weapons serving as the principal cause.

In balancing these considerations, the slow pace of most systemic global changes and the robust—but not infallible—mechanisms of nuclear deterrence lend weight to the view that while the risk of nuclear-triggered catastrophe is significant, it is one among several formidable dangers. Ultimately, the interplay between enduring nuclear tensions, historical near-misses, and the parallel emergence of other global risks creates a nuanced outlook, where the deployment of nuclear weapons remains a plausible, though not overwhelmingly dominant, pathway to a rapid global catastrophe.
