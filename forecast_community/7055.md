With approximately 1.5 years remaining until 2026, the current landscape for cultivated meat in quick-service restaurants (QSRs) remains largely unchanged, with no major chains having announced or offered such products. The status quo suggests a 0% adoption rate if no developments occur. The prevailing trend, characterized by slow regulatory progress and a cautious stance from QSRs, indicates that the adoption rate might remain low, potentially between 0% and 8%. Expert forecasts and market analyses align with this outlook, generally estimating a low probability of widespread adoption by 2026, with most predictions falling below 15% and a median around 7-8%.

Several factors could lead to a low adoption rate: unresolved regulatory hurdles, low consumer acceptance, and high production costs. Conversely, a high adoption scenario could emerge from rapid technological advancements that significantly reduce production costs, major regulatory approvals in key markets, and a surge in consumer demand for sustainable meat alternatives. Such developments could prompt several QSRs to incorporate cultivated meat products into their offerings by 2026.
