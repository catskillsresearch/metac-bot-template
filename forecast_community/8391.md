The probability of a nuclear conflict occurring by 2030 is generally considered low, estimated between 1.8% and 5%. This assessment is based on expert evaluations and the current geopolitical climate, which has not seen a nuclear conflict between states since January 1, 2021. The status quo remains "ambiguous," as no nuclear conflict has occurred, and global changes tend to happen gradually.

There is no evidence to suggest that the June-September period is more likely for the initial outbreak of a nuclear conflict. The timing of such conflicts is typically driven by geopolitical events and crises, which can arise unpredictably throughout the year. Historical data does not indicate any seasonal patterns in military mobilization or geopolitical tensions that would make the summer months more likely for a nuclear conflict to begin.

If a nuclear conflict were to occur, the probability of it starting in the June-September period is approximately proportional to the length of that interval, which is about one-third of the year. This estimation is based on the absence of any specific factors that would skew the likelihood toward these months. The potential for a conflict to start in this period is considered random, given the lack of evidence for seasonal influences.

In summary, while the overall likelihood of a nuclear conflict by 2030 is low, if such a conflict were to occur, the timing is expected to be random with respect to the seasons, resulting in a roughly equal chance for any given period of the year.
