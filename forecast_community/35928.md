# The Future of the 45Q Carbon Capture Tax Credit: A Comprehensive Analysis

With just over seven months until January 1, 2026, the fate of the 45Q carbon oxide sequestration credit remains uncertain. Current legislative developments, political dynamics, and economic considerations all factor into what might happen next concerning this significant tax incentive.

## Legislative Landscape

The legislative environment has seen significant activity regarding the 45Q tax credit:

- In March 2025, Representatives Perry (R-PA) and Khanna (D-CA) introduced H.R. 1946, the 45Q Repeal Act of 2025, which would eliminate Section 45Q of the Internal Revenue Code without any safe harbor provisions for existing projects.

- The House has passed a major tax bill that includes significant rollbacks of Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) clean energy credits, contemplating a 2025 end date for new 45Q projects.

- Recent House proposals include expiring various energy credits as early as December 31, 2025, while other credits would either expire in 2028 or follow modified phaseout schedules.

If no new legislation is enacted, the status quo prevails: the 45Q tax credit continues under the Inflation Reduction Act expansions, allowing new facilities to qualify if they begin construction before January 1, 2033.

## Political and Economic Dynamics

Several key factors are influencing the potential outcomes:

**Republican Control and Priorities**: Unified Republican control increases the likelihood of significant rollbacks or repeal of climate-related tax credits. The administration is rolling back climate rules and seeking to eliminate federal spending on climate-related projects, signaling a desire to curtail programs like 45Q.

**Industry Opposition and Support**: Carbon capture has unique political standing with support in fossil fuel-dependent states and among energy interests. Industry opposition to full repeal is significant—even among traditional Republican allies—given the reliance of the oil, gas, and industrial sectors on 45Q. This creates intra-party tension as some Republican lawmakers and fossil energy interests still support CCS as part of their energy mix.

**Economic and Investment Concerns**: Market concerns about policy volatility and the potential for stranded investments are exerting pressure to preserve at least a safe harbor for existing projects. Industry and investor lobbying emphasizes the importance of 45Q for both CCS and U.S. energy competitiveness.

**Senate Dynamics**: While the House has shown momentum for repeal, the Senate could revise House provisions, including the treatment of safe harbors or effective repeal dates. This is especially likely under industry pressure and the influence of moderate Republicans from energy-producing states.

## Potential Outcomes

The most likely outcomes include:

**2025-2026 Sunset Without Safe Harbor**: This aligns with Rep. Perry's bill and current House language, reflecting the administration's aggressive rollback of climate policies. The Republican trifecta increases the likelihood of pushing through a repeal without protections for existing projects.

**2025-2026 Sunset With Safe Harbor**: A modified version of Perry's bill that acknowledges industry concerns about stranded investments. The Senate is likely to be more responsive to industry lobbying for safe harbor provisions, making this a plausible compromise.

**Status Quo Preservation**: Despite momentum for repeal, there remains a significant probability that legislative gridlock, competing priorities, or successful industry lobbying could result in no changes to 45Q before 2026.

**Later Sunset Options**: While less likely, scenarios involving 2027-2028 or 2029-2031 sunsets (with or without safe harbors) could emerge from Senate negotiations or as compromise outcomes reflecting industry influence and moderate Republican positions.

## Key Uncertainties

Several uncertainties could affect the ultimate outcome:

- The final scope of the reconciliation bill remains in flux and can change rapidly
- Potential inclusion of safe harbor provisions for ongoing projects during Senate negotiations
- The strength and effectiveness of industry lobbying efforts
- Last-minute amendments driven by fiscal or political imperatives
- Internal Republican party negotiations, especially between fiscal hawks and representatives from energy-producing states

The coming months will be critical in determining whether the 45Q tax credit will face an immediate repeal, a phased sunset, or continue in its current form through at least 2026.
