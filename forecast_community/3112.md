The question of whether Mars will have a permanent population of 10,000 before the Moon does by 2100 involves several complex factors. Currently, neither Mars nor the Moon has a permanent human population, and the challenges of establishing such large-scale settlements are significant. The status quo suggests that without significant changes, neither celestial body will reach this threshold by 2100 due to the lack of concrete plans and infrastructure.

Mars presents ambitious plans for colonization, primarily driven by private entities like SpaceX. These plans envision overcoming substantial technical and logistical barriers to establish a self-sustaining city. However, the challenges are immense, including transportation, life support, and resource utilization. The vision for Mars is bold, but the timeline for achieving a permanent population of 10,000 remains uncertain.

On the other hand, the Moon's proximity to Earth and ease of access make it a more likely candidate for smaller-scale, incremental settlement. International collaboration and investment could focus on scientific research and resource extraction, leveraging the Moon's resources like water and helium-3. However, these efforts are likely to remain limited to small, rotating crews without a clear roadmap for scaling up to a permanent population of 10,000.

Historical trends in space exploration suggest that progress is slow and incremental. While the Moon is more accessible and has ongoing international interest, it lacks a concrete plan for large-scale colonization. Mars, despite its ambitious plans, faces substantial barriers that make rapid colonization unlikely. Given these factors, the probability of either body reaching the specified population threshold by 2100 is low, with the Moon being slightly more likely due to its proximity and ease of access.
