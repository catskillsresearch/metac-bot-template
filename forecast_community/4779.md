The historical trend since 1945 has been the non-use of nuclear weapons in conflict, primarily due to the deterrent effect of mutually assured destruction (MAD) and the success of arms control agreements. Despite an increase in the number of nuclear-armed states and persistent geopolitical tensions, the status quo of non-use has been maintained through a combination of deterrence, diplomacy, and effective crisis management. Continued adherence to nuclear deterrence doctrines, robust arms control agreements, and successful diplomatic efforts are crucial in preventing any deliberate use of nuclear weapons. The international community's maintenance of strong communication channels and crisis management mechanisms plays a vital role in de-escalating potential conflicts involving nuclear-armed states.

However, the potential for regional conflicts, technological vulnerabilities, and the erosion of some arms control agreements introduce new risks. Escalating tensions between nuclear-armed states, such as India and Pakistan or the US and North Korea, could lead to a breakdown in diplomatic relations and crisis management. In such scenarios, miscommunication, miscalculation, or a significant cyberattack on nuclear command-and-control systems could result in a deliberate nuclear strike, possibly as a demonstration of power or in response to a perceived existential threat.

While the probability of a deliberate nuclear detonation remains low, it is not negligible. The high stakes involved in nuclear warfare and the catastrophic consequences of nuclear escalation continue to act as strong deterrents. Nonetheless, the potential for geopolitical crises to spiral out of control underscores the importance of ongoing international efforts to prevent nuclear escalation and maintain the status quo of non-use.
