(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
Assuming the 2024 PHEIC declaration was on August 14, 2024, and that the 180-day maximum window is used, the question will resolve on or around February 10, 2025—about 3 months from the current date.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
As of September 2024, the global total for the 2024 PHEIC period is approximately 29,000 confirmed and suspected cases, well below the 66,387 threshold required to exceed the 2022–2023 outbreak[2][3][5]. Unless there is a significant surge in international transmission or reporting, the current path points to a "No" outcome.

(c) **Scenario that results in a No outcome:**  
Transmission remains largely confined to Central Africa, with sporadic, low-level cases in other regions. Under-reporting continues, but no dramatic surge in international spread or in the rate of laboratory-confirmed case reporting occurs. As a result, total confirmed cases during the PHEIC period remain substantially below the 66,387 threshold by the close date.

(d) **Scenario that results in a Yes outcome:**  
A rapid escalation in international transmission takes place, mirroring or exceeding the global geographic spread seen in 2022–2023. This could be triggered by exportation events and subsequent outbreaks in multiple non-African countries with robust detection/reporting, or by a major improvement in case detection and confirmation in Central Africa. In these scenarios, the cumulative confirmed case count during the PHEIC period could surpass 66,387 before the close date.

## Rationale

Mpox Clade I (1b) in 2024 is more severe than Clade II, but as of September 2024, the outbreak remains primarily centered in Central Africa, especially the Democratic Republic of the Congo[2][3]. The total of around 29,000 confirmed or suspected cases globally at that point is less than half the 2022–2023 PHEIC total[2][3][5]. While under-reporting is acknowledged, authoritative sources caution that most of the world is not experiencing the kind of rapidly accelerating case numbers that defined the previous global outbreak[3][5]. Exported cases to other continents are rare and have not sparked major secondary outbreaks[1][4].

As of early 2025, the situation is largely unchanged. The United States, for example, has seen only sporadic cases with no sustained transmission chains[1][4][5]. The bulk of global cases and fatalities remains concentrated in Central Africa. Surveillance and containment efforts have been ramped up by global health authorities[1][2][3], and while under-ascertainment remains a concern, no evidence suggests a sudden and dramatic undercount that would vault the cumulative confirmed global total above the prior outbreak.

Given these factors, historical precedent strongly favors the status quo: the majority of outbreaks do not suddenly begin accelerating late in their course, especially in the absence of significant new transmission dynamics or failures in containment.

## Final Assessment

- Transmission outside Central Africa remains limited as of early 2025[1][4][5].
- Confirmed case numbers are well below the 66,387 mark as measured by Our World in Data for the relevant period[2][3][5].
- Under-reporting is a real issue but unlikely to account for a >2x undercount relative to the previous outbreak, especially as surveillance improves[3][5].

**Probability: 30%**

A "No" outcome remains more likely given current trends and the lack of substantial, sustained international spread. However, a nontrivial risk remains—if a late or under-detected wave of cases emerges, or if surveillance and confirmation ramp up sharply, the total could approach or exceed the previous threshold. The main risk factor is a late, rapid surge in cases outside Africa or a dramatic increase in case detection, but these scenarios lack strong evidence as of May 2025[2][3][5].
