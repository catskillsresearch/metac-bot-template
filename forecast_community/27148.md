(a) The time left until the outcome is known is approximately 7 months if the PHEIC declaration remains in effect until December 31, 2025 (the question close date).

(b) The status quo outcome based on current data is that the 2024 mpox outbreak has not yet exceeded the 2022-2023 outbreak's 66,387 confirmed cases.

(c) A No outcome would result if containment efforts in Africa prove successful, particularly in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Uganda, and Burundi, limiting the spread of Clade I mpox. Additionally, if vaccination campaigns and public health measures effectively control outbreaks in other regions like Europe, the case total would remain below the threshold.

(d) A Yes outcome would result if the current rapid spread in Africa continues unchecked, with Sierra Leone's surge (384 cases in one week) spreading to neighboring countries, while existing outbreaks in Germany and other European countries accelerate. The underreporting issue in affected regions could also mean actual case numbers are significantly higher than officially reported.

Based on the available search results and recent data, I can provide a comprehensive assessment of whether the 2024 mpox outbreak will exceed the 2022-2023 outbreak in confirmed cases.

## Current Situation Analysis

The 2023-2025 mpox epidemic involves a new variant of clade I mpox (called clade 1b), which began in Central Africa in September 2023[3]. As of September 2024, more than 29,000 cases have been reported with over 800 fatalities, representing an approximately 3% fatality rate[3]. The World Health Organization declared this epidemic a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on August 14, 2024[3].

The current outbreak is primarily centered in Central Africa, with the Democratic Republic of the Congo being the most affected country. However, cases have been reported in multiple countries, indicating potential for wider geographic spread[3]. In the United States, there have been four reported cases of clade I mpox in people who had recently traveled to affected areas in Central and Eastern Africa[1][4].

## Comparison with the 2022-2023 Outbreak

The 2022-2023 mpox outbreak, caused by clade II variant, resulted in 66,387 confirmed cases worldwide between July 23, 2022, and May 10, 2023. Several key differences exist between the two outbreaks:

1. **Variant differences**: The current outbreak primarily involves clade Ib mpox, which has historically been associated with higher virulence and potentially more severe outcomes compared to clade II that caused the 2022-2023 outbreak[3][5].

2. **Geographic focus**: While the 2022-2023 outbreak had significant case numbers in North America and Europe, the current outbreak is primarily centered in Africa, though it has shown potential for spread to other regions[3].

3. **Case trajectory**: The current outbreak has shown rapid acceleration in certain regions. As reported in May 2025, Sierra Leone alone reported 384 confirmed cases in a single week, representing 50.7% of all cases on the African continent during that period.

4. **Reporting challenges**: The CDC and WHO reports indicate significant under-reporting issues in the most affected regions, suggesting the actual case numbers may be substantially higher than officially reported[3].

## Recent Developments

Recent data from early 2025 indicates the outbreak is still active and spreading:

1. In Germany, particularly Berlin, mpox infections have been increasing, with 74 reported cases in Berlin by May 2025, surpassing the previous year's total of 67 cases. Nationally, Germany has reported 229 mpox cases in 2025.

2. Sierra Leone has seen a concerning 63% jump in confirmed cases within a single week, with 384 new confirmed cases. The country has 800 active cases but only 60 treatment beds available.

3. The WHO continues to classify the mpox outbreak as a public health emergency, citing the continued rise in cases and geographic spread. As of February 2025, there had been over 21,000 confirmed cases of mpox since the beginning of 2024, with 70 deaths reported.

4. According to Democratic Republic of Congo's Health Ministry, 66,063 suspected mpox cases were reported in 2024, with 14,417 confirmed cases and 1,366 deaths. In the first week of 2025 alone, 2,318 suspected cases were detected with 20 deaths.

## Forecast Assessment

When evaluating whether the 2024 mpox outbreak will exceed the 2022-2023 outbreak in confirmed cases, several factors must be considered:

### Factors Supporting a "Yes" Outcome

1. **Rapid case accumulation**: With approximately 29,000 cases reported by September 2024 and over 21,000 confirmed cases by February 2025, the outbreak was already approaching one-third of the 2022-2023 total within the first months of the PHEIC declaration.

2. **Geographical expansion**: The outbreak has spread beyond its initial epicenter in the DRC to multiple countries in Africa, with cases also reported in Europe and North America.

3. **Under-reporting**: Official figures likely underestimate actual case numbers due to limited surveillance and testing capacity in the most affected regions.

4. **Continuing PHEIC status**: The WHO has maintained the PHEIC status as of February 2025, indicating the outbreak was not being brought under control.

### Factors Supporting a "No" Outcome

1. **Enhanced awareness and response**: Previous outbreak experience may improve response efficiency.

2. **Vaccination campaigns**: Targeted vaccination efforts, particularly in countries like Germany, may help contain spread in regions outside Africa.

3. **Limited time frame**: With the question closing on December 31, 2025, there is a limited window for cases to accumulate beyond the 66,387 threshold.

4. **Potential containment in Africa**: Reports indicate that cases in high-burden countries such as Uganda and Burundi were on a steady decline as of May 2025, while cases in the Democratic Republic of Congo were showing signs of flattening.

## Conclusion

Given the evidence available, the 2024 mpox outbreak shows significant potential to exceed the 2022-2023 outbreak in confirmed cases. The DRC alone reported 14,417 confirmed cases in 2024, and with the outbreak continuing into 2025 with significant spread to other countries, the trajectory suggests continued growth in case numbers. However, there are also signs of potential containment in some regions.

The status quo indicates we are not yet at the threshold of 66,387 cases, but the outbreak continues with significant momentum. Considering the rate of spread, under-reporting issues, and the continuing PHEIC status, there is a higher than 50% probability that the case count will exceed the threshold before December 31, 2025.

Probability: 65%
