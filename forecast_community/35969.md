(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
There are approximately 7 months and 3 weeks remaining until January 1, 2026, the cut-off date for the question to resolve as “Not before 2026.”

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
As of now, a bilateral ceasefire or peace agreement covering all official and disputed territory has *not* gone into effect. Ukraine has agreed to a proposed 30-day unconditional ceasefire backed by the U.S., but Russia has *not* yet formally accepted the terms[4][5]. Russia’s actions on the battlefield, including preparations for a significant summer offensive and intense ongoing fighting, signal that a comprehensive halt to hostilities is unlikely in the immediate future[5]. If nothing changes, the conflict will continue through 2025 without a qualifying ceasefire, resulting in the outcome “Not before 2026.”

(c) **Scenario for an unexpected outcome:**  
A plausible unexpected scenario would be that after initial escalation during Russia’s summer offensive, battlefield exhaustion, economic pressure from heightened sanctions, or a sudden shift in Russian or Ukrainian political leadership (or U.S.-brokered concessions) catalyze a dramatic diplomatic breakthrough. Both Moscow and Kyiv could then rapidly accept and implement a bilateral ceasefire, potentially as early as late Q3 or during Q4 of 2025, in an effort to halt mounting casualties and economic costs[2][5]. Alternatively, a major external shock, such as a domestic crisis within Russia or new international guarantees, could accelerate such a breakthrough.

## Analytical Rationale

- **Weight of the status quo:** The most reliable indicators—recent Russian battlefield preparations, open skepticism about Moscow’s intentions, repeated past negotiation failures, and no official ceasefire in effect—point towards continued hostilities through at least the summer and possibly into late 2025[5]. Good forecasters emphasize the inertia of the current situation, as substantial policy or battlefield changes are infrequent and hard-won.
- **Allowance for surprises:** However, there are genuine signs of diplomatic activity, with the U.S., Ukraine, and—conditionally—Russia engaging in talks, and both Kyiv and Washington supporting a 30-day truce[2][4][5]. Political will can shift unexpectedly, especially under external or internal pressures, so it is prudent to maintain a moderate probability that a ceasefire could be implemented later in 2025.
- **Process & verification:** Since the question requires the formal, public implementation of a bilateral agreement, the bar is high; isolated or local truces do not qualify, and both capitals must issue concordant declarations[4]. Even with a deal “in final stages,” as the White House asserts, practical and legal obstacles persist[2].

## Probability Forecast

| Option                                             | Probability |
|----------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| 1 January 2025 – 31 March 2025                     | 0           |
| 1 April 2025 – 30 June 2025                        | 5           |
| 1 July 2025 – 30 September 2025                    | 20          |
| 1 October 2025 – 31 December 2025                  | 25          |
| Not before 2026                                    | 50          |

**Option_1 January 2025 - 31 March 2025: 0**  
**Option_1 April 2025 - 30 June 2025: 5**  
**Option_1 July 2025 - 30 September 2025: 20**  
**Option_1 October 2025 - 31 December 2025: 25**  
**Option_Not before 2026: 50**

The most likely outcome, all else equal, is that no bilateral ceasefire will go into effect before 2026. The next most probable windows are Q4 and late Q3 2025, reflecting a cautious possibility of breakthrough after a bloody summer but before the year’s end. There is only a small chance (5%) that a deal is somehow sealed and implemented before July, given Russia’s stance and ongoing military operations.
