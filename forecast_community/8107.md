The global population is projected to peak around 10.3 billion people in the 2080s, based on current trends of declining fertility rates and aging populations. This projection aligns with the most recent UN estimates and is supported by expert consensus, which anticipates a peak between 9 and 11 billion people. These estimates are grounded in current fertility, mortality, and migration trends.

However, several unexpected scenarios could alter this trajectory. A significant global crisis, such as a pandemic, large-scale conflict, or severe climate change impacts, could drastically reduce fertility rates and increase mortality, resulting in a peak population significantly lower than current projections. Conversely, breakthroughs in medical technology that extend human lifespan or shifts in fertility trends due to cultural or policy changes could lead to a higher peak population, potentially exceeding 11 billion. These scenarios highlight the uncertainty and potential variability in future population dynamics.
