Recent U.S. field production of crude oil has demonstrated consistent stability, with output in April and May 2025 remaining near record levels. The Energy Information Administration’s (EIA) weekly data for late April 2025 showed production around 13.46 million barrels per day, with subsequent weeks in May maintaining a range of approximately 13.40–13.41 million barrels per day. The EIA’s May 2025 Short-Term Energy Outlook revised the annual average for 2025 slightly downward to 13.42 million barrels per day, reflecting a modest softening from prior projections but still indicating a strong production environment.

Historical patterns suggest that U.S. crude oil production fluctuates gradually, barring significant supply shocks or operational interruptions. Monthly averages tend to stay close to both the most recent weekly figures and the annual forecast, with very limited variation month-to-month unless there is a major, widely reported event. No public reports or data for April 2025 indicate the occurrence of any major disruption—such as severe weather, large-scale technical outages, regulatory changes, or price shocks—that would have sharply altered output. Likewise, no evidence points to an unusual surge in production, such as the early completion of major projects or an unexpected jump in oil prices.

Given this context, the most robust expectation is that the reported U.S. field production of crude oil for April 2025 will be within the 13,400 to 13,600 thousand barrels per day range. This aligns with the clustering of recent weekly EIA data, the downward-revised but still robust EIA annual forecast, and typical month-to-month production trends. While very small probabilities should be reserved for outcomes just outside this central band—accounting for the possibility of minor, unreported operational events or standard reporting adjustments—scenarios that would push the monthly average below 13,000 or above 13,600 thousand barrels per day remain extremely unlikely given available information.

Overall, the balance of evidence indicates a stable and high output environment for U.S. crude oil production in April 2025, with any deviation from this status quo requiring rare, significant, and presently unreported factors.
