I'll provide a professional forecasting answer to the question about Revolut's UK banking license restrictions.

(a) Time left until outcome: 2 months and 17 days (from May 9, 2025 to July 26, 2025)

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: The restrictions would remain in place, and Revolut would continue in the mobilisation phase.

(c) Scenario resulting in a No outcome: The PRA identifies significant operational or compliance issues during Revolut's mobilisation phase, requiring extended remediation. Alternatively, Revolut might struggle to build out its banking infrastructure to meet regulatory standards, forcing the PRA to extend the mobilisation period beyond July 26, 2025.

(d) Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome: Revolut successfully completes all regulatory requirements during the standard mobilisation period, and the PRA approves the removal of restrictions by July 2025, allowing Revolut to operate as a fully licensed UK bank.

## Analyzing the Probability of Revolut's Banking License Restrictions Being Removed

The key question is whether Revolut will transition from its current restricted banking license to a full UK banking license before July 26, 2025. Based on the available information, I can provide a structured analysis of this probability.

### Timeline and Regulatory Context

Revolut received its UK banking license with restrictions on July 25, 2024, entering the standard "mobilisation" phase that all new UK banks must complete[2][3]. This phase typically lasts up to 12 months, according to the PRA's guidelines[3][5]. If this standard timeline holds, Revolut would complete the mobilisation phase by July 25, 2025 - just one day before the deadline in question.

During this mobilisation period, Revolut is limited to holding only Â£50,000 of total customer deposits and must work with regulators to finalize its banking operations[3][5]. This is a common regulatory step that other successful UK neobanks like Monzo and Starling have previously completed.

### Historical Precedents and Indicators

Looking at precedents, most UK digital banks have completed their mobilisation phases within the standard 12-month timeframe. The PRA's website explicitly states that mobilisation "should take no longer than 12 months"[3], indicating regulatory expectation of completion within this period.

There have been no public announcements of regulatory concerns or operational delays since Revolut received its restricted license. In fact, the company's CEO Nik Storonsky expressed confidence about delivering on making "Revolut the bank of choice for UK customers"[2], suggesting internal optimism about completing the mobilisation phase successfully.

### Factors Supporting Timely Completion

Several factors increase the probability of Revolut meeting the July 2025 deadline:

1. **Extensive Preparation**: Revolut applied for its banking license in 2021 and waited three years for approval, giving it ample time to prepare for the mobilisation phase[3][5].

2. **Operational Experience**: Revolut already operates as a bank in the European Economic Area with a license granted by the Bank of Lithuania, providing valuable operational experience[5].

3. **Regulatory Familiarity**: Having successfully navigated the initial, more challenging phase of license approval, Revolut has demonstrated regulatory compliance capabilities.

### Potential Obstacles

There are some factors that could delay completion:

1. **Regulatory Scrutiny**: The PRA has previously shown caution with Revolut, taking three years to grant the initial restricted license due to "accounting and reputational concerns"[5].

2. **Operational Complexity**: Building out full banking infrastructure for 9 million UK customers is a complex undertaking that could face technical challenges.

3. **Status Quo Bias**: Regulatory processes often take longer than expected, and extensions of mobilisation periods are not unprecedented.

## Final Assessment

Weighing all factors, I believe there is a high probability that Revolut will complete its mobilisation phase and have its restrictions removed by the deadline. The standard regulatory timeline aligns almost perfectly with the question's deadline, and there are no public indications of issues that would cause significant delays. 

However, I must account for the uncertainty inherent in regulatory processes and the fact that delays can occur unexpectedly. The PRA has already shown particular caution with Revolut by taking three years for the initial approval. Additionally, recognizing status quo bias, I should acknowledge that regulatory processes often take longer than anticipated.

Given that the deadline is just one day after the standard 12-month mobilisation period would end, any minor delay would result in a negative outcome for this question.

Probability: 75%
