# Proton Decay Detection: Prospects Through 2040

The search for proton decay represents one of the most challenging and fundamental pursuits in particle physics. Despite decades of increasingly sensitive experiments, no evidence of this phenomenon has been observed. Current theoretical models suggest proton lifetimes exceed 10^34 years, making detection extraordinarily difficult even with advanced equipment.

## Current State of Research

As of 2025, scientists have reimagined some physics processes assuming proton decay does occur, calculating possible lifetimes around 10^18 years. While still representing an enormous timescale, this is significantly shorter than previous estimates and potentially brings detection somewhat closer to experimental reach.

The primary experimental approach involves monitoring massive quantities of protons in specialized detectors. Super-Kamiokande in Japan has been at the forefront of this search, using 50,000 tons of pure water containing approximately 7×10^33 protons. Despite years of operation, no definitive evidence of proton decay has been observed.

Recent developments show ongoing activity in the field. The CMS Collaboration announced 50 new results at Moriond 2025, though no specific breakthroughs in proton decay were reported. Meanwhile, researchers have developed an advanced digital detector array enhancing charged-particle detection with high granularity and low detection thresholds (approximately 500 keV for protons). While primarily used for studying exotic nuclei and β-delayed proton emission, such technological advances could potentially benefit proton decay searches.

## Experimental Outlook

Looking toward 2040, several factors will influence our detection capabilities:

**Hyper-Kamiokande**: This next-generation detector represents our best near-term hope for detecting proton decay. Approximately 10 times larger than Super-Kamiokande, it will significantly increase sensitivity and is expected to surpass current limits within just two years of operation.

**Advanced Detection Technologies**: The development of more sensitive detection technologies continues to push measurement boundaries. Recent advances in digital detector arrays with enhanced granularity and lower detection thresholds make them particularly well-suited for investigating rare decay modes.

**Theoretical Refinements**: Ongoing theoretical work may identify alternative decay channels more accessible to detection with current or near-future technology. Discoveries in related fields like neutron decay or exotic nuclear structures could provide valuable insights relevant to proton decay.

## Challenges to Detection

Despite these advances, several fundamental challenges remain:

1. **Extraordinarily Long Lifetime**: Even at the more optimistic estimate of 10^18 years mentioned in recent research, proton decay remains an exceedingly rare event.

2. **Experimental Constraints**: Even Hyper-Kamiokande, while representing a significant improvement, may not increase sensitivity by enough orders of magnitude to detect decay if the actual lifetime is close to theoretical predictions.

3. **Historical Precedent**: Each generation of experiments has simply set more stringent lower limits on proton lifetime without observing actual decay events, suggesting the phenomenon may remain beyond our detection capabilities through 2040.

## Pathways to Discovery

Despite these challenges, several factors could increase the likelihood of detection by 2040:

1. **Increased Detection Volume**: Hyper-Kamiokande's much larger size will monitor many more protons simultaneously, increasing the chances of observing a decay event.

2. **Alternative Decay Modes**: Scientists might discover proton decay through channels that current theories haven't fully explored or that current detectors are less sensitive to.

3. **Unexpected Breakthroughs**: Revolutionary advances in detection technology or theoretical understanding could dramatically change the outlook. The advanced digital detector array with its high granularity and low detection threshold exemplifies how technological innovation continues to advance.

While these advances are promising, the gap between our detection capabilities and theoretically predicted proton lifetime remains vast. The most likely outcome is that experiments will continue to push the lower limits on proton lifetime without observing actual decay events by 2040.
