# Comprehensive Rationale: Will Russia and NATO Countries (Excluding the US) Go to War by 2035?

Several concerning developments elevate the risk of a direct military conflict between Russia and one or more NATO countries (excluding the US as a primary belligerent) by 2035. A careful analysis of current trends, intelligence assessments, and strategic factors provides a foundation for evaluating this significant geopolitical risk.

## Current Intelligence and Threat Assessment

Ukrainian intelligence has disclosed that Russia has formulated 15 potential military conflict scenarios extending to 2045, with four specifically involving Poland and six pertaining to Northern Europe, including vulnerable NATO members like the Baltic states. According to these reports, Russia aims to "resolve the Ukrainian issue" by 2026, with any delay potentially hindering its ability to compete with the United States and China on a global scale.

The Atlantic Council's survey from early 2025 found that 45% of respondents somewhat or strongly agreed that Russia and NATO will engage in a direct military conflict within the next ten yearsâ€”a significant increase from 29% in their previous survey. Among those expecting another world war within the next decade, 69% anticipated a direct clash between Russia and NATO.

Nearly half (47%) of respondents predicted that by 2035, the world will largely be divided into China-aligned and US-aligned blocs, with Russia, Iran, and North Korea likely forming a formal alliance with China. This potential bloc formation could embolden Russian aggression against NATO's eastern flank.

## NATO's Eastern Vulnerability

Poland and the Baltic states appear particularly vulnerable in Russian strategic planning. Ukrainian intelligence explicitly mentions four potential conflict scenarios involving Polish territory. The "Suwalki Corridor" - the border region between Lithuania, Poland, Russia, and Belarus - has been identified as a potential flashpoint by defense officials.

The geographic vulnerability of NATO's eastern flank, particularly the Baltic states and Poland, creates a situation where Russia might calculate that a limited operation could achieve strategic objectives before a full NATO response materializes. These countries have expressed acute concern about Russian intentions, with Poland featured prominently in Russian conflict scenarios.

## Russian Strategic Timeline

According to intelligence assessments, Russia has developed a geopolitical forecast for 2026-2035 with ramifications extending to 2045. Within this timeline, addressing the "Ukrainian question" by 2026 is highlighted as crucial, suggesting a potential shift in focus afterward.

This timeline aligns with warnings from European intelligence services that Russia may be preparing for a "large-scale conventional war" with NATO by the end of the current decade. The critical period appears to be 2029-2035, after Russia has potentially resolved or significantly reduced its Ukrainian conflict and can redirect military resources toward NATO's eastern flank.

## Constraints Against Conflict

Despite these concerning developments, several powerful factors constrain the likelihood of direct Russia-NATO warfare:

1. **Nuclear deterrence** remains the fundamental constraint against great power conflict
2. **NATO's Article 5 collective defense guarantee** creates uncertainty about the scope of response
3. The risk of **US involvement and escalation** to a broader conflict serves as a powerful deterrent
4. **Historical precedent** shows that despite numerous tensions since 1991, nuclear powers have avoided direct large-scale military conflicts

The mutual deterrence provided by nuclear arsenals has historically prevented escalation to full-scale conventional warfare between major powers. Additionally, Russia's military capabilities are currently tied up in Ukraine, limiting its ability to open a new front against NATO in the near term.

## Scenario for Potential Conflict

A plausible scenario for conflict would involve Russia, after resolving or significantly reducing its Ukrainian conflict by 2026-2030, redeploying forces against NATO countries in Eastern or Northern Europe. Russia might test NATO's resolve by launching limited military operations against Baltic states or Poland, calculating that the operation could achieve objectives before a full NATO response materializes.

For this scenario to meet the criteria of the question, the conflict would need to:
- Produce at least 1,000 battle deaths in a calendar year between Russia and one or more NATO countries
- Remain below the threshold of direct US-Russia warfare, with the US limiting its involvement

The timeframe of 2029-2035 appears most dangerous, as Russia would have had time to rebuild its military capabilities after Ukraine while NATO's eastern flank remains vulnerable despite increased defense spending and preparations.

## Military Preparations and Strategic Posturing

NATO countries, particularly those on Russia's borders, are significantly increasing defense spending and military preparations. Multiple NATO members have announced plans to achieve higher levels of "war-readiness" with substantial investments in military capabilities, explicitly citing Russian threats.

Russia's defense industry is reportedly producing significant quantities of military equipment, including tanks and artillery, at levels exceeding what's needed for the Ukraine conflict. This suggests preparation for potential future conflicts beyond Ukraine.

The failure to normalize relations with Russia after the Cold War has been consequential, and NATO is now viewed by Russian officials as emblematic of Western disregard for Russian security interests. This perception increases the risk of miscalculation or deliberate action against NATO's eastern flank.

The status quo of avoiding direct NATO-Russia warfare has persisted through significant tensions over decades. While recent developments indicate heightened risk, the fundamental deterrents against great power conflict remain strong, though somewhat weakened compared to previous periods.
