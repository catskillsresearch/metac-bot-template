(a) Time left until outcome: About 7.5 months (from May 13, 2025 to January 1, 2026)
(b) Status quo outcome: No sunset reduction before 2026
(c) Unexpected scenario: A compromise bill emerges that keeps the 45V credit but with significant modifications to eligibility requirements, potentially allowing more carbon-intensive hydrogen production methods to qualify while maintaining the original sunset date.

Based on the latest information available, I'll now provide my assessment of what will happen next concerning the repeal of the 45V clean hydrogen tax credit.

## Current Situation

The Clean Hydrogen Production Tax Credit (Section 45V), established by the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, provides up to $3.00 per kilogram for clean hydrogen production over a 10-year period[1][5]. In January 2025, the Treasury Department and IRS released final regulations for this credit, clarifying requirements for qualification and implementation[3][5].

However, as of May 12-13, 2025, House Republicans have unveiled legislative text proposing to terminate the 45V tax credit entirely[2]. This is part of a broader effort to roll back various clean energy tax credits from the Inflation Reduction Act[2]. The bill would specifically repeal the Clean Hydrogen Production 45V tax credit by next year[2].

## Political Context

This legislative proposal comes in the context of the new administration's agenda to roll back climate-related policies from the previous administration. The House Ways and Means Republicans have included the termination of the 45V credit in a reconciliation bill that targets multiple clean energy tax credits[2].

The political dynamics are significant - while House Republicans have put forward this proposal, its passage would require broader support in Congress. Democrats have already voiced opposition, with Senator Catherine Cortez Masto criticizing the bill, stating it would "jack up prices on American families," "kill jobs," and "create chaos in the business community"[2].

## Industry Reaction and Economic Impact

The hydrogen industry has mobilized to defend the 45V credit. In February 2025, over 110 trade groups and companies, including both traditional energy companies and renewable energy advocates, sent a letter to lawmakers urging protection of the credit. They warned that "private sector investment is at risk due to the uncertainty around this crucial incentive," and without it, "hundreds of companies and thousands of jobs" could be lost to other countries.

The clean hydrogen credit is seen by many as essential for the growth of the U.S. hydrogen industry and its ability to enable energy leadership[4]. Some companies, like EDP SA, have expressed confidence that tax credits for renewable projects will remain in place, indicating that there's ongoing negotiation regarding the Inflation Reduction Act.

## Likelihood of Different Outcomes

Looking at the current political landscape and recent developments:

1. **Full repeal without safe harbor**: The House Republicans' proposal aims to terminate the 45V credit entirely, without apparent provisions for existing projects[2]. However, achieving this would require overcoming likely opposition in a divided government.

2. **Repeal with safe harbor**: There's no specific mention of safe harbor provisions in the current proposal, but such provisions could emerge as a compromise to protect existing investments.

3. **Modified sunset**: While some tax credits like the Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit are proposed to be phased out by 2031, the current proposal for 45V appears to be full termination rather than a modified sunset date[2].

4. **Status quo**: Given the political challenges of passing major legislation and the significant industry opposition to repeal, there's a substantial chance that no changes will be enacted before January 1, 2026.

## Forecast Rationale

The repeal of the 45V credit is currently in the proposal stage, with significant industry opposition and political hurdles ahead. The timeline is tight - with about 7.5 months remaining until January 1, 2026. Legislative processes, especially for contentious issues, often move slowly.

While the House GOP has made the repeal a priority, the divided nature of government makes swift, dramatic policy changes difficult to achieve. Additionally, industry support for the credit crosses traditional partisan lines, with both traditional energy companies and renewable advocates supporting its continuation.

However, the fact that specific legislative text has been released targeting the 45V credit specifically indicates a serious effort that could gain momentum, especially as part of broader budget reconciliation negotiations.

Given these factors, I assess that while the status quo outcome (no change before 2026) remains most likely, there is a significant probability of the credit being terminated or modified, with the most likely alternative being a 2025-2026 sunset with some form of safe harbor for existing projects.

## Final Probabilities

2025-2026
- 2025-2026 sunset w/o safe harbor: 15%
- 2025-2026 sunset w/ safe harbor: 25%

2027-2028
- 2027-2028 sunset w/o safe harbor: 5%
- 2027-2028 sunset w/ safe harbor: 10%

2029-2031
- 2029-2031 sunset w/o safe harbor: 2%
- 2029-2031 sunset w/ safe harbor: 8%

No sunset reduction before 2026: 35%
