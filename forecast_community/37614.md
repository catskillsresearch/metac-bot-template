# John Morgan's Potential Florida Gubernatorial Run: Will He Announce Before July 1, 2025?

John Morgan, the prominent billionaire attorney known for his "For the People" advertisements and advocacy for issues like medical marijuana legalization, has been openly considering a run for Florida governor in 2026. Despite generating significant media attention with his public statements and criticisms of both major political parties, several factors suggest he is unlikely to formally announce his candidacy before July 1, 2025.

## Legal and Procedural Constraints

Florida law imposes a critical deadline that directly impacts Morgan's stated intentions. If he wishes to run under the banner of a new third party—which he has repeatedly indicated is his preference—he must be a registered member of that party at least 365 days before the June 12, 2026 qualifying deadline. This means Morgan has until June 12, 2025—less than a week from today—to establish his new party and register with it.

This compressed timeline creates significant logistical challenges. As of June 6, 2025, there is no public evidence that Morgan has completed the legal process of forming a new party or registering as a member. Creating a political party is a complex undertaking that typically requires substantial groundwork and organizational structure—none of which appears to be in place with just days remaining before this crucial deadline.

## Morgan's Current Stance and Communication Style

Morgan has deliberately maintained an ambiguous position regarding his candidacy. During a nearly hour-long discussion at the Capital Tiger Bay Club in Tallahassee in May 2025, he did not provide a clear answer about his intentions. His public statements consistently frame his decision-making as ongoing and day-to-day: "Every day that you wake up, you lean differently. You see stuff".

This pattern of communication appears strategic rather than indicative of imminent action. Morgan is known for being unpredictable and for using public speculation as a tool to generate media buzz and maintain leverage. He has established a pattern of keeping his options open while maximizing publicity—characteristics that suggest he is unlikely to rush into a formal announcement without thorough preparation.

## Focus on Party Creation Rather Than Campaign Launch

Morgan's recent public comments have centered more on his dissatisfaction with the two-party system and his desire to create a centrist alternative than on an imminent campaign launch. He has stated that he doesn't "think there's a future for just running as an independent" and instead wants to form a new third party for those stuck "in the middle" with "clowns to the left" and "jokers to the right".

This focus on party creation rather than campaign infrastructure suggests Morgan is still in the preliminary stages of political involvement. Establishing a new party and building the necessary organizational framework would likely need to precede any formal candidacy announcement—a sequence that makes a declaration before July 1 increasingly improbable.

## Media Coverage and External Indicators

All authoritative news coverage—including reports from Politico, Fox 35 Orlando, and WUSF—explicitly characterizes Morgan as still being in the exploratory phase. There have been no leaks, planned events, or filed paperwork indicating an imminent change in status. Professional observers note that high-profile potential candidates, especially wealthy ones who can self-fund, often spend extended periods testing the waters before making formal commitments.

Morgan's wealth does give him the ability to move quickly should he decide to announce, but there are no visible signs of the preparatory steps that would typically precede a major campaign launch. The absence of campaign hiring, infrastructure development, or accelerated political activity suggests no imminent announcement.

## Historical Patterns for Non-Traditional Candidates

Wealthy, non-traditional candidates with the ability to self-fund often take their time before formally entering races, frequently waiting to assess the evolving candidate field or for strategically opportune moments closer to primary deadlines. Morgan appears to be following this established pattern rather than rushing toward a declaration.

His style has consistently been to maintain public interest through provocative statements while avoiding commitment to specific timelines. This approach maximizes flexibility but makes a sudden announcement increasingly unlikely as the July 1 deadline approaches without any observable shift in strategy.
