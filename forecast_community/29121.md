Lula is currently the dominant political figure on the Brazilian left, facing little to no internal competition within his party, the Workers’ Party (PT), or its coalition partners. This lack of viable successors has not happened by accident; rather, it is partly the result of political strategy over the years, with alternative candidates such as Fernando Haddad or Rui Costa struggling to reach Lula’s level of popular appeal or visibility. As a result, significant pressure both within the PT and from allied groups has been building for Lula to seek re-election in 2026, further reinforcing his central role in shaping the left’s prospects.

Publicly, Lula has made explicit and recent declarations of his intention to run, telling PT leadership, “I will run in 2026. The only person who can beat me is me.” He has backed up these words with actions, initiating high-level discussions to secure alliances—especially with the centrist MDB and PSD parties, targeting strategic regional support for the campaign. His vice president and senior government officials have echoed and endorsed Lula’s candidacy, framing him as the “natural candidate” for the left and for the PT in particular.

From an opposition standpoint, the right faces its own set of challenges. Former President Jair Bolsonaro, who was Lula's main adversary in 2022, is barred from running in 2026 due to ongoing legal issues. Efforts are underway to find a replacement standard-bearer, with names like Tarcísio Gomes de Freitas and Michelle Bolsonaro being considered, but neither has yet achieved Bolsonaro’s degree of national prominence or unified support.

Lula’s campaign preparations are visibly underway: he is planning nationwide travel to mobilize support and “combat hate speech” from the far right, a clear indication of campaign positioning. Internal unity within the PT remains strong, with no credible signs of dissent. Polls indicate Lula holds the highest level of potential voter support among tested candidates, though there remains significant disapproval and some public desire for alternatives. Despite this, no challenger—either internally or from the opposition—currently threatens his front-runner status.

Health is the primary factor introducing uncertainty. At 79, Lula’s recent medical history includes surgery for a brain hemorrhage and treatment for a vocal cord lesion. Still, he has repeatedly said his candidacy depends on maintaining “100% of his health,” and his current activities suggest he believes himself fit for a national campaign. The official registration deadline is August 15, 2025, leaving only a short period in which an unexpected health or political crisis could alter the trajectory.

In summary, Lula’s active preparations, public declarations, strong internal and coalition support, and lack of viable alternatives make his candidacy in 2026 highly likely. Only a sudden health issue or dramatic, unforeseen political upheaval would be likely to change this outlook in the limited time before the official registration deadline.
