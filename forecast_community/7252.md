The timeline for determining when AGI first came online is inherently uncertain, as it depends on when AGI becomes publicly known, which is currently unknown. If AGI is never created or disclosed, the question remains unresolved. However, if AGI is developed and eventually becomes public knowledge, the gap between its creation and public announcement could vary significantly. This gap could range from immediate disclosure to several months or even years, influenced by factors such as secrecy, verification challenges, and geopolitical context.

Experts and markets offer a wide range of predictions regarding the timeline for AGI development, with some anticipating it within the next decade and others projecting it further into the future. The competitive landscape and the nature of AGI development suggest that the period of secrecy might be shorter than historical precedents like nuclear weapons, due to competitive pressures and ethical considerations.

Unexpected scenarios could drastically alter the timeline. A rapid and transparent development process, possibly driven by a private company seeking a competitive edge, could lead to an immediate announcement, resulting in a minimal gap between creation and public knowledge. Conversely, a highly secretive government or corporate program, especially during periods of geopolitical tension, could maintain secrecy for several years, significantly delaying public disclosure. These scenarios highlight the complex interplay of technological, competitive, and geopolitical factors that will shape the eventual timeline for AGI's public acknowledgment.
