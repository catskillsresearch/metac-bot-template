Based on the search results and current situation, I'll analyze how long a potential ceasefire in the Russia-Ukraine conflict might last if implemented in 2025.

(a) Time left until outcome is known: We don't know exactly when a ceasefire might be implemented, but the conditional question will be annulled if no ceasefire takes effect before January 1, 2026 - approximately 7.5 months from now.

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: Currently, there is no bilateral ceasefire in effect. Ukraine has agreed to an unconditional ceasefire proposal, but Russia has consistently rejected such proposals while blaming Ukraine for lack of progress[5]. If this pattern continues, even if a ceasefire is implemented, historical patterns suggest it would be brief.

(c) Unexpected outcome scenario: A scenario leading to a longer ceasefire could emerge if significant external pressure (particularly from the Trump administration) forces Russia to accept meaningful compromises, combined with a "coalition of the willing" with troops in Ukraine as proposed by British and French leaders[2]. If this coalition provides robust enforcement mechanisms and deterrence, and if economic pressures on Russia intensify, a ceasefire might extend beyond initial expectations.

## Analysis of Potential Ceasefire Duration

The search results reveal several critical factors that would influence the duration of any ceasefire implemented in 2025:

**Current Negotiation Dynamics**
US President Trump has called for a 30-day unconditional ceasefire that would "ultimately build toward a peace agreement"[5]. Ukraine's President Zelensky has expressed agreement with this approach, indicating that Ukraine, the US, and Europe are "on the same page" about the necessity of a full ceasefire[5]. However, the Kremlin has consistently rejected these proposals while blaming Ukraine for the lack of progress[5].

**Fundamental Conflict Between Russian and Ukrainian Positions**
Russia's demands include recognition of all occupied land as Russian territory, guarantees that Ukraine will never join NATO, and lifting of sanctions[2]. Ukraine seeks full withdrawal of Russian troops, return of prisoners and kidnapped children, prosecution of Russian war crimes, and security guarantees against future aggression[2]. These fundamentally incompatible positions make a sustainable ceasefire challenging.

**Strategic Use of Ceasefire Periods**
Importantly, both sides would likely use any ceasefire as an opportunity to regroup and build military capabilities. As noted by analysts, "There are clear signs that such a ceasefire will not bring peace, and both sides will use any breathing space obtained by a truce to build up their military capabilities"[3]. Russia would use the time to bolster its military while Ukraine would prepare for future Russian threats[3].

**US Administration's Stance**
The Trump administration appears to be taking a more nuanced position than might be expected. VP Vance has stated that Russia is asking for "too much" because it perceives it is winning, noting that Russia cannot expect Ukraine to cede territory it has not seized[5]. This suggests some resistance to simply pressuring Ukraine to capitulate.

## Probability Assessment

Given these factors, I assess that any ceasefire implemented in 2025 would face significant challenges in maintaining durability:

1. **Historical precedent**: Previous attempts at negotiation have failed due to fundamental disagreements and lack of trust.

2. **Strategic calculations**: Both sides view the conflict in existential terms and would use a ceasefire to prepare for future conflict[3].

3. **Enforcement mechanisms**: While European leaders have proposed a "coalition of the willing" with troops in Ukraine[2], the actual implementation of robust enforcement remains uncertain.

4. **Economic and military exhaustion**: By early 2025, both Ukraine and its allies appear largely exhausted[4], which could push for a ceasefire but not necessarily ensure its durability.

The most likely scenario is that a ceasefire would last either the minimum proposed 30 days or slightly longer, before breaking down due to violations or strategic calculations by either side. A longer ceasefire would require significant changes in the fundamental dynamics of the conflict.

Option_A: Less than 30 days: 35%
Option_B: 30 days: 30%
Option_C: 31-60 days: 20%
Option_D: 61-90 days: 10%
Option_E: 91 days or more: 5%
