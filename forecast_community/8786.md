# Will Russia Annex Any Part of Any Baltic Country by 2035?

Assessing the probability of Russian annexation in the Baltics requires careful analysis of historical patterns, current geopolitical dynamics, and the strategic calculations of all parties involved. The Baltic states (Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania) represent a unique security flashpoint with significant implications for European security and NATO credibility.

## Current Geopolitical Context

The Baltic region has become increasingly tense as Russia and NATO engage in a prolonged diplomatic and military standoff. Recent developments indicate Russia's continued interest in projecting power in the region:

- Russia remains engaged in a protracted conflict in Ukraine with uncertain resolution timeframes
- Baltic nations have implemented a joint Eastern Border Initiative with Poland to strengthen the 2,300 km border with Russia and Belarus
- NATO has enhanced its forward presence in the Baltic states as a deterrent measure
- Former CIA Director David Petraeus has specifically warned that Lithuania may be Russia's next target if Russia succeeds in Ukraine
- Russia is increasing its military presence near the Finnish border and considering multiple conflict scenarios involving Northern Europe

The pace of Russia's advance in Ukraine has been extremely slow, with estimates suggesting it would take 140-180 years at current rates to capture remaining Ukrainian territory. However, intelligence assessments indicate the war continues to slowly trend in Russia's favor as of mid-2025.

## Key Risk Factors

Several factors potentially increase the likelihood of Russian annexation in the Baltics:

**Demographic Vulnerabilities**: The presence of approximately 1 million ethnic Russians across the Baltic states provides potential justification for Russian intervention. This population is particularly concentrated in eastern regions, with some municipalities having 40-60% ethnic Russian populations - a demographic situation that mirrors patterns Russia exploited in Crimea and eastern Ukraine.

**Russian Strategic Planning**: According to intelligence reports, Russia is considering 15 possible military conflict scenarios by 2045, with six relating to Northern Europe. The German Federal Intelligence Service (BND) has warned that Russia may be fully prepared for a "large-scale conventional war" by 2030 and views its relations with the West as a systemic conflict.

**Military Redeployment Potential**: Baltic defense ministers have expressed concern that any ceasefire in Ukraine would enable Russia to quickly rearm and redeploy troops to NATO's northeastern flank. Estonian Defense Minister Hanno Pevkur estimated that of the 600,000 Russian servicemen currently in Ukraine, 300,000 could be redeployed elsewhere.

**Limited Strategic Depth**: The Baltic states lack strategic depth, with their combined land area of 175,000 square kilometers being smaller than the Ukrainian territory seized by Russia in the early months of its invasion.

## Deterrence Factors

Several significant factors reduce the likelihood of Russian annexation:

**NATO Article 5**: The Baltic states are protected by NATO's collective defense guarantee, unlike Ukraine. Any direct attack would risk full-scale war with the alliance - a fundamentally different security guarantee than Ukraine had in 2014.

**Enhanced Defense Posture**: The Baltic countries have significantly increased their defense spending (committing to 5% of GDP) and are constructing extensive defensive infrastructure along their borders, including bunkers, trenches, and anti-tank ditches.

**Strategic Regional Changes**: Finland's NATO accession has redrawn the military map, with its 1,340-km border with Russia extending NATO's eastern flank. The Baltic Sea is increasingly described as a "NATO lake" with Russia's access significantly constrained.

**Energy Independence**: The Baltic states successfully disconnected from Russia's electrical grid and connected to the European Union's grid through Poland in February 2025, eliminating a major point of leverage that Russia previously held over these nations.

## Potential Scenarios

When evaluating the likelihood of Russian annexation in the Baltics by 2035, three main scenarios emerge:

1. **Status Quo Continuation (65-75% probability)**: Russia remains deterred by NATO's Article 5 commitment and focuses on consolidating gains in Ukraine rather than risking direct conflict with NATO. Russia continues using hybrid warfare tactics that fall below the threshold of Article 5.

2. **Limited Territory Seizure (20-30% probability)**: Russia exploits a period of NATO division or distraction to seize small border territories with significant ethnic Russian populations, particularly in eastern Estonia (Narva). This could occur following a manufactured crisis or during a major geopolitical distraction elsewhere. Russia calculates that NATO's response will be divided or limited, establishing facts on the ground before an effective collective defense can be mobilized.

3. **Major Military Operation (5-10% probability)**: Russia conducts a large-scale military operation to annex substantial Baltic territories following a collapse of NATO cohesion or a major strategic realignment in Europe.

## Comparative Analysis

Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea provides the closest analog, but critical differences exist. Crimea featured a much larger Russian population percentage, lacked NATO protection, and offered significant strategic value through naval bases. The Baltic states' NATO membership represents a qualitatively different security guarantee.

## Conclusion

While Russia clearly maintains strategic interest in the Baltic region and has demonstrated willingness to annex territory in non-NATO states, the combination of NATO's Article 5 guarantee, enhanced defensive preparations, and the significant escalation risk provides a powerful deterrent. Russia's military limitations exposed in Ukraine further constrain its options.

Nevertheless, the concentration of ethnic Russians in border regions, Russia's increasing military capabilities, and the potential redeployment of forces after the Ukraine conflict create an enduring risk that cannot be dismissed. This risk will likely increase after Russia potentially achieves its objectives in Ukraine and can rebuild and redeploy its forces toward NATO's northeastern flank.
