The number of people working for the US federal government in November 2026 will be shaped by an interplay of aggressive policy actions, legal constraints, and economic and political developments over the coming 17–18 months. The starting point is a federal workforce of approximately 3,012,000 employees, as recorded in early 2025.

Current administration plans call for substantial reductions, targeting up to 700,000 positions through strategies that include Reductions in Force (RIFs), hiring freezes, and attrition, with early implementation already resulting in a wave of layoffs and buyouts—particularly in large agencies such as the VA, EPA, Department of Education, and NOAA. However, while initial layoffs have been significant, the trajectory of further cuts is uncertain and heavily contingent on multiple factors. Legal and logistical barriers have slowed or partially blocked the implementation of the most ambitious targets, resulting in a front-loaded pattern of downsizing that is likely to stabilize by early 2026. Most expert forecasts, including University of Michigan’s February 2025 economic outlook, anticipate a net reduction of 240,000 to 700,000 jobs, with the federal workforce plateauing at a new, lower level for the remainder of 2026.

Legislative and judicial resistance plays a pivotal role: courts have already blocked or delayed cuts affecting large numbers of employees, and bipartisan pushback has emerged to prevent “maximum elimination” scenarios, particularly for agencies involved in national security or functions mandated by law. Consequently, while the lower bound for workforce size is shaped by scenarios in which legal and political obstacles collapse and the administration fully enacts its planned cuts—potentially pushing the workforce down to 2,200,000—this outcome requires both rapid, comprehensive execution of layoffs and minimal offsetting factors.

Conversely, scenarios that would keep employment at higher levels hinge on legal or political reversals, Congressional intervention, or external shocks such as a national emergency or large-scale disaster response. Should major court injunctions or Congressional action block most layoffs, or if an unforeseen crisis necessitates ramped-up federal hiring, the workforce could remain near current levels, or see only modest reductions—possibly above 2,800,000.

Overall, the consensus among expert analysis and available data is that most major cuts will proceed, but implementation will be uneven, with the ultimate number likely falling well below the status quo but not reaching the lowest possible scenarios. The balance of risks points to a federal workforce in November 2026 between 2,300,000 and 2,500,000 employees, with the most probable outcome reflecting partial but substantial implementation of announced reductions, tempered by legal, political, and economic constraints. Unexpected developments—whether rapid legal validation of cuts or major national emergencies—could, however, drive the total notably outside this range.
