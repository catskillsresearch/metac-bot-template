As a professional forecaster, I'll address the question about antimicrobial drug sales for livestock in 2024 compared to 2023.

(a) Time until outcome is known: The FDA's report on 2024 antimicrobial sales will likely be published in late 2025, approximately 6-7 months from now.

(b) Status quo outcome: The most recent data shows a 2% decrease in sales from 2022 to 2023, with the 2023 total being 6,127,991 kg of medically important antimicrobials.

(c) No outcome scenario: Continued implementation of antibiotic stewardship programs, growth in alternatives like probiotics, and regulatory pressure to reduce antimicrobial use lead to stable or slightly decreased sales in 2024.

(d) Yes outcome scenario: Increased disease prevalence in livestock, new antimicrobial product approvals (like Pradalex in April 2024), and growth in certain livestock sectors (particularly swine) drive sales above 6,158,631 kg in 2024.

## Historical Trends and Recent Context

The FDA reported that sales of medically important antimicrobials for food-producing animals decreased by 2% between 2022 and 2023[1]. This continues a long-term downward trend, with a 37% decrease since peak sales in 2015[1].

However, this decline hasn't been consistent. Looking at annual changes:
- 2022 to 2023: 2% decrease (6.2 million kg to 6.1 million kg)[1][3]
- 2021 to 2022: 4% increase (5.9 million kg to 6.2 million kg)[5]

The trend shows fluctuations rather than a steady decline, with sales remaining significantly above the lows reached after major regulatory changes in 2017.

## Factors Supporting a Sales Increase in 2024

Several developments suggest antimicrobial sales could increase in 2024:

1. **New Product Approvals**: The FDA approved Pradalex, a pradofloxacin injection for respiratory diseases in cattle and swine, in April 2024. New treatment options typically lead to increased usage.

2. **Livestock Disease Dynamics**: The veterinary antimicrobial susceptibility testing market is expanding, partly due to the increasing frequency of multidrug-resistant organisms. This suggests ongoing challenges with livestock diseases that may require antimicrobial treatment.

3. **Market Growth Projections**: The global veterinary antibiotics market was calculated at USD 5.25 billion in 2024 and is expected to reach USD 6.72 billion by 2034[4]. While this is a global figure, it indicates continued growth in the sector.

4. **Production Cycle Considerations**: Antimicrobial use tends to correlate with livestock production volumes. With continued demand for meat products, particularly in the swine sector, usage may increase accordingly.

## Factors Supporting Sales Stability or Decrease

Counterbalancing forces may limit antimicrobial growth:

1. **Regulatory Pressure**: The Drugs Technical Advisory Board recently recommended prohibiting 34 antimicrobial products for animal use, reflecting continued regulatory concern about antimicrobial resistance.

2. **Alternative Solutions**: The animal probiotics market is growing rapidly, with products like DSM's PoultryStar reducing necrotic enteritis by 60% without antibiotics. This represents a viable alternative to traditional antimicrobials.

3. **Industry Initiatives**: Major industry players like Elanco Animal Health have implemented global antibiotic stewardship plans focused on reducing shared-class antibiotics.

4. **Long-term Resistance Concerns**: A recent study indicating that 8,500 tons of antibiotics end up in rivers annually has heightened awareness of environmental impacts, potentially influencing usage decisions.

## Analysis of Sales Patterns

The FDA notes that "sales volume observed over time can be a valuable indicator of market trends related to these products"[5]. While the 2% decrease from 2022 to 2023 might suggest a continuing downward trend, the 4% increase from 2021 to 2022 demonstrates that year-to-year fluctuations occur.

Given that 2023 saw a decrease, and considering the historical pattern of fluctuations rather than consistent direction, the probability of an increase in 2024 is heightened by regression to the mean. Additionally, with new product approvals and continued disease challenges, the conditions exist for at least a modest increase.

## Conclusion

While long-term trends point toward gradually decreasing antimicrobial use in livestock, short-term fluctuations are common. The approval of new products in 2024, ongoing disease challenges, and the pattern of alternating increases and decreases suggest that 2024 could see an uptick following the 2023 decrease.

Given the historical volatility, the recent product approvals, and the fact that the question only requires a 0.5% increase (which is quite modest), I believe there's a greater than even chance that antimicrobial sales will increase by at least 0.5% in 2024.

Probability: 65%
