A variety of interconnected trends are influencing the outlook for antimicrobial drug sales in livestock production for 2024. Historically, sales of medically important antimicrobials for food-producing animals in the U.S. have been on a downward trajectory, with a reported 37% decline since their peak in 2015 and a 2% decrease from 2022 to 2023. This decrease reflects the cumulative effects of regulatory reforms, global and domestic stewardship efforts, and growing public and industry awareness of antimicrobial resistance.

Regulatory and industry initiatives remain strong drivers pushing usage downward. Regulatory authorities have continued to tighten controls, with actions such as bans and restrictions on certain antimicrobials and increased monitoring. At the same time, the industry is embracing stewardship campaigns, adoption of improved herd management practices, and investment in alternative solutions like probiotics, vaccines, and enhanced biosecurity. The rapid growth of the animal probiotics market—expected to reach $6.8 billion by 2031—demonstrates the increasing viability and uptake of non-antibiotic interventions.

However, the downward trend has not been perfectly linear. Recent history shows year-to-year volatility: sales increased by 4% from 2021 to 2022 before falling by 2% in 2023. Such fluctuations demonstrate that temporary reversals are possible even within a persistent long-term decline. Economic and epidemiological factors—such as increased livestock production, new disease outbreaks, or approval and adoption of new antimicrobial products—can create spikes in demand. For example, the recent approval of Pradalex (a pradofloxacin injection for cattle and swine) could foster new market activity, while broader veterinary antibiotics market projections anticipate revenue growth over the next decade.

Internationally, the market for veterinary antibiotics is expanding, with global revenues expected to rise from $5.25 billion in 2024 to around $6.7 billion by 2034, driven by disease prevalence, ongoing product launches, and the pursuit of higher productivity in animal agriculture. While these trends may influence U.S. practices, the domestic context features uniquely strong regulatory oversight and stewardship.

The balance of evidence favors a continuation of the modest downward trend or, at the very least, stability in antimicrobial drug sales for livestock in the U.S. The regulatory environment, growth of alternatives, and sustained public and industry focus on antimicrobial resistance make a significant sustained increase unlikely. Nonetheless, the demonstrated potential for short-term increases due to market and epidemiological shocks means a reversal cannot be entirely ruled out. Unpredictable disease outbreaks or other external shocks could drive usage above recent levels.

Overall, while temporary increases are possible given historical volatility and the dynamic nature of the sector, the dominant forces—regulation, stewardship, and alternatives—continue to apply downward pressure on overall antimicrobial drug sales for livestock.
