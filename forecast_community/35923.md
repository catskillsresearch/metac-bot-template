The Inflation Reduction Act's domestic content provisions currently offer an *optional* bonus, not a mandatory requirement, for securing the Section 48E Investment Tax Credit (ITC). Under this framework, energy projects that meet specified thresholds for U.S.-sourced steel, iron, and manufactured products receive a 10% bonus credit atop the base ITC, but the base credit remains fully available regardless of domestic content compliance. The IRS, most recently via Notice 2025-08, has reaffirmed and clarified this elective structure, with updated guidance on calculating compliance percentages and safe harbors, but has not signaled any plans to transform the voluntary bonus into a prerequisite for ITC eligibility. 

The legislative and political environment also supports the continuation of this approach. The current Republican-led Congress and White House are focused on reducing or phasing out clean energy tax credits, including Section 48E, rather than expanding regulatory requirements or making them stricter. Recent legislative actions have prioritized cutting, capping, or accelerating the phaseout of incentives, with no active bills or serious proposals to mandate domestic content for the base ITC. While protectionist and “America First” rhetoric remains present, practical legislative efforts are directed at reducing federal involvement in clean energy incentives, not increasing it.

Enacting a mandatory domestic content requirement would be a significant policy shift that would require new federal legislation. There is no evidence of such a proposal being under serious consideration, and the complex legislative process makes its passage unlikely within the remaining months of 2025. The administrative agencies (IRS and Treasury) also lack the statutory authority to impose such a requirement unilaterally. 

Industry expectations, as reflected in recent reports and analyses, anticipate continued uncertainty about the IRA’s future but see reduction or elimination of clean energy incentives as far more likely outcomes than an expansion of domestic content mandates. The technical and practical barriers—including potential supply chain disruptions, industry resistance, and the inertia of existing regulatory frameworks—further diminish the plausibility of a mandatory domestic content rule taking effect in 2025.

In sum, all current policy guidance, legislative activity, and industry expectations point toward the domestic content requirement for the Section 48E ITC remaining optional—as a bonus credit rather than a mandatory prerequisite—at least through the end of 2025.
