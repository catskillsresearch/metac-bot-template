(a) **Time Left Until Resolution:**  
There are approximately 7.5 months remaining until the outcome is determined (the deadline is January 1, 2026). Today is May 13, 2025.

(b) **Status Quo Outcome If Nothing Changes:**  
The domestic content requirements for the Section 48E Investment Tax Credit (ITC) under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) remain a *voluntary bonus*. Projects that incorporate sufficient US-made steel, iron, and manufactured components receive an extra 10% credit, but domestic content is not a universal prerequisite for the base ITC[1][2][5]. Treasury and IRS guidance, including Notice 2025-08 issued in January 2025, maintains this bonus structure[1][2][5].

(c) **No Outcome Scenario (Domestic Content Not Mandatory):**  
- Congress does not pass a law making domestic content a mandatory requirement for receiving the 48E ITC.  
- The IRS and Treasury continue issuing guidance focused on amending bonus eligibility and safe harbors, but do not alter the fundamental, bonus-only structure[1][2][5].
- The legislative focus remains on reducing, phasing out, or eliminating IRA tax credits rather than introducing stricter requirements.

(d) **Yes Outcome Scenario (Domestic Content Becomes Mandatory):**  
- Congress passes, and the President signs, a federal law before January 1, 2026, that makes domestic content requirements at least as strict as those attached to the bonus credit *mandatory* for all Section 48E ITC claims.
- This could occur as part of omnibus tax reform, a targeted energy bill, or as a provision added to budget reconciliation.
- The new law would explicitly condition eligibility for the baseline 48E ITC on meeting domestic content thresholds, not just for the bonus.

## Rationale

Recent legislative activity in Congress under Republican control centers on *reducing* or *eliminating* clean energy tax credits, including the 48E ITC, rather than expanding eligibility requirements or making bonus provisions mandatory for all claimants. House Republican tax proposals would phase out or end clean energy incentives early, aiming to redirect funds toward tax cuts and deficit reduction[news.bloomberglaw.com][Washington Examiner]. There is no evidence in legislative summaries, Congressional Research Service reports, or IRS guidance up to May 13, 2025, that any bill to make domestic content mandatory for 48E ITC is moving forward or under serious active consideration[1][2][5].

IRS guidance as of Notice 2025-08 (January 2025) preserves the bonus structure: domestic content is incentivized with up to a 10% additional credit, but is not required for the standard ITC. The updated safe harbor thresholds and calculation methods clarify how the bonus is earned, not alter its elective nature[1][5]. No new requirement has been announced that would convert the bonus condition into a universal prerequisite.

Political dynamics further reinforce the status quo. Key Republican lawmakers advocate a "thoughtful phaseout" of green credits, and the majority's slim margin in the House, along with division over how sharply to cut clean energy policy, make major new mandates highly unlikely[eenews.net][thehill.com]. The legislative energy is on reduction or repeal, not expansion, of clean energy requirements.

While it is always possible, in principle, for Congress to dramatically revise the program, the dominant pressures are for less support, not for stricter conditions. Therefore, absent a rapid and unexpected legislative reversal, the base ITC under Section 48E will not become contingent on meeting domestic content requirements before January 1, 2026.
