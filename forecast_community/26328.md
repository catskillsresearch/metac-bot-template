As a professional forecaster, I'll address this question about human-to-human transmission of H5N1 avian influenza before 2026.

(a) Time remaining until outcome is known: 7.5 months (from May 13, 2025 to January 1, 2026)

(b) Status quo outcome: No confirmed human-to-human transmission of H5N1 has been reported by CDC as of May 13, 2025.

(c) Scenario resulting in No outcome: H5N1 continues to infect humans through animal contact only, with surveillance systems detecting and containing cases quickly, preventing viral adaptations necessary for efficient human-to-human spread.

(d) Scenario resulting in Yes outcome: The virus undergoes genetic mutations as it continues to spread in mammals, adapting to efficiently transmit between humans, with CDC confirming at least one such case before January 1, 2026.

## Current Situation Analysis

The H5N1 avian influenza situation has evolved significantly since the initial 2024 outbreaks. As of mid-May 2025, we have several key data points to consider:

- There have been approximately 70 human cases of avian influenza A(H5) virus infection reported in the United States since April 2024[1]
- The first U.S. death from H5N1 bird flu was reported in Louisiana in early 2025[2]
- Globally, from 2003 to April 2025, 972 cases of human infections with avian influenza A(H5N1) have been reported to the WHO from 24 countries, with 470 deaths (48.4% case fatality rate)[4]

Most critically for our forecast, the WHO explicitly stated as of February 25, 2025: "human-to-human transmission of avian influenza A(H5N1) virus has not been reported."[5]

## Risk Assessment Factors

Several factors suggest the risk of human-to-human transmission remains significant:

**1. Expanding Host Range**
The virus continues to demonstrate remarkable adaptability across species. It has infected dairy cattle, cats, pigs, and various other mammals, creating multiple opportunities for viral evolution[5]. This multi-species spread increases mutation opportunities that could potentially enable human-to-human transmission.

**2. Increasing Human Cases**
The growing number of human infections (from 9 cases in July 2024 to 70 cases by March 2025)[1] provides more opportunities for the virus to adapt to human hosts. While most cases remain linked to animal exposure, each infection represents a chance for the virus to evolve.

**3. High Mortality Rate**
The global case fatality rate of approximately 48.4%[4] indicates the virus remains highly pathogenic when it does infect humans. This suggests the virus retains features that make it dangerous to humans, though not yet efficiently transmissible between them.

**4. Surveillance Capabilities**
The robust surveillance systems currently monitoring both animal and human cases increase the likelihood of detecting human-to-human transmission if it does occur. The CDC is actively monitoring over 16,600 individuals through targeted surveillance.

## Historical Context

It's important to note that highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses have maintained a persistent pattern throughout their history:

1. They periodically cause outbreaks in birds
2. They occasionally infect humans through direct animal contact
3. They rarely develop sustained human-to-human transmission

Despite decades of circulation, H5N1 has not yet developed the ability for efficient human-to-human transmission. The WHO notes that "limited human-to-human transmission of A(H5) viruses was observed in isolated events between 1997 and 2007," but "sustained human-to-human transmission of A(H5) viruses has not been documented."[4]

## Forecast Reasoning

Given the available evidence, I assess that human-to-human transmission of H5N1 before January 1, 2026 remains unlikely but possible. Several factors support this assessment:

1. **Status quo persistence**: Despite 70+ human cases in the U.S. and hundreds globally over many years, the virus has not yet demonstrated sustained human-to-human transmission capability[4][5].

2. **Limited timeframe**: Only 7.5 months remain until January 1, 2026, providing a relatively short window for the necessary viral adaptations to emerge and be confirmed by the CDC.

3. **Robust surveillance**: The extensive monitoring systems in place would likely detect any shift toward human-to-human transmission quickly, allowing for rapid containment measures.

4. **Biological hurdles**: For efficient human-to-human transmission, the virus would need to overcome significant biological barriers, including adaptation to the human upper respiratory tract and development of airborne transmission capability.

However, I must acknowledge significant risk factors that could lead to human-to-human transmission:

1. The virus continues to demonstrate remarkable adaptability across species
2. The increasing number of human infections provides more opportunities for viral evolution
3. The high case load in mammals creates more potential for reassortment events
