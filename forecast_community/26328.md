The highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 virus continues to generate global concern due to its widespread circulation in birds and various mammals, including dairy cattle and other species, across multiple continents. While as of late May 2025, no confirmed human-to-human transmission has been reported anywhere in the world, the evolving epidemiological landscape warrants cautious attention.

H5N1 maintains a predominantly animal-to-human transmission pattern, with most human cases linked directly to exposure to infected birds or mammals. The United States, for example, has documented 66 confirmed human H5N1 cases since 2024, including the first U.S. death in January 2025, and a total of 972 global cases with a high case fatality rate of 48.4%. The virus’s ability to infect a broad range of mammals—including cattle, cats, and other species—demonstrates its expanding host range, which is a critical factor for future adaptation to humans.

The risk profile for human-to-human transmission has increased due to several converging trends:
- **Expanding Host Range**: H5N1’s repeated successful cross-species jumps, particularly its spread in dairy cattle across U.S. states and infection of numerous mammalian species, provide more opportunities for the virus to adapt.
- **Continued Viral Evolution**: Evidence of mutations associated with mammalian adaptation (such as the E627K mutation) has been detected, although not yet at levels deemed sufficient for efficient human-to-human transmission.
- **Increasing Human Infections**: Surges in the number of human cases, including a few with unknown sources of infection, heighten the opportunities for further viral adaptation to human hosts.
- **Widespread Geographic Distribution**: The virus’s presence in all U.S. states and across many countries creates persistent opportunities for human exposure and subsequent viral evolution.

Despite these risk factors, there are significant barriers and mitigations against H5N1 achieving efficient human-to-human transmission in the near term:
- **Genetic Barriers**: The virus would require multiple, specific genetic changes—particularly in its hemagglutinin protein—to efficiently recognize and infect human respiratory tract cells. Such changes have not yet been observed.
- **Historical Precedent**: After decades of circulation and hundreds of human cases worldwide, H5N1 has not yet acquired sustained human-to-human transmissibility.
- **Ongoing Surveillance and Public Health Response**: Health authorities, including the CDC and WHO, have robust surveillance and biosecurity measures in place, enabling rapid detection and containment of potential transmission events. Their current assessments continue to rate the public health risk to the general population as low, although they acknowledge increased risk for individuals with occupational exposure.

Cases with undetermined infection sources—particularly those without documented animal exposure—raise the possibility of limited or undetected human-to-human transmission, but current epidemiological and virological investigations have not provided confirming evidence. Surveillance in both the U.S. and globally has so far ruled out known human-to-human transmission events.

In summary, while the probability of reported human-to-human transmission of highly pathogenic H5N1 before 2026 remains below even odds, the risk is higher than at any previous time due to the virus’s expanding host range, continued global spread, and a growing number of human infections. Vigilance is warranted, as each new infection increases the probability of adaptive mutations. However, the absence of confirmed person-to-person transmission, substantial genetic barriers, and proactive public health measures collectively sustain the status quo, with animal-to-human transmission remaining the primary route of infection for now.
