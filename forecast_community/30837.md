(a) Time left: Approximately 7.5 months until the outcome is known (May 13, 2025 to January 1, 2026)
(b) Status quo outcome: No All-Star from NFL, NBA, MLB, or NHL has been banned or suspended for sports betting
(c) No outcome scenario: All-Star players continue to be more cautious than average players due to their higher profiles and greater financial incentives to follow rules, resulting in no violations through the end of 2025
(d) Yes outcome scenario: An All-Star player inadvertently violates betting rules (perhaps betting from a team facility) or deliberately participates in a betting scheme, leading to a suspension before 2026

As a professional forecaster, I'll analyze the likelihood of an All-Star from one of the major sports leagues being suspended for gambling violations before 2026.

## Historical Context and Current Environment

Sports betting has experienced dramatic growth since its broad legalization in 2018. The search results show numerous gambling-related suspensions have occurred across major sports leagues, particularly in the NFL. For instance, in 2022, Atlanta Falcons wide receiver Calvin Ridley was suspended for the entire season for betting on NFL games[2][4]. Since 2022, at least eleven NFL players have faced gambling-related suspensions.

The leagues maintain strict gambling policies:
- NFL players can bet on non-NFL events through legal sportsbooks but cannot place bets from team facilities or when traveling with the team[4]
- The NBA, MLB, and NHL allow players to bet on other sports without restriction, as long as it's through regulated channels in legal states[5]

Notably, however, no All-Stars have been suspended for gambling violations as of December 2024.

## Risk Factors and Considerations

Several factors increase the risk of an All-Star being suspended:

1. **Increased Accessibility**: Sports betting is now legal in 38 states as of March 2024, making it easily accessible through mobile apps[4]

2. **High Detection Capability**: Leagues have sophisticated monitoring systems in partnership with sportsbooks to detect unusual betting patterns[2][4]

3. **Large Pool of Potential Violators**: The question encompasses all past All-Stars from four major sports leagues who are still active players, representing hundreds of individuals

4. **Recent Precedents**: We've seen high-profile cases like MLB umpire Pat Hoberg's suspension for allegedly sharing a betting account with a poker player, showing leagues are actively enforcing policies

However, several factors decrease the likelihood:

1. **Status Quo Persistence**: Despite increased betting availability, no All-Star has been caught violating betting rules so far, suggesting they may be more cautious

2. **Risk Asymmetry**: All-Stars have more to lose financially and reputationally from violations than average players

3. **Awareness**: High-profile athletes likely receive additional education about gambling policies and may have financial advisors helping them avoid violations

4. **Time Constraint**: The question only covers approximately 7.5 months, limiting the window for a violation to occur

## Recent Developments

The search results show several relevant recent developments:

- The NCAA is considering lifting its ban on professional sports betting while maintaining the ban on college sports betting[3]
- The NFL has revised its gambling policy to create clearer distinctions between different types of violations[4]
- MLB recently suspended Braves player Jurickson Profar for 80 games, though for PED use rather than gambling

## Probabilistic Assessment

Given the historical data and current environment, I must consider both the base rate (no All-Star suspensions so far) and the increased risk factors. The status quo suggests a less than 50% probability, but the question's 7.5-month timeframe, the large pool of potential violators, and the heightened enforcement environment create meaningful risk.

Considering the status quo deserves significant weight—the world changes slowly most of the time—but we must account for the clear trend of increasing gambling violations across sports.

Probability: 25%
