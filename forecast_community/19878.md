(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
There are just under eight months remaining until the end of 2025, when the resolution criteria—credible reports indicating a Chinese robotics company has produced and delivered more than 1,000 identical, autonomous, bipedal humanoid robots—will be met or not.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
If current trends persist, China is highly likely to meet the criteria for mass production of humanoid robots by the end of 2025. Multiple companies are either already at, or on track to exceed, the 1,000-unit milestone for a single model within the year, with strong government support, policy mandates, and visible industrial ramp-up[1][5].

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
A “No” would occur if, despite current plans and production ramp-ups, Chinese humanoid robot firms fail to:
- Deliver credible evidence that any single company manufactured and delivered over 1,000 identical units before December 31, 2025.
- Face unforeseen constraints such as bottlenecks in key components (e.g., actuators, sensors), labor shortages, regulatory issues, or technical performance shortfalls that prevent autonomous operation at the required scale.
- Experience delays or failures in transferring production from pilot runs to reliable mass manufacturing, or only produce robots that do not meet the full technical definition (e.g., if they cannot walk autonomously, or are not truly bipedal)[1].

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
A “Yes” would occur if:
- One or more Chinese robotics companies deliver verifiable evidence (e.g., government filings, major media reporting, or audited company statements) of having manufactured and delivered more than 1,000 identical, fully autonomous, bipedal humanoid robots before the end of 2025.
- This could happen through existing leaders like AGIBOT/Zhiyuan or UBTech, who have publicized their intent and preliminary production numbers close to the 1,000-unit mark and have ongoing production ramp-ups[1][5].
- Industry-wide reports and government policy incentives successfully spur the key firms to cross the threshold in time, and this is credibly reported[1][5].

## Rationale

- **Current evidence:** Multiple Chinese companies are now in mass production or advanced pilot production of humanoid robots, with at least six firms publicly targeting or having already reached the 1,000-unit mark in 2025[1]. AGIBOT, for example, reported producing at least 962 robots as early as January 2025 and is reportedly increasing this output further[5]. Industry sources, including TrendForce and the South China Morning Post, consistently report that at least six companies expect to surpass 1,000 units of an identical model within 2025, with several operating dedicated mass production lines[1].
- **Policy and ecosystem:** The Chinese government has prioritized humanoid robotics as a strategic technological sector, with explicit policy goals for mass production in 2025[2][4]. Financial incentives, manufacturing scale, and supply chain maturity (especially in the Yangtze River Delta) are all working in favor of achieving the relevant milestone[1][5].
- **Remaining uncertainties:** Although some reports stop just short of explicitly confirming the delivery of >1,000 units per company as of now, production momentum is strong and accelerating. Risks remain in logistics, component shortages, or possible technical setbacks, but there is no sign these are derailing progress at the sector level[1]. Industry sources and management statements suggest positive trajectories with few bottlenecks[1][5].

## Final Probability Assessment

Given the combination of:
- Multiple independent firms already nearing the required threshold,
- Clear government policy and material support,
- Public production targets aligned with resolution criteria,
- Credible, ongoing media and sector reporting,

It is highly probable that at least one Chinese robotics company will credibly report having produced and delivered more than 1,000 autonomous, bipedal humanoid robots of an identical model before December 31, 2025.

**Probability: 85%**
