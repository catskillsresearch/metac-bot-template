# NATO Membership Outlook for December 31, 2025

As of May 2025, NATO currently has 32 member states, with Sweden being the most recent addition on March 7, 2024, following Finland's accession on April 4, 2023. Looking ahead to December 31, 2025, several factors will influence whether this number changes.

## Current Membership Status

NATO expanded northward with the addition of Finland and Sweden, which represented a significant shift in the Alliance's presence and capabilities, particularly in the Arctic region. Sweden's membership completed the unification of all five Nordic countries under the same defensive alliance for the first time since the 16th century. These recent additions brought NATO to its current 32 members, strengthening the Alliance's northern flank.

## Potential Candidates

Three countries have been recognized as aspirants for NATO membership:

**Bosnia and Herzegovina** is currently the most advanced prospective member, having participated in NATO's Membership Action Plan since 2010. However, progress remains slow due to internal political divisions and lack of required reforms. While this is the most likely candidate for becoming the 33rd member, there is no clear evidence that accession will complete before the end of 2025.

**Georgia and Ukraine** were promised future membership at the 2008 Bucharest Summit. However, both face significant barriers to near-term accession, primarily ongoing territorial conflicts. These unresolved issues make their admission by the end of 2025 extremely unlikely, as NATO typically avoids admitting countries with active territorial disputes.

## Accession Process Considerations

The NATO accession process is methodical and lengthy. Any country wishing to join must meet economic and military strength requirements, and the decision to add a new member state must be unanimously approved by all existing members. This process involves each Alliance member signing and ratifying the Accession Protocol according to their national procedures.

Sweden's recent experience demonstrates the potential for delays in this process. Both Turkey and Hungary initially delayed ratification of Sweden's accession protocol before eventually approving it in early 2024. Such political hurdles could affect any potential new member's timeline.

## Current Strategic Focus

The upcoming NATO summit in The Hague in June 2025 appears focused on other priorities rather than enlargement. The agenda centers on reinforcing unity, increasing defense spending targets (pushing for 3.5% of GDP by 2030), securing increased capability targets, and strategic planning regarding threats from both Russia and China. This suggests that immediate expansion is not a top priority for the Alliance in 2025.

## Potential Scenarios

The most likely outcome is that NATO maintains 32 members through December 31, 2025. There is little evidence of any country completing the accession process within this timeframe.

An unexpected scenario that could lead to a lower number would require a member state withdrawing from NATO. This is extremely improbable given the current security environment in Europe, with the Russia-Ukraine conflict actually strengthening alliance cohesion rather than weakening it.

A scenario resulting in 33 members by year-end would most likely involve Bosnia and Herzegovina making unexpectedly rapid progress in its accession process, possibly accelerated by a significant geopolitical event or security crisis in the region. While possible, there are currently no signals that the process is moving at this pace.

Based on the current geopolitical landscape, procedural timelines, and lack of imminent accession candidates, NATO is highly likely to maintain its current 32 members through the end of 2025, with only a small possibility of expansion to 33 members if Bosnia and Herzegovina's accession were to unexpectedly accelerate.
