(a) Time left until outcome is known: Approximately 7.5 months (from May 10, 2025 to January 1, 2026)

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: "No sunset reduction before 2026" - The current law maintains the January 1, 2033 phase-out date for 45Q tax credits as established in the Inflation Reduction Act.

(c) An unexpected outcome scenario: Despite strong bipartisan support for repealing 45Q, significant lobbying from the 226+ existing project stakeholders could lead to a compromise that includes a longer transition period (2027-2028 sunset) with safe harbor provisions for ongoing projects. This could happen if Republican moderates from states with significant carbon capture investments align with industry interests to protect existing investments while still moving toward eventual repeal.

## Rationale for 45Q Tax Credit Repeal Forecast

The 45Q carbon capture tax credit faces a serious repeal effort with H.R. 1946, the 45Q Repeal Act of 2025, introduced by Representative Scott Perry (R-PA) on March 6, 2025. This legislation aims to completely eliminate Section 45Q of the Internal Revenue Code, which provides tax credits for carbon capture and storage projects[1][3].

### Political Landscape and Support for Repeal

What makes this repeal effort particularly notable is its bipartisan nature. The bill has garnered support across party lines, with Democratic Representative Ro Khanna of California serving as a co-sponsor[1][5]. This unusual alliance between Perry, described as "one of the House's leading climate change skeptics," and Khanna, characterized as a "fossil fuel critic," suggests a convergence of interests despite differing motivations[4].

The Republican control of both houses of Congress and the White House following the 2024 elections creates a favorable environment for this legislation. The party's consideration of a budget reconciliation bill provides a pathway for passing tax and spending changes with a simple majority, making the repeal of energy tax credits like 45Q a realistic possibility[4].

### Economic Arguments for Repeal

The economic case for repeal is substantial and appears to be gaining traction. The legislation is projected to save American taxpayers an estimated $36.2 billion from FY2024-FY2033[1]. Taxpayers for Common Sense, an advocacy group, has highlighted concerns about the tax credit's "long history of fraud and abuse" and its "hefty price tag"[1].

Critics argue that carbon capture and storage projects have consistently failed to deliver lasting results despite decades of generous federal funding[1]. These economic considerations may appeal to fiscal conservatives within the Republican party, strengthening the case for repeal.

### Current Status and Timing

H.R. 1946 was forwarded to the House Committee on Ways and Means after its introduction, where it currently awaits further action[5]. The bill does not contain a safe harbor provision and would implement a full repeal effective January 1, 2026[3][5].

Given that Republicans are actively discussing energy tax credits in their budget reconciliation plans, and the 45Q credit appears to be a specific target due to its bipartisan opposition, there is a high probability that action will be taken before the January 1, 2026 deadline specified in the question.

### Counterforces and Alternative Scenarios

Despite the momentum behind repeal, there are potential counterforces to consider:

1. There is a concurrent "dueling bipartisan proposal" to expand the credit through the "Methane Reduction and Economic Growth Act," which seeks to include methane captured from coal mines[4].

2. The credit has powerful corporate backers, including Exxon, which has lobbied for additional CCS benefits[4].

3. The 226+ existing qualifying projects represent significant investments that could mobilize industry pressure to include safe harbor provisions.

While these forces might not prevent repeal entirely, they could influence the final form of the legislation, potentially leading to the inclusion of safe harbor provisions or a modified timeline.

### Conclusion and Probability Assessment

Considering all factors—the bipartisan support for repeal, Republican control of government, the economic arguments, and the status of H.R. 1946—the most likely outcome is that the 45Q tax credit will be repealed or sunset in 2025-2026. The current bill does not include safe harbor provisions, and there is no indication in the search results that such provisions are being actively considered as amendments.

However, given the status quo bias and the possibility of unexpected developments during the legislative process, I must assign some probability to alternative outcomes, including the possibility that lobbying efforts could result in safe harbor provisions or that the legislative process might stall, leaving the current law unchanged.
