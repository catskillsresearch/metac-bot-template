Maersk’s approach to resuming shipping in the Red Sea for the remainder of 2025 is shaped by a combination of explicit safety requirements, a cautious interpretation of recent diplomatic developments, and substantial operational adjustments made in response to ongoing regional instability.

Throughout 2025, Maersk has continued to reroute vessels via the Cape of Good Hope, citing heightened and persistent security risks in the Red Sea and Bab-el-Mandeb Strait. This policy persists despite diplomatic breakthroughs, such as a ceasefire agreement between the United States and the Houthi movement in Yemen, an Houthi declaration to halt attacks on shipping, and broader de-escalation efforts surrounding the Israel-Hamas conflict. While these developments are viewed as positive first steps, Maersk does not yet regard them as translating into a sufficiently stable or predictable security environment for commercial shipping.

The company’s public statements, most recently in May 2025, reaffirm an expectation that Red Sea disruptions will last throughout the year. Maersk has been unequivocal that it will only resume Red Sea transits when there are credible guarantees of the safety of crew, vessels, and cargo—a threshold they consider unmet at this time. The company has further emphasized that premature resumption, without long-term safety assurances, risks operational instability and could force further disruptive changes to their network.

To provide reliability and certainty to customers, Maersk has made significant structural changes to its network, notably the implementation of the East-West “Network of the Future” and the Gemini Cooperation with Hapag-Lloyd, both optimized for the longer Cape of Good Hope route and set to remain in place unless the Red Sea is demonstrably safe again. Maersk maintains operational flexibility and readiness to quickly pivot ships back through the Suez Canal should risk conditions improve dramatically and durably. However, until there is a proven, sustained reduction in risk—demonstrated by a long period without attacks and confirmed by international monitoring or guarantees from relevant authorities—Maersk is unlikely to alter its current posture.

Historically, Maersk and other major carriers have demonstrated extreme caution in response to maritime security incidents, prioritizing long-term stability and risk mitigation over potential economic incentives associated with shorter routes. Their requirements for a return include not just diplomatic agreements but actual, verified safety over time. The company’s repeated advisories to clients continue to direct supply chain planning around the Cape route for the foreseeable future.

While a durable political settlement or robust international security arrangement could trigger a rapid operational shift, such scenarios are rare and would need to occur—and be widely recognized as credible—within the limited time remaining in 2025. At present, all indicators from Maersk’s leadership, operational planning, and external assessments point to a strong preference for maintaining the status quo until their strict safety criteria have clearly been met.
