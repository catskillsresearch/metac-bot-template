The United States is currently ranked #85 out of 179 countries, placing it just within the top 40% for academic freedom. While there has been a consistent decline in academic freedom over the past decade, the pace of this decline suggests that the U.S. is likely to remain above the bottom 50% threshold in the 2025 AFI report. The status quo outcome, where the U.S. remains in the top 40-50% bracket, is more probable unless there is a marked acceleration in negative trends.

Several factors could contribute to a scenario where the U.S. does not fall into the bottom 50%. These include maintaining the current trajectory without significant new restrictive legislation or systemic changes that further erode academic freedom. Efforts to counteract state-level restrictions, such as legal challenges or federal interventions, could help stabilize the situation. Additionally, the historical resilience of U.S. academic institutions and the potential for legal and institutional pushback against restrictive measures play a crucial role in maintaining the current status.

Conversely, a scenario that results in the U.S. falling into the bottom 50% would involve an acceleration of current negative trends. This could include more states enacting restrictive laws on academic content, tenure, and employment security, as well as increased political interference in academic matters. Federal actions that undermine academic freedom, heightened political polarization, and increased public campaigns against academics could further exacerbate these issues.

Overall, while there is a clear downward trend, the pace of decline has not been rapid enough to suggest an immediate drop into the bottom 50% without further significant changes. Given the historical tendency for gradual change, the probability of the U.S. falling into the bottom 50% by 2025 remains moderate but less than 50%.
