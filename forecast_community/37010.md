HKU5-CoV-2, a novel bat-derived coronavirus identified in China in February 2025, has attracted scientific attention due to its demonstrated ability to use the human ACE2 receptor as a gateway to infect cells—a mechanism shared with SARS-CoV-2 and notable among merbecoviruses. Laboratory studies confirm that HKU5-CoV-2 can bind to and infect human cells under controlled conditions, and the virus shows improved adaptation to human ACE2 compared to some previous related viruses. However, its binding affinity remains significantly weaker than that of SARS-CoV-2, which substantially limits the likelihood of natural human infection in real-world circumstances.

At present, no human cases of HKU5-CoV-2 have been reported anywhere in the world, and there is no evidence of human-to-human transmission or an ongoing outbreak. The short timeframe between now and July 1, 2025—just 45 days—further reduces the probability of detecting new spillover events, especially given that most newly discovered animal coronaviruses do not successfully establish in human populations. Historically, successful zoonotic jumps from bats to humans (such as those by SARS-CoV-1, MERS, and SARS-CoV-2) have typically required either strong binding to human receptors or the involvement of intermediate hosts, and these transitions often unfold over months or years rather than weeks.

Globally, monitoring and surveillance for novel coronaviruses have been intensified in the post-COVID-19 era, increasing the likelihood that any human cases would be rapidly identified. This heightened surveillance also means that the current absence of reported cases is informative. The primary avenues by which human infection could arise in the near term are: laboratory exposure during research on the virus, direct bat-to-human transmission in regions with high exposure risk, or adaptation via an intermediate animal host facilitating the jump to humans.

While the theoretical potential for spillover exists, major barriers remain: the virus’s lower ACE2 binding efficiency, no detected human infections to date, strict biosafety protocols in laboratories, and a very short window before the forecast period ends. Nonetheless, active research on HKU5-CoV-2 does introduce a minimal but nonzero risk of laboratory-acquired infection, and the unpredictable nature of zoonotic spillovers means that continued close monitoring is warranted. 

Given these factors, the status quo strongly favors no human cases emerging before July 1, 2025—but the possibility cannot be entirely excluded due to ongoing research activities and the inherent risk of spillover events in areas with high bat-human or animal-human contact.
