European Union member states currently operate under a framework defined by strict ethical norms, conservative regulatory policies, and public skepticism regarding non‐therapeutic genetic interventions. At present, preimplantation genetic testing is primarily reserved for detecting serious medical conditions rather than for selecting traits like intelligence. This longstanding status quo is supported by decades of cautious policy-making and is reinforced by the reluctance of both regulators and the broader public to embrace practices that have eugenic implications.

While technological advancements in polygenic scoring and embryo selection are progressing, any shift toward using these technologies for cognitive enhancement would require a dramatic realignment of political priorities, scientific consensus, and public opinion. Even in EU countries with high levels of in vitro fertilization uptake, such as Denmark, it is unlikely that the regulatory environment will relax rapidly enough to promote a scenario where more than 10% of newborns in a single calendar year are conceived via intelligence-focused embryo selection.

Furthermore, given that alternative avenues like fertility tourism keep the demand for such procedures alive outside the EU's restrictive framework, the likelihood of a member state overtly adopting a widespread domestic program for intelligence enhancement remains very low. Although a breakthrough—possibly driven by intense geopolitical or economic competition—could potentially trigger rapid, large-scale adoption, the cumulative weight of the historical trends, ethical constraints, and slow pace of regulatory change strongly favors the continuation of the current conservative approach throughout the foreseeable future.
