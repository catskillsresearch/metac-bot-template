With current data and expert judgment, it appears that the vast majority of stars—roughly around 95%—appear to form planetary systems under prevailing conditions. This estimation is based on observations of planet formation across a wide range of stellar types and environments, including main‐sequence stars, binaries, and stars in various clusters, with most experts favoring a high overall efficiency of planet formation. However, there is also careful consideration given to alternative scenarios. On one hand, if future studies reveal that planet formation is significantly impeded in certain contexts—such as in low-metallicity environments, extremely dense star clusters, or among very low-mass stars—the effective fraction of stars hosting planets could be notably lower, potentially down to around 80%. On the other hand, comprehensive surveys covering all spectral types and varied environmental conditions might confirm that even stars previously thought less likely to host planets nearly always do so, pushing the fraction virtually to 100%. Overall, while the status quo and trends strongly support a high probability of planetary systems around stars, careful attention to emerging evidence regarding stellar environments and planet detection methods continues to inform and refine these assessments over the coming decades.
