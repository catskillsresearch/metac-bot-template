The question of whether China will control at least half of Taiwan before 2050 is complex and influenced by numerous factors. The current status quo of Taiwan's de facto independence has persisted for decades, demonstrating a degree of stability. However, several key developments suggest an increased risk of change in the coming decades.

China's growing military capabilities and assertiveness in the region are significant factors. The Chinese leadership has repeatedly emphasized the importance of "reunification" and has not ruled out the use of force. Recent statements from Chinese officials setting informal deadlines for potential reunification (e.g., 2027, 2035, 2049) indicate a growing impatience with the status quo.

The modernization and expansion of China's military, particularly focused on capabilities relevant to a Taiwan invasion, continue to progress rapidly. U.S. officials and analysts have warned of China's increasing ability to launch a successful invasion in the coming years.

However, substantial deterrents to Chinese military action remain:

1. The potential for U.S. military intervention and international sanctions.
2. The severe economic costs and risks associated with an invasion.
3. The significant technical and logistical challenges of a successful amphibious invasion of Taiwan.
4. Strong international opposition to forceful reunification.

The scenario for peaceful reunification seems unlikely given current Taiwanese public opinion, which strongly favors the status quo or independence. Taiwan has been strengthening its defenses and international relationships, while the U.S. has been increasing its support and clarifying its commitment to the island's defense.

Economic interdependence and the potential for severe diplomatic and economic consequences for China also serve as deterrents to drastic action. China's internal challenges, such as demographic issues and economic slowdown, may divert focus from external expansion.

The long timeframe until 2050 introduces significant uncertainty, allowing for many potential developments in geopolitics, military technology, and economic conditions. While the status quo remains a strong possibility, the combination of China's growing power, its strategic focus on Taiwan, and the extended time horizon increase the chances of Chinese control.

Given these factors, while the risk of conflict or forced reunification has increased, it is not a foregone conclusion. The probability of China controlling at least half of Taiwan before 2050 is significant but remains below 50%, reflecting the substantial barriers to change and the continued strength of the status quo.
