(a) Time left until outcome is known: 7 months, 19 days (until December 31, 2025)

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: No - Israel currently has military presence in Gaza but has not established a formal government or annexed the territory

(c) Scenario for No outcome: International pressure and diplomatic negotiations lead Israel to pursue an alternative arrangement for Gaza governance, such as an internationally-supervised administration. Military operations continue but formal governmental control or annexation is avoided.

(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: Following the recently approved plans, Israel proceeds to capture all of Gaza, establishes a formal transitional government headed by Israeli officials to administer the territory, or officially annexes at least 50% of Gaza's area before the end of 2025.

As a forecaster, I need to carefully evaluate the evidence while giving appropriate weight to the status quo, recognizing that major political changes often take longer than anticipated.

Based on the most recent information, Israel has taken significant steps toward potentially establishing direct governmental control of Gaza. On May 5, 2025, the Israeli Cabinet approved plans to capture the entire Gaza Strip and remain in the territory for an unspecified period[2]. This represents a notable escalation from previous positions and indicates serious consideration of formal control.

However, several factors suggest caution in forecasting a definite "Yes" outcome:

First, the status quo remains that Israel does not have formal governmental control of Gaza. Since withdrawing in 2005, Israel has maintained a blockade but avoided establishing a civilian government there[2]. This represents a 20-year precedent against formal control.

Second, the recent plans appear to focus primarily on military operations rather than civilian governance. While the plans include capturing territory and establishing a "sustained physical presence," they don't explicitly commit to establishing a formal government structure as defined in the resolution criteria[1][2].

Third, international opposition to such a move would be substantial. Amnesty International has already condemned these plans[1], and the broader international community would likely apply significant pressure against formal annexation or governmental control.

Fourth, the implementation timeline remains uncertain. The defense official cited indicates that operations wouldn't begin until after an expected visit by U.S. President Trump later this month, leaving limited time in 2025 for the establishment of formal governmental structures[2].

Fifth, alternative governance arrangements are still being discussed. Previous reports mentioned UAE discussions about a provisional international administration, suggesting other pathways are being considered.

On the other hand, several factors increase the probability of a "Yes" outcome:

The recently approved plans explicitly call for Israel to "capture the entire Gaza Strip and remain in the Palestinian territory for an unspecified amount of time"[2]. This represents a concrete policy decision rather than mere speculation.

The plans appear to include components that move toward the resolution criteria, including "annexing territory" and establishing a "sustained physical presence"[1].

The Israeli military chief has called up tens of thousands of reserve soldiers, suggesting serious preparation for expanded operations[2].

The reference to potential displacement of Palestinians to southern Gaza suggests comprehensive territorial control is being contemplated[2].

Weighing these factors and giving appropriate weight to status quo persistence, I assess that while there is a significant chance of Israel establishing direct governmental control of Gaza in 2025, it remains less likely than not. The most probable outcome is continued military operations without formal governmental establishment or annexation.

Probability: 40%
