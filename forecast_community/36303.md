# Comprehensive Analysis of the Future of IRA Clean Energy Tax Credit Adders

The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022 established significant tax credit adders for clean energy projects, including bonuses for domestic content, energy communities, prevailing wage requirements, and apprenticeship programs. These adders have substantially increased the value of both the Investment Tax Credit (ITC) and Production Tax Credit (PTC), boosting them from a base rate of 6% up to 30% when certain qualifications are met. As we approach 2026, there are important factors to consider regarding their future.

## Current Legislative Landscape

House Republicans have recently introduced legislation that explicitly targets IRA clean energy tax credits for modification. The May 2025 bill proposes phasing out or restricting several elements of the IRA's clean energy provisions, including the Clean Electricity Investment and Production Tax Credits. The Ways and Means Committee is actively working on markup for this legislation, with timing that suggests it could potentially advance through Congress before January 2026.

Notably, the bill shifts eligibility provisions for the ITC and PTC from being based on when facilities began construction to when facilities enter service, which reduces eligibility beyond what a simple phaseout timeline would do. However, the proposal focuses on phasedowns rather than immediate termination, with full-value PTCs continuing to be paid out until 2038, and reduced-value PTCs continuing until 2041 for facilities that enter service before 2029.

The bill would also eliminate transferability for all relevant credits after the end of 2027, which would significantly impact how these credits are utilized in the market. Transferability, introduced by the IRA, allows companies that benefit from credits but lack tax liability to sell their tax benefits to third parties, effectively replacing more complicated tax equity partnerships.

## Political and Economic Considerations

Several key factors will influence the outcome of these legislative efforts:

**Congressional Dynamics**: While Republicans have shown clear intent to modify the IRA tax credits, the path to enactment faces potential obstacles. Senate composition, the possibility of filibusters, and the need for compromise all complicate the legislative process. Any bill would need to clear hurdles in both chambers to become law.

**Industry Momentum and Implementation**: The IRS and Treasury are actively finalizing and implementing guidance for these credits, including the various adders. Many projects are already moving forward with these incentives in mind, creating substantial economic dependencies across multiple states. Beginning with property placed in service in 2023, many credits became refundable to tax-exempt organizations, allowing them to claim the credit and receive cash even without tax liability.

**Economic Impact**: There is significant investment and industry momentum behind these credits. The domestic content adder, energy communities adder, and other bonuses have created jobs and investments across the country, including in Republican-held districts. This creates interest group pressure against full repeal.

**Administrative Implementation**: The administrative apparatus for delivering these incentives is already in place, with Treasury and the IRS rolling out guidance. This bureaucratic inertia makes wholesale repeal less likely in the short term, though targeted reductions remain plausible.

## Likely Outcomes

Based on current legislative proposals, political dynamics, and economic considerations, a partial reduction of incentives appears most likely. The House GOP bill explicitly proposes phasedowns rather than immediate elimination, suggesting that compromise legislation would reduce or restrict some adders without completely repealing the entire framework.

Industry stakeholders have expressed confidence that some form of the credits will persist. For example, under the current House GOP plan, facilities that enter service before 2029 would continue to receive their full benefits, indicating a gradual rather than abrupt change.

While full repeal is possible given strong Republican opposition to certain aspects of the IRA, it would require overcoming significant political and economic hurdles. The Senate composition and potential filibuster present substantial obstacles to complete elimination of all adders.

Conversely, legislative gridlock or prioritization of other issues could result in no changes before 2026. Congressional inaction due to competing priorities, election-year dynamics, or internal party disagreements could preserve the status quo, though this appears less likely given the current legislative momentum.

## Conclusion

The most probable outcome is some reduction in IRA tax credit adders before 2026, potentially including phasedowns, restrictions on transferability, or elimination of specific bonuses as part of a compromise package. This approach would allow for budget savings and policy signaling without completely disrupting the clean energy and manufacturing sectors that have come to rely on these incentives.

Full repeal remains possible but faces significant headwinds, while complete preservation of all adders without modification seems least likely given the current political environment and explicit legislative proposals already in motion.

### Forecast

Repealed fully: 25.0%
Reduced incentives: 60.0%
Neither repealed nor reduced: 15.0%
