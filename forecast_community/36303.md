As a professional forecaster, I'll analyze the future of the Inflation Reduction Act's tax credit adders before 2026.

(a) Time left until outcome is known: Approximately 7.5 months (from May 13, 2025 until January 1, 2026)

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: The IRA tax credit adders would remain intact through 2026.

(c) Unexpected outcome scenario: Bipartisan compromise emerges that preserves some adders while eliminating others, as specific industries (like domestic manufacturing) gain protection due to economic and national security concerns.

## Current Landscape of IRA Tax Credit Adders

The 2022 Inflation Reduction Act established a system of base tax credits with conditional adders for clean energy projects. These include the Investment Tax Credit (ITC/48E) and Production Tax Credit (PTC/45Y)[2]. The adders were designed to increase the base credits significantly when certain conditions are met, such as:

- Increasing the ITC from 6% to 30% for meeting prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements
- Adding 10% for domestic content sourcing
- Adding bonus amounts for energy community siting

These credits are currently scheduled to remain in place through the end of 2025, with some provisions extending further[5].

## Recent Legislative Developments

The latest information indicates significant momentum toward changing these tax credits. House Republicans have unveiled bill text that would specifically target the clean energy tax credits established by the IRA[4]. According to recent reporting, the proposed legislation would:

- Subject the Clean Electricity Investment (48E) and Production Tax Credits (45Y) to a phase-out period
- Add restrictions related to prohibited foreign entities
- Terminate certain other clean energy tax credits entirely

This indicates concrete legislative action is already underway that could affect these adders before 2026.

## Budget Considerations

A key factor driving potential changes is the budgetary impact. The enhanced subsidies from the IRA are projected to cost taxpayers significantly more than originally estimated[3]. The Congressional Budget Office initially projected costs around $370 billion, but more recent estimates suggest the total could reach $1-2 trillion over 10 years.

This creates strong fiscal pressure to reduce or eliminate these credits as part of broader budget reconciliation efforts, especially as lawmakers also look to extend other tax provisions like the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.

## Political and Economic Factors

Several competing factors influence the likelihood of changes to the tax credit adders:

1. **Executive Branch Position**: The current administration has issued executive orders to pause disbursement of IRA funds, signaling clear intent to modify the program.

2. **Economic Impact**: The credits have driven significant investment in clean energy projects and job creation, creating constituencies that benefit from their continuation.

3. **Industry Expectations**: Some industry executives, like EDP SA's CEO, remain "confident that the tax credits will continue to be available for the next couple of years," suggesting business planning based on at least partial continuation.

4. **Legislative Timeline**: The House Ways and Means Committee has already released partial tax bill text and scheduled a markup for May 13, 2025, indicating this is a near-term priority.

## Probability Assessment

Given the evidence available, I assess the following probabilities for each outcome:

**Repealed fully (40%)**: There is strong momentum toward a complete repeal of the adders given:
- Clear legislative proposals already in motion
- Executive branch opposition to the IRA
- Budgetary pressures to reduce federal spending
- Republican control of government institutions

However, this is not a certainty because:
- Some business interests benefit from and lobby for these credits
- Complete repeal requires coordinated legislative action, which faces procedural hurdles

**Reduced incentives (45%)**: This outcome appears slightly more likely than full repeal because:
- It represents a compromise position that could attract broader support
- Certain industries (particularly domestic manufacturing) have bipartisan backing
- Phasing out rather than immediately eliminating credits provides market transition time
- Recent legislative proposals suggest targeted modifications rather than wholesale elimination

**Neither repealed nor reduced (15%)**: While this is the least likely outcome, it remains possible if:
- Legislative gridlock prevents passage of changes
- Economic concerns about disrupting investment create hesitation
- Implementation challenges make immediate changes impractical
- Strategic priorities shift to other policy areas

The status quo has significant momentum against it, which is why I've assigned it the lowest probability. However, I maintain a meaningful 15% chance to account for the possibility of unexpected political developments or implementation challenges.

Repealed fully: 40%
Reduced incentives: 45%
Neither repealed nor reduced: 15%
