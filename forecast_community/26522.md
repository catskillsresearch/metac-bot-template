# Will an AI Company Become a Military Power After AGI?

The question of whether an AI company could become a military power within five years after AGI emergence requires careful examination of historical precedents, modern state systems, technological capabilities, and regulatory frameworks.

## Historical Context vs. Modern Reality

The East India Company (EIC) provides our primary historical reference for a corporation wielding military power. The EIC controlled vast territories and maintained armies exceeding 250,000 soldiers—twice the size of the British Army at that time. This remarkable status emerged from unique historical circumstances:

- Fragmented political landscapes with weak central authorities
- Limited communication and enforcement capabilities
- Private revenue streams independent of state control
- Ambiguous sovereignty in colonial regions
- Lack of strong, centralized states capable of enforcing monopolies on force

Today's world bears little resemblance to these conditions. Modern states vigilantly guard their monopoly over armed force and treaty-making powers. The international legal order grants the legitimate use of force almost exclusively to sovereign states, with private military actions at significant scale being internationally condemned and likely to trigger swift suppression.

## Legal and Institutional Barriers

Contemporary AI companies exist within robust regulatory frameworks specifically designed to prevent corporate military autonomy:

- International law reserves war-making and treaty powers to sovereign states
- Domestic regulations tightly control dual-use and military technologies
- National security frameworks allow rapid state intervention when threatened
- Historical precedent shows advanced military technologies (nuclear, bioweapons) are quickly brought under state control

The resolution criteria specifically exclude companies under "effective control" of governments—including forced production or Manhattan Project-style nationalization—which eliminates most plausible scenarios involving military-capable AGI companies.

## Technological Considerations

While AGI could theoretically provide significant military advantages, converting these capabilities into independent military power would require:

- Physical infrastructure (data centers, manufacturing facilities)
- Supply chains for hardware components
- Autonomous weapons platforms or other tangible capabilities
- Protection from state intervention and regulatory oversight

All these elements would remain vulnerable to state action, making it extremely difficult for a company to maintain independence against determined government opposition. The most likely scenario is that AI companies will enhance military capabilities but remain firmly integrated within state-directed defense structures.

## Emerging Trends in Military AI

Recent developments suggest increasing integration of AI into military applications, but through state-directed channels rather than independent corporate action. The Pentagon seeks to allocate significant funding—$874 million for AI and machine learning defense technologies and $2.3 billion of its science and technology research budget to military AI. This demonstrates that while AI is transforming warfare, it's doing so within existing state structures.

With the AI military market projected to grow from $9.2 billion in 2023 to $38.8 billion by 2028, we see a clear trajectory of AI becoming central to military operations, but through government procurement and partnerships rather than independent corporate military power.

## Potential Wildcards

The only plausible paths to a "Yes" outcome would require extraordinary circumstances:

- State collapse or failed states creating power vacuums exploitable by well-resourced AI companies
- Ultra-rapid AGI takeoff yielding a "decisive strategic advantage" that outpaces state response
- Jurisdictional ambiguity or international breakdowns allowing companies to operate in governance gaps

These scenarios remain highly improbable given the vigilance and capabilities of modern states and international institutions when facing potential existential threats.

## Time Constraints

The five-year timeframe after AGI emergence is relatively brief for building independent military capabilities that could challenge sovereign states. Even with AGI providing substantial technological advantages, converting these into military power comparable to state actors would likely require more time than the question allows.

The speed of warfare will increase with AI integration, and those with the best AI tools will constantly exploit initiative advantages. However, this technological revolution is being pursued aggressively by state actors who are determined to "intelligentize" warfare—not by independent corporations seeking military autonomy.

The most likely outcome remains AI companies serving as contractors, strategic partners, and technology providers to state military organizations, but remaining firmly subordinated to state authority and never independently signing treaties or waging war as sovereign entities.
