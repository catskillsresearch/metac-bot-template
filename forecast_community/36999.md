# Starlink Somalia Availability Assessment

Recent developments strongly indicate that Starlink will add Somalia to its availability map before July 1, 2025. With approximately 46 days remaining until the deadline, several key factors support this conclusion.

## Regulatory Authorization Secured

On April 14, 2025, Somalia's National Communications Authority (NCA) officially granted Starlink an operating license. This formal authorization represents the culmination of negotiations between Starlink and the Somali government. The license approval was marked by a ceremony in Mogadishu attended by senior Starlink representatives, including the Senior Director of Starlink Market Access.

Following this approval, Elon Musk publicly announced "Starlink now in Somalia!" on his X platform. The Somali government similarly celebrated this development, with state media outlet Sonna calling it "another historic day for Somalia's communications and technology sectors".

## Current Implementation Status

Multiple sources confirm that Starlink service is already operational in Somalia:

- Users within Somalia can now order Starlink equipment
- Customers are reporting download speeds between 50-150 Mbps
- Starlink equipment is actively shipping to Somali addresses

This deployment will significantly improve Somalia's internet infrastructure, especially extending connectivity to remote regions. This is particularly important given that only approximately 30% of Somalia's population currently has internet access.

## Website Update Patterns

Starlink follows a consistent pattern when entering new markets:
1. Obtain regulatory approval (completed April 14, 2025)
2. Begin accepting customer orders (already happening)
3. Update the availability map on their website

Historical precedent shows that Starlink typically updates its website within weeks of licensure and operational rollout. In recent African expansions:
- Niger and Liberia had their website availability maps updated within 3-4 weeks of regulatory approval
- Website updates generally occurred before full service rollout was completed

## Risk Assessment

Despite strong positive indicators, a few potential risks could delay the website update:
- Unexpected administrative delays within SpaceX's website management team
- Potential capacity constraints creating waiting lists
- Starlink prioritizing rollouts or site updates for other markets

However, these risks appear minimal given the confirmed operational status, government support, and absence of any reported regulatory, technical, or political barriers that would impede the map update.

## Timeline Considerations

With more than six weeks remaining until the July 1 deadline and service already operational, there is ample time for Starlink to follow its typical procedure of updating the availability map. The company has demonstrated an accelerated expansion in Africa throughout 2025, suggesting Somalia's website listing should follow the established pattern.

The preponderance of evidence indicates that Starlink operates consistently: once licensing is public and equipment is shipping, the website is updated to list the new market as "Available" within a short window. Given the current status and historical patterns, a website update reflecting Somalia's availability before July 1, 2025, is highly likely.
