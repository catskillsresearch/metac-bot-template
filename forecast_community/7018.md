The development of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and its impact on global economic growth is a complex and uncertain topic. Current expert predictions suggest AGI could be developed between 2040-2050, with some forecasts indicating it may arrive as early as the late 2020s or 2030s. The unprecedented 25% growth in world real GDP is generally expected to follow AGI development by 1-2 years, based on projections of Transformative AI's economic impacts.

However, several factors could influence the timing between AGI development and significant economic growth. Global economic conditions, regulatory frameworks, and the readiness of various sectors to implement AGI technologies will play crucial roles in determining the speed and magnitude of its economic impact.

In a scenario where AGI development occurs earlier than anticipated (e.g., 2030), we might see a delay in its widespread implementation due to economic and regulatory challenges. This could result in a longer gap, potentially 5-10 years, between AGI development and the 25% GDP growth milestone.

Conversely, rapid advancements in narrow AI and other technologies could lead to a surge in global productivity and economic growth even before AGI is fully realized. This could result in world real GDP becoming 25% higher than all prior years before AGI is officially announced, possibly by 1-2 years.

The relationship between AGI development and economic growth is not necessarily linear or predictable. Breakthroughs in AI could cause a series of economic advancements across multiple sectors, potentially triggering significant GDP growth before AGI reaches its full potential. Alternatively, the full economic impact of AGI might be gradual, taking several years to manifest as various industries adapt and integrate the technology.

Given these considerations, it's prudent to account for a wide range of possible outcomes, from the 25% GDP growth occurring up to 10 years after AGI development in a conservative scenario, to it happening up to 5 years before AGI in an optimistic scenario.
