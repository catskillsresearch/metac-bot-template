Rationale:

The risk of a tsunami causing 50,000 or more deaths before 2030 is relatively low but cannot be completely discounted. Since the devastating 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, there have been significant global improvements in tsunami detection, warning systems, and community preparedness. The UNESCO initiative to make all coastal communities "Tsunami Ready" by 2030 further reinforces this positive trend in disaster mitigation.

However, the possibility of a catastrophic event still exists. Japan's own estimates of potential casualties from a major Nankai Trough earthquake and tsunami, with up to 298,000 deaths in a worst-case scenario, demonstrate that even well-prepared nations face substantial risks. Other regions with high population density, challenging geography, or less developed infrastructure may be even more vulnerable.

The timeframe until 2030 introduces additional uncertainty and increases the possibility of an extreme event occurring. Factors such as climate change could potentially exacerbate tsunami risks in some areas. The unpredictability of seismic events and the potential for a "black swan" disaster scenario means we cannot entirely rule out a catastrophic tsunami.

That said, the world has not seen a tsunami of this magnitude since 2004, and the global focus on disaster preparedness makes such an event less likely going forward. Recent tsunamis have resulted in far fewer casualties than historical events, reflecting the effectiveness of improved warning systems and evacuation procedures.

While the status quo and ongoing preparedness efforts strongly favor a scenario where no tsunami causes 50,000 or more deaths before 2030, the inherent unpredictability of natural disasters and the potential for extreme events means that the possibility, however small, still exists. The risk is low but not zero, given the high stakes involved and the potential for a perfect storm of circumstances to overwhelm even the best preparations.
