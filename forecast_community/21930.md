## Rationale for the Forecast: Caplan’s Civil War Bet in Non-Communist Europe

Western and Southern European countries—those not communist in 1988—have consistently demonstrated high levels of internal stability since World War II. Historical precedent shows that even during periods of intense unrest, violence has not approached the scale required to qualify as a civil war under the terms of the bet: a conflict resulting in 10,000 or more fatalities and recognized as such by major global media. Notable episodes such as the Troubles in Northern Ireland and recent waves of terrorism or protest movements have remained far below this threshold.

**Current Risk Assessments**  
Major conflict monitoring organizations—including the ACLED Conflict Index, the European Commission’s Global Conflict Risk Index, and the International Crisis Group—currently assess the risk of large-scale internal conflict in non-communist Western European countries as extremely low. These countries are characterized by robust state institutions, stable democratic governance, and participation in strong international alliances like the EU and NATO, which collectively serve as substantial bulwarks against violent destabilization.

**Contemporary Pressures and Warning Signals**  
Europe is not immune to challenges. There is increasing political polarization, a resurgence of nationalist and populist movements, concerns over immigration, and periodic spikes in terrorism and extremist activity. Economic challenges and declining trust in political institutions are also noted in both academic literature and policy discourse. While these factors contribute to social fragmentation and unrest, experts widely agree that, as of now, there is no credible path from current trends to the outbreak of an organized, sustained civil war of the required magnitude.

**Threshold for Civil War Risk**  
The requirement for a qualifying civil war—sustained, organized armed conflict with over 10,000 deaths within a single country—sets a very high bar. Achieving this level of violence would require the widespread collapse of central authority, the formation of well-organized armed factions, and the inability or unwillingness of both national and international actors to contain hostilities. Even amid heightened rhetoric about societal collapse, ongoing disorder remains orders of magnitude less severe than the stipulated threshold.

**Expert Opinion and Index Consensus**  
Expert and policy consensus is that threats to stability, while increasing in some measurable ways (polarization, terrorism, economic stagnation), remain far more likely to result in unrest, protests, or isolated violence rather than escalation to true civil war. The most frequently cited risks involve gradual political fragmentation and erosion of democratic norms, not sudden outbreaks of mass-casualty armed conflict.

**Importance of “Black Swan” Events**  
Forecasting over two decades necessarily involves significant uncertainty. Low-probability, high-impact events—such as catastrophic economic collapse, a coup, external manipulation, or major technological disruption—could theoretically trigger a chain reaction leading to civil war. Nonetheless, such scenarios are considered highly unlikely in the absence of any current trends suggesting their emergence.

**Weight of Structural Stability**  
Europe’s wealth, aging population, effective security services, and entrenched civil societies all strongly correlate with sustained peace. Despite periodic “doom” rhetoric and isolated incidents of violence, the inertia of peaceful order and institutional resilience remains the default expectation. The burden of proof lies with those predicting catastrophic change rather than the maintenance of the status quo.

**Geopolitical Context**  
Although global risks—including state-based armed conflict—are viewed with growing concern internationally, these primarily apply to regions already prone to instability or active war. Current major European conflicts, such as the war in Ukraine, involve countries specifically excluded from Caplan’s bet. Even as global tensions rise, no credible analyst or index currently predicts civil war risk on the required scale for Western or Southern Europe.

**Conclusion**  
The preponderance of evidence and expert analysis indicates that, while European societies face real pressures and must remain vigilant, the probability of a civil war as defined by the bet—one with 10,000 or more deaths in a qualifying country by 2045—remains extremely low. The fundamental risks are not zero; the long time horizon allows for unforeseen changes. Still, all key risk indices, institutional strengths, and historical patterns continue to strongly support the expectation that large-scale internal armed conflict will not occur within the given period.
