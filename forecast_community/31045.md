(a) **Time until resolution:**  
There are just over seven months remaining before January 1, 2026. This is the period in which Jerome Powell could potentially leave office and satisfy the question’s "Yes" criteria.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changes:**  
If current conditions persist, Jerome Powell will remain Chair of the Federal Reserve through the end of 2025, with his term set to expire on May 15, 2026[2][3]. All recent public appearances—such as speeches in April and May 2025—show him actively serving in his role and discussing policy outlooks[1][2][3].

(c) **Scenario for a 'No' outcome:**  
The "No" outcome resolves if Powell continues as Chair through January 1, 2026. This is the default scenario, as there are strong institutional, legal, and historical precedents for Federal Reserve chairs completing their terms absent extraordinary circumstances.

(d) **Scenario for a 'Yes' outcome:**  
A "Yes" could be triggered if Powell leaves office before January 1, 2026, due to:
- Voluntary resignation (which he has stated he will not do if pressured politically)
- Health issues or incapacitation
- Unanticipated personal circumstances
- An unprecedented legal or political event challenging the Fed’s independence (highly unlikely given legal protections and recent reaffirmations by political leaders)

## Rationale

Jerome Powell is demonstrably still serving as Chair of the Federal Reserve as of May 2025, with no evidence of plans to resign early[1][2][3]. The legal framework offers strong protections—presidents cannot directly fire or demote the Fed Chair[3]. Powell himself has indicated he would not step down if asked by a president, and recent statements and actions by political figures (including comments from Donald Trump and bipartisan members of Congress) reinforce respect for the Fed’s institutional independence.

The most probable causes for an early departure—health or unforeseen personal reasons—lack substantiating evidence as of now. Historically, no Fed chair has been removed for political reasons mid-term, and to do so would require extraordinary circumstances and face significant legal and institutional resistance.

Given the short time until the forecast window closes, the strong status quo bias, and the lack of any credible signals of imminent removal or resignation, the base rate for early departure is extremely low.

## Final Probability

Probability: **4%**
