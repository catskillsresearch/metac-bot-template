(a) Time left until outcome: 111 days (from May 12, 2025 to September 1, 2025)
(b) Status quo outcome: No Ivy League university has had its SEVP certification revoked or suspended
(c) No outcome scenario: Harvard complies with DHS requests, legal challenges delay any potential action, or political pressure forces DHS to back down from its threats
(d) Yes outcome scenario: DHS determines Harvard's response to be inadequate and formally revokes its SEVP certification, or Harvard refuses to comply with DHS demands, triggering automatic withdrawal of certification

The question asks whether the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) will revoke or suspend the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) certification for any Ivy League university before September 1, 2025. Based on the current information, I'll analyze this situation carefully.

## Current Situation

As of May 12, 2025, DHS has explicitly threatened to revoke Harvard University's SEVP certification. The department demanded that Harvard provide "detailed records on Harvard's foreign student visa holders' illegal and violent activities" by the end of April 2025, or face immediate loss of its SEVP certification[3]. This ultimatum stemmed from allegations that Harvard has created a hostile environment for Jewish students and failed to address antisemitism on campus.

The April 30, 2025 deadline has now passed. According to the most recent information from May 1, 2025, Harvard has sent international students' information to DHS[5]. A Harvard administrator named Weenick stated, "Our participation in SEVP is unchanged at this time, and any withdrawal by DHS of Harvard's certification would be involuntary"[5]. This suggests that Harvard has attempted to comply with DHS demands, but the adequacy of their response remains in question.

## Key Considerations

### 1. Precedent and Political Context

This situation appears highly unusual. While DHS has revoked SEVP certifications in the past, these typically involved institutions that ceased operations or failed recertification processes for administrative reasons. The current threat against Harvard is politically charged, with DHS Secretary Kristi Noem claiming Harvard was "bending the knee to antisemitism" under "its spineless leadership"[3]. Former President Trump has also publicly criticized Harvard, calling it a "JOKE" that "teaches Hate and Stupidity"[3].

### 2. Legal Challenges

If DHS attempts to revoke Harvard's certification, the university would almost certainly mount immediate legal challenges. Several legal experts have reportedly advised Harvard to consider suing DHS over its demands[5]. Harvard has already filed a lawsuit against nine federal agencies over federal funding cuts, though DHS was not named as a defendant in that case[5]. Additionally, DHS is already "facing several lawsuits" over recent visa revocations for foreign students[3].

### 3. Impact Assessment

The stakes are extremely high. Harvard currently has 6,793 international students, representing 27.2% of its total enrollment[3]. Revoking Harvard's SEVP certification would cause significant disruption to these students' education and to Harvard's operations and reputation. It would also likely trigger diplomatic tensions with multiple countries whose citizens attend Harvard.

### 4. Compliance Status

While Harvard has submitted some information to DHS, it's unclear whether their submission fully satisfies DHS demands. The statement that "any withdrawal by DHS of Harvard's certification would be involuntary"[5] suggests Harvard believes it has complied sufficiently, but DHS may disagree.

## Status Quo Bias Analysis

Historically, federal agencies have rarely taken dramatic actions against prestigious universities like Harvard. The status quo strongly favors continued certification, as:

1. Revoking certification would face significant legal challenges
2. The diplomatic and economic fallout would be considerable
3. Such an action would be unprecedented against an Ivy League institution
4. There are many off-ramps and compromise solutions available

However, this situation is occurring in an unusually polarized political environment where traditional status quo assumptions may be less reliable.

## Probability Assessment

Given all these factors, I assess that there is a 25% probability that DHS will revoke or suspend SEVP certification for at least one Ivy League university before September 1, 2025.

This relatively low probability reflects:
- Harvard appears to have submitted information to DHS, potentially satisfying the immediate demands
- The substantial legal obstacles DHS would face in implementing a revocation
- The absence of precedent for such actions against elite universities
- The significant political, diplomatic, and economic costs of following through with the threat
- The likelihood that other avenues for resolving the dispute will be pursued

However, the 25% is higher than would typically be assigned to such a dramatic action because of the unusually confrontational political environment and explicit threats already issued by DHS.

Probability: 25%
