(a) **Time left until outcome known:**  
Roughly 2–3 months. The Supreme Court is expected to issue a decision by late June or early July 2025, with oral arguments scheduled for May 15, 2025[2].

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
The status quo is the continuation of birthright citizenship for nearly all children born in the United States, regardless of their parents’ immigration status. The Supreme Court has left in place nationwide injunctions blocking enforcement of the executive order, meaning automatic citizenship continues as before[2].

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
The Supreme Court either explicitly reaffirms the existing interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment—holding that all children born on U.S. soil, except those explicitly excluded (such as children of diplomats), receive citizenship—or otherwise upholds the status quo by declining to alter the broad birthright citizenship rule established by *United States v. Wong Kim Ark*[2][3]. This could include a narrow or procedural ruling that leaves current law intact.

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
The Supreme Court rules that the Fourteenth Amendment does *not* require birthright citizenship for at least some children born in the U.S. who currently qualify. Specifically, the Court would accept the executive branch’s interpretation that “subject to the jurisdiction thereof” allows Congress or the executive to exclude children of undocumented immigrants or certain non-citizens from automatic citizenship[2].

## Rationale

The principle of birthright citizenship is deeply embedded in U.S. constitutional law, notably through the Fourteenth Amendment and the Supreme Court’s 1898 decision in *United States v. Wong Kim Ark*, which has served as binding precedent for over 125 years[3]. That ruling held that virtually all persons born in the U.S., regardless of parents’ citizenship, are entitled to citizenship, with very narrow exceptions (e.g., children of foreign diplomats)[2][3].

All lower courts have thus far blocked the executive order, strongly signaling that under current law and precedent, such a restriction is unconstitutional[1][2]. The Supreme Court chose to leave those injunctions in place pending oral arguments, a step that usually indicates reluctance to upend established law quickly or a lack of urgency to reverse those lower-court holds[2].

While the current Supreme Court may contain justices open to revisiting precedent, overturning *Wong Kim Ark* or sharply restricting the Fourteenth Amendment’s guarantee would represent a dramatic and controversial shift. Historically, even justices favoring originalist or textualist readings (such as Justices Thomas or Alito) have not publicly supported a dramatic curtailment of birthright citizenship, and there has been no broad judicial movement in this direction[3].

Moreover, major changes to constitutional interpretation tend to come gradually, and the Supreme Court often gives substantial weight to longstanding precedent—especially one as fundamental and deeply woven into the fabric of American law as birthright citizenship[3].

Given the weight of history, precedent, and the Supreme Court’s recent procedural behavior, the most likely outcome is a reaffirmation of the status quo—birthright citizenship preserved for nearly all persons born in the U.S., regardless of parental status.
