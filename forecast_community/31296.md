(a) Time until outcome known: The outcome will be known after the end of FY 2025, which runs from October 1, 2024, to September 30, 2025. As of today (May 12, 2025), we have approximately 4.5 months of data from FY 2025, with about 4.5 months remaining.

(b) Status quo outcome: If current deportation rates continued without significant change, ICE would not reach twice the FY 2024 level (542,968 deportations) by the end of FY 2025.

(c) No outcome scenario: Despite increased enforcement rhetoric and higher arrest rates in early FY 2025, logistical constraints, legal challenges, and resource limitations prevent ICE from sustaining the dramatic acceleration needed to double deportations. The agency achieves a significant increase over FY 2024, perhaps 30-50% higher, but falls well short of the doubling threshold.

(d) Yes outcome scenario: The increased arrest rates (from 310 to 650 per day) reported in mid-March 2025 continue accelerating throughout the remainder of FY 2025. ICE successfully expands detention capacity, streamlines removal processes, and secures additional cooperation from receiving countries, enabling them to sustain the necessary pace to exceed 542,968 deportations by September 30, 2025.

Looking at the available data, I need to assess whether ICE deportations will reach at least twice the FY 2024 level in FY 2025.

ICE reported 271,484 deportations in FY 2024, representing a 10-year high that surpassed even the Trump-era peak from FY 2019[5]. To reach a "Yes" outcome, ICE would need to deport at least 542,968 individuals in FY 2025.

Recent data shows significant increases in enforcement activity. ICE arrest rates have approximately doubled since FY 2024, increasing from 310 to about 650 per day as of mid-March 2025[3]. This represents a substantial escalation in enforcement operations that could potentially translate to higher deportation numbers.

However, several factors suggest caution in projecting a doubling of deportations:

First, historical precedent indicates that even during administrations with strong deportation rhetoric, actual year-over-year doubling is rare. During the previous Trump administration, despite campaign promises of mass deportations, the total deportations over four years (1.5 million) were half those of Obama's first term and similar to Obama's second term and Biden's term[5].

Second, there are significant operational constraints to doubling deportations. While arrest rates have increased, the processing pipeline—including detention capacity, immigration court proceedings, and coordination with receiving countries—faces bottlenecks that limit how quickly deportations can be executed.

Third, the baseline of 271,484 deportations in FY 2024 is already historically high, making a doubling particularly challenging. This would require unprecedented operational capacity and efficiency.

On the other hand, there are factors supporting potential significant increases:

The Q3 FY 2024 data showed nearly 68,000 removals, reflecting a 69% increase over the same quarter in FY 2023[2]. This demonstrates ICE's recent capacity to substantially increase deportation rates.

ICE has reported success in streamlining deportation processes and securing increased cooperation from receiving countries, including nations that historically resisted accepting deportees[5].

Weighing these factors, while I expect deportations to increase significantly in FY 2025 compared to FY 2024, a complete doubling faces substantial operational and logistical hurdles. The data suggests an increase in the 30-70% range is more plausible than a 100% increase, particularly given the already elevated baseline from FY 2024.

Probability: 25%
