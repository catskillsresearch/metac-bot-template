## Rationale for a Breakthrough in Protein Structure Prediction Before 2031

The field of protein structure prediction has experienced transformative advances in recent years, primarily driven by AI and deep learning technologies. The most significant milestone came with DeepMind's AlphaFold, which achieved unprecedented accuracy in the CASP competition. This breakthrough, recognized by the 2024 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, has catalyzed further innovation and investment in the field.

### Recent Progress and Technological Trajectory

1. **AlphaFold and Successors**: AlphaFold2 and its successors have demonstrated near-experimental accuracy for many proteins, with median GDT-TS scores sometimes exceeding 90. This represents a fundamental shift from earlier physics-based models to deep learning approaches.

2. **Generative AI Models**: Beyond prediction, generative AI is revolutionizing protein design by addressing key challenges in sequence optimization and backbone generation. New tools like Evo 2 predict protein structures across all domains of life and accelerate genetic experimentation.

3. **Commercial and Scientific Motivation**: The protein engineering market is rapidly growing, projected to reach $10.4 billion by 2031 from $3.61 billion in 2024. This growth indicates substantial financial and scientific incentives for continued innovation.

### Specific Evidence for Breakthrough Potential

- **AlphaFoldâ€™s Performance**: AlphaFold has achieved median GDT-TS scores of 92.4 in recent competitions, suggesting that the 90 GDT-TS threshold is technically achievable.
- **Emergence of New Algorithms**: Recent algorithms have begun to address previously challenging protein classes, such as disordered proteins, with success matching or beating older methods.
- **Global Competition and Investment**: Major research groups and corporations view CASP as a focal point for innovation, ensuring continued rapid progress and resource allocation.

### Challenges and Limitations

- **Diminishing Returns**: As models approach higher accuracy levels, each incremental improvement becomes more difficult.
- **Challenging Protein Classes**: Proteins without homologous structures or highly disordered proteins remain difficult to predict.
- **Technical Barriers**: The lack of suitable training data for certain proteins and potential changes in CASP evaluation protocols could hinder progress.

Despite these challenges, the field's momentum, supported by continued investment and the emergence of new AI technologies, suggests that achieving a mean GDT-TS score of 90 or higher in a CASP competition before 2031 is highly plausible. The combination of technological advancements, commercial interest, and scientific recognition provides a strong foundation for further breakthroughs in protein structure prediction.
