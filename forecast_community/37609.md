Francis Suarez, the current Republican mayor of Miami, has openly flirted with the idea of running for Florida governor, frequently expressing interest over the past several years. As of early May 2025, his public statements reflect continued consideration but also clear and repeated hesitation. Suarez has directly acknowledged the difficulty posed by Donald Trump's endorsement of Byron Donalds, recognizing that such support creates a formidable barrier for any Republican challenger in the primary. This dynamic is supported by recent polling showing Donalds with a substantial lead among Republicans, while Suarez lags far behind.

Despite being term-limited as Miami mayor and in search of his next political opportunity, Suarez has not been observed taking concrete steps toward launching a gubernatorial campaign. There are no credible reports of him building campaign infrastructure, organizing staff, or ramping up fundraising operations—preliminary moves typically seen ahead of a major statewide announcement. Instead, his recent comments suggest he may be evaluating alternative political paths, stating there may be "other ways to serve" beyond the governor's race.

The political environment in Florida is rapidly solidifying, with several major candidates—most prominently Byron Donalds with Trump’s endorsement—already declaring their intentions. This makes a late entry into the race especially challenging for any candidate lacking established momentum. Typically, viable gubernatorial campaigns are announced well in advance to allow time for fundraising and statewide coalition-building. With less than a month until the July 1, 2025 deadline, time is running short for Suarez to mount a credible campaign.

While politicians sometimes make last-minute announcements, such moves usually require the presence of a clear catalyst or a disruptive political development, neither of which is currently apparent. Suarez’s history of public speculation without followed-through action on higher offices further suggests a cautious and deliberative approach rather than abrupt decision-making.

Taken together, the combination of Trump's influential endorsement for a primary rival, Suarez's low polling numbers, absence of campaign activity, and the lack of any urgent electoral deadlines diminishing the need for an early announcement, all point toward Suarez not launching a gubernatorial campaign before July 1, 2025. The default political inertia—where the status quo persists unless decisively disrupted—appears firmly in place for this race.
