Rationale:

The trend of vegetarianism in the United States has shown slow but steady growth over the past few decades, increasing from about 1% in the late 1970s to 4% in 2019. This represents an average growth of approximately 0.1 percentage points per year. If this trend were to continue without significant change, we would expect to see around 5.7% of U.S. adults self-reporting as vegetarian by 2036, falling short of the 8% threshold.

However, several factors could potentially accelerate this trend. Growing environmental concerns, particularly related to climate change and the impact of animal agriculture, may drive more people to adopt plant-based diets. Increasing awareness of animal welfare issues and personal health benefits associated with vegetarian diets could also contribute to faster adoption rates.

Technological advancements in plant-based food alternatives are making vegetarian options more appealing and accessible to the general public. Major food companies are investing heavily in developing and marketing these products, which could lead to wider acceptance and adoption of vegetarian diets.

Despite these potential accelerators, it's important to recognize that dietary habits tend to change slowly, especially on a population level. Cultural preferences for meat consumption are deeply ingrained in American society, and significant shifts usually occur over generations rather than decades. Economic factors also play a role, as meat-based diets often remain more affordable and accessible for many Americans.

The strict definition of vegetarianism used in this forecast ("never eat meat, fish, seafood, or poultry") sets a high bar for adoption. This excludes flexitarians or those who occasionally consume animal products, potentially limiting the growth rate of strict vegetarianism.

Government policies could play a significant role in shaping dietary trends. If policies are implemented to incentivize plant-based diets or discourage meat consumption, this could accelerate the shift towards vegetarianism. However, such policy changes are not guaranteed and would likely face resistance from various stakeholders.

While reaching 8% vegetarianism by 2036 would require a substantial acceleration from current trends, we cannot completely rule out this possibility. Unforeseen events such as major health studies, environmental crises, or breakthroughs in plant-based food technology could potentially drive a more rapid shift in dietary preferences.

In conclusion, while a significant increase in vegetarianism is possible, the weight of evidence suggests that reaching 8% by 2036 is less likely than not. The status quo of slow, steady growth remains the most probable outcome, but with some potential for acceleration due to the various factors discussed.
