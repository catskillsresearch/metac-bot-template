The global total fertility rate (TFR) is projected to continue its gradual decline over the next 21 years, influenced by factors such as increased access to education, economic development, urbanization, and access to contraception. Current trends and projections suggest that the TFR will decline to around 1.8 by 2050, with no credible models indicating a drop below 1.0 by 2046. Fertility rates in high-income countries are expected to remain low, while those in low-income regions, particularly sub-Saharan Africa, will decline more slowly, maintaining a moderating effect on the global average.

The status quo outcome, if nothing changes, is a "No" outcome, as the global TFR is unlikely to drop to 0.25 births per woman by 2046. Historical trends show a steady but gradual decline in fertility rates, and there is no evidence or credible forecast suggesting a drastic reduction to 0.25 within the given timeframe. While unforeseen events can occur, the world generally changes slowly, and the probability of such a drastic change in fertility rates is extremely low.

A scenario that could result in a "Yes" outcome would require an unprecedented global catastrophe, such as a widespread environmental disaster or a pandemic, severely impacting human reproductive capacity. This would necessitate a rapid and universal decline in fertility rates worldwide, driven by significant biological, environmental, and social disruptions. Hormone-disrupting chemicals or other environmental factors could also contribute to a severe decline in reproductive health, but such scenarios are currently not anticipated by any major forecasting models.

Overall, while there are concerns about environmental factors affecting fertility, the likelihood of these leading to a global TFR of 0.25 by 2046 is extremely low, given the absence of any credible mechanisms or forecasts indicating such a drastic decline.
