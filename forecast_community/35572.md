(a) **Time until outcome is known:**  
There are approximately 8 months remaining until the outcome is determined; the IBEX 35 will be evaluated on the final trading day of December 2025.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
The IBEX 35 closed February 2025 at 13,347.3 points, well above the threshold of 11,595.00. If the index remains near this level or higher, the outcome would be "Yes"—it would close 2025 above the threshold[5].

(c) **Brief scenario for a No outcome:**  
A "No" outcome (IBEX 35 closes at or below 11,595.00) would require a significant market drawdown—over a 13% decline from current levels. This could result from a combination of negative shocks such as a sharp economic slowdown in Spain or the eurozone, adverse geopolitical events, a banking crisis, or a reversal of central bank policy leading to higher interest rates, all of which could weigh heavily on Spanish equities[5].

(d) **Brief scenario for a Yes outcome:**  
A "Yes" outcome (above 11,595.00) would occur if the IBEX 35 maintains its current trajectory or experiences moderate gains or only small declines. Continuation of resilient economic growth in Spain (projected at 2.3% for 2025), ongoing strength in the banking sector (a major index component), and a stable or accommodative policy environment from the ECB would support this scenario[1][5].

## Rationale

The IBEX 35 has exhibited strong momentum: after an impressive 23% rise in 2023 and nearly 15% in 2024, it has continued to outperform major European peers into 2025. As of February, it sits roughly 15% above the critical threshold, reflecting robust performance especially from the banking sector, which has benefited from the ECB’s rate cuts and Spain’s relatively strong GDP growth[5].  

Most 2025 forecasts are positive:
- Analytical projections put the year-end value as high as 14,945.61[1].
- Even conservative outlooks do not foresee declines below current levels[4].
- Economic fundamentals remain favorable compared to broader Europe, though risks such as global trade tensions, sectoral weaknesses, and unexpected policy shifts persist[5].

Market declines of 13% or more from here are possible but statistically uncommon absent major negative catalysts. While caution is always warranted and shocks are possible, historical patterns and current indicators suggest the status quo (an outcome above 11,595.00) has elevated likelihood. Good forecasters assign extra weight to the status quo, especially when recent economic and market data show resilience.

**Probability: 85%**
