## Rationale for Forecasting Real World GDP at AGI Deployment

The timing of AGI deployment is highly uncertain, with leading surveys and expert panels suggesting a wide range of possible dates, commonly placing the median between the 2040s and 2060s. This leaves a window of several decades—potentially 15–35 years or even longer—during which numerous technological, social, and economic changes could unfold.

If global real GDP were to continue along its historical growth trajectory of approximately 2–3% annual real growth, starting from a 2019 baseline of $87 trillion, the world economy would experience steady expansion. By the time AGI is deployed, this would plausibly yield a global GDP in the range of $180–375 trillion (2020 dollars), depending on the exact timing of AGI arrival and the persistence of current trends. This scenario assumes that technological progress remains incremental, without any major accelerations or catastrophic setbacks.

Recent economic indicators reveal that some regions, such as India, are growing at rates above the global average, but aggregate world GDP growth remains close to its long-term trend. Until recently, there has been little sign in the global data of dramatic acceleration attributable to early AI or automation, suggesting that transformative economic effects may still be on the horizon.

However, many experts and economic theorists anticipate that the years or even decades preceding AGI may bring significant changes. As advanced AI systems become more capable, widespread automation and productivity enhancements could trigger a phase of accelerated economic growth. Pre-AGI technologies might cause growth rates to rise to 5–10% or more, particularly as automation begins to impact a broader range of industries and tasks. In scenarios where growth accelerates well before "true" AGI is achieved, world GDP at the point of AGI deployment could climb into the $300–400 trillion range—or, in extreme cases with compounding acceleration and prolonged takeoff, potentially much higher.

Historical and theoretical analyses, such as those by Nick Bostrom, further suggest that with the advent of digital labor and advanced AI, economic output could enter a regime of extremely rapid expansion, with GDP doubling much faster than ever before. While models forecasting annual doubling rates remain speculative, they highlight the possibility of outcomes far above standard projections, reaching into the high hundreds of trillions or even quadrillions if takeoff is sharp and sustained.

Nevertheless, the distribution of possible outcomes is wide due to profound uncertainties, particularly surrounding the timing and economic impact of AGI and the degree of pre-AGI acceleration. Severe negative shocks—such as major wars, pandemics, regulatory crackdowns on technology, or global economic collapse—could suppress growth, resulting in world GDP at AGI deployment being only modestly above current levels, perhaps in the $100–150 trillion range.

Conversely, if advanced AI drives a broad-based productivity revolution well in advance of AGI deployment, and if this acceleration persists or intensifies, the world could enter a phase where GDP growth sharply outpaces the historical norm, leading to real GDP at AGI deployment reaching several times the business-as-usual baseline.

In summary, the economic landscape at the time of AGI deployment is shaped by a complex interplay of historical growth patterns, regional disparities, potential for pre-AGI economic acceleration, theoretical possibilities of explosive growth, and risks of global setbacks. The plausible range for real world GDP is therefore broad, with most projections clustering between status-quo extrapolations and scenarios allowing for accelerating growth, all while acknowledging tail risks on both the downside and the upside.
