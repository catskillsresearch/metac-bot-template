For Q2 2025, the outlook for U.S. bank failures as measured by additions to the FDIC's Failed Bank List is shaped by the convergence of strong industry fundamentals, recent historical trends, and the ongoing presence of tail risks related to economic and sector-specific stresses.

The U.S. banking sector enters the final month of Q2 2025 in a position of relative resilience. As of May 30, 2025, only one bank has failed year-to-date—in Q1—while no failures have occurred in Q2 thus far. Over the prior two years, the sector saw 5 failures in 2023 and just 2 in 2024, a clear downtrend from periods of elevated stress and an indicator of sector stability. Recent FDIC data underscores this picture: the Q1 2025 banking profile reports robust profit growth, improved capital and liquidity positions, and positive asset quality metrics, with return on assets ticking up and domestic deposits increasing for several consecutive quarters.

Nevertheless, the risk landscape is not entirely benign. The FDIC’s Problem Bank List currently includes 63 institutions—elevated from the previous quarter but still within the normal historical range for non-crisis periods. These problem banks face financial or operational weaknesses and are under close regulatory scrutiny, representing a pool of potential, though not imminent, vulnerability. Commercial real estate exposures remain a sector to watch, with rising overdue loan rates signaling possible stress points, while the broader economy is contending with persistent inflation, elevated interest rates, and policy uncertainties that could introduce further volatility.

Absent new shocks, the most probable outcome is that no banks will be added to the Failed Bank List in Q2 2025. This expectation is anchored by the lack of failures to date in the quarter, the sector’s improved balance sheets, and the pattern of failures being well-telegraphed and infrequent during periods of relative economic stability. However, the elevated problem bank count means there remains a nonzero chance that a single troubled institution may experience a sudden deterioration—possibly triggered by a localized credit event, liquidity shortfall, or external shock—which could lead to an isolated failure before the quarter closes. Scenarios involving multiple failures, while not impossible, would require a rapid and widespread crystallization of risks or a significant systemic event, neither of which is signaled by current indicators or recent news.

In summary, the prevailing industry stability and absence of distress signals make zero Q2 failures the baseline scenario, but the presence of numerous problem banks and broader economic uncertainties warrant a modest allowance for an isolated failure, with a low but non-negligible tail risk of a small cluster in the event of a sudden downturn. Large-scale or systemic waves of failures remain extremely improbable in the present environment.
