The time frame for when the first AGI will be publicly known is uncertain, with expectations ranging from the next 12 months to several years. This uncertainty adds complexity to predicting market performance relative to AGI development. Historically, the status quo suggests that a publicly traded company developing the first AGI is unlikely to outperform the global equities market by at least 1.5x in the 12-to-2 months leading up to the AGI announcement. This is primarily due to the strong baseline performance of the global equities market, which could be driven by broad economic recovery, diversification into emerging markets, and stable macroeconomic conditions.

For a company to achieve such outperformance, specific conditions would need to be met. These include significant investor anticipation or leaks about the company's progress towards AGI, which could lead to substantial stock price increases. Such scenarios might be driven by strategic partnerships, technological breakthroughs, or other signals indicating imminent AGI development. Major tech companies with a history of innovation and market influence, such as Nvidia, Alphabet, or Microsoft, might have a better chance of achieving this due to their established presence in the AI space and capacity for strong stock performance.

However, if the development of AGI is kept under wraps until the public announcement, there may be limited investor anticipation or leaks to drive significant stock price increases beforehand. Additionally, if the company developing AGI is not one of the major tech players, it may lack the market influence needed to achieve the required outperformance. Given these factors, while the potential for a company to outperform the market exists, it remains a challenging prospect due to the high threshold set by the question and the strong performance of the global equities market.
