The United States has recently implemented a notable shift in immigration enforcement policy, most visibly with the Department of Homeland Security's introduction of a voluntary self-deportation program. Under this initiative, undocumented immigrants who opt to leave the country using the CBP Home app receive a $1,000 stipend and travel assistance, with payments issued only after their confirmed return abroad. This program, launched in May 2025, represents the first significant federal monetary incentive tied to deportation in recent years but is directed exclusively at individuals choosing to self-deport, not at third-party civilians providing information about others.

Despite the introduction of this self-deportation incentive, there is no federal or state program, as of late May 2025, that offers financial rewards to civilians for providing tips or information leading to the deportation of others. Existing mechanisms such as ICE tip lines and reporting systems continue to operate, but they do not include cash bonuses or bounties for informants. Historically, U.S. immigration enforcement has never extended financial rewards to third-party civilian tipsters; all related reward programs focus either on encouraging voluntary departures or on other areas of law enforcement (such as crime tips or tax evasion enforcement), rather than immigration-specific informant rewards.

There have been isolated legislative proposals, most notably in Missouri, which called for a $1,000 payment to civilians whose tips result in the arrest and potential deportation of undocumented immigrants. However, such proposals have not been enacted or implemented as active government programs. The Missouri plan, for example, sparked immediate controversy and debate over legal, ethical, and civil liberties concerns, stalling its progress in the state legislature and underscoring the substantial political and social hurdles such programs face.

The broader policy context is one of intense immigration enforcement under the Trump administration, including expanded use of local and state resources, increased funding for removals, and new efforts to encourage voluntary exits. However, even with this more aggressive posture, the administration has chosen to focus on incentives for self-removal rather than deputizing the public as paid informants. This distinction highlights the legal, ethical, and reputational risks associated with bounty-style civilian reward programs, which raise concerns about due process, privacy, discrimination, and the potential for abusive or false reporting.

Given the history of U.S. immigration enforcement, the current policy trajectory, and the significant barriers—both legal and societal—to instituting civilian tipster reward programs, the status quo strongly favors continuation of existing approaches. While political pressure and a highly enforcement-oriented climate might create conditions for policy innovation, the lack of precedent, slow legislative pace, and the distinct focus on voluntary self-deportation rather than public rewards for informants make it unlikely that a qualifying program will be established and activated before January 3, 2027. Nonetheless, developments at the state level and the possibility of executive action mean this scenario cannot be entirely ruled out, though major obstacles remain.
