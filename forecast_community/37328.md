(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  
There are approximately 52 days remaining until July 1, 2025, when the question will be resolved.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
As of May 9, 2025, credible media and official statements report that the death toll from overt military conflict between India and Pakistan since May 1, 2025, is at least 50, primarily due to Indian air strikes in Pakistan on May 7-8, 2025[5][1][4]. The most widely cited official Pakistani figures state 31 civilians killed and 57 injured in these strikes, with some reports of additional deaths from ongoing artillery exchanges[1][4][5]. No official or widely agreed count has yet reached 100 deaths since May 1, 2025, from overtly flagged military actions by the two states. If the pattern of sporadic cross-border fire and brief escalatory air strikes continues—without major further escalation—the most likely outcome is that the death toll may remain below 100 by July 1, 2025.

(c) **Scenario for a No outcome:**  
After the recent air strikes and artillery exchanges in early May, both sides, possibly influenced by international diplomatic interventions and mutual deterrence, refrain from further large-scale overt military action. Cross-border shelling and isolated incidents continue but with relatively low lethality, and cumulative deaths from military conflict (as defined by the resolution criteria) do not reach 100 by the end of June 2025.

(d) **Scenario for a Yes outcome:**  
Escalation continues or resumes: either side launches additional air or missile strikes, or artillery exchanges intensify across multiple sectors along the border or Line of Control. Given the geographic spread and capabilities of both militaries, one or more significant kinetic actions could quickly push the cumulative death toll over 100. This could include a single high-casualty event (such as a strike on a military post or civilian area) or a series of deadly skirmishes in the coming weeks.

## Rationale

- **Recent Death Toll:** As of May 9, 2025, the best-documented and broadly accepted death toll from military-on-military or military-on-civilian kinetic actions by flagged forces since May 1 is estimated at over 50 (with official Pakistani figures at 31 from Indian air strikes plus at least 5 from artillery, and Indian claims of further casualties)[5][1][4]. However, there is no single, widely recognized total yet at or above 100.
- **Historical Pattern:** Past India-Pakistan escalations have occasionally produced death tolls exceeding 100 in weeks, but also have sometimes plateaued below this threshold due to de-escalatory diplomatic moves and international pressure.
- **Current Trends:** The escalation over the past two weeks has been rapid and already deadly, but both sides have reasons to avoid further escalation—nuclear deterrence, economic pressures, and diplomatic interventions (notably from the US and China)[3]. There is evidence of international calls for restraint.
- **Information Uncertainty:** There are discrepancies in death toll reporting, with some sources citing 150+ casualties but official Pakistani sources downgrading these to 31 civilian deaths and 57 injuries; India claims 15 civilian deaths and 57 injuries from Pakistani shelling in Indian-administered Kashmir[4]. The Metaculus criteria stress the importance of claims from credible, independent sources.
- **Momentum:** The threshold of 100 deaths could be crossed with only one or two further significant skirmishes if escalation continues. However, if both countries pause further escalatory actions after the May 7-8 strikes, it is plausible the total will remain below 100.

## Final Probability

Given the current death toll just above 50 and the acute but potentially stabilizing situation—balancing the risks of renewed escalation with strong incentives for pause and de-escalation—the status quo slightly favors a "No" outcome. However, the high risk of sudden further escalation means the odds for "Yes" are significant and rising.

**Probability: 55%**
