## Integrated Rationale on Whether Automated Decipherment of Enciphered Historical Manuscripts Will Change History

Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning are transforming the landscape of historical manuscript analysis, particularly for deciphering enciphered, pre-20th-century documents. AI-driven methods, like convolutional neural networks and automated linguistic pattern recognition, have dramatically increased the speed and scale at which researchers can transcribe, analyze, and compare vast numbers of historical manuscripts. Unlike traditional manual methods, which were painstakingly slow and required deep expertise, these new tools can process complex scripts and ciphers in minutes, opening domains of research previously inaccessible to all but a handful of specialists.

The digitization of major archives—including projects at the Vatican Library, Händel-Haus Museum, and the Asiatic Society—has rapidly expanded the pool of accessible source material for automated analysis. Simultaneously, interdisciplinary collaborations between cryptographers, historians, and computer scientists are laying the groundwork for specialized tools tailored to the unique challenges of historical ciphers, which are often bespoke, poorly documented, and highly heterogeneous. Such collaborative projects are already yielding notable successes: AI has been used to virtually unseal and read historic letters, decipher erased fragments, and even "unroll" damaged ancient scrolls without risking physical deterioration.

However, several substantial barriers remain. The technical difficulty of deciphering unique or complex ciphers, the unpredictability of the content within these manuscripts, and the need for contextual historical interpretation mean that successful transcription or cryptanalysis does not guarantee historically significant revelations. Most manuscripts, even when automatically deciphered, may contain information that is routine or only marginally expands upon established narratives. The path from initial decipherment to historical revision is further complicated by the requirement for peer-reviewed scholarly validation and independent recognition by multiple credible media outlets, ensuring that only findings of genuine significance are acknowledged as "history-changing."

Despite these challenges, the sheer volume of undeciphered, encrypted manuscripts—many created for political, diplomatic, or sensitive reasons—suggests non-trivial potential for a discovery that could prompt a re-evaluation of a major historical event. As automated decipherment becomes faster and more accurate, and as more material becomes available, the statistical likelihood that at least one document will meet the high bar of significance grows over time. While historical paradigm shifts stemming from a single document are rare, and the process from discovery to acceptance in academia and the public sphere can be slow, the combination of technical momentum, digitization, and strong incentives for discovery increases the chance of such an event occurring in the coming decades.

Given the long time horizon for continued technical development and the accelerating rate of both digitization and AI sophistication, there is a real—though far from certain—possibility that automated decipherment of an enciphered manuscript will yield a peer-reviewed, media-recognized revision of historical understanding by 2055. The field is at a transformative juncture, with both its promise and its unpredictability underscored by recent achievements that, while not yet meeting the full criteria for "changing history," provide compelling proof-of-concept for what is possible.
